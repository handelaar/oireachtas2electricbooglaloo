      <P>I propose to take together the questions numbered 7, 8 and 9.  I am circulating with the Official Report a statement giving the names of the companies in which the Industrial Credit Company has a shareholding.  The companies for which issues were sponsored are specially indicated.</P>
      <P>According to the latest audited and published accounts, which relate to the year ended 31st October, 1940, the company's holdings of securities were valued at £618,220 4s. 10d.  The corresponding accounts for the year ended 31st October last have not yet been issued, but pursuant to statute will be laid in due course before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Investments are valued on the balance sheets at net cost (less reserves) or latest market quotations, whichever is the lower.  By inquiry from the company I have ascertained that the company's investments on the 31st October last were valued at £663,179 6s. 10d.</P>
      <P>It would not be in the public interest, or in that of the company or its clients, to disclose particulars of loans made by the company.  Similar considerations preclude, in general, the publication of specific information regarding the company's investments on the lines requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Oatmeal packed by millers or wholesalers in containers or packets containing by weight one stone or less and sold wholesale by such millers or wholesalers and intended for resale by retailers in such containers or packets was not included within the scope of the Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 96) Order, 1941, owing to the difficulty of fixing a uniform price for all millers and wholesalers due to the variety of packages used and the differences in costs and the fact that normally the sales of oatmeal in such packets represent a very small proportion of the total sales of oatmeal.  I am aware that there is a scarcity of oatmeal at present as oats are not yet coming on the market in adequate quantities.  The situation is being carefully watched, but I do not consider that the fixing of a maximum price for packeted meal would materially improve the situation.</P>

I put the position to the Minister for Agriculture in a private conversation I had with him last night and he told me that it was the Minister for Supplies who was responsible.

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, in order to allay public uneasiness in the matter, he will call for, from Irish Shipping, Limited, and present to the Dáil, a report as to the number of ships purchased by them, the full prices paid for each such ship, the agents by whom purchase was effected in each case, the date of first registering of each ship, the condition of each ship as shown by survey and report thereon, the number of trips made and amount of cargo carried by each since each was purchased by Irish Shipping, Limited, and the amount already spent for repairs on each or already estimated as the cost of necessary repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the existence of any public uneasiness on this matter, but I recognise that the attitude adopted by certain members of this House may tend to create uneasiness.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to call for a report of the kind suggested.  It has never been the practice to answer in the Dáil questions of detail regarding the administration of companies owned or controlled by the Government, and I see no sufficient reason for a departure from established practice in the case of Irish Shipping, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have on several occasions stated in this House that it is not now possible to purchase good ships or cheap ships, judged by normal peace-time standards.  The alternatives are to buy on the best possible terms such ships of suitable tonnage as may be offered from time to time, or to abandon any effort to import essential supplies to this country and to buy no vessels at all.  Faced with a choice between these alternatives, the Government decided without hesitation to take such <Col N="1204" /> steps as are possible with a view to providing for imports of essential supplies. It was always recognised that the effort would be a costly one and the Government take full responsibility for the policy involved.</P>
    <P>In view of the form in which this question is put I may remind the House, as a matter of interest, that on a previous occasion I mentioned that Irish Shipping, Limited had been offered a profit of £25,000 on one of the ships which it had purchased and which had been the subject of very critical comment in this House.  Since that date, I understand, the company has been offered for one of its ships double the price which it paid for it.</P>

I do not propose to state the name of the company to which I think the article refers.  I should say, however, that if I am correct as to the company concerned, the total assets far exceed the total issued capital, and a number of investigations carried out by my Department have shown that the prices of the commodities produced and the profits have been maintained at reasonable levels.  It is reasonable to assume that the information obtained by the writer of the article is also available to the Deputy, and I suggest that he should make his investigations through that source rather than through a question in the House.</P>

      <P>As supplies of tea to this country are at present allocated by the British Ministry of Food on the basis of the purchases of tea by Éire wholesale merchants in the year ended 30th June, 1939, it is necessary that the arrangements for distribution to retailers and for the rationing of consumers should be made to conform with those allocations.  It would not, therefore, be practicable to make the extensive adjustment in tea quotas for wholesalers as well as retailers which the adoption of the Deputy's suggestion would entail.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the present system of allocation, particularly in regard to sugar, is causing chaos in a great number of towns?  Is he also aware that business people usually do not purchase uniform quantities of tea or sugar each year? For example, my attention has been drawn to the case of a business man who laid in a big supply of tea and sugar early in 1938, with the result that he did not purchase very large supplies during the standard year.  The consequence is that his supplies have been very much reduced, and that he has had to turn away old customers who were on his books for years.  That seems to me to be a case which the Minister should consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he can state the reason for fixing the price of turf on the basis of weight, and if in view of the fact that the sale of turf by weight reacts against the proper drying out of turf he will take steps to promote the sale of turf by the cubic yard or other standard measure subject to its being graded as to quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have fully considered the basis on which the price of turf should be fixed and am satisfied that in the interests of the consumer the best method is by weight.  The views of the Deputy as to the merits of fixing the price by some other standard are open to argument, but in any event they involve the grading of turf for quality which could not be undertaken whilst there is the necessity of getting immediate supplies to the non-turf areas.  With regard to the suggestion that the sale of turf by weight reacts against the proper drying out of turf, Fuel Importers, Ltd., who are purchasing all the turf from the turf area for sale in the non-turf areas, are taking precautions to ensure that they will not take delivery of turf which is not up to a reasonable standard.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the practice of leaving the turf in the open when it arrives here in the city has the effect of increasing the weight of it because of the amount of moisture it absorbs?  The suggestion in the question is that turf should be sold not by weight but by the bushel or the box.  It should also be provided that the turf would not contain more than a certain percentage of moisture. In that way steps could be taken to ensure that the people in Dublin were getting dry turf, leaving out the question of quality altogether.</P>

I am not in a position to state whether the area covered by this lease includes the lands occupied by Stephen Considine.  The lease held by Judge Comyn runs for a period of 49 years from 28th September, 1935, and provides for payment by the lessee of a dead rent of £10 per annum, which merges in a royalty of 6d. per ton on all phosphate rock raised or gotten under authority of the lease.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.  Irish Shipping, Limited, undertakes certain war risks insurance of goods destined for this country for such time as they are lying at ports in Spain or Portugal and are not coverable by ordinary war risk insurance.  Since the risks are outside the range of ordinary insurance business the considerations relevant to the Marine Insurance Act, 1906, are not applicable.</P>
      <P>The effect of the order is to release the company from the obligation under the Marine Insurance Act, 1906, to refund insurance premiums wholly or partly in the event of the consideration for the premiums failing wholly or partly to materialise.</P>
      <P>I have no information as to whether cases have arisen where the consideration has failed to materialise.  This may happen in the event of the goods insured not arriving at the ports covered or in the event of their safe arrival and removal from the ports covered before the lapse of the period covered by ordinary war risk policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> The need for the order is based on the desire to ensure the continuance of importation of essential supplies for the community by the route concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean to imply that, if a trader effects this exceptional insurance policy for goods lying at Lisbon against the risk that will materialise if the ordinary war risk insurance policy lapses, then, if that risk does not materialise, the merchant will not get his premium back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely because of the circumstances in which the insurance has to be made that ordinary risk insurance associations will not cover the risk at all.  Because ordinary insurance firms would not cover the risk at all, Irish Shipping, Ltd., undertook it in order to make it possible to bring in goods, completely covered, by this route, but they recognised that the risk they were covering might materialise at any moment and involve a very substantial loss for Irish Shipping, Ltd., a loss that would only arise on one occasion. It is, consequently, necessary for Irish Shipping, Ltd., to build up a fund to cover that risk and they could not acquire that fund if they had to fulfil the condition of the Marine Insurance Act requiring repayment of the premiums, in whole or in part, if the consideration did not materialise.</P>

      <P>I have no evidence that there is any increase in the number of cases of stealing of hens and turkeys. I have not had time to make full inquiries in the matter, but such inquiries <Col N="1223" /> as I have had time to make indicate that there have been fewer cases this year than last year.  The attention of the Gárda Síochána is being directed to the matter, however. I think that the penalties for larceny of livestock (including poultry) provided by the Larceny Acts and the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1862, are quite sufficient, and I do not propose to introduce legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £10 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1942, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin (Uimh. 16 de 1924).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £10, be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    <P>This Estimate provides for the new Legation which it is proposed to establish at Lisbon.  The provision proposed is on almost exactly the same lines as that made in the case of our Legation in Switzerland.  I do not think the Estimate provides any special feature to which I need draw the attention of Deputies.  The present Vote is merely for a token amount because it will be possible to meet the cost of this Legation for the rest of the present financial year out of savings on the Principal Vote.  The provision for a full year would amount to about £2,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be general satisfaction that we are to have this direct contact with Portugal.  Portugal is a neighbouring country.  In certain respects, her geographical situation and her attitude in relation to the present conflict are similar to our own and, no doubt, the problems which confront the two countries, particularly at the present time, have also many points of resemblance.  We have all heard of the great advance which Portugal has made under the leadership of her present Premier, Dr. Salazar.  The progressive and Christian manner in which the Portuguese Government is handling its economic and other domestic problems has attracted attention and admiration throughout the world and not least, I think, in this country.  I think it right and proper that these two countries should have direct diplomatic relations and I have no doubt that the closer contact will prove useful and valuable to us.  At the present time there are special reasons why this should be so.  Lisbon is now a main junction on our communication with the outside world.  It is the terminus of the air service from Foynes, some of our boats are calling there fairly frequently and even at the present moment we have a number of our nationals stranded there awaiting the <Col N="1226" /> making of arrangements for their return to this country.  Lisbon is also important in connection with our supplies. Deputies are aware.  I think, that some of our cargoes from overseas are shipped to Portugal in the first instance and are then loaded into those of our ships which are not in a position to face Atlantic crossings.  All this makes it desirable and indeed necessary that we should have a representative in Portugal.  Especially under present conditions, travel and shipping depend to a great extent on consular services, and whenever there is a large body of Irish interests requiring such services as there are in Portugal at the moment, it is fitting that we should provide a representative of our own to whom our nationals can turn for protection and assistance when they require it.</P>
    <P>In these various ways, I am sure the new Legation in Portugal will amply justify itself and I, therefore, ask the House to vote this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the announcement of the establishment of diplomatic relations with Portugal will give satisfaction to every element of our society.  The Minister for External Affairs has referred to the bonds of sympathy which must naturally exist between our country and Portugal and the fact that these are being further strengthened by diplomatic relation is something which, I am sure, will be welcome to us all.</P>
      <P>There are a few details in connection with the proposed diplomatic exchange which I would like to have clarified. One is, who our representative is to be, and whether we may expect the Portuguese Government to honour us by sending a Portuguese Minister to this country, and, if so, when? Secondly, I would like to inquire whether it is intended to provide consular services at Lisbon?  I heard no mention made specifically in the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs of an Irish consulate in Lisbon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister no doubt will realise, with the passage of Irish trade through Lisbon at the present time there do <Col N="1227" /> arise peculiar problems, to which the Minister for Supplies made reference to-day at question time, such as the exceptional insurance of cargoes which had to lie at Lisbon for a period longer than that covered by the normal policy of marine insurance.  If we had effective consular representation in Lisbon, it occurs to me that some more economical method of insuring those cargoes might be operated by our consular service, just as in America our consular service has been used to assist heirs and beneficiaries under wills to recover what they are entitled to, without the ordinary expensive process of law.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to subscribe very cordially to the words of praise uttered by the Minister for External Affairs in relation to the Christian economic policies of Dr. Salazar and to inquire if the Minister will familiarise himself with those policies which he has so highly praised, and in which I am so happy to second him, because I think he will find that the foundation stone upon which they are built is the profound conviction frequently enunciated by Dr. Salazar that economic self-sufficiency is inconsistent with Christian economics or with the intelligent progress of any sane country in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister for External Affairs will tell us, in connection with the establishment of this office in Portugal, how many Irish citizens are in Portugal at the present time, and if he has any information as to the volume of our trade passing through Portugal&mdash;that is, the volume of trade between this country and Portugal in ordinary times and the volume which is now routed via Portugal.  Perhaps he can tell us what steps are being taken to assist Irish citizens who may be stranded in Lisbon and whether any efforts have been made to ensure for them transport by ships from Portugal to wherever they want to go, or transport by air services from Lisbon.  I understand that a number of Irish citizens stranded in Lisbon find it almost impossible to get shipping space or seats in aircraft leaving Lisbon and that they are pretty helpless there.</P>
      <P>If the Minister feels like following the advice of Deputy Dillon and looks into the economic policies of Dr. Salazar in Portugal, I suggest that he might pursue his studies a little further and examine the beneficial activities of the New Zealand Government, under whose policy agricultural workers are receiving £3 12s. 6d. a week and old age pensioners get 30/- a week at the age of 60 years.</P>

I quite realise that circumstances may be too strong for him and that until all the goods are cleared from there consular representation will be necessary.  I should like to know whether the Taoiseach or the Minister for Supplies is responsible for the present system in the United States by which goods have to be paid for when they are merely brought alongside the wharf.

      <P>I see in this Vote an item for a shorthand-typist.  The explanation is that this is only for portion of the year.  I take it that that would be for an Irish national and that there would be nothing to debar Irish nationals abroad from wishing to transfer to the service at home.  Now, I should like to bring under the Minister's notice a practice that, apparently, has grown up and that, I think, ought not to be continued, namely, discouraging people who are in offices in other countries from seeking a transfer to the home country.  I suppose that most Irish citizens have an affection for their own country and probably would be prepared to take even lower <Col N="1230" /> wages than they can get abroad if they had a chance of getting home.  As an illustration of what I mean I should like to bring under the Minister's notice that in September last there was a confined competitive examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's contention is irrelevant.  We have no shorthand-typist in Lisbon yet, hence he cannot advocate the hypothetical transfer of a typist from Lisbon to this country, nor go further afield, and advocate transfers from other countries. The question of staff conditions comes under the Department of Finance.  The Deputy may not survey the diplomatic service from the U.S.A. to New Zealand on a Vote of £10 for Lisbon.</P>

I want to ask what conditions are governing that post, and I should like to suggest that the conditions governing other posts ought not to apply.  I am giving an illustration of what happened in one instance, and what I want to get from the Minister is an assurance that, at any rate, it will not happen in Portugal.

      <P>Very well.  I had mentioned that there was a confined competitive examination in September. Some people in another country&mdash;not typists, I may say&mdash;thought that they might compete for that examination. They were then asked to say what were their qualifications in Irish.  They replied that they would be quite happy to furnish their qualifications in Irish if other competitors were asked similar questions.  They were then told that that would not be pressed, and that item was withdrawn.  Now, I leave it to the Minister's own imagination whether the fact of putting that forward and then withdrawing it does not look like a rod which was kept in pickle for one person and not for another.  The next item that I wish to bring up in connection with this is that the next request these people had was for a record of their late attendances. I do not like to mention the place, but <Col N="1232" /> it was a city where very extensive bombing has taken place over the last two years.</P>

With great respect, if I bring that up before the Minister for Finance he will tell <Col N="1234" /> me that of course he has to settle the regulations governing the appointments, salaries, etc., but that the permission to be given and the circumstances attending that person's conduct in the office of the Minister for External Affairs are matters for the Minister for External Affairs.</P>

      <P>The matter agitating the Chair is this: The Committee is discussing the possibility of appointing a staff in Lisbon.  Apparently the Deputy has got some cases of civil servants in the Department of External Affairs and is dissatisfied with the conditions.  He wants to avail himself of this opportunity to raise those matters without giving previous notice to a Minister.</P>

      <P>With great respect, there is only one instance, and it is governing the conditions of one examination for which a number of people wished to sit.  I have raised the point that before they could leave that office they had to get permission, and I should like to suggest that most unworthy hurdles were put in front of them before they were allowed to sit for the examination.  What I am suggesting is that that should not occur in Lisbon, and I also suggest to the Minister, if he can see his way, that he should investigate a flagrant injustice such as that, and that he might very well say: &ldquo;Well, it will cease in other places as well as Lisbon.&rdquo;</P>

In that regard we have not a Consul in Portugal, but the Chargé d'Affaires will perform certain consular functions.  I have been asked by Deputy Norton about some of the people who had been stranded in Portugal, and what steps have been taken with regard to them.  I think about 20 or 25 who were in Lisbon have been brought home, and, as far as we know, about 20 remain.  Certain help has been given to them.  For that, we have to thank the British, whose good offices were availed of there.  Of <Col N="1236" /> course, we ultimately ourselves pay the expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>That is such an obvious thing to have tried that I feel pretty certain it has been examined, but there may be some difficulties.  The present situation may be such that there would have to be particular care with regard to taking passengers in some of the ships.  If it has not been examined&mdash;I feel certain it has been&mdash; I will have the matter looked into.  I was asked a question as to the amount of our trade with Portugal.  I have been informed&mdash;I do not like giving this without those who supplied the figures having an opportunity of examining it more fully&mdash;that about £100,000 a year is the amount of our normal imports from Portugal, and I do not think they take very much from us in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point which Deputy Dockrell has been raising, I do not know the case to which he is referring, but, if he will be good enough to give me particulars, I will have the matter examined to see exactly what is at the bottom of it.  I think that would be the simplest way of dealing with it.  Other questions were raised, and if there is any desire for definite information with regard to particular cases&mdash;it is obvious that I could not give it here without notice; I would have to have them examined&mdash;I will try to give the information that is required to the fullest extent possible.

    <P>A sanitary authority to whom an interference notice relating to any proposal has been given by a navigation authority shall consider the objections of such navigation authority to such proposal and shall negotiate with such navigation authority for the withdrawal of the interference notice.</P>
    <P>The navigation authority will tell the sanitary authority its reasons for thinking that the proposals would affect navigation.  The sanitary authority must consider the objections of the navigation authority and negotiate with the navigation authority.

      <P>Quite.  The intention is to put a statutory obligation on the sanitary authority at least to establish contact with the navigation authority. The anticipation is that when the parties get round the table to discuss the matter, they will probably adjust their difficulties without having to resort to litigation.  Should they not resolve their differences the sanitary authority will presumably bring the navigation authority to court to have the interference notice annulled.  There <Col N="1240" /> is probably not a lot in the amendment, but I have put it forward following discussions with a navigation authority. They seemed to base a good deal of hope as to the outcome if we provide them with an opportunity of getting into actual contact with the sanitary authority, if difficulties should arise.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 106) Order, 1941, dated 1st November, 1941, should be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the motion is to have annulled the order which was made on the 1st November fixing for certain areas the maximum price for turf at 64/- per ton.  The area which the order affects comprises the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork and Waterford, the administrative counties of Dublin, Kilkenny, Louth, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow, and portion of County Cork. I have already put some questions to the Minister asking him to justify the fixing of a price of 64/- per ton for turf and the House has heard the answer which the Minister has given.  I suggest that the fixing of the price of turf at that figure is simply making turf consumers in those cities and counties pay for the lack of vision and lack of competence of the Government in dealing with the fuel situation on the one hand and their complete incompetence now to examine the situation as it is, see what the costings in the production and distribution of turf are and face the fixing of a reasonable price.  The <Col N="1241" /> Minister indicated in his reply the other day that a price of 64/- had been fixed because it was the maximum price which the consumer in the present circumstances could be asked to pay.  The fact is that in some of those areas where the price has now been raised to 64/- it was possible, before the order was issued, for the people to get turf at a much more reasonable price.  The people in the City of Cork, and in a large part of the County of Cork, for instance, are having their turf prices increased as a result of this order.  They were previously able to buy turf at a much lower price.  In the City of Cork it was possible for the corporation to get a quantity of turf from the county council for which they paid 33/- per ton delivered in Cork City.  It was possible for the committee of management of the Cork Mental Hospital to buy turf loaded at the bog for 22/- per ton, and at a cost of 10/- per ton to get it delivered at the mental hospital, or a total of 33/3. It was possible for the Cork City Vocational Education Committee to get turf from the county council and to have it delivered to the committee's order in Cork City at 35/3 per ton.  All that turf came a distance of 20 miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the South Cork Board of Assistance, they got turf delivered at 33/6 in Bandon, 38/6 in Kinsale, 31/- in Macroom, and 33/9 somewhere else.  The North Cork Board of Assistance were able to get turf at 36/- per ton.  There is another part of South Cork where the turf purchased at the bog was 22/- and they got it delivered to their institutions for 32/-.  In County Wicklow they were able to get turf delivered at Rathdrum for 46/10; at Baltinglass for 46/8, and at Wicklow for 52/6.  In Louth they were able to get turf delivered at Ardee for 48/- and for 55/- they were able to get turf from Kinnegad to Drogheda.  I just quote these as figures that are available.  It is on these areas that the Minister is imposing the implications and the results of his 64/- per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> The Minister has indicated that he has got a considerable amount of representative information collected by Fuel Importers (Éire), Ltd., for turf delivered to various centres throughout the non-turf areas.  He says that they put that information together and presented him with certain results.  I should like to compare the results that they have presented to him with the position that existed before and to see where exactly the changes have taken place.  I also suggest to the Minister that, if this House is to be treated in an intelligent way so that we can discuss these things intelligently, some of these figures he has given will have to be taken and analysed a little more. He indicated to us yesterday that his price of 64/- was built up in this way: that the average free on rail cost of turf at loading point or ex bog was 24/3 per ton; that freight was 18/6; that handling charges&mdash;and he did not indicate exactly what handling charges covered&mdash;were 8/9, and that the total cost was therefore 51/6.  Then, when shrinkage, overhead expenses, and all that were taken into consideration he indicated that Fuel Importers (Éire), Ltd., were almost losing money on selling turf at 64/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to complete the picture for us and tell us what they are losing&mdash;let us have the full picture.  The cost of turf in the County Dublin at the present time for the county council institutions, as produced by county council workers, is estimated at 60/- per ton.  It is pointed out, and it can be seen, that that turf was produced from absolutely undeveloped bogs by absolutely inexperienced workmen.  The Minister will find out that, even in those bogs and with the workmen that were employed this year, they expect to produce turf next year at a lower rate.  We are now asked to pay an absurdly inflated price for turf which is intended to cover incompetent work carried out in an emergency which, unless the people of the country and their representatives <Col N="1243" /> have become completely irresponsible, cannot possibly occur again.  I want to point out that the first and most urgent thing that requires to be done is that the price of turf should be reduced and, if there is a loss in the producing and distribution campaign this year, that loss should be treated in a special way by the Government; that the cost of it should be treated as an emergency cost and, if necessary, spread over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Let us take the figure which the Minister quotes of 24/3 per ton on rail at loading point or ex-bog.  In 1934 various figures were quoted as to what it was reasonable to pay producers for turf produced and delivered at the bog. The theory then on the Government Benches was that 10/- or 10/6 was an adequate figure.  In fact the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a statement published in the Press on 5th July, 1933, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The price to be paid to the producer for standard quality peat has been fixed at 11/6 per ton, which price includes placing the turf in sacks and on rail trucks or canal barges.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The price that the Minister is taking credit for in building up his 64/- is 24/3.  Therefore, the 11/6 has gone up to 24/3 between the bog and where it is put on the rail or on the road at the bogside.  When, in present circumstances, people in the City of Dublin, in the City of Cork, and in the counties that are referred to are asked in an emergency to pay 64/- per ton, as made out in the Minister's office from information and reasons which he has not given to the House, I suggest that the House is entitled to know how it is that in 1941 we have to take the cost of turf at the loading point on rail or ex-bog as having increased by 12/9, namely, from 11/6 to 24/3.  That is one thing we want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that particular time the railway company fixed the standard charge for the carriage of turf at 6/- per ton. When that matter came before the <Col N="1244" /> tribunal that approves railway rates or fixes railway rates to be continued, the local representative of the railway company indicated that they might change that 6/- and might zone the country and give a turf rate of 4/-. I asked the Minister the other day what became of that proposal and the Minister indicated that when the 6/- was changed it was changed to rates varying from 4/- to 8/6.  The Minister gave us the other day what was the cost of the freight on which he was basing his price of 64/-.  He bases it at 18/6.  We want to know how that 18/6 is built up.  That involves an understanding of where the turf is coming from and in what manner it is coming.  When the Minister discusses the question of handling charges here or includes handling charges as an item in his costs, he puts it at 8/9. When, some time early in 1934&mdash; January or February, I have not got the date here&mdash;he replied to a question of mine arising out of the dissatisfaction on the part of the Board of Public Assistance in Dublin at the price they were charged for turf, he gave some particulars of the cost of turf from Turraun.  He said that the cost of turf ex-works was 15/-; that sacks and covering charges cost 8d. and 6d. respectively; cartage, 8/6, and unloading charge, 2/-.  I do not know what the unloading charge there refers to but the total came to 26/8 and he allowed 11/8 there for the handling of the material here in the City of Dublin and its distribution.  An unloading charge, as far as I can read the figures, of 2/- and a figure to cover costs, profits, overhead charges and everything like that of 11/8 gave us a sum of 13/8.  Here the Minister leaves a margin of 12/6 after taking into account handling charges of 8/9, which would amount to 21/3.  We are entitled to know where the difference between 13/8 for unloading charges, handling and distribution in the City of Dublin in 1934, and 21/3 for handling charges and additional costs has gone.  The whole case has been presented by the Minister in such a way as to make the situation more confused and to prevent people from having any understanding in detail of <Col N="1245" /> how these figures have been arrived at. That is why I say these figures have been arrived at simply to cover the futility and incompetence of the whole turf provision in these areas.</P>
    <P>We have next to consider what turf is costing in the turf areas.  The local hospital in Belmullet has been provided with turf at a cost of 14/6 a ton; in Ballina, at 22/6; in Castlebar, at 22/6; in Swinford, at 22/6.  The local institutions in Longford have been provided with turf at 25/-, after being carted 12 miles; at Ballymahon, at 25/-; in Cavan, after being transported from 30 miles in some cases to eight miles in another, they are getting turf at 42/6.  A discussion took place the other day in Kildare as to what is the cost of the turf produced by the Kildare County Council.  A figure of 35/- was given.  That was controverted. Some people thought 35/- was high, and others argued that the turf produced in Kildare by the County Council could not be sold there at 45/-, because the cost of producing the turf in Kildare bog was 33/-.  We want to know if it is costing 33/- to produce a ton of turf in Kildare bogs when 11/6 was considered to be a generous price when the turf scheme was originally embarked on in 1933 and 1934.  In North Tipperary they are drawing turf from a distance of 15 to 20 miles from bogs, and they expect the price to be 45/-.  They say it may be less, or a little more.  In South Tipperary they are getting turf in three of the main institutions&mdash;Clonmel, Tipperary, and in Cashel, I think&mdash;at 45/-.  Limerick City is getting turf from Newcastlewest for 42/6, and is getting turf from Clare at 40/-.  The Kerry Board of Health have contracted to get turf for their institutions at rates slightly varying in different parts of the country&mdash;22/9, 25/-, 23/-, 27/-, 32/6.  They do not know yet in Kerry what the effect of the Minister's order is likely to be.  They have already had demands from the turf producers there for increased prices.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the price is an exorbitant and an extraordinary one, and that he has been utterly unfair to this House in the way in <Col N="1246" /> which the House has been treated.  The House is unable to examine whether the people are being fairly treated or not.  When one considers the condition of the people, to charge them 64/- a ton for turf, which is the equivalent of £6 8s. 0d. a ton for coal, is a heartless and a dangerous attitude for the Minister to adopt.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his reply yesterday that there was a shrinkage of 20 per cent. to be taken into account. I wanted to find out where that shrinkage took place, and I understood the Minister to say that it took place from the time the producers handed over responsibility for the turf until the time it left the hands of fuel importers. Has the Minister carried out or caused to be carried out any examination of the condition of the turf when delivered to householders in the City of Dublin? What machinery has there been for estimating the fall of 20 per cent. in the weight of the turf, due to shrinkage or evaporation?  What shrinkage does the Minister expect to take place in some of the turf that has been delivered in the City of Dublin by the time it is fit to put on a fire?  I have had complaints brought to me by people who have had to return turf.  I know people who have been advised, where they had the goodwill of the coal suppliers, not to take or touch the turf.  I have been invited to visit the out-houses of people who bought turf, and who feel that they are not important enough to return it and get any satisfaction.  I ask Deputies from Kilkenny, Louth, Waterford, Wexford, Cork and Dublin, from what they know of the price at which they or their people have been able to get turf, why it should be raised in these counties to 64/-.  I ask them also to say what they think of the quality of turf being provided for them under this scheme, and for which they are asked to pay this price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support all the arguments of Deputy Mulcahy, and I ask the Minister to see that the order is withdrawn and proper prices fixed&mdash; prices which our people can pay&mdash;for turf.  The price at present is 64/- a ton, and for bad turf at that.  Some of it <Col N="1247" /> was described in our newspapers within the last 24 hours as sods of grass and clay, and I have seen turf which, if it were properly dried, would be just good horse-bedding.  It is soft and broken, and has to be swept up and carted in in boxes in certain parts of the city, and the people are asked to pay 64/- when we know that there are contractors who, if they could get licences, are prepared to deliver turf in the City of Dublin at £2 10s. 0d. per ton.  In these circumstances, the charge of 64/- per ton requires some explanation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to go into a little more detail and to give us an explanation as to how the charges are made up and why a price of 64/- is charged. If it was turf that would burn, if it was turf that was dry, there might be something to be said, but our people in the tenement quarters and in the cottages in the City of Dublin are asked to burn wet turf.  The turf to-day, I believe, is 20 per cent. water. The timber blocks which are available are cut too big.  In addition, they are damp and these tenement dwellers who have to depend on them are not able to make fires.  I was in an office this morning when an effort was made to kindle a fire.  One of these cut blocks was put on and the fire went out within five minutes.  This is the kind of stuff our tenement and cottage dwellers and working-class people generally have to depend on.  If, as I say, it was good quality turf, there might be something to be said for some of these charges, but the people under present circumstances are bearing very great hardships. The Minister knows York Street.  I passed through there this morning and I saw children trying to break some of these hard wood blocks with little hatchets, and even with table knives, in order to make a fire. The Minister ought to be able to tell us something about the coal position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether it is absolutely necessary that this charge of 64/- per ton should be imposed by Fuel Importers, Limited. I quite appreciate the difficulty in which the Minister has been placed, as well as the difficulties that surround this whole question of turf production. We more or less asked the Government to take up this question of turf production and to develop it to the utmost. The position was somewhat difficult and rather new to the Government, and there may or may not have been mistakes made, but I think we have arrived at the time when a thorough examination of the position in relation to turf production should be made, and if it were at all possible, with the cooperation of all Parties, for the Minister to enable the people to get turf at a lesser price than that charged at present, it would be good for all concerned.</P>
      <P>I know perfectly well that it is very difficult to have a uniform price for turf because the conditions under which turf is produced differ in different areas.  I am also aware of the fact that the distance over which turf has to be transported adds very substantially to the cost of that turf when it reaches the grates of the poor and, for that matter, of the rich.  Take the position in County Louth.  It is not by any means a turf-producing county, and the turf that has been coming there during the past few months, comes, I understand, from Donegal.  It is a long journey from Dundalk to the nearest parts of Donegal and the transport charges are bound to be heavy.  I know, also, that the handling charges, that is, the charges incurred when the turf comes to the quayside and is handled by the local merchants, acting in conjunction with the committee in Dublin, are fairly heavy.  The cost of discharging the wagons, I know, is fairly high.  The coal importers&mdash;this will be of interest to Deputy Hickey&mdash;have to pay trade union wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, the cost per ton is high, and I often asked myself what the poor fellow in the bog gets for drawing up a ton of turf in comparison with what the man who takes it out of the wagon gets.  The conditions in the one case are very different from those in the other.  However, jolly good luck to them, but it did occur to me that by the time the turf reaches the grates of the poor, it will be very costly and we cannot put all the blame for that on the Minister or his Department.  There are factors over which he has no control.  At the same time, even taking into consideration all these charges, the fact remains that 64/- per ton is rather a high price to pay for turf, especially when we consider that, in comparison with coal, so far as fuel content is concerned, that price would represent between £7 and £8 a ton.  Two and a half tons of turf are of the same value as a ton of coal, and the turf would need to be fairly good to equal a ton of coal.  I would not be far astray in saying that it would take three tons of some of the turf I have seen to equal a ton of coal, which would represent a price of £9 12s. per ton which a man would have to pay before he had the same fuel value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are difficult matters to deal with, and if anything we say here is of assistance to the Minister in having the cost reduced, it would be a good thing, because undoubtedly it is a great hardship on the poorer section who cannot afford to buy turf in large quantities.  They have to get it by the cwt., and, on that matter again, I have my own opinion.  It is questionable whether they get the full weight or not because the quality of the turf must be taken into account.  Sometimes a great deal of this turf is sold on the basis of filling a bag from a cart. When the bag is full, I suppose it represents a cwt. of turf.  There may be more or there may be less, but the poor have no way of getting in any quantity of turf and that is the way they must buy it.  It works out about 3/3 or 3/6 per cwt.  The main point about this motion is: if this order were revoked, would the price of turf be less than it is?  That is what we have to consider. If the Minister saw fit to revoke <Col N="1250" /> the order fixing 64/- as the price of a ton of turf delivered, would the people get turf at a lower price?  My own opinion is that, possibly, they would in a great many cases.  It could also be argued that, possibly, they would be charged more than 64/-.  I know, for example, that people could bring in an ordinary cart-load of turf to a town and get as much as 35/- or £2 for it.  I do not think I would be far out if I said that if it was weighed there would not be more than 7 cwt. of turf in it, so that three loads of that kind would be nearer to £6 per ton than 64/-.  That is another side of the question.  It is one of the things that could happen, and it is a matter that would require very careful consideration. My own opinion is that if, over a wide stretch of the country, the people were left to their own resources they could get turf much cheaper than the price that is being charged to-day. But, there, again, we are up against the fact that the Government have been called upon to have supplies of turf available that will be sufficient to meet the needs of the people.  I know that the Department are getting up stocks of turf in Dundalk, and to a greater or lesser extent, in Drogheda.  The handling charges in connection with that will be heavy, taking it from the wagons and putting it into the storage place selected.  Men have to be employed to build up the turf in accordance with the regulations laid down, so that it will be able to withstand the rigours of the weather.  All that is going to mean additional charges.  It is a very difficult problem to deal with. The point that should get serious consideration is to ascertain whether the price of 64/- per ton could not be reduced. When we take into consideration the price charged for the turf on the bog, and the charges for handling and transportation, there still seems to be too big a margin between the sum total of these charges and the actual price charged by those who are being entrusted with the delivery of turf to the people in our cities and chief towns.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that, in speaking on this motion, he should give the House all <Col N="1251" /> the information he possibly can, and that, no matter what action the House may take on the motion, he will give careful and sympathetic consideration to the price that is being charged for turf.</P>

      <P>I want the House to understand that if Deputy Mulcahy's motion is passed the effect of it will be to repeal the order which at present fixes the maximum retail price for turf, with the immediate result that the retail price of turf will go up. We can, of course, make orders fixing a lower price.  We can decide that everybody concerned with the production, transportation and distribution of turf shall do so at a substantial loss. We can decide upon subsidies if we like, but I think the House must keep clearly in mind that if we made enough orders to plaster all the walls of Dublin we would not thereby bring down the cost of turf.  We can bring down the price by subsidies.  We can bring down the price by carrying the charges forward to another period, but the cost of the turf remains the same all the time.  The cost of the turf is easily determined.  The various factors that make up the cost can be brought out and inspected.  I am going to give the House all the available information. There is some information that I cannot give because it is not available. Deputy Mulcahy said that, in fixing the price of 64/- per ton for turf delivered in Dublin, we were making the consumers pay for the incompetence of the Government.  Now, everybody in this life who gets a job to do has got to put up with all the criticism of the spectator who will say that he could do that job much better, knowing, of <Col N="1252" /> course, that he will never be put to the test.</P>
      <P>I do not know that the Government has any apology to make for the manner in which it has handled this fuel situation.  Early this year it became clear that, before the year ended, we were likely to be facing a fuel famine, but I am quite prepared to admit that the Government did not expect that that situation would arise during the war.  It is true that before the war, and in the early stages of the war, we had to contemplate the possibility of supplies from Great Britain being cut off for a period, due to the invasion of that country, or the attempted invasion of that country, or to other belligerent action which would temporarily interrupt exports. We considered that it would be a reasonable precaution to take against such eventualities to build up here a store sufficient to keep us going for two or three months, expecting that in such a period conditions would be restored which would enable the normal flow of imports to be resumed again.  In the year before the war, by arrangements made through the Department of Industry and Commerce, the quantity of coal imported into the country was increased above the normal by about 250,000 tons, and in the early stages of the war the Government, through an organisation which it set up for the purpose, created an emergency reserve of coal which is still there, a reserve which was intended to meet the circumstances of a possible attempt to invade Great Britain which might interrupt normal supplies here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not anticipate that our supplies of coal would be curtailed for another reason altogether: a decline in production in Great Britain.  Great Britain was a great coal-producing country.  It produced coal not merely in quantities sufficient to supply its own requirements but also to carry on a vast export trade with most of the countries in Europe.  The development of the war cut off its export markets, and that development would appear to suggest that there would still be more coal available for the few markets that were left, of which we were one, but, for reasons which <Col N="1253" /> I cannot discuss, the production of coal in Great Britain declined.  No doubt, Deputies will have read the debates in the British House of Commons on that matter and the various explanations given by the British Government for the decline of production and are aware of the efforts the British Government are making to bring up production again. Whatever the reason for the situation may have been, we had to face the fact that, over a period, the production of coal in Great Britain fell below the point at which it was sufficient to supply the requirements of Great Britain.  Consequently, we had to expect reduced supplies and, in fact, since then, we have got only a very small proportion of our normal requirements and that in a very inferior form of coal, indeed.</P>
    <P>When that situation developed, the Government, early this year, set out forthwith, with very small preparation and very little equipment, to secure the production within the country of a vast quantity of turf&mdash; sufficient, if possible, to replace the coal which, we knew, was not going to come.  The Government organised for that purpose the machinery of the county councils, brought into the service of turf-production the county surveyors and their staffs, organised by various means the production of turf upon bogs that were not properly prepared, with limited equipment, using staff that had no experience and men who had never seen a bog before.  The Government succeeded in getting a good deal of enthusiasm aroused and, instead of having the carping criticism of individuals who know nothing of what has been done, we should get from those who do know some appreciation of the immense achievement that is to be put to the credit of the surveyors' staffs, the county councils and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and those under him who organised that great effort.  That effort has put us in the position to-day that, over by far the greater part of this country, there is no scarcity of fuel. Over the whole of what is now called the turf area, there is an abundance of fuel&mdash;such an abundance that it is not <Col N="1254" /> even necessary to ration it.  Within that area, it is possible for the Government to make an order prohibiting the sale of coal except for specific industrial purposes and thus concentrate in the rest of the country, which is not supplied with sufficient turf within its own borders to meet its requirements, whatever coal may be available, although we know that that coal will have to be supplemented, and is being supplemented, by a surplus of turf taken out of the turf-producing counties.  That was all done without organisation and without preparation by men who never thought they would have to face the job, men who had to learn to do the job as they were doing it.  Although it is quite true that, here and there, experience showed that better methods were possible, that other plans could have been devised if there had been time, nevertheless the result is noteworthy and I think praiseworthy from those whose concern it is to give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>We had to produce the turf where the bogs were.  We could not shift the bogs and these bogs were not always convenient to roads, railways or canals. We had to produce the turf not merely where the bogs were but where there were bogs and people in conjunction. Over a great part of the country where there are deep bogs, the population is sparse.  The available number of workers living in proximity to these bogs could not produce more than a small fraction of our requirements. Only on the western seaboard did circumstances exist that enabled a huge increase in turf production to be made &mdash;where there were bogs and people who knew how to handle turf.  It is in these areas&mdash;Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry&mdash;that the great bulk of the additional turf available now to supply the non-turf areas was produced.  It is from these areas we have got to bring it and it is because we have to bring it from those areas that the cost of that turf, delivered here, is much higher than it is in districts much nearer the point of production.  It is true that turf could be produced in Kildare or in the areas adjoining the Bog of Allen and transported to Dublin more cheaply than that could be done <Col N="1255" /> in Mayo but the workers were not available in these areas.  For next year, our plans include the erection of hutments and the transportation of workers to the most suitable bogs. That was not possible this year.  This year, we had to work within limitations imposed by circumstances and by nature and the result is one upon which we should congratulate ourselves, even though it must be recognised that the cost of the turf, reckoned in terms of money, is considerable.  We could have decided to cut the cost by doing without the turf but, in the Government's view, it was better to have turf so that people could get fuel than that these financial considerations should dominate policy.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what that cost is. Turf has been produced in nearly every county but the surplus that is available for the City of Dublin and for the non-turf areas generally is mainly located along the western coast.  That turf was produced, as I have said, by organisations created by the county surveyors.  Seventy-five per cent. of the total quantity of turf delivered to Fuel Importers, Ltd., was county surveyors' turf.  There is no element of private profit in that.  The county surveyors produced that turf with their own organisations and with the assistance of public funds.  The accounts of the county surveyors will be audited by the Department of Local Government. The cost of the turf has been provisionally fixed.  Perhaps, when the Local Government audit takes place, some reduction of that cost will be possible but I do not think that that is likely.  These provisional figures will, probably, prove to be accurate.  They represent the actual cost of producing the turf.  There is no item in that price capable of being questioned.  That is what the turf did cost in those districts and I do not think it was an unreasonable cost.</P>

      <P>That is the first item of cost.  The average price was 24/3 per ton for turf free on rail or ex-bog available for transportation.  Having regard to the price at which turf was <Col N="1256" /> sold in a competitive market in towns like Galway, Sligo and other centres in the West earlier in the year, that price is not exorbitant.  It may be that if the work had been organised over a longer period, and if all the men employed had had more experience of the work, some slight reduction in that cost would have been possible but, allowing for all the circumstances, nobody can claim that that figure of 24/3 is exorbitant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  These figures deal with turf from the turf areas.  I have explained to the Deputy that the available information as to what the turf will cost relates to the quantity delivered up to about the middle of November.  That is, approximately, 25 per cent. of what the estimated supply will be.  It is, no doubt, representative of what the total cost will be but the possibility of variations in these costs must be allowed for.  The turf was taken over by Fuel Importers, Ltd., at the railhead at these prices.  There can be no question about that.  They represent no element of private profit&mdash;only the cost of the turf produced by the county council organisations and delivered there.  That turf had to be transported. 72 per cent. was carried by rail, 21 per cent. by lorry and 7 per cent. by canal or sea.  The mode of transport is, of course, governed to a very large degree by the location of the turf.  The greatest possible use is made of the cheapest method of transportation. The predominant rail rate to Dublin from the midland counties was about 12/- and from the western counties about double that&mdash;24/-.  The cost of bringing turf by road was much more expensive.  The cost by canal or by sea was not unreasonable but the quantity of turf that could be brought by these methods of transportation was, naturally, limited.  The turf had to be available in locations which permitted of the use of these methods of transportation.  The average transportation cost of all the turf delivered up to the middle of November was 18/6 per ton. There is little use in making comparisons between the present cost of transporting turf by rail and the flat rate price of 6/- per ton, fixed some years ago but abandoned later.  That flatrate price related to an entirely different set of circumstances from those now existing.  The average haul per ton was estimated to be considerably less <Col N="1258" /> than it was necessary to undertake this year and the cost of railway transportation was much less then than it is now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not misunderstand what I have said. When the flat rate price was fixed&mdash;in 1936, I think&mdash;it was estimated that the average haul per ton would be very much less than the haul from Donegal or Mayo or Galway.  In practice, it did not prove to be and, therefore, the flat rate had to be abandoned.  In any event, there is little purpose in comparing that figure with the figure now, having regard to the difference in the circumstances.  Everybody knows that the cost of transporting goods by rail has increased considerably and that the cost of operating rail services has also increased considerably.  While I do not want to say that it is impossible to secure some reduction in the cost of transporting turf by rail, the figures I have given represent the actual amount paid so far as Fuel Importers, Ltd., are concerned.  That is what they paid for the transport of turf, and it is on the basis of that charge that the cost of the turf to them must be determined.  We have now taken the turf from the bog and put it on the train.  It has been brought up to Dublin or whatever other part of the non-turf areas in which Fuel Importers, Ltd., were establishing dumps.  There, the turf had to be taken off the train, brought to the dump site and clamped into stacks.  The cost of doing that was, on the average, 8/9 per ton.  In the City of Dublin, it was higher; in the town of Dundalk it was higher still, but the average for the non-turf area as a whole was 8/9.</P>

That is what Fuel Importers, Ltd., are doing.  The turf cost them 51/6.  They are selling <Col N="1259" /> it at 50/6.  There is, therefore, a loss of 1/- per ton to Fuel Importers, Ltd. But these are not the only costs.  We know that other costs will arise&mdash;the cost of administration and the overhead charges which Fuel Importers, Ltd., have to carry.  What these costs will be cannot be determined until the total quantity of turf is known.  It is only at the end of the period, when these overhead charges are related to the actual quantity of turf, that these costs can be determined.  It is estimated that they will be 4/6 a ton and, if we add that to the shilling loss already incurred, we are faced with a loss of 5/6 per ton on the turf supplied by Fuel Importers, Ltd.  Another charge must be taken into account. What it will be is hard to determine. There is a wastage in turf.  Between the time it leaves the bog, and is put into the clamp, or taken from the clamp and delivered to the consumer, there is, with all the handlings, a wastage.  Some of the turf crumbles. Some of it loses moisture-content and shrinks and, generally speaking, the weight of turf which will be taken out of these dumps will be less than that put in.</P>
      <P>Through wastage, shrinkage, or pilferage, through one cause or another, there will be a loss sustained, and what that loss will be has yet to be determined. Estimates have been made varying from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent.  Turf stored in clamps tends to shrink considerably through loss of moisture.  Assuming that the minimum estimate is correct and that the wastage is 20 per cent. and not 40 per cent., then, upon the known cost of the quantity of turf delivered to the middle of November, that represents a further charge of 12/6 per ton.  That means that 12/6, plus 5/6, represents the total loss per ton which Fuel Importers, Ltd., may sustain arising out of the turf sold by them.  If we are going to let purely economic considerations operate, remove the control, as Deputy Mulcahy asks, then that 18/- must be recovered from somebody, and it can only be recovered, under present circumstances, from the consumers of turf and, consequently, the price must go up by that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> At the price of 50/6 per ton fuel is delivered by Fuel Importers, Ltd., to the merchants.  The merchants get 16/- per ton for the delivery of turf.  It is, of course, impossible to say precisely what the cost to a merchant delivering turf to householders is, because there is no previous experience to go back over. We are doing it for the first time on the present scale, and it is only after a period that actual accounts can be taken out and actual charges determined. We did determine an allowance of 16/- a ton upon the known cost of delivering coal&mdash;I am dealing with average figures in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think it will prove to be more expensive for a merchant to deliver turf to householders than to deliver coal. It is greater in bulk, there is more handling and transportation required and, consequently, it is not likely that the cost of delivering turf will be less than the cost of delivering coal. Therefore, that allowance to merchants is not likely to yield them any undue return.  However, that matter can be checked up.  As soon as accounts can be taken out over a reasonable period, the actual cost can be determined.</P>
    <P>In the City of Cork and in other parts of the non-turf areas different costs operate to those existing in the City of Dublin.  We have fixed a flat price for the whole of the area.  We think that facilitates price control and is fair in any event, because it is in the City of Dublin that the greatest problem arises.  It is true that the cost of doing all the operations necessary in relation to turf are higher in Dublin than elsewhere and that the maintenance of a flat price benefits the Dublin consumer on that account, but we think nevertheless, that the maintenance of a flat price is justifiable.  If we were to attempt to fix for Cork, Wexford, Waterford, Dundalk and Drogheda as well as for Dublin, the actual price in these districts, it would complicate administration and impair the efficiency of the price control.</P>
    <P>I have shown how this price has arisen.  It is quite clear that Fuel Importers, Limited, are losing upon that price.  What the future arrangement with that organisation will be I <Col N="1261" /> cannot at the moment say&mdash;it has not been decided.  It is quite clear that Fuel Importers, Limited, must be protected against loss; from some source they must get funds to enable them to recover the amount they lose upon the turf.  These figures relating to the cost of turf to Fuel Importers, Limited, have been determined upon the known costs of the turf delivered to the middle of November and put into reserve dumps established by Fuel Importers, Limited.</P>
    <P>During November when, for the first time, the turf of Fuel Importers, Limited, was released for consumption, we endeavoured to arrange that certain of the charges which arose in connection with the dumping of the turf would be eliminated by having the fresh turf coming in diverted to the merchants, so that the charge of taking it from the wagons, dumping it and then taking it from the dumps and delivering it later to the merchants would be eliminated. When the final accounts are taken out costs may be reduced by reason of the elimination of these charges.  To what extent they may be reduced it is impossible to say, but against a possible reduction in cost through that method of operation must be put the fact that a far higher proportion of the total deliveries of turf is now coming by road, and that the cost of delivery by road is substantially higher than the cost of delivery by rail.  It may happen that the additional cost arising out of the use of road transportation on a larger scale will more than offset the economy effected by the elimination of storage charges in respect of the turf now arriving.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to give the Dáil all possible information concerning this matter.  It is true that in fixing the price of 64/- the Government, as it were, thought of a price and determined on a price which had no direct relation to the known cost of the turf.  We had to take into account the fact that a loss was likely to occur which would have to be met by somebody, and we were anxious to minimise that loss.  We took into account that a very high price for turf would defeat the purpose of the Government in organising this <Col N="1262" /> turf campaign, because it would prevent the necessitous class of the population from being able to avail of it. Between the two considerations we fixed on a price of 64/-.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is justifiable to subsidise the price of that fuel in Dublin.  As I had occasion to explain to the Dáil in another connection, you do not prevent a rise in the cost of fuel or reduce the cost of the fuel by means of a subsidy.  You may conceal the fact that the commodity is costing that particular amount; you may prevent the impact of the cost upon the resources of individuals, but the actual cost remains the same and, whether people pay for the turf as fuel consumers or as taxpayers, they have to pay, nevertheless.  Are we justified in imposing upon the whole country an additional tax in order to get the means of subsidising the cost of fuel to one section of the population or members of the population living in particular districts?  You cannot, unfortunately, subsidise the cost of fuel to one class of the community only; if a subsidy is given, every class gets the benefit of it, both those who require assistance and those who do not require it, and it is only through the machinery of local authorities that assistance can be given direct to those who need assistance most.  It is doubtful, however, to what extent we would be justified, in present circumstances, in burdening the whole community in order to reduce the cost of fuel in one district.  Whether the Government will decide to deal with this loss, accruing to-Fuel Importers, Limited, by means of a subsidy, or whether we will attempt to recover that loss by means of higher charges for fuel at a later period, has yet to be decided.  Clearly, Fuel Importers, Limited, must be recouped for that loss, but the method of recoupment has not yet been decided upon.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was any other matter raised by any of the Deputies who have spoken, to which I have not referred.  I have given the analysis of the cost of the turf to Fuel Importers. Limited.  I have pointed out that the price at which that turf could be sold without loss is substantially <Col N="1263" /> higher than the fixed price now in operation.  I have, to some extent at least, explained the reason why that fixed price was determined upon.  I ask the Dáil not lightly to nullify the order fixing that price because, if they do, control of turf prices will cease to operate and the effect of the removal of control, inevitably, must be a higher price than that fixed by the order.  If there is a proposition to provide out of State funds a subsidy in order to enable turf fuel to be sold at a still lower price in the City of Dublin, then that will have to be considered separately, I think, in relation to the general financial position of the country.</P>

      <P>I have had some experience recently with regard to the present price of turf, and, as a member of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, I can say that we purchased over 650 tons of turf from the county council.  As the Minister has stated, 75 per cent. of the turf purchased by Fuel Importers, Ltd., was purchased under the county council scheme.  Well, as I was saying, the South Cork Board of Public Assistance bought about 695 tons of that turf at 22/6 a ton.  They paid 10/- for bringing it in to Cork City and to the county home, and they paid 3d. a ton for weighing it.  I may say that they weighed it on the corporation's weighbridges.  We are allowing another couple of shillings or 3/- for clamping it at the county home&mdash;that is, 35/-, about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Deputy only allow 2/- or 3/- for clamping it, seeing that the known price for clamping it at Cork is 9/7?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I shall come to that later.  I am talking now about the county council turf.  As a matter of fact, over 1,200 tons were bought direct at the bog at 22/6 a ton, and the wages paid were 38/- a ton, wet days or dry days.  That turf was brought into the county home at 10/- a ton, plus 3d. for weighing, and plus the cost of clamping it in the grounds of the institution.  I do not know <Col N="1264" /> whether the latter cost was 1/- or 2/- but that works out at about 35/- or 36/-.  The Minister says that 75 per cent. of the turf bought by Fuel Importers, Ltd., was purchased under the county council scheme.  There is also a big percentage in Cork, brought in by Fuel Importers, Ltd., or by the State, as far as I know, which is stored down in Ford's grounds, and if that is also being produced by the county council I take it that it is costing about 22/- or 23/- a ton, plus the cost of bringing it to Cork City from places like Kerry, Kanturk, or the Mill Street direction, plus 9/7 a ton for clamping it.  Now, I am at a loss to know what becomes of the difference between that and the 64/- charged by the merchants to householders. I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that it is hard to know where to trace the big difference there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit, of course, that there is a good deal of waste in the handling of turf.  As a matter of fact, as far as I know, coal merchants are not very keen at all on handling turf because there is a great deal of waste in it. The unfortunate thing is that whatever wastage or shrinkage there may be, is going to be paid for by the people who purchase the turf.  I have some experience of seeing the kind of turf that is coming in daily to Cork City from the bogs.  I have seen turf that was bought for the county home, and I think I can say without fear of contradiction that any of it that was brought in previous to the last month was very good.  The turf that was brought in during July and August was very good, but I think it is most unfair to the people who are compelled to buy turf in small quantities that they should have to pay a flat rate for all classes of turf.  Quite recently&mdash;no later than last Monday&mdash; I passed by a place where turf was being discharged in Cork.  I went to some of the wagons, and it seemed to me to be really a mischievous thing for people to be putting that kind of turf into the wagons for consumption. In another place, recently, where two creels of turf were being shipped, I noticed that quantities of the turf appeared to be very wet, and <Col N="1265" /> so I took one of the sods along with me and got it weighed in a shop, and the weight of the sod was 3 lbs. 3 ozs. A few hours after that I sent for a peck of turf and a peck of coal because I felt for the poor people who were buying turf at 9d. a peck and coal at 1/- a peck.  In order to satisfy myself, I sent for a poor chap, who had no coal or turf, and said to him: &ldquo;There is money, go and purchase a peck of turf and a peck of coal.&rdquo;  He came back and told me that he could not bring back the coal because it was all slack and no use to him, but that he had a peck of turf for which he had paid 9d.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to show the injustice of all this.  I wanted to see what class of turf it was, and so I weighed one of the sods or, rather, got it weighed in a shop, and one of the sods weighed 2½ lbs.  I said to him that there was no good in taking that turf, but he said that he would take it home and try to dry it.  In view of such things, the Minister should consider whether or not he should grade the price of turf or, rather, grade the turf and charge a price for it accordingly, because it is most unfair to expect the same price for good turf as for bad turf or for wet turf as for dry turf.  I know it is difficult to arrive at what the price should be, but it is a question that the Minister should go into further with a view to ascertaining, on the figures I have given, what is becoming of the difference.  I have already said that I know that turf was bought from the county council and brought into Cork, a distance of 20 miles.  It was purchased at 22/6, plus 10/- for bringing it in over 20 miles, plus 3/- or 4/- for clamping it, and 3d. a ton for weighing it, and it was weighed by this particular board for very good reasons.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in Cork Sanatorium, and we decided there that we would also weigh each load or each wagon of turf.  We discovered that the estimate on which the turf was purchased per cubic foot did not give the return at all in tons.  I know that is not the fault of the Minister, but there are many things to be considered when arriving at the price of turf.  It would be well worth the Minister's <Col N="1266" /> while to go into the matters to which I have referred, because there is no doubt that turf has been stored since last October and November and December at anything from 30/- to 32/6 or 34/-, so we cannot expect people to pay as high a price for turf bought at 32/-.  In my opinion, we are doing an injustice; they bought that turf and had it in their places at a maximum of 35/- or 38/-.  It would be interesting to know, if those people happen to be Fuel Importers, Ltd., where is the difference between that 35/- or 38/- and the 64/-.  Is it a reasonable margin to allow?</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that turf is becoming what is commonly called a racket in this country, and there will have to be some very definite cutting down in costs.  I fail to see how, in one portion of Cork City&mdash;and I have the figures that Deputy Hickey has&mdash;turf can be clamped at 2/9 a ton, while it costs 9/7 to clamp it in another portion of the city.</P>

That is the difference in Cork City itself between the clamping of two ricks of turf&mdash;the clamping of one rick in the county home at 3/- a ton, that is 2/9 plus 3d. for weighing, and the clamping of Fuel Importers, Ltd., turf down on the Marina at 9/7 a ton. Who is going to pay the difference of 6/7 but the unfortunate person who has to buy the turf in the end?  That is the situation, and I think it is unfair to the poor of the city.  I would have no objection to its going up to 95/- if the <Col N="1269" /> civil servants and others who have been dabbling in this have to pay the piper. I would have no objection to its going up to 95/- were it not that it might be unfair to the poor.  The Deputy himself saw the flight from the land, the flight from one bog into another.</P>

      <P>I would not blame the worker any day for getting the highest wage he could, but when we had workers employed at 38/-, the industrialists of Cork came on the job with their 1/- an hour, plus a special canteen, plus oilskins, plus rubber boots, plus transport to and from the bog for those who wanted it.  Taking that side by side with the wages we were paying, how many labourers could we hope to get?  We lost 1,300 or 1,400 tons of turf as a result of our men being taken away and put on this job.  That is the real situation, and that is what has driven up the price of turf for Cork City.  I am not very worried about Dublin, because every farthing in the whole Twenty-Six Counties eventually finds its way to Dublin; but the facts I have given explain why the price of turf in Cork has risen from a maximum of £2 to 64/-.  I cannot for the life of me understand how the delivery of turf in Dublin should cost 16/-.  If a farmer or a bog worker can cut the turf, spread it, clamp it and rick it at the price paid by the county councils and the county surveyors, somewhere between 11/6 and 14/- per ton, and the gentlemen who deliver it around Dublin are going to get 16/- a ton, I think it is a joke.  It is a rather tragic joke on the poor.  I would advise the Minister immediately to look into the figures for clamping turf in Cork City.  The figure for clamping it in one dump is given at 9/7, while the figure for clamping it in another dump is given as 2/9.</P>

Two hundred tons were delivered on these terms.  The Government then stepped in and said: &ldquo;You will supply no more under that contract; you are not a fuel merchant.  This turf must come through a fuel merchant.&rdquo;  Henry Ford then got £2 for the turf and the rest went to the fuel merchants.  Murphy's Brewery had to pay £3 per ton, £1 of which went to the fuel merchant.

      <P>That is the correction I want to have made.  Unfortunately it is now evidently too late to make it. Surely the Minister should have some idea of the cost of distributing turf in Dublin.  Surely it should not cost 16/- per ton to distribute it when the man on the bog who cuts and saves it gets only 14/- per ton.  Surely it is beyond reason to suggest that the cost of cutting, drying and setting the turf on the road is less than the cost of delivering it round Dublin.  Then there is the case of the two dumps in Cork, one at the county home costing 2/9 and the other costing 9/7.  These are the points that I should like the Minister to rectify.  If he has any idea that he is going to make the unfortunate bog man contribute to a subsidy to pay for the blunders that have been made, he never made a bigger mistake in his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to juggle with figures in any way but the Minister in his explanation has given us a figure of 24/3 per ton at the railhead.  He has accounted for that by the fact that turf has been cut on bogs which were not previously worked and by people who previously were not used to the work.  I am not quite prepared to accept that explanation with regard to the West of Ireland figures and the West of Ireland figures for the cost of turf are more favourable from the point of view of foundation prices than are the prices which have been ascertained for the East of Ireland. When one takes the position of Mayo, for which the Minister has given us a figure of 24/- a ton delivered at a particular railway station, one will notice that that is a generous figure having regard to the fact that all the institutions in Mayo have been able to get their turf delivered and fixed up at the various institutions at 22/6.  That applies to Ballina, Claremorris and Swinford.  In Belmullet they have been able to get it at 14/6.  We have got that explanation but we have no materials upon which we could usefully question the figures here now.  He explains the increase in freight to an average of 18/6 per ton by the cost of railway transit.  All I want to say is that <Col N="1272" /> what must have broken down the railways was attempting to carry turf in 1933, 1934 and 1935 at 6/- per ton, if it requires 18/6 to carry it now.</P>
      <P>When the Minister, after accounting for the cost of cutting and of freight, comes to the cost of distribution&mdash; that is the point which Deputy Corry put his finger on&mdash;we come to a situation that swings us back to the very beginning with regard to any of the costs and makes us doubt completely what the Minister has done to analyse, to examine, and to see that the prices are fair and reasonable.  We cannot go back to the past, as the Minister tells us, with regard to the cost of things, but I think it is reasonable that we should refer to certain matters.  I want to go back to the past and to take the last section of the costs, the third group on which the Minister builds up his costs, that is, handling, profits and distribution.  In May, 1934, a man in Sutton was selling good turf brought from Clare.  The price paid to the producer was 11/6, and the cost of carriage was 6/-, making a total of 17/6.  He was selling that turf in Howth at 25/- per ton.  That meant that he was covering the costs of handling, local distribution, profits, overhead costs, shrinkage, and all that by 7/6 per ton.  The Minister provides a figure of 23/3 which I put against that figure.  He has given us figures for the cost and for freight, and then he says handling charges are 8/9.  He leaves the merchant 12/6 for distribution and profit.  He tells us that in some way in that 23/3 he is arranging that the person who takes the turf from Fuel Importers, Ltd., in the city here and distributes it will get 16/- for the cost of distribution.  I ask the Minister what is wrong with a situation when a person who has got turf from Fuel Importers, Ltd., and is distributing it in the city is to get 16/- for the distribution, when for 7/6 a few years ago it was possible to do the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister opened his statement here by explaining how unexpected the present situation was; that they did not expect the British to break down on coal.  I was not raising the <Col N="1273" /> question of the Government's failure to foresee what would happen.  I was raising the question of the Government's facing the situation as long ago as January and February last when they indicated that there would be a desperate fuel shortage except the people were able to get turf.  I was dealing with their failure and their futility and incompetence in handling a situation that they agreed disclosed itself to them then.  The Minister went on to suggest that there had been criticism of the way in which the turf was produced.  The thing about it is that a very considerable quantity of turf has been produced, but it is on the distribution side that the Minister has broken down.  Even supposing that it cost 24/3 to produce the turf, and giving credit for the production which has taken place, there is a break-down in the distribution position when freight is put down at 18/6.  There is failure and incompetence when we are asked to take at 23/3 the cost that is to be added on from the time the turf reaches Dublin.</P>
    <P>Various Ministers in the beginning of the year indicated what a terrible thing it would be if we had a fuel famine here.  We are told that an immense amount of turf has been produced, but it is not available for the people who cannot pay 64/- per ton for it.  The Minister has heard from Deputy Hickey that the same complaint arises in Cork as arises in Dublin with regard to the quality of the turf.  It is almost impossible to use some of it.  When the Minister considers the position of some of the poorer householders in various parts of the city, with no other fuel than the turf for which they have to pay that price&mdash;and they are getting wet and bad turf&mdash;there is a fuel famine for them.  It is just as important for them that they should be helped to have a fire as that they should be helped to have bread.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is examining the situation further to see whether he can cut down the sectional costs he has mentioned, I submit that the present order should be cancelled and another order introduced fixing a lower maximum price.  The Minister told us the <Col N="1274" /> other day: &ldquo;When, in June last, the price of turf was fixed at 45/- per ton, or 50/- per ton where it was delivered in quarter-ton lots, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance fixed the price in the County Borough of Dublin and the County Dublin by a certain Emergency Order on the basis of information supplied to him by my Department, and all the factors mentioned in the Deputy's question were fully considered by my Department before advising the Parlimentary Secretary.&rdquo;  In June last year, after fully considering the cost of production, the railway rates and the cost of distribution, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, on the advice of the Minister for Supplies, after the Minister for Supplies had examined all these things, fixed the price of turf at 45/- per ton, or 50/- per ton where it was distributed in quarter-ton lots.</P>
    <P>Every factor tending towards a high price for turf that existed in November existed in June, and if there was any factor adding to the increase in cost it was the shutting down of the turf in the turf districts over a particular period and the holding of it there. Therefore, the transport that might have been available in June and July to bring turf to non-turf areas did not exist later on when it was required. The Parliamentary Secretary has probably, by the restrictions that he introduced with regard to turf in the non-turf areas, increased the price of transport.  But no explanation of any kind has been given, or I believe can be given, as to why when the turf reaches Dublin it costs, between Fuel Importers, Ltd., and the merchants to whom they sell for further distribution, 23/3 per ton.  We had a situation before in regard to milk.  When the Government brought about a change in the distributing machinery for milk in the City of Dublin and set up a kind of monopoly of big distributors and prevented the smaller distributors in the city distributing except through these, the price of milk was raised.  So that, apparently, the bigger the machinery and the more elaborate the machinery there is for the distribution of any commodity, the higher are going to be the <Col N="1275" /> costs.  Assuming that there is justice in what the Minister says with regard to the cost of turf and bringing it to Dublin, there is no reason at all why costs of distribution in the City of Dublin should be as they are.  A very severe hardship is being imposed on all fuel users in the City of Dublin.  As regards the rest of the country, I want to reiterate that the Minister's order is being applied to various counties where, before his order was issued, turf was being supplied at very much lower prices.  I want to reiterate that in Cork, the level was 33/3 and 33/9. In Youghal it was 41/-.  In North Tipperary, coming from a distance of 25 miles, it was 45/-.  In the Tullamore Hospital it was 30/-, coming from a distance of eight to four miles, and it was 30/- coming from a distance of 13 miles.  In other Offaly institutions it was 29/-.  Where the turf was from County Dublin, where it was 60/-, the highest of all, it was from a completely undeveloped bog, worked by completely inexperienced workers and in circumstances that indicate that the price should and will be very considerably reduced when the work of cutting is tackled there again.  So that we are in a special and an emergency situation that cannot possibly recur.</P>
    <P>As to the Minister's question as to why the people as a whole should be taxed by some kind of subsidy for the purpose of making turf cheap in a particular area, I submit that the Minister is taxing the people grievously and that he is putting that tax on the most unfortunate people, the people who, in largest numbers and in poorest circumstances, have to depend on fires and who, in very many places, under the present circumstances, can get nothing but turf.  I refer to people in the large urban centres and in the large cities.  The Minister, by his order, has increased to a very large extent the price of turf, and I think his order should be abolished and replaced by <Col N="1276" /> another order.  The Minister has suggested that to wipe out this order means that the price of turf is going to soar.  The object of abolishing this order is to replace it by an order that would reduce the maximum price of turf.  I think the Minister cannot possibly stand over this order.  He was not here when I pointed out that there is no reason in the world why 16/- a ton should be taken as the cost of distributing turf in the City of Dublin.  If we take the Minister's figures, I suggest that for the costs of Fuel Importers, Ltd., and the costs of the distributors, from the time the turf reaches Dublin, he is making an allowance of 23/3 for distribution.  I pointed out that in 1934 it was possible for a seller of turf in Howth to sell turf that had come from Clare at 25/-, 11/6 being the price to the producer, 6/- being the rail cost, and 7/6 his cost of distribution. I put his cost of 7/6 for distribution and the general run of costs at that particular time against 23/3, his figure now.</P>

When the Minister then allows Fuel Importers, Ltd., to take a certain amount of money and says that 16/- then can be taken by the merchants who are actually distributing, I say it is an outrageous figure and that there is nothing in the experience of fuel distribution in the City of Dublin that can bear it out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is many months since this motion <Col N="1279" /> was put down by Deputy Hannigan and myself.  Since then, there has been some improvement in the tea situation, but there has not been the improvement that most of us would like to see.  We know the severe hardships that our people were called upon to bear when the tea ration was reduced very suddenly from 2 ozs. to ½ oz.  Quite recently there has been an improvement in the situation.  We do not know how long the present ration of 1 oz. will be continued.  If I thought there was any possibility of the present ration being increased, I would gladly make a demand to have it increased.  The motion will give the Minister an opportunity of telling the House what the position is likely to be for the future.  In the newspapers recently we were told by some of the leading tea merchants in the city that they hoped to see an improvement in the supply of tea available during the coming year.  It was stated that tea is coming from India, and that some space was being reserved on American ships for cargoes for this country.  I hope that tea will be included in the supplies coming here.  There was a cry all over the city, especially in the working-class quarters, where people have to depend on a tea meal three times a day, when the supply of this commodity was suddenly cut down.  I earnestly hope the Minister will take steps to see that nothing of that kind will occur again.  We are all anxious to hear what the Minister has to say as to the prospects for the future in regard to tea and other supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  I suggest to the Minister that there is need for some inquiry into the distribution of tea.  I have in mind one trading concern.  Its tea supply is based on what it purchased in 1938. In 1938, 1939 and 1940 a number of people went to trade with this concern. There were no new people taken on in 1941.  The position is that the people who were trading with that concern in 1939 and 1940 are now being told&mdash;the notices were sent out on Friday last&mdash; that they will have to go back to the firm they were dealing with in 1938. That is the position in regard to that <Col N="1280" /> trading concern, notwithstanding the fact that the wholesalers are agreeable to give the supply of tea required by it if they can get permission from the Department of Supplies.</P>

      <P>I think the demand outlined in the motion is a reasonable one. It is one, I think, that should be met by the Government in a reasonable way.  I think no one will dispute the fact that there is a scarcity of the commodities set out in the motion.  We have the position that a number of retailers who have been in business for a long time are to-day not able to get the necessary supplies to meet the demands of customers who have been dealing with them for a long number of years.  Is it not obvious, therefore, that there is a scarcity somewhere?  Is the scarcity due to the fact that tea cannot be found to meet the demands of retailers, or is it due to the fact that there have been some mistakes or bungling in the administration concerned with the distribution of tea?  I am personally aware of a retailer who is only able to obtain a supply sufficient to provide for the needs of two-thirds of his customers.  He has to send the rest away.  Surely the distribution of tea ought to be arranged in such a way that retailers will get adequate supplies to provide the ration of one ounce for all their customers.</P>

      <P>We are told that purchases of tea have been made.  We do not know how true that is, or how soon they may be brought to this country, but if additional supplies of tea are available, I think special consideration should be given to agricultural workers and to people who have to work at considerable distances from their homes, such as men working on the roads or cutting and saving turf.  They are engaged on very strenuous work, and are in need of something in the nature of a stimulant.  In that respect, no suitable substitute can be found for tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of employers employ casual labour.  Some farmers employ a large number of men in the harvest or at the potato picking.  For seasonal work of that character, the present system of rationing is no use.  The number of people who have to be catered for on a special occasion, such as during harvesting operations, is far in excess of the normal number.  Here, again, there is a case for a special allowance.  If a committee of this House were appointed to inquire into <Col N="1282" /> this question, they would find that there is a very serious scarcity of these essential commodities and that, amongst the poorer sections of the community particularly, a great deal of hardship is occasioned by this scarcity.</P>

The Minister should welcome the introduction of a motion of this kind if for no other reason than that it affords him an opportunity of making a statement regarding the supplies of tea, cocoa and coffee available for consumption.  I seriously suggest that there is a scarcity of tea, due to the fact that certain wealthy people, at a particular period, took the advice&mdash;I do not blame them&mdash;given by the Minister to buy in all the tea, cocoa and coffee which the money in their possession would enable them to buy.  The people with money, at that period, went out to every merchant in the city and throughout the country and bought up all the tea which wholesalers and retailers were willing to sell them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time, there was nothing wrong in it, but the fact that these people hold large quantities of tea, and, perhaps, cocoa and coffee, has created the scarcity that exists at present and is responsible, to a certain extent, for the very small ration of tea allowed the community.  I ask Deputy Walsh if it is right that any person in his constituency, simply because he had plenty of money at the time the Minister gave this advice, should have a chest or two chests of tea while poor people in the same locality cannot get <Col N="1283" /> any more than the miserable ration allowed by the Minister.  The ration is fixed at the present low figure simply because the wholesalers have not sufficient tea at their disposal, but if the Minister would exercise the powers which, I believe, he has, under the Emergency Powers Order, to search the houses of wealthy people who have tea and, perhaps, coffee and cocoa hoarded, he would find that there would be a sufficient supply of tea and, perhaps, coffee and cocoa to increase the existing ration.  The scarcity exists, to some extent, because there is a certain amount of hoarding.</P>
      <P>I am not blaming the Minister for giving the advice he did at that time, but I am sure he knows that, because of that advice, certain wealthy people have more tea in their possession than the other citizens of the State.  To what extent has the Minister, in recent times, exercised his power to make a search of private or business houses so as to recover tea held in excess of the quantity which should be held?  If he could get back into his own control the large quantity of tea hoarded by a number of wealthy citizens, there would not be the scarcity of which Deputy Byrne complains in his motion. I do not know whether that matter was given very much consideration by Deputy Byrne when putting down his motion, but I am sure he will agree that, to some extent, what I am saying is correct.  Whatever about cocoa and coffee, I believe that a surplus of tea is held by a certain limited number of privileged citizens and that the Minister should, if he believes that, exercise his powers of search so as to increase the present ration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, undoubtedly, a scarcity of tea, and I wonder if any substitutes are possible.  Tea and cocoa are the principal food-drinks in rural Ireland.  I do not know whether tea is being held up or not, but there is, undoubtedly, a scarcity of it.  During the coming year I should like the Minister to consider the case of those workers in rural Ireland who have not been registered in their homes.  Take the West of Ireland.  A good many <Col N="1284" /> men in the West are not registered in their homes.  They work a week for a farmer here and a week for a farmer in some other place.  Workers in the north-west and south would be in a similar position.  These people have to get an allowance of tea from the farmers for whom they are working and the farmer's family is deprived of its due allowance so as to supply the workers.  Last year an attempt was made to remedy the position but it was rather late.  Take the case of men working in bogs.  I know areas where up to 300 men have been working in bogs.  The man working in a bog does not take his usual meals.  He may work six miles from his home.  He depends on tea for his midday meal and he has another meal of the same kind in the evening after he leaves off work.  He works from daylight to dark and does not go home for his regular meals.  If he were to go home, he would not use the same amount of tea because the meals would be of a different kind. Young members of a farmer's family are deprived of their due amount of tea because practically three times as much tea is used by farmers' sons engaged in this way than would be used if they were working on their father's farms.  The Department held this year that any man who could get home at night was not entitled to the increased supply.  Now they are only registered in the ordinary way.  I would like the Minister to give some attention to that matter, seeing that the Parliamentary Secretary informed us a few weeks ago that he would have men working in the bogs in February.  If that is so, there will be much more tea required for those men in February than there would be required in June.  These men have to cycle six or seven miles to work in these areas and should receive special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another class of worker is the road worker, who very seldom gets home to dinner, and has to depend on a bottle of tea for his dinner.  Either he or his family are deprived of tea and they are very poor.  Young families deprived of that have no substitute.  The ordinary road worker has no substitute whatsoever, as he does not <Col N="1285" /> usually have a cow.  I cannot see why these youngsters should be deprived of the small allowance of tea they require. The Minister may answer that milk is a good substitute.  It is, in the months of June or July, but in February or March it is not a substitute, when a person wants something warm.</P>
    <P>There are many workers throughout the country working under different Departments.  Take the Forestry Department: I have seen men working on very big schemes cutting fuel to heat the poor of Dublin.  They work an eight-hour day, and in those woods that is not a very nice job.  If the Minister went down there and went through them he would see what they are like. Then there are drainage schemes in connection with bogs, where men are up to their hips at the present time carrying out drainage work.  I know they are provided with long boots for the purpose, but they have to work an eight-hour day and have to live on a substitute for tea or, if they get the tea, the family is deprived of it.  The Minister should look into that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there has been great storing of tea.  I know the Minister and the Government advised everyone to put in supplies.  I know people who put in supplies of flour and are sorry now, as a lot of it went bad.  I do not believe tea would go bad, but doubt if there are the stores Deputy Davin says there are throughout the country.  I probably know a few myself, but do not suppose it is done to a great extent.  I would like the Minister to look after the case of people in the cities who have to live on a small amount, and that of workers on different schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The only scarcity we have noticed throughout the country is not due to the fundamental reason of tea being scarce, owing to the war and its not being produced in such quantity, but rather is it due to the method of distribution of supplies in country areas.  If the Minister distributed the tea in the same way as paraffin oil&mdash;on the basis of the number of registered customers with the shop-keeper&mdash;it would do away with practically all the <Col N="1286" /> complaints there are at present.  There is one element that does not appear to have been realised by the Minister's Department in connection with the distribution of tea.  It is that, prior to the scarcity, you had all over the West&mdash;and I am sure this applies all over the country&mdash;people who were supplied by travelling shops.</P>
      <P>Since the emergency, these travelling shops have faded out, owing to lack of petrol and tyres and the difficulty of keeping mechanically propelled vehicles on the road.  As a result, the customers of these travelling shops have been compelled to go back to the local shopkeeper and hand their tea coupons to him.  No shopkeeper wants to take them at present, as he is limited in his tea purchases to a certain quota&mdash;portion of the amount he obtained in 1939.  I think it would eliminate a lot of the dissatisfaction, where there is that dissatisfaction about the distribution of tea and resultant scarcity in those areas, if the Minister based his quota to those people on their actual registered customers.</P>
      <P>There has been a definite change in the number of customers being supplied owing to the curtailment of the activities of the travelling shop.  If he does not do that, there undoubtedly will be hardships, as there are in some remote districts where this matter principally arises.  If the Minister examined the matter, it would cut out many of these complaints.  From what I know it is only in a few isolated areas that there have been complaints about the scarcity of tea and, in my opinion, it is not so much a scarcity as inequitable distribution by the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody blames the Minister for the scarcity of tea&mdash; although I did perhaps blame him at one time.  As far as there is a scarcity, we are all prepared to tighten our belts and take our share of what there is. I believe Deputy Moran touched the spot, as far as the complaints of the people generally are concerned.  It is not that the people expect the Minister to do the impossible.  Rather, as Deputy Moran said, it is that we all <Col N="1287" /> feel entitled&mdash;rich and poor&mdash;to a fair crack of the whip and to get our share of what is there.</P>
      <P>The complaint raised by Deputy Moran exists everywhere.  In the particular town with which I am concerned, I have been extremely bothered day and night with regard to the tea supply.  It is not perhaps a question of scarcity, but distribution means, for a person who cannot get tea, a scarcity, whatever quantity is there, if that person gets none.  There are people in my vicinity who cannot get any tea. If some system were adopted, as suggested by Deputy Moran, of allocating supplies on the basis of customers rather than on the amount they got last year or the year before, there would be some chance of the poor person getting some tea.</P>
      <P>Perhaps if I were another Deputy, or if I were the Minister in opposition, I might be inclined to take political advantage of a certain case of which I will give some details, but I do not want to.  I was in a village shop quite recently.  In this shop every week for some time past there have been difficulties with regard to the distribution of tea.  Perhaps the shopkeeper took too many cards, but then somebody had to take them.  Anyhow, this person had more cards than could be supplied. Communications were addressed to the Department and eventually the shopkeeper was asked, if there were more cards than could be supplied, to pass on some of the cards to another shop in the same place and that shop would be in a position to supply the people who required tea.  If I were so inclined, I could take political advantage out of a case like that.  I could argue why should one shop get certain facilities over another and I could point out that it might mean the taking by one shop of another shop's customers.  In my opinion, that would be a rather improper argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyway, what really happened in that village was that the shop the people were asked to go to would not supply them at all; that shop either did not want to supply the people or it could not supply them&mdash;probably it could not.  I get my ounce of tea and <Col N="1288" /> I am sure every other Deputy gets his or her ounce, but some unfortunate people in the country do not get an ounce each.  I will support the case that has been made by Deputy Moran and I will ask the Minister to see if in future he could arrange that the tea will be allocated to retailers in proportion to the number of cards in their possession.  People who want to buy tea should be facilitated.  The whole matter would be simplified in that manner.  As it is, difficulties exist everywhere and I have no doubt every Deputy has had the experience of Deputy Moran and myself of the trouble that arises because of the manner in which the supplies of tea are distributed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in intervening in this debate is for the purpose of presenting a case on behalf of a certain section of the community in relation to supplies of tea and, if the Minister can make any adjustment at all, I think he should make some adjustment in their favour.  I refer to old and single people.  These people are at a great disadvantage in this matter as compared to large families.  If you divide an ounce into seven parts you will find it almost impossible to make any practical use of it, but in the case of a family of four or five, or perhaps eight or nine, the weekly tea ration can be used to some advantage.  Take the case of a poor person who, until this war broke out and tea rationing became essential, was in the habit of using tea for practically every meal. Just imagine dividing an ounce of tea into 14 parts so as to provide for two meals each day!  We must realise how impossible that would be and I suggest to the Minister that if there is any hope of an additional ration or some adjustment being made, he should pay particular attention to the case of those single individuals and old people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, which has been moved by Deputy Byrne, asks the Dáil to set up a committee to investigate and report on the reasons for the scarcity of tea, cocoa and coffee.  I do not think any Deputy has spoken about the motion, nor do I think a case could be made for setting up a committee to <Col N="1289" /> find out the reason for the scarcity of tea, cocoa and coffee.  The reason for the general scarcity of these commodities is well known, and nothing that a committee could do could possibly add to our knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>It may, however, be no harm to refresh the minds of Deputies on the history of our tea supplies during the war. I think most Deputies are aware that before the war the bulk of our tea came from the United Kingdom.  It was bought in the London tea market through English tea brokers.  Some part of our supplies came from Holland, a similar tea market in Holland, and some came direct from India and other countries of origin; but by far the greater part of our supplies came from London.  When the war started, the British Government took control of all the tea in Great Britain.  That situation inevitably led to discussions between ourselves and the Tea Control Section of the British Ministry of Food. They had then under their control the tea supplies which had been destined for this country.</P>
      <P>Arising out of these discussions, an arrangement was made under which they, on their side, agreed to give us our normal annual imports of tea, based upon the actual recorded imports during a period of 12 months prior to June, 1939, and to make up that proportion of our normal annual imports which formerly was obtained from Holland or direct from India, on the understanding that we would take all our supplies from them and not attempt to compete in other markets for supplies or to make arrangements for shipments of supplies from other markets.  We made that arrangement, and it worked very smoothly for a considerable period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June, 1940, the British Government decided to introduce tea rationing in Great Britain, but when they did they officially informed us that the introduction of rationing in Great Britain would not involve any alteration of our position, and that we would continue to receive periodic allocations of tea equivalent to 100 per cent. of our normal purchases.  Towards the end of 1940, when air attacks upon <Col N="1290" /> Great Britain became more numerous, their transport and distribution arrangements were from time to time disorganised, and before the end of the year the allocation of tea to this country had fallen into arrear.  We were due certain allocations which had not, in fact, arrived.  There was no change in the English position, and, in fact, discussions were proceeding between officers of my Department and officials of the Tea Control Section in Great Britain concerning the wiping out of the arrears of allocations by the exportation of special consignments to this country.  We were anxious, naturally, to maintain, if possible, a reserve supply in this country, and we felt that these allocations in arrear, if made good, would provide that reserve.</P>
    <P>That situation continued until 16th January, 1941.  We were then informed, without any preliminary notice, and with no reason to expect the intimation, that the current allocation of tea was going to be reduced to the same level as that obtaining in the United Kingdom; that is to say, to about 85 per cent. of the normal quantity.  That intimation took us by surprise and certainly found us unprepared for the immediate introduction of the rationing scheme which then became necessary. We felt sure that any necessity to reduce the allocation of tea to this country by the British Tea Control would be preceded by an intimation sufficiently in advance of the actual reduction of supplies to enable us to prepare for the introduction of a rationing scheme.  As I have said, however, we got no such intimation except the unexpected notification that the current allocation was being reduced to 85 per cent.  We immediately took steps to control the distribution of tea by wholesalers to retailers, and for the introduction of a rationing scheme. We had numerous discussions during that period with the British Tea Control, but they did not result in any increase in the allocation then being made on the basis of 85 per cent.  On the contrary, and without previous intimation again, we received notifications in rapid succession that current allocations were being reduced from 85 per cent. to 60 per cent., from <Col N="1291" /> 60 per cent. to 50 per cent., and, finally, from 50 per cent. to 25 per cent. In fact, before our rationing scheme came into full formal operation, the allocations of tea to this country were being made, not upon the basis of 85 per cent., but upon the basis of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>When it became evident that the British Ministry of Food were not prepared to increase the supplies of tea to this country, we gave consideration to the question of endeavouring to augment our supplies by direct purchases either in the countries of origin or in the United States of America.  It was obvious that the principal difficulty in the making of direct purchases was that of arranging for shipment, but on the establishment of Irish Shipping, Ltd., it appeared likely that that difficulty, to some extent, would be relieved, and steps were then taken to set up an importing organisation for tea.  A company on the usual lines, called Tea Importers (Éire), Ltd., was set up as a non-profit-making company to arrange for direct imports of tea, and the consent of prominent members of the Wholesale Tea Merchants' Association to act as directors of that company was secured.  That company set out to buy tea in the United States of America and in Calcutta.  They bought a quantity of tea in the U.S.A., and a very much larger quantity in India, but considerable difficulty was experienced in arranging shipment from India.</P>
    <P>We found, in fact, that direct shipment from India was out of the question. Consequently, plans had to be revised for the movement of that tea and arrangements were made for its shipment the other way around the world, that is to say, from India, through the Panama Canal, to the eastern coast of the U.S.A., with the intention of picking it up from the American ports in our own ships and bringing it across the Atlantic here. That movement is going on at the moment, and there are some 2,000,000 lbs. of tea at present on the sea somewhere between India and the United States and there is a considerably larger quantity awaiting shipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> Whether the arrangements will work out as planned, and the tea will arrive in this country, it is yet too soon to say.  It is, in present circumstances, very unwise to assume that everything will work out as anticipated, but there is at least reason to hope that some part of that tea, which has been purchased through Tea Importers, Ltd., will arrive here.  A quantity of tea purchased in the U.S.A. has arrived and forms part of our present supplies.</P>
    <P>Because of these purchases made in the U.S.A. and in India, and because of the fact that we can proceed upon the assumption that some of that tea will arrive here, and also having regard to the stocks of tea which had been accumulated through administrative action in the hands of wholesale merchants, it was decided in mid-October to increase the ration from half an ounce per head per week to one ounce.  In the month of October we received intimation from the British Tea Control that the current allocation would be on the basis of 37½ per cent., instead of on the basis of 25 per cent.  It was that intimation that turned the decision in favour of increasing the ration to one ounce per week, but, as Deputies now know, the next allocation was again made upon the 25 per cent. basis.  I cannot say for certain whether we will be able to keep the one-ounce ration going indefinitely. I can say certainly that we will be able to keep it till the end of the present month, as stocks for that purpose are available, but whether it will be possible to carry it on during January depends upon the arrival of certain supplies that are on the seas at the present time.  If these supplies do not arrive, we cannot do it; if they do arrive, we may be able to do it.  In any event, however, I should hope that even if we have to revert to the half-ounce ration for the month of January we will be able to restore the ounce ration in February.</P>
    <P>All these plans, of course, are based on the assumption that no catastrophe will befall the stocks <i>en route.</i>  It is not desirable, I think, that we should allow the wholesale stocks in the country to fall unduly low, because, of <Col N="1293" /> course, circumstances might arise at any time which would involve a total cutting off of all supplies for a period, and therefore we have got to keep some small reserves available, but we hope that it will be possible to do that, and, at the same time, maintain the one-ounce ration.  However, if it should turn out that we are not able to do that and if these supplies, now at sea, should not arrive, and if, consequently, we have to revert to the half-ounce ration for the month of January, I would ask the public not to be too disappointed because I should hope to be able to increase the ration to one ounce in the month of February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fairly sure about that?  I do not mean January, but is he fairly sure about February?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fairly sure that some of the supplies now <i>en route</i> will arrive before February.  They may not.  Nobody can be certain in these days that any supplies will arrive, but all our eggs are not in the one basket and I think it is unlikely that all the baskets will suffer damage simultaneously. Now, that is the position concerning our supplies.  I have given, briefly, the history of our supplies position since the outbreak of the war, and our present position, but I should like to deal with some of the matters that were raised concerning the distribution of tea.  I know that there are Deputies, and many members of the public, who do not fully understand why we have to be so strict in insisting that householders should register with the traders from whom they normally bought tea.  In theory, it should be possible to allow a customer to go to any trader he liked, and to adjust the supply of tea to traders to correspond to the number of customers registered with them.  In practice, that is not possible.  I have told you that all the tea we have got this year and are now getting is coming to us from the British Ministry of Food.  That tea does not come to us in bulk.  It is allocated by the British Ministry of Food to all the wholesale merchants who formerly did business in this country.  Our <Col N="1294" /> position in respect of tea is entirely different to our position, say, in respect of petrol.  All the petrol comes in here in one tanker, and it can then be allocated to the various users of petrol in accordance with their needs or some pre-determined plan of distribution.</P>
      <P>The same is also true in the case of sugar.  All the sugar is available at the point of distribution, and can be distributed on any basis.  For various administrative reasons we have linked up the distribution of sugar with the distribution of tea.  That is another question.  In the case of tea, however, for the reason I have stated, it is not under our control at any stage except in the final process of distribution.  It is allocated by the British Ministry of Food to those primary wholesalers, many of whom are located in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and are not subject to our control at all.  Consequently, we must have a system of distribution which conforms to that method of allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those primary wholesalers supply tea, on the basis of 25 per cent. of their datum year purchases, to the traders whom they normally supplied.  We cannot take that tea from one wholesaler and give it to another in order to increase the supplies of one trader or reduce the supplies of another.  If we attempted to do that we would just lose the tea.  We have got to allocate it in the manner which I have indicated, from those primary wholesalers to the traders who are registered with those wholesalers, and, consequently, any system of distribution must involve adjusting the number of customers to the supply of tea instead of adjusting the supply of tea to the number of customers. We can alter the number of customers registered with the trader, but we cannot alter the quantity of tea he is getting.  That is the general principle.  There may be some words of explanation required in connection with the application of it, but I want Deputies to understand that no matter what system of control we put into operation, whether the existing system of registration by households with traders or a new system of individual ration cards or the issue of coupons, it must involve no alteration in the <Col N="1295" /> quantity of tea which a trader is entitled to receive, because we cannot change that.  Even when the tea we purchased ourselves in India comes along we will have to continue distributing it through the same channels, because it is necessary to ensure that those primary wholesalers located in Great Britain are kept in the trade; otherwise they might cut their connections with this country and involve us in a loss of the quantity of tea allocated to them for us.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are wholesalers in this country in a position to supply more tea to their customers.  The commonest form of letter which comes to me from some traders is to the effect: &ldquo;I want more tea to give their ration to my customers, and my wholesaler is willing to give it to me.&rdquo;  I would not expect the wholesaler to say anything else.  He is obviously going to pass the burden of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; on to the Department of Supplies.  He is not going to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; himself, but we have to control the distribution from the wholesaler to the retailer in order to ensure that certain stocks are held. It is not in the interests of the wholesaler to hold those stocks.  He is willing to disperse his stocks.  He has no responsibility for the supplies of the country as a whole.  His responsibility as a businessman is to keep the goodwill of his customers.  It is our job to see that he does not dissipate his stocks, that those stocks are held for distribution in accordance with the prescribed scheme of distribution and are available for whatever period of time we decide.  That is why we cannot merely O.K. private arrangements made between wholesaler and retailer under which the wholesaler agrees to give the retailer larger supplies.  We have to ensure that the supplies going to each retailer are limited to the percentage of the quantity that went to him in the datum year which is for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>We decided on a flat rate ration.  I think we already discussed in the Dáil whether the flat rate ration was the most equitable system.  Deputy Brodrick says there are workers employed in laborious sort of work who should get special consideration, and a case could <Col N="1296" /> be made for that.  According to the newspapers, there are various classes of workers in Great Britain employed in what they call the heavy industries who get increased rations of controlled foods of one kind or another, and I can contemplate a Deputy making a case for giving an increased ration of tea to those classes of workers.  On the other hand, Deputy Gorry comes here to propose that we give an increased ration to the old people, to the people to whom tea is a greater luxury than to young, vigorous people in employment, who at any rate have the means to buy other foods.  Some people will urge that special consideration should be given to the unemployed. Other people might equally forcibly urge that this special consideration be given to those who are at work.  A very good case could be made for special consideration for special classes of people, but once you come down to dealing with special classes of people you will find there are so many of those classes that if you were to attempt to give a larger ration to any one of them &mdash;I suppose the minimum amount by which you could increase the individual ration would be, say, half an ounce per week&mdash;there would be nothing left for anybody else, and your position would inevitably be that you would be giving the whole of your available supplies to certain limited classes and leaving everyone else without tea.  We decided against that.  We decided that the fairest system of distribution of tea was to give a fixed equal amount to every member of the population.</P>
    <P>We do give special allowances to certain limited classes of workers, such as workers on bogs, who have to work a very long way from their homes.  That is the peculiarity of the bog worker's life, that he is working very many miles away from his home, and it is not possible for him to return for a meal in the middle of the day; he cannot return until some time after his work is concluded in the evening. They get a special allowance of tea where they are organised in certain minimum numbers, and there exists a person or a body which can take control of the tea and ensure that it is equitably distributed amongst the <Col N="1297" /> workers concerned.  Certain classes of railway workers who have to be a long way from their homes at night on long journeys get an extra allowance of tea. The same applies to coal miners, because of the special arduous nature of their work, and to some classes of fishermen, but in each case we are dealing with a limited class whose work is such or who are so organised that there can be no possibility, or very little possibility, of abuse.  When Deputy Brodrick urges that we should give a special allowance to itinerant farm workers and people of that kind, he is clearly bringing us into a field where organisation of any system of distribution of the extra allowance becomes impossible. It is not possible to conceive a system that will be free from abuse whereby you can give an extra allowance to itinerant farmers.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, what I really meant was itinerant farmers' sons who go away from their homes, people who, as the Minister himself has said, go to work in the bogs or to do hard work on drainage.  What I meant was that those people should, while they are doing that particular kind of work, receive some special consideration.</P>

      <P>We obviously cannot do it for individuals.  It is only when there are large numbers employed as on the county council turf schemes, the Clonsast Bog or through some of these special charitable orgnaisations which have gone into the turf production business, and where there are responsible people who will take the total allocation of tea for that particular job and look after its distribution, that we can do it.  It is clearly impossible to devise any scheme where you are dealing with individuals.  In the case of a farm worker who goes to work with another farmer for any period of time, he is entitled to change his registration from his old supplier to a new supplier in the district in which he is now living.  The suggestion is often made that secreted in the cellars of private individuals around the country there is an amazing quantity of tea and that if we could get our hands on that <Col N="1298" /> there would be enough for everybody.  I think that is nonsense.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin says that it is a quantity sufficiently large to enable us to increase the ration.  If he will admit that the minimum amount by which it is possible to increase the ration is one half ounce per week, has he any conception of the quantity of tea which that involves?  A one half-ounce ration involves 1,000 chests of tea per week&mdash;that is, 1,000 full chests of 120 lbs. each.  It requires that quantity to increase the ration by a half ounce per week.  I do not know if there is any system of a household search that is likely to turn out 1,000 chests of tea per week and I am quite certain that no such quantity is held by private householders.  We know from the figures that the total quantity of tea sold last year was no greater than the total quantity sold in the previous year.  It is quite possible that people still have got some of the reserve stocks which were accumulated in some households last year, but I doubt if there is much of the reserve stocks left except in a few isolated individual cases.  Even in these cases, if one went to search for them, there is no guarantee that one would find them. I am quite certain that the household search over the half million households in the country which Deputy Davin contemplates would require the services of the Army and the Guards for months and would not produce anything in the shape of a reserve stock of tea that would make it worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are difficulties of a special kind in some cases.  The disappearance of the travelling shop has caused a problem in some districts.  People who got tea from these travelling shops can no longer get tea from such suppliers. They have now to register with traders who have not got tea to supply them as they were not previously customers of these traders.  All these cases are being dealt with and additional supplies are being arranged for these traders as quickly as inspectors can get round to them.  While I do not want to say that all anomalies and <Col N="1299" /> difficulties have yet been smoothed out, a very large number of them have been smoothed out and special individual difficulties which arose in some districts or in the case of some traders or some individual consumers have been got rid of.  We have all come against the case of the individual who is finding it difficult to get any trader to accept his registration.</P>
    <P>There may have been a reason for that.  Not everybody pays for his supplies as promptly as the trader would like, and when a trader has to pick and choose between those who want to register with him, he naturally picks those who are likely to pay rather than those who may be doubtful. These cases are obviously hard to deal with.  We have power, and have used the power, given us in the order to require a trader to register a particular named customer.  It is not a power that should be widely used, but it has been used in particular cases. By the use of these powers, or more generally by the use of persuasive methods, various difficulties that have arisen for individuals and traders have been got rid of.  So much for tea.</P>
    <P>The motion refers also to cocoa and coffee and to substitutes for these beverages.  Perhaps the Dáil might be interested to know what the position is in regard to these commodities. In the days before the war our supplies of cocoa were made entirely by the home manufacturers. There were no imports of cocoa.  For the purpose of manufacturing cocoa, the principal raw material was cocoa beans.  About 2,400 tons of cocoa beans were normally imported annually into this country.  Again, as in the case of tea, they were imported through British brokers.  Early in this year the British Government prohibited the export of cocoa beans to this country and also refused to give facilities for the transhipment of cocoa beans at British ports.  At the same time an embargo was placed on the export of manufactured cocoa.  The result was that manufacturers in this country had to rely upon the stocks of cocoa beans which they then held, and as these stocks would only last for a very short period, the immediate result was a <Col N="1300" /> scarcity of cocoa, a scarcity which coincided with the introduction of rationing for tea and, consequently, occurred at a time when cocoa was in exceptional demand.</P>
    <P>We had to provide for some form of control over the distribution of cocoa. We could not introduce a rationing scheme; there was not enough cocoa to give a ration to everybody as in the case of tea.  We had to make an order limiting the amount which any household could procure to a quarter of a pound a week.  There was not sufficient to give a quarter of a pound a week to every householder, and the whole purpose of the order was to ensure that nobody would get any more than a quarter of a pound a week.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we recognised that there was not enough to provide each household with a ¼ lb. a week.  As Deputies are aware, cocoa is made up in packets, and it is not possible to distribute it otherwise than in packets as a proportion of a lb.  We then got in touch with the cocoa manufacturers with a view to arranging for the purchase of cocoa beans abroad for direct shipment to this country.  The manufacturers made these arrangements and up to date they have brought 1,650 tons of cocoa beans into this country.  These stocks were purchased by the manufacturers in the countries of origin and were shipped here by Irish Shipping, Ltd.  These imports, with the stocks already in hand, meant more than a year's normal requirements, and consequently although the restriction on the amount that may be given to individual households is still being maintained, it has been found possible to remove the restriction which we had previously in operation on the output of manufacturers. The manufacturers are now allowed to produce more cocoa and, consequently, the position in respect to supplies to traders is becoming easier. In fact, deliveries by the manufacturers are now on the basis of 100 per cent. normal output.  I want it to be understood, however, that the normal output is, nevertheless, small in relation to the number of households in the country, and it does not permit of any modification of the restriction of the <Col N="1301" /> quantity which each household can buy in a week.</P>
    <P>In the case of coffee, our supplies of coffee, which normally amounted to about 300 tons per year, were also purchased from British brokers.  Again, when in the early part of this year the export of coffee beans from Great Britain to this country was prohibited by the British Government, we decided that special facilities for the importation of coffee beans should be given, and coffee importers were encouraged to purchase coffee beans on the understanding that we would endeavour to arrange shipping facilities for them. In fact importers have purchased more than two years' normal requirements of beans, but we have not yet succeeded in bringing all that quantity of coffee beans into this country.  It is, however, expected that some part of that supply will begin to arrive in the next few months.  When it all comes in it will mean that there will be available more than two years' normal supply of coffee.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to coffee substitutes.  Most of the coffee substitutes on sale have been produced from barley.  We have made allocations of barley to the manufacturers of substitutes up to the present.  It may be necessary to place some restrictions upon the quantity of barley made available for that purpose in present circumstances. But, so long as there is a demand for those substitutes, we will endeavour, if possible, to facilitate further production.  The demand has cased naturally enough since the increase in the tea ration.  But I know that a number of those substitutes are quite palatable and have secured public favour, and, while we must ensure that the supplies of barley for more essential purposes, including the manufacture of beer, are made available, nevertheless we will endeavour to keep the production of those substitutes going.</P>
    <P>Now, that is the fullest statement of the position of the supply and distribution of those beverages which can be made.  I do not think that a committee such as is suggested in this motion can add to the information I have given <Col N="1302" /> to the House.  No doubt they could investigate methods of distribution and deal with individual grievances.  But I doubt very much if it is desirable that Committees of the Dáil should interfere in matters of that kind.  I think, as a practice, it is much more desirable that the responsibility should be put on the individual Minister and that he should be made answerable to the Dáil for decisions.  The administration of public affairs by Dáil Committees is not a desirable practice and, consequently, I have considered it desirable to oppose all motions of this kind that have come before the House, while at the same time indicating a willingness to give to the House the fullest possible information available on any occasion that it requires it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, in relation to those commodities, or any other commodities, there has been any reluctance to tell the House what the supply position is once distribution has been taken under control.  The only time I have found it desirable not to make the fullest information available was when the control over distribution had not become fully operative, and it was felt that a statement to the public revealing the position might promote panic buying and disorganise distribution arrangements. When control has been established, and when distribution cannot be upset by any panic or uneasiness amongst the public, then it has been my policy and the policy of the Government at all times to give the fullest information desired by the House.  I am prepared to undertake in relation to those commodities&mdash;tea, cocoa and coffee&mdash;that I will be only too glad to inform the House as to the position and as to changes in the position which may arise at any time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>In view of the Minister's optimistic speech, I can only say that I hope his optimism will be justified; that the tea will arrive safely here, and that the allocation of tea to our people can be increased.  I do not intend to divide the House on the motion, but I want the Minister to understand that there are still a number of people who cannot get their supplies of tea.  In the early part of the discussion the question <Col N="1303" /> of distribution was ruled out, but the Ceann Comhairle afterwards said that he would allow it to be discussed. I have here a letter, dated 4th December, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the 30th August, my grocer, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, returned my tea card to me as he could not get sufficient tea for all.  He said that the Minister for Supplies could not let him have sufficient, as he was not in business in 1939.  Until that time he had been giving me sugar with the tea.  I went to another grocer and he took my tea card, but could not register me for sugar.  I went back to my grocer and asked him to register me for sugar only, but he could not, although he had supplied me for six months up to and including that date, the 30th August.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That letter was handed to me by another Deputy.  I have heard complaints of unequal distribution by wholesalers to retailers, who at times get into trouble with their customers if they are not able to give them their full ration of tea.  The ounce of tea only goes half way, if it does go half way, to satisfy the requirements of the people.  I have often thought, and <Col N="1304" /> others have thought the same in connection with our supplies of tea that, as we had a plentiful supply of other goods for export, such as beef, bacon, butter, eggs and beer, we had a right to demand some form of exchange from the British Government.  In that way we might exchange bacon or beef for tea.  If there were commodities of which the British had an extra supply and of which we were short, and if we had a plentiful supply of commodities of which they were short, we might have an exchange of those commodities instead of taking their paper money for what we supply to them.  It is a matter that ought to be considered by the Government.  As I have said, I do not intend to divide the House on the motion, but I earnestly trust that the Minister's hopes will be fully realised, that the tea which is now coming from foreign countries will arrive safely here and that our people will get an increased ration.  We cannot hope for the full pre-war supply, but we do earnestly hope that an increase will be given, if possible, at a very early date.</P>
