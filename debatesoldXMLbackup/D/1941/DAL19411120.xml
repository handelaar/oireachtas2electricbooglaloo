      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is yet in a position to state the result of his Department's efforts to secure the repatriation of seamen Thomas Dixon, Patrick O'Neill, Bernard Goulding, Christopher Deering, Thomas Phelan, Thomas Cadogan, and two others&mdash;all citizens of Ireland, whose ship was blown up in the battle of Narvik, and who have been interned in neutral Sweden since July, 1940.</P>

      <P>My information does not bear out the suggestion that these men are interned.  They entered Sweden when the merchant ships on which they were serving were sunk in Narvik Harbour, and the reports I have received speak of their kindly reception by the Swedish authorities.</P>
      <P>The difficulty about the repatriation of these men is one of finding a suitable route and means of transport. The efforts which we have been making to arrange their transport back to Ireland have not yet yielded a result, but efforts are still being continued.</P>

      <P>The rate at which claims in respect of injuries, whether to property <Col N="844" /> or the person, arising out of bombing incidents can be brought to the payment stage depends on two factors: (a) the promptness with which the claims are lodged, and (b) the rate at which they can be investigated Departmentally.  So far as the second factor is concerned, all possible steps are being taken to ensure that there will be no avoidable delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has caused any claim for compensation to be made against any Government in respect of (a) deaths; (b) personal injuries; (c) damage to property; (d) other damage, caused by bombings in the City of Dublin, and, if so, if he will state in the case of each such bombing (1) to what Government the claim has been addressed; (2) the date of its presentation; (3) the amount of the claim under each class of damage, and (4) what the result of the claim has been.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to bombings in the City of Dublin.  The first of these incidents occurred in January last when bombs fell in Terenure and on the South Circular Road on two successive nights, and the second occurred in May, when bombs were dropped in the North Strand and Phoenix Park areas. In each case a protest and claim for compensation was made to the German Government.  An expression of regret and acceptance of responsibility has been received in respect of the May bombing, but the other incident is still under discussion.  The details of the claim for compensation in respect of the May incident have not yet been furnished to the German Government, as full particulars are not available of the deaths, personal injuries, damage to property and other damage caused. These particulars can only become available as individual claims for compensation are received in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government has yet found time to consider the report of the Arterial Drainage Commission, and, if so, what has been the outcome, if any, of that consideration; whether any advance has been made in dealing with the problem presented by the Brick and Cashen; what steps, if any, have been taken to implement the recommendations of the commission in respect of these two rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy was informed in reply to a question on the 25th June last, the report of the Drainage Commission has been considered by the Government.  As a result of that consideration the Government have decided to adopt in principle the recommendations of the commission in regard to the setting up of a central drainage authority, with the functions indicated in the commission's report, the carrying out of a comprehensive scheme of arterial drainage and the <Col N="846" /> treatment of the cost of future drainage construction works as a national charge.  The framing of the heads of the necessary legislation has been put in hands.</P>
      <P>As regards the Brick-Cashen, a survey of this area was made about 1926 from which it is clear that the district is unsuitable for operations under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, and it would, therefore, be necessary to await the further legislation now contemplated before any progress can be made.  At the moment, records of river discharges, tidal levels, and rainfall, in the area are being collected; but a thorough engineering survey in much greater detail than that previously carried out will be required before any works can be undertaken, or, indeed, before a sound opinion can be formed as to the feasibility of dealing in any satisfactory manner with the outfall problem, which is particularly difficult in this district.  I am aware that the Drainage Commission mentioned the district specially as one of two areas for which priority of treatment is recommended, but I think it proper to say that the engineering difficulties inherent in the scheme give rise to grave doubt as to whether it would be desirable to select it for the initiation of a new drainage programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the recent extensive damage done in the areas in North Kerry which are connected with the Cashen, and is he also aware that even still more extensive damage was escaped only because the recent floods did not coincide with the spring tide?  In view of the amount of loss now suffered, does he not think it well to revise the opinion already put forward by the Government that even preventive works cannot be undertaken before the whole scheme is thoroughly examined for final adoption; and whether it is not in the long run cheaper to go in for these preventive works, even partial works, now than to allow things to get worse and the cost to mount season by season?  Am I right, finally, in assuming from the Minister's statement that in ordinary words this <Col N="847" /> Brick and Cashen scheme that was approved of by different Departments several years ago is now to be put on the long finger, and that in this particular respect the report of the Drainage Commission, appointed by the Government, is being simply put on the shelf?  Does the Minister not recognise what despair it must cause to the sufferers there when they read the Minister's answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first part of the Deputy's assumption is correct.  His second assumption is not correct.  The report is not being put on the shelf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will excuse me, I did not say that the report was being put on the shelf, but only that portion dealing with priority for this area.  I said that the Brick and Cashen portion of it was being put on the long finger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that every season that passes increases the cost, and does he not recognise that this year furnishes him with an outstanding example of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this is a very difficult engineering problem.  My information is that tinkering with it will be of no help. If tackled at all, it will have to be done in a big way.  There is no legislation at present to enable the problem to be tackled in that big way.  At present a Bill is being drafted, and orders have been given to speed the drafting of it with a view to dealing with this and other problems when the legislation is completed.</P>

      <P>May I point out to the Minister that what I suggested was preventive work?  May I put this point to him, since he speaks of the absence of legislation, that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has to deal with unemployment on the one hand and with drainage on the other?  Could he not bring the two lobes of the Parliamentary Secretary's brain together and combine them to deal with this particular problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the cost per ton on the bog of the turf produced during the 1941 season at Clonsast, the cost of the haulage per ton of such turf from the bog to the railhead at Portarlington, the cost per ton of its <Col N="849" /> transport by rail from Portlaoighise to Dublin; (b) the cost per ton of transporting turf by road from Clonsast to Dublin, and (c) the total quantities of Clonsast turf carried by (1) rail, and (2) road to Dublin up to October 31st, 1941.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Turf is produced at Clonsast by the Turf Development Board, Ltd., and sold by them on a commercial basis.  The cost of haulage and rail transport is the subject of a business arrangement between the parties concerned. Generally, the question relates to administrative matters within the competence of the Turf Development Board, and in this regard I would refer the Deputy to the replies made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to questions on such matters asked by him on 16th June, 1936, and 9th February, 1939.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the Turf Development Board is now under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary, and is he refusing to give this information simply because he cannot stand over the retail price of turf at 64/- per ton?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state the position regarding the supply and price to consumers of all kinds of fuel: turf per dozen sods, wood blocks per stone, <Col N="850" /> briquettes per stone or sack, coal blocks per dozen, coal per bag, and if arrangements will be made to distribute a sufficient supply to small consumers through the bellmen and other suppliers of small quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of coal when sold retail in the County Borough of Dublin in a quantity less than ten stone in weight by bellmen or hucksters has been fixed by an order made by me at a price not to exceed a rate of 5½d. per stone. I have also made orders fixing the maximum prices at which turf may be sold retail at a price calculated at the rate of 64/- per ton and this commodity may only be sold by weight.  The maximum price fixed for wood blocks, not exceeding ten inches in length or diameter, in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire is a price calculated at the rate of 60/- per ton delivered to consumers. If the dimensions are greater than the foregoing the maximum price is at the rate of 56/- per ton.</P>
      <P>The prices charged for briquettes and coal blocks are at present the subject of investigation in my Department and if it should be found necessary, price orders will be made fixing maximum prices for these classes of fuel.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any instances where prices in excess of those fixed by order have been charged, I will have them investigated immediately if he will let me have the particulars, and legal proceedings will be instituted if the evidence warrants such proceedings.</P>
      <P>There is no restriction on the purchase of fuel by small consumers, that is, persons who purchase in quantities of two stones of coal or less, or four stones of turf.  Quantities of coal are made available to the bellmen and hucksters who serve such consumers at a lower cost than the normal rate charged by merchants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, the Minister did not fully answer the last portion of the question.  May I ask when will he allow sufficient coal <Col N="851" /> or fuel of some kind to be released to enable bellmen and hucksters to have supplies for people who buy in small lots at 6d. and 1/-?  There are some areas in the city where a bellman has not been seen for over a month.  I would suggest to the Minister the advisability of making further inquiries to find out if the emergency is not here already, and to see that those people who have fireless grates will be enabled to get supplies.  There is no use in telling me that coal is available at £3 a ton.  They want coal in one-stone lots and seven-stone lots.  The prices read out by the Minister are not being complied with by those selling coal.  May I ask him to put an advertisement in the newspapers setting out the price of coal per stone and of turf per dozen sods, so that the poorer type of purchaser will be protected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the small consumer who bought a stone of coal for 6d. or 7d. was never registered, and is not registered to-day? That person bought coal casually when a man passed his door if he had 6d. to spare to buy it.  I suggest to the Minister that it is necessary for him to take immediate steps to protect those people who, within the last few weeks, have been without a fire.  They have not been able to get any kind of fuel for their fireless grates.  The bellmen and the hucksters are getting a delivery of fuel, but they are not getting sufficient.</P>

It is true that they are not getting sufficient to give unlimited supplies to everybody, but they are getting their full share of the available supplies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether, in view of the danger of an acute fuel shortage in Dublin, he has any proposals with regard to the great amount of standing timber, valuable only for firewood, on river banks, canal banks and other such places in the vicinity of Dublin; and if he will consider arrangements to allow the unemployed to cut and take away this timber for fuel.</P>

      <P>No survey has ever been made of the quantities of standing timber available on river and canal banks and other such places in the vicinity of Dublin, but it is known that much of it consists of poplar which is not suitable for firewood.  Provided that agreement can be reached with the owners of such timber and that the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1928, and of the Emergency Powers (Control of Timber) Order, 1941, relating to the grant of felling licences and purchase permits, are observed, there is no restriction on the cutting and conversion of this timber for fuel by a local authority under the Emergency Powers (No. 108) Order, 1941, or by any one in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will say whether he has issued instructions to the Great Southern Railways Company regarding the priority to be afforded as from the 19th instant to various classes of traffic passing over their system, and, if so, whether he will state the authority under which such instructions were issued and the reasons which induced him to issue them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In exercise of powers conferred by Article 32 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939 (S.R. &amp; O. No. 224 of 1939), I have given directions to the Great Southern Railways Company as from 19th instant regarding the utilisation of that company's carrying capacity, including the carriage in priority of certain classes of traffics. Under normal conditions, the company are under an obligation as a carrier to accept and forward, without discrimination as between areas or persons, all traffic of any description which they hold themselves out to carry.  Owing to the abnormal demands of certain essential traffics, particularly grain, fuel, sugar beet, sugar, beet pulp and live stock, and the delays occasioned by inferior quality coal, it is considered necessary to place the company in a position to deal fully and promptly with these essential traffics even to the possible exclusion of other traffics.  I am of opinion, however, that if subparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 3 of the order, which relate to the more rapid loading and discharge of wagons and lorries, are effectively carried out, the priority accorded in sub-paragraph (d) may not, in present circumstances, <Col N="856" /> appreciably affect or delay non-priority traffics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, before issuing instructions to the Great Southern Railways Company regarding the priority to be afforded to nonperishable traffic, e.g., cattle for export, coal, cut timber, etc., over highly perishable passenger - rated traffic, e.g., fish, fresh meat and milk, he consulted with any representative bodies, or persons with specialised knowledge of transport problems and, if so, whether he will state the names of the organisations and persons so consulted; whether he has inquired if the railway company in giving effect to his instructions would be acting contrary to law and, further, whether he is aware that the effect of implementing the instructions will be deleterious in the case of highly perishable traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 3 of the order to which the Deputy refers retains the services for passenger-rated traffic by rail and road as they are to-day.  The great bulk of the highly perishable traffic is carried by passenger train and so is unaffected by the order.  The priority list applies only to commodities carried by merchandise trains and road vehicles.  The determination of priorities has been, and will continue to be, so long as it is necessary, the subject of consultation between the Government Departments concerned.  The interests of perishable traffic, in particular, are dealt with by the Department of Agriculture, which is in a position, with its intimate knowledge of the normal course of this trade, to advise on what is necessary.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggestion that the railways company, in giving effect to these directions, would be acting contrary to law, I would refer the Deputy to Section 10 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that there is a likelihood of many thousands of our citizens returning to this country from Great Britain in the near future; whether he is aware that the people in question have been engaged in insurable employment in Great Britain and contributed to the unemployment insurance funds in that country; whether in the event of their being unemployed on their return to this country he can say if any steps have been taken to ensure that by reciprocal arrangements or otherwise, the persons concerned will be entitled to unemployment insurance benefit in this country pending their absorption in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is a likelihood of the return in the near future to this country from Great Britain of any large number of Irish citizens, but I agree that it is probable that many Irish citizens in <Col N="858" /> Great Britain have undertaken work which is insurable under the unemployment insurance legislation of that country.  In the absence of reciprocal arrangements between the two countries in relation to unemployment insurance, persons returning to their homes in this country cannot be paid unemployment benefit out of the Unemployment Fund of this country in respect of contributions paid in Great Britain.  The Government has always been prepared, and more than once endeavoured without success, to enter into arrangements with the Government of Great Britain whereby unemployment benefit could be paid in one country in respect of contributions paid in the other country.  Divergence in unemployment insurance legislation in the two countries renders this matter one of real difficulty, however, and, at the present time, it is highly improbable that any progress will be made on tentative proposals for reciprocity which had been formulated by my Department. I am, however, prepared to renew these proposals if, and when, it appears to me that they are likely to produce satisfactory results.</P>

      <P>This work was partly financed out of the Road Fund.  Owing to decline in revenue, the position of the Road Fund does not admit of the allocation of grants for road improvement works. As long as present conditions last I can see no prospect of allocation from the Road Fund for the resumption of work on the scheme, but I will see how far it may be possible to continue work on a restricted basis with portion of the grant available from the Employments Schemes Vote to supplement the contribution made by the county council.</P>

      <P>Road improvement grants were allocated provisionally as usual last year.  Owing to the acute effect on the revenue of the Road Fund occasioned by the petrol shortage, it became necessary in January last to withhold ratification of all grants in respect of which plans had not already been approved by that date.  The Cork County Council scheme was one of those affected.  In present circumstances I do not see any prospect of reconsidering the position.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the cause of the delay in completing the fencing of a number of cottage plots owned by the Laoighis County Board of Health and situated at Moore Street, Rathdowney, County Leix; when the work commenced; the estimated cost of same; the amount already paid to the contractor concerned; and when the work will be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in completing the fencing of the plots is attributed to difficulties in procuring wire for fencing and gates and to local opposition to the manner of erecting the fencing.  I understand the work is now complete except for a right-of-way which is in dispute.  It is understood that the present contractor commenced work on the 22nd February last.  The estimated cost of the work is £473 8s. and the amount paid is £280.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that applications for plots were submitted to the Laoighis County Council at the beginning of this year by about 40 cottage tenants and others residing in and <Col N="863" /> around Rathdowney, County Laoighis, and if he will state the cause of the delay in providing same.</P>

      <P>No representations were received in my Department in regard to this matter.  Upon inquiries being made recently in the offices of the Commissioner administering the Laoighis Board of Health it was ascertained that in April last a communication was received by him from the Rathdowney Parish Council regarding the provision of plots of land for certain persons in the vicinity of that town, but at that time he considered it too late to acquire the necessary land and formulate a scheme.  A communication is being addressed to the Commissioner in regard to the provision of allotments in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that a large number of cottage tenants and others residing in and around the village of Shinrone, County Offaly, have made repeated unsuccessful applications to the Offaly Board of Health and to the Irish Land Commission for plots or allotments of land; whether the rents payable at present by the cottage tenants to the board of health include the provision of a cottage and plot; whether he is aware that Shinrone is surrounded by hundreds of acres of land used for grazing purposes; and if he will state what action, if any, he proposes taking for the purpose of providing plots for the large number of cottage tenants and others in this area who are anxious to secure and work same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations were received in my Department that there have been repeated unsuccessful applications from the Shinrone Parish Council to the Offaly Board of Health and Public Assistance and the Irish Land Commission for plots or allotments. Inquiries were made recently in the offices of the board of health and it was ascertained that the board communicated last March with the <Col N="864" /> Shinrone Parish Council to submit names of probable applicants for allotments and that the parish council submitted a list of 36 names, but were unable to procure land by agreement. No further action appears to have been taken at the time.</P>
      <P>The rent of a labourer's cottage is fixed in respect of the cottage and plot, if any, let with the cottage.  There is no land attached to the cottages in the village of Shinrone built by the former Roscrea Rural District Council. During the 1914-1918 war that council acquired 17 acres of land for allotments for tenants of cottages in villages which had no land attached.  It appears that these plots were not used by the tenants of the cottages, but were sub-let to other persons.  The land thus acquired was appropriated by the Offaly Board of Health for a housing scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, it is understood the board of health within the last three weeks wrote to parish councils in connection with the proposed provision of land for cultivation in allotments during the coming season.</P>
      <P>The matter is one for the board.  If I am asked to invest them with compulsory powers I shall consider the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will say whether he has since reconsidered the injustice done to certain boys who will be deprived of scholarships from the Intermediate Certificate Examinations, 1941, as a result of the Departmental overruling of the original judgment of the examiner in Greek on his standard of marking, and if he has caused an examination to be made of the number of boys so affected, and will he say how many there are, and if he is now prepared to award extra scholarships, so that this injustice will not be done to these boys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that this question is based on two incorrect assumptions, viz: (a) that there was a Departmental overruling of the original judgment of the Greek examiner, and (b) that an injustice was done to certain candidates as a result.  The Department did not overrule the judgement of the examiner in Greek on his standard of marking; that examiner decided that the original standard was too severe <Col N="866" /> and revised it.  As regards the second assumption, it cannot be admitted that an injustice was done to the boys the Deputy has in mind merely because they were not given the improper advantage which they might have obtained through an unfair treatment of other candidates.  In these circumstances I am not prepared to consider the suggestion contained in the last part of the question.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not realise that immediately the printed pass list, with the revised marks, are available that knowledge will be available to everyone in the country, as well as to the boys concerned?

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state the number of years the 1941 examiner in Greek for the Intermediate Certificate (boys) has been so acting; how many assistant examiners in Greek were there in 1941; how many of these were civil servants; how many years had each of them been acting as assistant examiner; and if he will state whether any instructions had been issued at any time since 1936 to the examiner and the assistant examiners regarding the standard of marking of Greek, and, if so, by whom were these instructions formulated and what was the object of these instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The present advising examiner in Greek has been acting as such for the past eight years.  There were four assistant examiners in 1941, none of whom was a civil servant.  One <Col N="873" /> of these had acted as assistant examiner on five previous occasions; one on four; one on three and the other on one occasion.  Instructions were given in 1937 to the advising examiners in certain subjects, including Greek, that a gradual raising of the standard of marking should be adopted in future at the examinations in these subjects.  The instructions applied to those subjects in which the large percentage of candidates obtaining high marks suggested that the existing standard was too low, and their purpose was to ensure that a higher standard was adopted.  These instructions were given in the usual manner by direction of the Secretary of the Department.</P>
      <P>A general code of instructions is issued each year to all advising and assistant examiners, and the assistant examiners in each subject receive detailed instructions each year from the responsible advising examiner regarding the method of marking the answers to each question on the examination paper.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether each question paper prepared by an examiner is submitted for criticism and approval to competent people before being printed, and whether this was done in the case of the Intermediate Certificate Greek, 1941; whether the examiner is constantly in touch with the assistant examiners, and, if so, if he will state how an incorrect and severe standard could have been adopted in the marking of the Intermediate Certificate Greek this year, and what explanation has been forthcoming of the occurrence of the alleged severe and incorrect standard adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft question papers are submitted for criticism to a small committee&mdash;consisting usually of the inspectors who deal with the particular subjects in the schools, and this procedure was followed in the case of the Greek papers.  The advising examiner, at a conference prior to the marking, indicates to his assistant examiners the standard of marking to be adopted and he keeps in touch with them during the marking.  In the case of Greek the incorrect standard which was adopted was due to an error of judgment on the part of the advising examiner.  He attributes his failure to observe the departure from the general standard of previous years mainly to the fact that the two papers in the subject were marked by different examiners and that he was not aware of the general results as represented by the combined marks of the two papers.  The combining of the marks is not carried out until all the marked answer books are received back in the Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether representations were made to him from some schools in connection with the marking of the Greek paper, Intermediate Certificate Examination, 1941, and whether it was as a result of these representations that the marking was increased by 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state when the system of issuing provisional lists of the Intermediate Certificate Examination marks was introduced; whether the recent increasing of the Greek by 10 per cent. was the first time since the introduction of provisional lists that in relation to any subject a drastic alteration of marks was made by adding a percentage increase all round either before or after the issue of the provisional lists, and, if not, if he will state the year, the subjects, and the nature of such drastic changes and the reasons for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In the years immediately preceding 1931 it was not found possible, owing to the gradual increase in the number of candidates, to have the final results issued, as formerly, by the beginning of September and it was then arranged, after consultation with school authorities, to issue provisional results to the individual schools for <Col N="876" /> their convenience in the formation of classes.  This arrangement came into operation for the first time in 1931. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that in the interval since 1931 the number of candidates at the certificate examinations has increased from 5,821 to 11,361.</P>
      <P>Although it has been found necessary from time to time to revise the marking of individual assistant examiners who had departed from the standard laid down, this is the first occasion since the introduction of provisional lists on which a general revision of marks was made by adding a percentage, either before or after the issue of those lists.  Before the introduction of these lists, however, such general revisions were occasionally made, the most recent being in 1928; the subject on that occasion was mathematics.  When the marks were examined the high percentage of failures and low percentage of honours made it clear that too high a standard had been exacted.  To remedy this all the intermediate certificate marks were increased in a manner similar to that adopted in the present instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not by way of a percentage added to the number of marks: it was by way of a flat rate of marks added to candidates who obtained a certain percentage.  I think the percentage was 25 per cent.  The marks of all candidates who obtained 25 per cent. or more at the original marking were increased by 30 marks, and the marks of the candidates who got less than 25 per cent. were increased by 20 per cent.  The pass standard was then 30 per cent., and the addition of 30 marks to those who had got 25 per cent. raised their marks to the pass standard.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether any re-examination and change of marks took place in the case of girls examined in Greek in the Intermediate Certificate Examination, 1941, similar to the re-examination and <Col N="877" /> change of marks that took place for boys; and, if so, if he will state (1) the number who failed in Greek according to the original marking; (2) the number of these who passed in Greek as a result of the increasing of the marks; and (3) the number who would have failed in the general examination as a result of the original Greek marking, but who passed in the general examination as a result of the revised Greek marking.</P>

      <P>Only two girl candidates presented themselves for Greek at the Intermediate Certificate Examination and their marks were revised as in the case of the boys.  One candidate passed in the subject, the other failed, and there was no change in that position as a result of the revision, nor was there any change in the general result of either candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Gárda Síochána Pensions (No. 2) Order, 1941, made on the 14th day of November, 1941, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 17th day of November, 1941.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that last June a retirement order was made. Following that, a pensions order had to be approved by both Houses.  After all that had been done, representations were made to me that the pensions order did not make sufficient provision for some of the people who were being retired.  I undertook to have the matter reconsidered by the Government and the result is that we have brought in a new pensions order which will make it possible for the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to add years, to a maximum of six, in the case of any officers in respect to whom it is decided to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another side to it.  There is no case before us now, but if it does happen that some officer or member of the Gárda is retired under this order and we do not feel justified in giving him the added years, or even giving him the period ordinarily given to a man retiring because of incapacity, <Col N="890" /> power is being taken in this order to reduce the period, and there is here also a maximum of six years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that representations were made.  I was so much influenced that I thought there was a good case and the Government agreed there was a case to be made for added years in the case of those who were compulsorily retired. There is another thing done here.  In view of the circumstances under which these officers were retired, it was rather embarrassing for the Commissioner to have to give the usual certificate&mdash;that is, the certificate that is given to a person who is retired before he comes to the pension period.  When this is passed the usual certificate will not be necessary.  That is dealt with in Article 7 (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has met those cases fairly.  There is a second part of the order which deals with men retired by reason of a medical certificate&mdash;that is, through ill-health.  So far as I can judge from the terms of the order, a pension might be as low as 20/-, if not lower, and not in excess of 25/-; that is, so far as those men are concerned.  I do not think that, on reflection, the Minister will agree that that is a fair sum.  These men were recruited in perfect health.  By reason of the circumstances of the period in which they were recruited, or the exceptional duties they were <Col N="891" /> called upon to perform at a particular time, their duties may have had an effect on their health. In these circumstances, perhaps the Minister will review, within the next few months, the section dealing with that particular aspect. The reconsideration that would be involved would not be an expensive matter, but it is obviously desirable that in the case of a body of men such as the Gárda Síochána, who have given such very good service, they should be assured that in a matter of that kind the Minister was more than conscious of their services and more than anxious to treat them fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be rather strange language used in Section 7 of this order.  The Minister talks about reckoning approved service for the purpose of a pension.  One would imagine that &ldquo;approved service&rdquo; would mean the type of service which would be approved as pensionable service: in other words, service of a character and quality that might be reckoned for pension purposes, and one can quite understand that the Minister might desire to add on some years to that type of service. Strangely enough, however, in paragraph (c) of Section 7, the Minister is taking power to diminish the approved service.  These seem to me to be contradictory terms.  I should imagine that &ldquo;approved service&rdquo; would be service that would carry some kind of hallmark from the Department as service of the type qualifying for a pension; yet, in paragraph (c), when the Minister takes power to increase the approved service qualifying for a higher rate of pension, he also takes power to diminish the approved service. How can you diminish approved service in that respect?  One can understand diminishing service, as in the case of the ordinary Civil Service Superannuation Acts, for demerits and so on, but one never heard of diminishing approved service.  How did the Minister get &ldquo;approved service&rdquo; and the diminution of that approved service linked up together for the purpose of this order?  I think <Col N="892" /> the Minister is unwise to equip himself with this order.  If the person concerned has got approved service, then he ought to get a pension based on that approved service.  If, on the other hand, the service rendered has been of such kind that it merits dismissal, then there ought to be dismissal; but it seems to me that the idea of putting in a provision for the diminution of approved service is a very unusual provision in an order of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has power all the time to deal with any case where a member of the Gárda Síochána has misconducted himself in any particular manner, but I think the Minister ought not to claim the right to diminish approved service if by &ldquo;approved service&rdquo; we mean the type of service which normally carries Departmental approval and is normally reckoned for pension purposes.  I gathered, from the Minister's reply to a question by Deputy Keyes to-day, that eight officers of the Gárda. Síochána have been retired under the Retirement Regulations and that no ordinary Guards have been retired and no non-commissioned officers.  I suppose we may borrow the Minister's own phrase and say that any of the latter who have gone have been &ldquo;fired&rdquo; without any pension, but there seems to be a rather amazing differentiation there.  The officer&mdash;the superintendent or the chief superintendent&mdash;from whom one would expect a very high standard of conduct, but who is considered not capable of discharging what is expected of him, is retired on pension, whereas the ordinary Guard or non-commissioned officer gets no pension and is simply &ldquo;fired&rdquo; without pension.  How does the Minister justify that?  I tried to get from the Minister, by Parliamentary question on some other day, the number of these persons who have retired, but I should like to know the reason for putting an ordinary member of the Gárda Síochána out of the force without pension while giving a pension to a high officer.  I object to that kind of differentiation, and I say that the ordinary member of the Gárda Síochána is entitled to at least as fair <Col N="893" /> a crack of the whip as the higher officers are getting.</P>
    <P>This order produces rather amazing anomalies, one of which was mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave.  For instance, if a member of the Gárda Síochána, in the diligent performance of his duty, manages to impair his health and is retired on medical grounds, in that case only the actual number of years he has served will count for service pension purposes, but if he goes on a prolonged spree and, as a result, his health becomes impaired, then he goes out, with power, in the Minister's hand, to add six years to his service.  How can you add six years on to a man's service if his physical disability has been brought about by a kind of permanent spree when, on the other hand, the Guard who conscientiously and diligently performs his duty and is retired on medical grounds will get no added service at all?  The Minister ought to consider the question of a particular person who is retired on medical grounds and whose disability is due to a genuine medical disqualification.</P>
    <P>The case made for the removal of these eight people, and the case that, presumably, may be made for the retirement of anybody else under the Retirement Regulations, will be that the efficiency of the force will be best served by their retirement.  That is not a very high type of certificate to give people on retirement, and yet the Minister takes power to increase their service for pension purposes by a maximum of six years.  If a Guard, who has a wife and family, is compelled to retire on medical grounds, why should the Minister not equip himself with powers to add the years of service in such a case?  In many cases, the ill-health of the Guard concerned might be due to an excess of efficiency rather than to any inefficiency, and I think that in the case of the retirement of a Guard on such grounds he should be treated not less well than in the case of a person who has been removed from the Gárda Síochána in the interests of its efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This just goes to show that once you open a door you do not <Col N="894" /> know where it will lead to.  The door was opened widely, and, I think, unwisely, in this matter already, and now we see what it is leading to.  We are told that it would be embarrassing to the Commissioner to give the usual certificate in regard to the elimination of these men, but where is this thing going to lead us in the finish?  Is it going to lead to the point that any individual member of the Gárda Síochána, now serving in the force, can look forward to this: that instead of being &ldquo;fired,&rdquo; if he does go on what Deputy Norton describes as a prolonged spree, he will be pensioned instead of being fired out without a pension?  That is what the open door is leading to, and I suggest to the Minister, before it is too late, that the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána would be best served by the withdrawal of this order and the one that preceded it. I suggest that to the Minister as the wisest course.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave talks of men who have lost their health.  This country is filled with men&mdash;you meet them every day in the week in the streets of Dublin and in every other constituency of this State&mdash;whose health has broken down as a result of services, far better than were ever rendered by any member of the Gárda Síochána, in other and more dangerous days, and very little thought or consideration was given to their health in that matter.  I, for one, have a very decided objection to seeing large pensions given to men who, in the words of Deputy Norton, went on prolonged sprees.</P>

      <P>Not only are they getting a pension but they are to have years added to their service for pension purposes. I remember a poor unfortunate man in Cork who had 33 years' service as a messenger to the county council, and the Minister for Local Government at the time refused him a pension. Although he had 33 years' faithful <Col N="895" /> service, without any year added to it, the unfortunate man had to come into the High Courts to get a pension. Is there to be one law for one class of the community in this country and another law for another?  That is the question we have to ask ourselves.  I, for one, have a very decided objection to this.  I thought it was bad enough in the first place when we decided that those inefficient men were to get anything, but it is worse when the Minister wants to add six years to their service for bad conduct&mdash;not good conduct, surely?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you will allow me to clear up that misunderstanding. I was talking about an objective case. The case I made was that, under this order, a man who goes on a prolonged spree and impairs his health will be retired on pension, and the Minister has power to add six years to his service; whereas if, by diligent service, a man impairs his health, he will be retired and no year will be added to his service.  I pleaded with the Minister to treat the man whose diligent service brought about ill-health no less favourably than the man whose want of diligent <Col N="896" /> service probably brought about illness.  It is purely an objective case, and has no relation whatever to the persons being retired.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry seems to know far more about it than I do, or than the House does, or than the Minister for Justice does.  The Minister has said that he never made that case.  I should like to add my voice to that of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Norton with regard to those persons who are forced to retire because of ill-health. I know of at least one case of a sergeant who has been in the Gárda Síochána, I think, from its very foundation about 1922 or 1923.  His health has now broken down, and I understand that he has to go on a pension of about 25/- a week.  He is a married man with four or five children, and after 18 or 19 years' service he is now faced with being thrown out on a pension of 25/-.  When this order was being framed.  I think the Minister should not have deprived himself of the power to deal with cases of that kind.  I cannot understand why the Minister should have withheld from himself power to deal with particular cases of retirement through ill-health when they arise.  I support the order from the point of view of adding six years to the service of those who are removed, but I wish the Minister would reconsider his decision to withhold from himself power to deal similarly with those men who are forced to retire because of ill-health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>I believe the present Minister for Justice is a very fair-minded man, and I would be prepared to leave in his hands the decision as to what treatment should be received by people who were being retired from the Guards, but I am sure the Minister will admit that he is not all powerful <Col N="897" /> in matters of this kind, and he is not taking all the power he might take to deal with cases other than those of high officers of the Guards who are retired for one reason or another.  I do not like to give power to the present Minister, or to any other Minister, to diminish a pension, without at least getting from the Minister or his advisers the kind of case on which they base that claim.  What is the kind of case the Minister has in mind for diminishing a pension?  Some case has been put up to the Minister for the purpose of persuading him that he should take those powers, in consultation, of course, with the Minister for Finance.  We have a fairly good idea of what the Ministry of Finance are in cases of this kind.  Apart from that altogether, I do not think the Minister for Justice could satisfy himself that there are good grounds for giving added service to officers of the Guards who have been retired in the public interest, and refusing any consideration to those below the rank of inspector.  I am certain that many men in the Guards from the rank of inspector down have been fired without getting any pension or any consideration, for reasons that might not be any worse, at any rate, than the reasons why those eight officers are being retired, and not alone given pensions under the ordinary regulations, but given added service as well. I do not think the Minister for Justice will stand up here in the House and say that he is clear in his own conscience that that is a sound proposal, or that he can justify it.  It is not in the interests of the Gárdaí as a whole to defend that kind of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry has been very hard upon the Minister and upon everybody concerned in this matter, but Deputy Corry has already voted in this House for retiring certain officers in the public interest, and promising them pensions from a certain period.  Apparently, he is arguing only about the question as to how much they should get.  Is it possible for the Minister to take back this order at this stage, and go very carefully into the consequences of making a claim in this House for power to diminish a pension, and refusing up <Col N="898" /> to now, at any rate, to give to officers and members of the Guards who have been retired on medical grounds the same consideration as he is giving under the terms of this order to officers who are retired in the public interest? I do not know whether the Minister has given the matter that careful consideration which it deserves.  I would appeal to him to take back the order, if it is possible, and reconsider the points which have been so very well put by Deputies Cosgrave, Norton and Lynch.</P>

      <P>While I am in favour of this order, I think the circumstances under which it has been introduced call for some explanation.  There is, I feel, a danger that Gárdaí might perhaps be thrown out of their jobs in future without any consideration whatever. There may be some reason for dispensing with the services of certain Gárdaí, but surely there is in the Gárda Síochána some disciplinary code to deal with Gárdaí and officers who are not doing their duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, Sir.  I am pointing out that within the regulations governing the Gárda Síochána, there was surely some disciplinary code for dealing with both officers and men.  Before the House at the moment, there is the question of a retiring allowance for a number of officers who have gone out.  I do not <Col N="899" /> disagree with the allowance given to those officers, but I am surprised that the Minister for Justice and whoever is responsible, should have come to this House to retire these officers.  Surely there was, as there is in every other country, some other way of dealing with officers who were unsatisfactory?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, I shall support the Minister on this question of providing a pension for these men because he really has no other option. If he gave them a greater pension, it would be merely in consonance with the action which he induced this House to take in this matter already, an action that as I say should have been carried out through the disciplinary code of the Gárda.  I disagree entirely with Deputy Corry that men who are medically unfit should be retired from the Gárda without pension, even though medical grounds may sometimes be used as a cloak for somebody who has gone on a spree, as Deputy Davin stated.  In my opinion any man who is compelled to leave the Gárda on medical grounds, from the rank of Gárda up to the rank of Commissioner, should be treated in the same way as the officers who are being retired under this Bill.  Take the case of a man who has 16 or 18 years' service in the Gárda and who has given good and efficient service.  There is nothing on the file against him in a disciplinary way but his health becomes impaired. Why should he be retired without some form of allowance?  The Guards have passed through a fairly anxious and serious time since the days when the force was first formed, and I think they are entitled to the best treatment we can give them.  I know myself of cases where Gárdaí through no fault of their own fell into bad health. <Col N="900" /> Some of them were married and had families.  There was nothing against them of a disciplinary measure.  Why should these men be fired out of the force without any pension?  Is it to make room for somebody else whom Deputy Corry would like to put into the force?  There is no reason why a decent Gárda should not be treated in the same way as the officers of the force.</P>
      <P>As regards the power of the Minister to add a certain number of years' service for pensions purposes, I agree that that power exists in all Departments, but I think that the Minister should not have power, if a man has given efficient service, to diminish his years of service.  In fact, I think that in any circumstances that is not a power that the Minister should reserve to himself.  If there are men who are not giving good service, the right of diminishing their service should be left to the Commissioner or to some other superior officer.  We all agree that the Minister should have the power to add years of service, but he should not take the right to diminish years of service. That should be left to somebody within the force dealing with disciplinary matters.  I hope that an occasion when this House will have to deal with the dismissal of Gárdaí, either officers or men, will never arise again.  That is a matter that should be left to some body within the force which has had special powers conferred on it to deal with such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in the interests of the loyal service amongst the rank and file of the Gárda this order should be amended.  Listening to the Minister, it would appear that a man who is compelled to retire, and who has served the public interest, will get less than a man who has not served the public interest and who is also compelled to retire.  I think that is likely to cause grave dissatisfaction amongst the Gárda as a body, and that it is hardly fair to the Gárda.  I think we shall all have to admit that, having regard to the disturbed period through which the country has passed in recent years, the Gárda is as fine a force as any country could have.  I have in <Col N="901" /> mind the case of a man who gave 17 years' service in the Gárda.  I understand that he was a very good member of the force, but he broke certain regulations, and he has now been sacked from the force without any pension. Having regard to the fact that the officers who have been compelled to resign have been given pensions, I think that the treatment meted out to other members of the force who were compelled to resign for other reasons is not likely to make for loyalty amongst the Gárda generally.  I think the Minister ought to look into this matter again.  As to the points made by Deputy Corry, I think Deputy Corry has as good a knowledge of the people of this country as anybody else, but I should like to remind him that certain remarks made in this House on a previous occasion gave rise to grave dissatisfaction amongst members of the Gárda.  It is only fair to say, taking into consideration the stirring times through which they have passed, that 99 per cent of the Gárdaí are as fine a body of men as could be found in any country in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is really this, I think, that what is causing all the trouble is the fact that people who are being retired under the order will get the benefits, and that people who are retired in the ordinary disciplinary way will not.  I think that is the cause of the trouble.  I am aware of the case that Deputy Hickey has referred to.</P>
      <P>I have some experience of the man in question over a fairly long period, and I entirely agree with Deputy Hickey's point of view, that the order, even as applying to senior officers, should be equally applied to Guards who had long service.  If this were a country in the happy position of having a continuing police force for 200 or 300 years, I would certainly oppose an order of this nature.  But it is perfectly obvious that men went into this force 18 or 19 years ago without the training they normally would have got when entering a police force in any country that had its own Government for a number of years.  There were men put into the position of Guards, sergeants and higher officers who had not the necessary training and background. They gave the best service they could according to their ability. With the development and growth of the police force and the tightening of regulations, these men were not as efficient as they would have been if they had gone through the ordinary training they would have received in a normal police force in any country in the world.  I think that applies to the rank and file as well as to the senior officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a number of the men who have been dismissed or who may be dismissed in future and who have had long service, it is entirely unfair to say, if a man's service was good <Col N="903" /> enough for this country for 17 or 18 years and if he is to be dismissed now, that he is to get no pension.  If he was kept on for 17 or 18 years, the people in charge who kept him on were doing a wrong to the country; but if he gave the service he should get a pension for that period.  I do not believe that Deputy Corry's attitude is any more than an attempt to create a sort of feeling in the country to justify the type of mind that thinks it is a good thing that any Gárda officer or any Army officer should be sacked.</P>
    <P>There is a type of mind which wants to see any man sacked who has in his hands the carrying out of law and order in this country, no matter under what Government.  That is the mentality of the type of person Deputy Corry referred to.  I think if a Guard, who has been in the service for 17 or 18 years, was not efficient for that period he should have been sacked long ago, and that if he has served 17 years he is entitled to a pension for that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the question of diminishing is concerned, it merely amounts to this, that the Minister is doing something which he ought not to do himself.  If the Minister is satisfied that a Gárda officer should be dismissed under circumstances in which his pension should be diminished, the only answer to that is that the man should have been sacked long ago.  It may not be the Minister's fault, but it is the fault of this man's superior officers.  What I would like is&mdash;and it cannot be a precedent, because we are evolving into the stage of having a settled police force in the country in which it cannot be said in the future that we are starting off with a new police force&mdash;that this order would be the last of these <Col N="904" /> orders.  Deputy Corry, however, knows well that farmers' sons and labourers went into the force in 1922 with nothing but a national school education, who were efficient officers and who did their work as well as could be expected from them, considering their training and background.  Very often the background was not the best one for enforcing law and order, because before that they were doing anything rather than enforcing law and order.  If the present Minister for Justice or the Minister for Justice in the last Government was satisfied that a Gárda, sergeant, inspector or superintendent was efficient, but that the time has come when it is necessary to replace him because he is not now considered efficient, he should be given a pension for the years of service he gave.</P>

      <P>It is a very delicate matter to discuss this order, particularly as compared with the Bill which was before the House, and especially now when you have individuals who have become either the favourites or the victims, whichever way you like to put it, of the Act that was passed. Deputy Linehan's analysis of the position is very correct in theory; but, in practice, if you invest the Minister for Justice with the power to retire some officers&mdash;and of course you must invest him with that power, as he has inherently in his position the power to dismiss any officer for a breach of the regulations&mdash;it is very hard to define which process the Minister is carrying out.  I join with Deputy Linehan in the hope that this is the last attempt at anything of this kind.  But there is another background to this as well as the background which Deputy Linehan put before the House.  If this Government or any other Government want to increase the police force, why do they not increase it by the ordinary way of getting recruits?  Why did we add the &ldquo;Broy Harriers&rdquo; to the police force?</P>

      <P>If this House is famous for anything, it is for granting pensions. I do not wish to proceed further with this discussion, particularly as officers have been retired.  All of them that I knew have my sympathy in their retirement because of the certain amount of disgrace that is attached to it, and I do not want to make their lot worse by adding any words of criticism here.  When they are retired I think that is a certain punishment, and because of that I support the order giving <Col N="906" /> them adequate pensions.  At the same time, I wish to express the hope that it will be the last of this kind of order or legislation; that people will do their job, or that if they do not do their job they will have to pay the price.  I hope that this Administration or any subsequent Administration will not have three or four grades in the Guards; that they will all be recruited on a common level.</P>

      <P>The point raised by some Deputies about Guards retiring through illness does not arise under this order at all, because this is merely a temporary order which has effect only for 12 months from the date it was passed, last June.  It was to deal with the problem that we had to face, which was outlined pretty well by Deputy Linehan.  People were recruited, I am quite satisfied, at a time when there was no chance of getting experienced men.  They were recruited for service during the trouble, and they were not the best men for the position.  But the time had come when we had to get the best men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not altogether their fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When we were discussing this and the retirement order, which were both discussed together, I said that at a time of crisis like this we would have to have men and officers of the best type we could possibly get, <Col N="907" /> and that was the reason for bringing the order in then.  If the emergency had not arisen, we might have sat back and let things drift.  I am glad we did not.  We tackled the job and, as I said, when introducing this, representations were made to me, which impressed me, that some of the men who were being retired ought to get more consideration than they had got.  That is what is being done now.</P>
      <P>In regard to the diminution of pensions, that is not an uncommon practice in the Civil Service.  The type of case will arise where a man has been a number of years in the service and has not been very satisfactory, not even satisfactory enough to give him the amount he would have got if he had been retired through incapacity.  That has happened in the Civil Service, and I am simply taking power in such a case, rather than throw the man out altogether, to diminish his pension.</P>
      <P>The point I misunderstood was about the guards who were dismissed.  Some have been dismissed, and I am sure as long as you have a Gárda force that is bound to happen occasionally, but they have not been dealt with under this order.  There is a number of guards and sergeants, I understand, in respect of whom the Commissioner intends to issue a certificate to have them removed, and that matter then will have to be considered.  He cannot do that without the consent of the Minister for Justice, and I thought it better to wait till this new order was made, so that they could all be dealt with under this new pension order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not require to be made retrospective because, in regard to these particular eight people, retirement counts only from the 1st November, so that they are all covered, and the others have not been retired, so that they will now be dealt with under the pension order.</P>

      <P>That is a different case altogether.  A man may be dismissed <Col N="908" /> and an officer may be dismissed, and if a man goes on a prolonged spree and neglects his duty he is not going to be retired under this order but his case will go before a disciplinary court, and if he is dismissed he will be dismissed without any pension.  If we had not got that provision, both for officers and men, the Gárda would get into a hopeless condition.  We are only dealing with the problem we had to deal with, but if people go on prolonged sprees they will have to take the consequences and get out with nothing at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a special order to deal with a special problem.  The whole question of retirement from the Civil Service and the Police Force would be involved in that.  I am not proposing to deal with that at all.  This order was brought in to deal with a problem arising from causes we all know, and I cannot enlarge this order. I am not prepared to do it.  I could not do it.  I would have to go back to the Government and I would not be prepared to do it because it is a question not alone of the Guards but of the whole Civil Service.  All that would have to be taken into consideration. Although I admit it looks bad to see men who are retired through ill-health being dealt with differently from these people, the case made for some of these people was that they were men in good health who had given good service and who were prepared to give good service and who were physically fit to do it and that, therefore, <Col N="909" /> it was a shame to put them out of the Guards.  I was quite satisfied, and so was the Government, that they should be retired, but the case that was made was not such that an ordinary court would stand over.  I mean, the man did not come forward; he was not heard himself, and that point was made so strongly to me that I was very much impressed by it and I said: &ldquo;In these circumstances I admit there is a case for giving more generous treatment than is provided for in the order.&rdquo;  But if the men had got an ordinary trial they might have got nothing at all.  In some cases, they might have been dismissed.  In other cases, the disciplinary court might have said, &ldquo;We do not find a case.&rdquo; But the Government was satisfied that their continued employment was not justified and, consequently, we are taking steps which we would not ordinarily take.  Therefore, I would not interfere.  It is not my business.  This question of retirement from illness or disability is one which involves the Civil Service as well as the Guards.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is a kind of hardy annual, with which the House is familiar.  It requires to be enacted before the end of the year, and in enacting it we propose to give statutory force to the schedule of enactments set out in I and II of the Schedule to the Bill.  A memorandum explanatory of these Acts and giving the reasons for continuing them has already been circulated.  Of the nine Acts affected by the Bill, provision has already been made for the repeal of three.  I refer to the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, <Col N="911" /> the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, and the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925.  This latter Act will go when the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing Act, 1939, comes into operation.  As it may not be possible, owing to the emergency, to give effect to that Act before 1st January, it is necessary to continue the temporary measure.</P>
      <P>As regards the other two Acts, both will be repealed when the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and the Local Government Act, 1941, come into operation, which will probably be before six months.  I might add that the Acts appearing in the Schedule are reviewed from time to time to consider whether legislation might be introduced to give permanence to any of them.  Apart from the three already mentioned, it is not considered desirable at present to make provision for any one of the remainder.  It will be appreciated that the schedule of enactments to be continued has shrunk considerably over a number of years and we are now left with a mere handful of the Acts which used to appear annually in this Bill about this time.</P>

      <P>I want to refer shortly to No. 7 in the Schedule&mdash;the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  That Act was designed primarily to protect tenants of houses and tenements who are at the mercy of property owners as a result of the housing shortage that then obtained and still obtains.  I want to link up this question to-day with that of the dwellers in tenement rooms in the City of Dublin.</P>

We are re-enacting this Act in the belief that it functions.  I want to tell the House that it is not functioning, and that there is a group of persons for whose benefit the Act was intended who are not getting the benefit of it.  I want the Minister to tell us what he is going to do to ensure that that group of people do get the benefits we intend to confer on them by re-enacting that Act this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  All I want to say is that the Act is being got around.  It ought to be strengthened, or an additional Act ought to be passed, or we are not achieving the purpose we have in view in enacting the Expiring Laws Bill, 1941.  There is a large group of persons in this city for whom the Rent Restrictions Act was intended the day it was passed.  They are the dwellers in one-roomed tenements in the City of Dublin.  These people have sought, in so far as their resources permitted them, to go to court and lawfully and constitutionally to get their rights as against the tenement owners.  A series of skilful pleas founded on the original Act has succeeded in preventing these people getting their rents reduced, when in fact the rents fixed by their landlords were in excess of those which could be charged under the Rent Restrictions Act.  The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act relates the rent chargeable for a tenement room to-day to that charged at some relevant date in 1914.  I do not think I exaggerate when I say that, in respect of 80 per cent. of the tenement rooms of the City of Dublin, it is impossible to ascertain what the rent in 1914 was.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy desires to ask the Minister as to what <Col N="913" /> are his intentions he may do so, but he may not initiate a debate on the rent of tenement rooms.  Other Deputies are interested in that problem and would have equal rights to intervene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I not oppose the re-enactment of this Bill on the ground that it is not achieving the purpose the House had in mind?  Is not the purpose of this law to prevent rack-rents in tenement rooms?  Is that not the purpose of the Rent Restrictions Act?  So I understood, and if that is the purpose of the Act, I want to tell the House that that purpose is not being served and will not be served. I want the Minister to say: &ldquo;Very well; I intend to introduce additional legislation which will stop the loophole which exists in the Rent Restrictions Act.&rdquo;  It is a matter of vital urgency, and for this reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely we cannot calmly re-enact this Act when it is not doing the job?  Surely Parliament is not going to sit back and say: &ldquo;Let the tenement dwellers go to blazes&mdash;we have passed the Rent Restrictions Act?&rdquo;  I am telling the House that that Act is not protecting these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is in order in asking the Minister when he proposes to introduce other suitable legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And I must ask for the kind of legislation I want.  I want legislation which will give effectively to these people the protection which the House meant them to get, but which is being denied them.  I am asking that because people are circulating amongst tenement dwellers in this city, telling them that Parliament is not going to do anything for them, that if the Rent Restrictions Act does not solve the difficulty, they can go hang, and urging these people to organise rent strikes and agitations of that character.  The dilemma is that those of us who understand how vital it <Col N="914" /> is to maintain ordered government in any community are bound to meet rent strikes with the full resources of the law, but when you go into the merits of the particular case in respect of which the rent strike has been caused, you find that you are actually being asked to put the utmost limit of the law into operation against a rackrented tenant who is being robbed by an unscrupulous landlord.  That is bringing the whole machinery of the law into disrepute in the eyes of the people, who, goodness knows, have a hard enough time keeping the law.</P>
      <P>I want to make the will of this House the effective instrument for every citizen, however humble, to get his rights, so that if agitators advocate violence, representatives of the community can go to these people and say: &ldquo;You have a peaceful way to get justice and so long as that course is open to you, it is wrong to resort to violence against the established law.&rdquo;  These people have no peaceful way of getting justice and the Rent Restrictions Act does not give them a peaceful way.  Surely it is the duty of Parliament to say at once to these people: &ldquo;We are asking you not to listen to those who advocate violence and civil disturbance because we are going to give the means peacefully to get the justice to which you are entitled?&rdquo;  That is all we are asking. For years it has been common knowledge that the Rent Restrictions Act has broken down in respect of the tenement dweller, and all I am asking the Minister is to say that he is conscious of that fact and is going to take steps forthwith to put that right and to make it clear to the public that we are not all sitting back calmly and saying: &ldquo;We passed the Rent Restrictions Act, and, therefore, our concern with the tenement dwellers is over.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only condition upon which we could consent to the re-enactment of the Rent Restrictions Act is that we get an assurance from the Government that they will see that the benefits intended by this House for the tenement dweller will be given to him, whatever legislation may be required to achieve that end.  It is a formidable task, and there is no use in a section of this House holding the Minister up to <Col N="915" /> odium for not having done anything sooner, because the problem is one of immense complexity.  It is going to be a formidable difficulty to establish fair rents for every tenement room in Dublin.</P>

All that I am now going to say to the Minister is this, and I venture to say it in public because I think it is desirable that it should be said in public: nobody underestimates the difficulties that have to be overcome in the solution of this restrictions problem of tenement rents, but the Minister, I believe, will get from all sides of this House cooperation not only in the passage of necessary legislation but in the preparation of it.

      <P>I ask the Minister to search the procedure of this House for procedure analogous to that relating to a Private Bill whereby this House sends a Bill not to a general committee of the House, which cannot hear evidence, but to a select committee of the House which can send for persons who are expert in this matter, so <Col N="916" /> that Deputies can get vital information necessary on the Committee Stage of the Bill to insert such amendments as are requisite.  Now, I can see all the &ldquo;old hard chaws&rdquo; nodding their heads and saying: &ldquo;Ah!  that is hopeless.&rdquo; It is not hopeless.  It will be absolutely necessary sooner or later. It has got to be done.  That it will be done some time I know, but what is urgent and vital is that it should be done now.  Here we all are in this House knowing that if there is a riot in Gloucester Street or in the Coombe it will be done in ten days, but are we to wait until there is a riot?  That is what makes me mad.  Why cannot we do it before there is a riot?  If we were in tenement rooms, could we put our hands upon our hearts and say that none of us would be in that riot if it were started?  If I were a tenement dweller and were denied my right to vindicate my rights in the courts, such as they are at present, I would take steps to hurry Parliament up.  All that I ask is that machinery be provided forthwith by means of which the residents in tenement rooms can go into the courts and get their rights. That is all.  My proposal is nothing more revolutionary than that.  I believe that the Tánaiste feels as deeply about this problem as I do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to refer to the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  I am very sorry that this code is once more <Col N="917" /> going into the limbo of forgotten legislation.  We are being asked to continue for another year an Act that was passed in 1923, an Act then regarded as only a temporary one to deal with certain circumstances and facts that existed at that time.  Anyone who has had anything to do either with the administration or interpretation of this Act will have realised that there are very grave injustices operating under it, both in favour of landlords and of tenants.  In the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated, I was sorry to see that there was no indication of an intention to introduce any amending legislation at an early date. There is a reference to the report that has been presented to the Government. It is stated that the report is under consideration.  If the Minister cares to make inquiries, in places where inquiries may properly be made, as to the working of the code at the present time, he will find that it is one of the codes most urgently in need of review.  Since the Act was passed in 1923 a number of judicial decisions have been given on the interpretation of it which have created very serious injustices, both as regards landlords and tenants.  It was obvious, when the Act was passed, that it was only intended to operate for a certain time, and that, presumably, there would be some amendment of it at the end of a period.  It has, however, been continued from year to year, and during all the time it has been in operation, I think there has been only one amendment made to it.  It is, I think, the duty of the Government to investigate this aspect of our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go into details now, but I could give to the Minister at least 20 illustrations of injustices that are operating under the Act at the present moment.  If the Minister cares to inquire from associations representing tenants or landlords, or from the law officers of the Government, or from people engaged in the courts, he will find that what I have said is quite true, that this legislation is badly in need of amendment.  The Dáil does not meet very often, and this is a matter that affects the welfare of the people.  I hope that by this time next year it will not be found necessary to <Col N="918" /> deal with this type of legislation in the lazy way that we are dealing with it to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that we have no indication from the Government that they propose to introduce amending legislation to deal with the question of rents, and particularly the rents charged for rooms.  I have some knowledge of houses in Cork and of the rents charged for rooms in them.  I am not at the moment thinking of tenement houses, but rather of houses that were occupied by professional people in the years gone by.  It is quite common, in the City of Cork, to find a person renting a house at 20/- a week and letting rooms in it to as many as three families, the tenant receiving up to 35/- or £2 a week for these rooms.  You may find a man and his wife with two or three children paying 12/- a week for two top rooms, while the tenant in the lower portion has the house for 11/9.  I could quote many such cases.  I am sure the Minister and the members of his Party must be aware of all that through the activities of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and of other societies that help the poor.  As a member of the Cork Board of Assistance, I often feel that we are simply dishing out money week after week to poor people simply to enable them to pay landlords exorbitant rents for rooms in tenement areas.  That is how a great part of the assistance given to them goes.  When we are taunted sometimes about the failure of democracy, we surely must hang our heads in shame when such things as I have stated can happen.  It can, at least, be said that democracy is not functioning so far as those poor people are concerned.  I am sorry that we have been given no indication that the Government propose to introduce amending legislation to deal with this matter.  I hope that the Minister, with the knowledge and sympathy he has so far as this problem is concerned, will prevail on the Government to bring in legislation to deal with the points raised by Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>Quite recently, in the columns of one of our newspapers, an advertisement appeared for sale of a tenement house in the Mountjoy area <Col N="919" /> and, as an inducement to purchasers, the rent-roll was disclosed at amounting to £300 a year.  That was in a Mountjoy tenement area.  That works out at about 12/- per room for every room in the house, from top to bottom. Something should be done in cases of that kind.  Another injustice often occurs in these landlord and tenant cases.  Where a tenant goes into court as defendant or claimant and has no legal aid, his case is not put forward in a proper way.  Hardships have been inflicted on tenants in that way, particularly on tenants who find a decree given against them because nobody has stated their case.  Many legal gentlemen have told me it was a pity that certain cases of this kind were not defended, because the decision would, in that event, have been the other way.  When the Minister is amending the Act, he ought to consider the points put forward by Deputy Hickey and Deputy Dillon.  I need say no more than &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to the case made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hickey. I agree with every word they said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference is made in this document to the simplification of the preliminary procedure in relation to the acquisition of land.  I wish the Minister would do something inside his Department to simplify the acquisition of land for labourers' cottages. The average cost of the land in a poor district for this purpose would be £18 or £20 an acre.  It would not be higher than £30 in any case.  The boards of health are bound to insist on a strict title.  They must get a good fee-simple title from the person selling.  In many cases, that requires a very costly investigation of title and the boards of health are responsible, I think, for the costs incurred by the vendor as well as by themselves.  The cost of making title, in some of these cases, to land worth £20 amounts to £20 or £30. Apart from legislation, something might be done to remedy that, as has been done in the case of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Land Trust.  In those cases, the occupier gives a statutory receipt and that provides good title to the purchasers irrespective of anything else.  This matter may seem very <Col N="920" /> trifling, but where there are 500 or 600 cottages erected in a rural district, the imposition on the rate is considerable. It might be arranged that, when the board of health require an acre plot, the person whose name appears as rated occupier should get the £20 and sign a receipt for it.  That should end the matter so far as the board of health is concerned.  If anybody else has a claim, let him deal with the person who got the money from the board of health.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Linehan. A sum of £1,700 was paid for land for this purpose, in my experience, and the solicitor's bill of costs amounted to £1,180.  After these costs were taxed, he got £875 in respect of a transaction amounting to £1,700.  I am thankful to Deputy Linehan for letting down his profession sufficiently to bring this point to the notice of the House.  I am sure he would not stand for that particular bill of costs.</P>

      <P>These expiring laws used to be very numerous and complicated.  When many Deputies saw one of these bills for the first time, it contained pages of schedules and references to a variety of Acts which required re-enactment.  It is now a much more slender Bill than it was 10 or 12 years ago.  A number of Acts which required renewal every year have been dealt with otherwise.  Many new Acts have been passed and laws have been codified, making it unnecessary to renew a number of the Acts formerly included in the Bill.  The Acts requiring renewal now are very few.  Some of them will, probably, remain during our life time.  One or two are crying out for codification and for treatment which will bring them up to date.  One of these is the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  As Deputies know, hardly anything in law is more complicated <Col N="921" /> than rent restriction and the rights of town tenants in general.  The last Government and this Government brought in amending legislation dealing with town tenants, but even now nobody is satisfied.  I think I am not exaggerating in saying that.  After great pressure for further legislation, we set up a tribunal of inquiry three years ago.  Evidently, the judge who presided over that tribunal and the other members found the question so complicated and found it so difficult to propound remedies for the problems presented by witnesses that every member of the tribunal furnished a report in addition to the main report.</P>

I cannot say any more than the Minister for Justice said.  I shall call his attention to the remarks made in this debate regarding the urgency of the problem.  I have not heard anything about revolutionary movements or riots in relation to rents in tenement areas, such as Deputy Dillon, I think, forecast.

      <P>The business before the House is the voting of a subsidy for bread and flour and, more particularly, the motion by Deputy Dillon asking the Dáil to reduce the sub-head in the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Supplies providing for that subsidy.  I do not propose to repeat now what I said in that connection last evening except to the extent necessary to take up the thread of my remarks.  The wheat which will be used this year for the manufacture of flour and bread will cost, approximately, £2,000,000 more than the wheat used last year.  I use the term &ldquo;year&rdquo; to denote not the calendar year but the cereal year&mdash;the period between one harvest and another.  That additional sum of £2,000,000 must be paid by somebody. Quite clearly, if we are to give the farmers more for native wheat and pay more for imported wheat, somebody has to foot the bill.  If we do not provide a subsidy and thus put that additional burden on the taxpayer, the additional amount will have to be paid by the consumers of bread and flour.</P>

Many people in this House, and some people outside it, are fond of urging that we should pay more to primary producers for their products and charge less for the same products to the consumers.  That is a common type of illogical argument characteristic <Col N="925" /> of certain Fine Gael Deputies and most Labour Deputies.  They like to have their cake and eat it and they like to have their cake without paying for it.  They want us to give the farmers more for their wheat without charging more for the flour.  It cannot be done.</P>

In fact, the farmers who grow wheat will get for the wheat they grow this year a sum of more than £2,000,000 in excess of the amount they received last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a simple calculation. It is due, not merely to the fact that the guaranteed minimum price for wheat has been increased by 5/- a barrel, but also and primarily to the fact that the total quantity of wheat produced has increased by 33? per cent. &mdash;at least, the total quantity of wheat produced in this country which it is assumed will be available for milling into flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister used the word &ldquo;assumed&rdquo; as I think it is a very big assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On that assumption, I find they will get for wheat in this year a sum which will exceed by more than £2,000,000 the sum they received last year.  We have to buy less foreign wheat, even though we will have to pay more for the foreign wheat that we do buy, and the total additional bill for wheat will be £2,000,000.  That £2,000,000 can, therefore, be described as a subsidy to wheat.  It is true&mdash; Deputies may contend and contend truthfully&mdash;that we had to pay the increased price for foreign wheat in any event, and that we had to pay the increased price for native wheat in order to get the yield, and that this additional cost had, therefore, to be faced <Col N="926" /> in any event.  It could not have been avoided.  If that contention is well founded, this subsidy can be described more accurately as a subsidy to the consumers of flour and bread.  It is not correct that the provision of this subsidy could benefit the millers of this country in any way: it is not intended to benefit them, nor will it do so.</P>

The sole effect is that the loaf, instead of costing 1/2, will continue to cost 1/-, and the sack of flour, instead of costing 66/6, will continue to cost 52/6.  If we do not provide a subsidy and adopt Deputy Dillon's motion, or if for any reason we fail to make this subsidy available, those prices will have to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with that.  If there is any truth in the contention that the millers of the country are getting unduly liberal treatment, that contention must be based upon the price fixed for flour, not upon the proposal to subsidise flour; as, in so far as the millers are concerned, the position in this cereal year will be precisely the same as it was in the last cereal year.  While undoubtedly the contention could be made that the price fixed for flour was unduly liberal to the millers, I think a very slight examination of the facts will show that the contention is unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fixing the price for flour, certain estimates had to be made, certain assumptions had to be relied upon; but to a much greater extent than is possible in the costing of most commodities, a decision was made upon known facts.  It was possible to determine with preciseness, down to a fraction of a penny, the cost of the wheat required to make a sack of flour; it was possible to determine <Col N="927" /> the costs of manufacturing wheat into flour in every flour mill in the country.  The certified accounts of every flour mill were examined, and the average cost of manufacturing in port mills was taken for the purpose of our calculations.  It was possible to determine, not quite so accurately, the capital invested in flour milling.  About the figure for actual capital invested in flour milling there was some contention with the Flour Millers' Association, but, nevertheless, a figure was determined upon; and on the basis of that figure and a decision to allow 6 per cent. in respect of capital charges, the flour price was built up.  That flour price is open to examination here. People can urge that we should pare a little more off the millers, people may urge that we should reduce the wages in the flour-milling industry in order to get the cost down.  Those people are undoubtedly free to make arguments of that kind, but I think no sensible person will urge that there is contained in the fixed price for flour any element of undue liberality to anyone.</P>

      <P>There may be in the minds of some people the idea, in this connection as in any other connection, that we can offset the increased price we decide to pay to farmers by a reduction of manufacturing and distribution costs.  That contention is without foundation.  There is no industry in this country which is so completely controlled as the flour-milling industry: <Col N="928" /> it is controlled in every aspect of its operation.  I must admit the possibility that, in making decisions, I or the officers who advised me were guilty of errors, but the point I want to make clear is that a positive decision was made by me in relation to every single cost of the industry before the price was fixed.  There is that absolute control over every cost, to which I have referred, and which does not exist in relation to any other industry.</P>
      <P>There is possibly some point in the contention made by Deputy Dillon that the operation of the order I made recently relating to sacks will upset the basis of our calculations of a fair price for flour.  I do not think it is either necessary or relevant now to justify that particular order.  I want to say merely that the purpose of the order was to ensure that every sack that went out containing flour or anything else came back again.  It is no exaggeration to say that, of all the many problems this country will face in the coming year, none is more likely to be so troublesome as that of maintaining the supply of sacks and other containers.  Deputies are aware that the supply of the materials required for the manufacture of sacks&mdash;cotton, jute, and other textiles&mdash;has been very seriously curtailed.  In consequence of that, we are facing a situation in which we may not have sufficient sacks to facilitate the distribution of various classes of goods.  My mind balks at the possibility of having to undertake the distribution of flour or sugar or similar commodities, without sacks; and that possibility may have to be faced, if we cannot secure the conservation of the existing stock and the return of all available containers to those who require them for distribution purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that was the reason why the Sacks Order was made&mdash;in order to ensure that flour sacks and other similar containers would be returned, a charge was attached to them.  A charge of 5/- was attached to the flour sack.  The person who gets the sack of flour&mdash;whether as a trader or as a consumer&mdash;is charged 5/- for the sack, which is returnable when the sack is <Col N="929" /> returned.  When we fixed the price for flour, we included in that price an item in respect of the sack which contained the flour.  It is clear that if the millers get back all the sacks that item becomes unnecessary and, unless there is some adjustment in the arrangement, the millers will benefit to the extent of the allowance previously made against the cost of the sack. But, of course, it is not true that the millers will get back all the sacks and those sacks that do come back will have to be cleaned and perhaps reconditioned, and consequently the millers will not save the whole of the allowance previously made to them in respect of the sack.  They will still have some charge to meet.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to proceed I will make it clear, perhaps even to him.  It is clear there is the possibility that some benefit will accrue to the millers under the operation of the sacks order, and if such benefit does accrue, then the position will be adjusted by a modification of the subsidy arrangement. The price of flour will remain unchanged, but, to the extent that the costings upon which that price is based are upset, then a rearrangement of it will be made in order to diminish the cost of the subsidy.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. There is no shadow of foundation for the Minister's suggestion.

      <P>The Labour Party fell for Deputy Dillon's suggestion, merely because they are always slaves of catchwords and phrases.  A catchword or a phrase saves the members of the Labour Party the trouble of thinking and when Deputy Dillon threw out the suggestion of nationalisation they at once fell for it.

      <P>For the information of those Deputies who want information I may say that that is generally assumed to be the capital cost of the equipment required to produce one sack of flour per hour.  Our milling capacity is 500 sacks per hour.  Our milling capacity at present is substantially in excess of our actual requirements, because it was established on the basis of flour of 70 per cent. extraction and we are now using flour of 95 per cent. extraction and it requires a much smaller number of mills to produce the full quantity of flour required when we are working to 95 per cent. extraction.  However, the millers have tangible assets capable of producing 500 sacks of flour per hour and, on the basis of £8,000 per sack, that means that about £4,000,000 is the value of their tangible assets.</P>

      <P>If we decide to proceed on Deputy Dillon's suggestion we will pay £4,000,000 to the flour millers. The flour millers will have no trouble about investing that money in England in a manner which will enable them to earn more than 6 per cent. on it.  I am sure I do not have to assure Deputies on that point.  We will then have the flour mills and we will have to get somebody to run them.  The only people capable of running them are the flour millers.  We will have to ask these people to run the mills and they will probably ask a salary for doing so. They will have got £4,000,000, which they will invest in England&mdash;and there can be no doubt it will be profitably invested&mdash;and then we will have to get them to run the mills for us.  If they do not do so, nobody else will do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody will have to run the mills and they are the only people who know how to.  No doubt, they will continue to engage the same workers as are employed now.  They will be paid the same wages as now and they will produce flour just in the same way.  The net result will mean no difference for the consumers of flour, but there will be a substantial improvement for certain of the flour millers.</P>
      <P>I want Labour Deputies to note one possible result.  I have just mentioned that our flour milling capacity is substantially in excess of our actual requirements, and if we establish one corporation to run all the flour mills the inevitable result will be a concentration of production of flour in the larger mills.  That is the only justification that could be offered for nationalisation. Deputy Davin may approve of that, and Deputy Keyes might possibly be in favour of it, because some of the concentration might be done in Limerick.  But ask the Labour Deputy for Kilkenny and the Labour Deputies for other places, where small mills exist and give employment, what their opinion is.  The mills in these places are the mills that will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> The only possible benefit that could be conferred on the consumers of flour through nationalisation or rationalisation would come from that elimination of the small mills and the concentration of production in the larger mills. We may have to do that&mdash;do not take me as arguing against it&mdash;but I want Deputies who have an enthusiasm for nationalisation to understand precisely what it involves.</P>

      <P>One of the things that has caused Deputies confusion is the fact that next year is not this year. One would think that that should be an obvious thing to Deputy Cosgrave and others who have spoken, but clearly they have not appreciated the fact and are all mixed up about the 80,000 tons of shipping space which we are going to use this year to import wheat which we will consume this year. They want us to use that 80,000 tons of shipping space to bring in fertilisers to help us to grow wheat here at home, but we would not get that wheat this year.  I could not get them to see the flaw in their argument. Undoubtedly, we have that 80,000 tons of shipping space, but we want 80,000 tons of wheat now, or at least before the next harvest, and we propose to use that available shipping space to bring in that 80,000 tons of wheat.  If we were to adopt the suggestion of Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies, to bring in fertilisers instead of wheat, we might get more wheat grown in this country next year as a result, but it would mean that we would be 80,000 tons of wheat short this year, and we cannot use that 80,000 tons of shipping space twice. The shipping capacity at our command may permit of our bringing in across the Atlantic, before the next harvest, a larger quantity of goods than the 80,000 tons.  The actual quantity of goods that we could bring in during that period, however, it is as yet difficult to say, but we do feel that we have at our command sufficient shipping capacity to bring in the 80,000 tons that we need.  Of course, the less wheat we have to bring in the better, and Deputies need not argue with me to convince me that it is undesirable to use that shipping space to bring in 80,000 tons of wheat if the wheat could be produced here at home.  I would much prefer to have the wheat produced <Col N="935" /> here in our own country because, if we had that wheat here, we could use that shipping space to bring in commodities that are almost as urgently required, but I have got to deal with the fact that we did not get, or are not going to get, from this year's harvest our full requirements of wheat, and if we are going to keep our full supply of flour and bread for the country against the coming of the next harvest, then that 80,000 tons of shipping space must be earmarked for the importation of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to remove certain misunderstandings with regard to the cost of that wheat.  I told Deputies that we had brought in wheat which cost us 84/- a barrel.  That wheat came in <i>via</i> Lisbon.  It was a most expensive way of bringing in the wheat, but we had to deal with the situation which arose early this year when it appeared almost certain that the total amount of wheat available for us here would be insufficient to keep us going until this year's harvest arrived.  That was the position at the beginning of the year. I told Deputies that at the time; in fact, I told them so vehemently that leaders of the Opposition Parties requested, and got, a special meeting of the Dáil called to discuss that situation. Now, by various methods we did, in fact, make our wheat supply last us until the harvest, although the harvest was three or four weeks later than we had anticipated, but one of the methods that were used was to bring the wheat in <i>via</i> Lisbon, and that was only because there was no other method available.  Direct shipment did not begin until July or early in August, and in the meantime we had to get wheat in any way we could, and the only way was <i>via</i> Lisbon.  We had some ships at our command, but they were small ships that could not make the voyage across the Atlantic.  The wheat arrived at Lisbon <i>via</i> American ships because, under American law these ships were able to sail there, but then the wheat had to be unloaded at the mouth of the river, carted 14 miles inland to the grain stores, stored there, and brought back again the 14 miles to the mouth of the river for reloading <Col N="936" /> on our ships, which then brought the wheat here.  Deputies can easily see that that was a most expensive and extremely uneconomic method, but we had reached the position in which the cost did not matter.  The only thing that mattered was the actual physical supplies of wheat available in this country, and when I mention what the average cost of 80,000 tons this year will be I have to take into account that a substantial proportion of that 80,000 tons has arrived, or will arrive, <i>via</i> the Lisbon route, and bearing these high charges.  Consequently, the average cost of importing the 80,000 tons of wheat this year is high, and higher than that at which we anticipate it will be possible to import wheat this time next year.  If, therefore, Deputies want to calculate what price we shall pay or could pay Irish farmers next year in order to obviate the possibility of importing wheat next year, they must not base their calculations on the assumption that it will be brought in by the Lisbon route, which may not be available next year, but on the cost of bringing it in by the direct route, which would be substantially less.  What the cost, over a long period, on the direct route would be, it is difficult to say, but certainly it would be substantially lower than by the Lisbon route.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the cost of bringing it direct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a precise figure because, at the moment, various methods and ports of shipment are being tried out, and some wheat is coming by one route and some by another.  It is not until you have a substantial quantity of wheat in that you can give a figure.  The actual costs of one ship are not necessarily a reliable way of working it out, but I think the Deputy can reckon that the cost will be in or around 65/- or, perhaps, 70/- a barrel.  However, I do not want to enter into the merits of the discussion that took place here upon this Estimate as to the price that should be paid to Irish farmers for wheat grown here.  It must be quite clear that any increase in the price paid to Irish farmers is going to increase the cost of producing flour so <Col N="937" /> long as Irish farmers produce only 80 per cent. of our requirements of flour, and even if they produced the whole of our requirements of flour, only a very slight increase in the guaranteed price would be possible without increasing the actual cost of the flour to the Irish people.  The increase in the cost of flour, which has already been made, is going to be concealed from the great majority of our people by this subsidy, but the members of this Dáil must not allow the fact to be concealed from them that whether we pay it in one way or another the cost of flour in the nation's bread is dearer this year than last year and if we increase the price paid for wheat now the nation's flour will be dearer next year than it is this year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry must not take it that I am arguing for or against an increase in the price of wheat.  It may be contended by some Deputies that, no matter what the increase in the cost of flour involved, it is a wiser policy to pay more for wheat.  I can see a Deputy contending that, but I do not want a Deputy to contend that and at the same time not face the fact that it is going to mean an increased price for flour and bread, unless the Government is prepared to increase the subsidy, and the Government has already intimated that it is not prepared to do that.  I do not say that that decision is immutable; that it will not change as facts and circumstances must change all decisions; but, when the Government decided on this subsidy arrangement some months ago, it announced, or authorised me to announce, that that was the limit to which it was prepared to go in the circumstances then existing, and if there was any further increase in the cost of producing flour for any reason &mdash;and I specifically mentioned the case of an increased price paid for wheat to Irish farmers&mdash;the full consequences of that increase would have to be reflected in the price of flour and the price of bread.  Deputy Brennan was perturbed about the extension of this <Col N="938" /> subsidy to wheaten meal, and he tried to make a calculation based upon the cost of the commission miller milling wheat on commission for the grower of wheat.  The present fixed price for wheaten meal is 49/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The present fixed price for wheaten meal is 49/- per 280 lbs., and that price is built up as follows: the licensed wheat meal millers receive an allocation of imported wheat, and consequently the price of imported wheat is taken into account in determining what their costs are.  On the basis of the allocations of imported wheat received by them last year, supplemented by native wheat, the cost of the wheat required to make 280 lbs. of wheaten meal was £2 0s. 3½d. That cost will be increased now because of the higher price for native wheat and the higher price for imported wheat, but under the subsidy arrangement it will remain unchanged. The purpose of the subsidy is to ensure that those wheat meal millers will receive the wheat used by them this year at the same price as last year. That is the whole purpose of the subsidy. In addition to the £2, there is an allowance of 2/- in respect of sacks. The same considerations apply in relation to that sacks' allowance made to wheat meal millers as apply in the case of flour millers, and, although it is quite clear that the whole of that item cannot be wiped out, neverthless some part of it may be.</P>

      <P>Why can you not wipe out the whole of the item?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the collection, reconditioning, renovating and cleaning of the sacks will still have to be paid for.  There is a discount of 4/- in the £ allowed by the miller to traders; and wages, overheads and profits amount to 6/8.  An investigation carried out in 1939 put the wages and overheads of wheat meal millers at 5/6 per sack.  No increase has been allowed over that 1939 estimate.  I think it is almost certain that some increases in the costs of production have taken place since then, but no allowance for any increase in the cost of production has yet been <Col N="939" /> reflected in the price.  That allows 1/2 per sack profit to the miller.</P>

      <P>Those are the only matters to which I wish to refer now. There were some other matters of detail mentioned by various Deputies, but I think it is not necessary to refer to them at this stage.  I have dealt with the principal contentions of Deputies on the main subject of this motion.  Now, I want Deputies to understand precisely what they are going to do.  The Government has decided to subsidise flour and bread in order to keep the price of flour and bread unchanged when a rise in the price of each would otherwise be inevitable because of the increased cost of wheat.  The Dáil is now going to be asked to vote on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question as to what scheme he had worked out whereunder he could equitably distribute the bread subsidy on the basis of batch bread.  How is he going to know that a country baker has baked so much of his flour in the form of batch bread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The baker will have to keep accounts as prescribed by the Department, subject to the periodic inspection of the Department's officers by way of check.  He will be paid his subsidy on the basis of the batch bread sold by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And he will be the certifying authority as to the amount of batch bread sold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The certifying authority will be an officer of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But how can an officer of the Department do it?  As I say, take the baker on the side of the road. How is an officer of the Department ever going to know how much batch bread he sold in a given day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He will give the Department the benefit of the doubt, I am sure.  The Deputy seems to think it is impossible to determine the amount of batch bread which a baker sold.  I do not see that there is any difficulty at all.  I admit that there is a possibility of a baker here and there attempting to falsify returns and getting more than he is entitled to.  I think the risks which such a baker would take would be appalling.  He goes out of business; he loses everything if he is caught, and he is almost certain to be caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How can you check up on him?  Suppose he says: &ldquo;On a certain day, I baked 20 dozen plain and 15 dozen fancy.&rdquo;  That bread has been sold and consumed long before the Department's inspector comes on the scene.  How in the name of heaven can you check up on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the quantity sold, not the quantity baked, that matters. It does not matter how much he baked. We can check up on the sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose he says: &ldquo;I sent out my van on such a day.  I am charging the same price for fancy, although fancy is not as heavy as batch.  I say that my van contained 15 dozen fancy and ten dozen plain.  It has been sold and consumed.&rdquo;  How can the Department's inspector possibly check up on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="941" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we have to rely on periodic inspections.  I think in this matter, as in all matters where revenue considerations are involved, the enforcement is secured firstly by those regular and systematic checks upon the accuracy of statements made by individuals, and, secondly, by the drastic nature of the penalties involved. The baker would be able, undoubtedly, to make an inaccurate return in respect of this day and the next day and the third day, but on the fourth day he may be caught, in which case he loses everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister check up on him?  If the Minister's inspector goes out at nine o'clock in the morning he can open the bread van. At that hour, the baker has not completed his return for that day.  Suppose the bread van has gone out the country&mdash;there may be two vans or five&mdash;how is the inspector to find out what is in the bread van?  Suppose he does not find the expected quantity of plain bread in the van, how is he to prove that the baker has not sold the plain bread before he caught up on the van?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there will be any difficulty in keeping that check.  The system in operation has been worked out by the officers of my Department and has been communicated to the Association of Bakers.  It has been in operation for some weeks, because as I have already informed the House the subsidy will be payable retrospectively to the middle of October. These accounts have been kept and this system of supervision is already in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that the only account that is kept is that the baker says: &ldquo;I baked so many dozen plain and so many dozen fancy.&rdquo; How can these returns be checked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The baker who does not keep accounts in conformity with the regulations does not get paid.  I want to repeat that the subsidy will be paid only to bakers who have completed their registration with my Department. While I cannot say precisely what the number of bakers in this country is, <Col N="942" /> from the available information in the Industrial Year Book and other sources, the number appears to be considerably larger than has actually registered.  Only those who have registered will get the subsidy, therefore bakers who fail to comply with the regulations are depriving themselves of the subsidy.  A subsidy for bread is necessary to offset other costs involved in the manufacture of bread, exclusive of the cost of flour.  As Deputies are aware, the manufacture of bread involves the use of salt, vegetable oils and certain other commodities, all of which have gone up in price.  While it is true that we have not got, in relation to the baking industry as a whole, the very precise knowledge we have in regard to the flour milling industry, neverthless it is clear that costs have gone up to such an extent as to invalidate the allowance made by the Prices Commission on which the price of bread had been fixed.  The Prices Commission worked on pre-war costs for these goods.  We have got to make this additional allowance or a number of the smaller bakers could not continue to operate.  Their disappearance would cause hardship and inconvenience to a large number of people in the country.  That is why we decided that not merely should we stabilise the price of flour but that we should also stabilise the price of bread and offset these increased costs.</P>

Is the Minister aware that a baker of my acquaintance, who registered and had his registration acknowledged by the Department of Supplies, had received no such request to keep accounts up to last Tuesday, that the only records that baker was required to keep were those which he kept at the request of the bakers' organisation which merely asked that a record of batch and fancy <Col N="943" /> bread should be kept from time to time and that no request for accounts was ever issued?</P>

Tá cinnte aca, freisin, go n-íocfar ina iomláine an méid tuarastail do coinníodh ó na hoidí a mbaineann an cás leo.  Tuairim agus £93,000 suim an airgid sin, go dtí an 30adh de Mheán Fomhair, 1941, agus (má's toil leis an Dáil é) táthar ag brath a íoc ina dhá thráth-chuid&mdash;an chéad tráth-chuid faoi cheann míosa nó mar sin, agus an dara ceann sa bhliain airgeadais seo chughainn &mdash; ionnas nach gcuirfear as go ró-mhór don Aire Airgeadais.

Mar is cuimhin leis na Teachtaí, do mhol an Coimisiún Fiosrúcháin go gcuirfí teagasc liteardha na scol sin i gcóimh-cheangal díreach le Brainnse an Bhun-Oideachais agus gur ón mBrainnse sin do gheobhadh na hoidí a dtuarastail. Do measadh go gcuirfeadh sin tuairim agus £30,000 sa bhliain de chostas ar an Stát; agus, gidh gur ghlac an Riaghaltas le prionsabal an mholta agus gur mhaith leo a chur i ngníomh, do cinneadh go gcaithfí fanúint go raghadh an saol chun socrachta agus chun feabhais maidir le cúrsaí airgid. Acht do tháinig iarratais tréana ó mhórán Teachta le linn díospóireacht na Meastachán, agus, mar gheall air sin, do bhíos i ndon a rá go dtabharfaí socrú isteach le haghaidh pháirtíocaíocht na dtuarastal i mbliadhna. Tá an scéim ullamh anois, agus táthar ag brath an íocaíocht do dhéanamh ionann agus dá mbeadh sí i bhfeidhm ón 1adh Abrán, 1941.  £8,000 atáthar a d'iarraidh sa Mheastachán seo, agus do bhéadh £8,800 ag teasáil le haghaidh lán-bhliana.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom é bheith le rá agam go bhfuil glactha ag Bainisteóirí na Scol leis an scéim seo.  Ní hé amháin go dtugann sé congnamh maith airgid do na Scoileanna, ach tá sé ina thionnscnamh ar ní do bhí an-riachtanach .i. a chur i n-áirithe go mbéidh tuarastal cóir agus go mbéidh cáiliochta oiriúnacha ag na hoidí.  Ba cheart a thuigsint nach dtiocfaidh faoi'n scéim acht daoine ag a bhfuil na cáilíochta atá riachtanach de ghnáth ag Oidí Bun-Scol&mdash;sin nó daoine mheasfaidh an Roinn do bheith oiriúnach mar gheall ar a gcáilíochta léighinn agus a gcleachtadh ar obair an teagaisc.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 2, to insert the following definition before the definition of the word &ldquo;proposal&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression ancillary operations' means any of the following operations, that is to say, the embanking, damming, dredging, deepening, widening, straightening, diverting, altering the level of, or otherwise affecting a source of water or any lake, pond, river, canal, or other water connected directly or indirectly with a source of water&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to have power to carry out incidental works such as the laying of a weir in the bed of a stream or, in the case of a lake, raising the embankment or constructing a weir at the outlet of the lake so as to raise the general level of the lake.  The amendment indicates the general types of work that may be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, to delete paragraph (d), and substitute the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) where part only of the water at a place is proposed to be taken, the maximum rate at which it is proposed to be taken,</P>
      <P>(e) where part only of the water at a place is proposed to be taken and the source of water is a lake, the estimated lowest summer level of the lake and sufficient particulars of the method by which it is proposed to take the water to enable a reasonable estimate to be made of the effect of such taking on the level of the lake,</P>
      <P>(f) where part only of the water at a place is proposed to be taken and the source of water is not a lake, the estimated minimum quantity of water flowing past such place in the summer during any continuous period not exceeding one day, and</P>
      <P>(g) where the proposal involves the carrying out of any ancillary operations, particulars of such operations, and</P>
      <P>In every proposal formulated by a sanitary authority for taking a supply of water, the sanitary authority is required to include in the proposal definite particulars in regard to the source of the water, the place or places at which the supply is to be taken and the quantity of the water proposed to be taken.  It is also necessary to indicate the minimum quantity of water at the source of supply, and the maximum rate at which it is proposed to be taken.  Information of this kind is necessary in determining whether or not damage is likely to be caused by the taking of the water.  These particulars will, likewise, afford information to riparian interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> Paragraph (d) of the Bill as it stands is not sufficiently explicit in some respects. If the source of the water were a lake, it would not be practicable to determine the minimum flow.  Where a lake is the source of supply, the quantity of water in the lake will be readily ascertainable, and it is considered that details should be furnished as to the lowest summer level of the lake, and particulars as to the method by which it is proposed to take the water.  With this information available, and information as to the quantity proposed to be taken, the effect of the sanitary authority's proposal can be gauged. The amendment also sets out in greater detail the procedure to be followed where the source of supply is other than a lake.  The amendment does not introduce any new principle into the original section.  It merely sets out in greater detail information that a riparian owner or other interested party would require.</P>

      <P>The amendment the Minister has given notice of, dealing with the Grand Canal Company, has a bearing on this amendment.  Various businesses throughout the country depend for their existence on a supply of water.  The Grand Canal Company is, perhaps, the biggest of these.  There are, then, streams which supply essential water for mills, and which are useful for giving power in certain places throughout the country.  Now, it was with a view to affording some protection to these and to the effect that they would have on the properties concerned, that amendment No. 3 was drafted.  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary is endeavouring to meet that matter as far as he can in this section.</P>

Possibly the persons affected by a scheme would not know the result of it until the scheme was in actual operation. If you tie yourself to a period of two years, you may be doing an injustice to somebody.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that there are many schemes which, for one cause or another, were not completed within two years or even three years. I do not say that you should make provision for an unlimited period, but I do not think it would be wise to tie yourself down too tightly, so that you would be prevented from exercising a discretion if such a case as I have in mind arose.</P>

      <P>Any persons affected directly or indirectly by a proposal will have one or two years after the scheme comes into force within which to make a claim.  They will have that period of actual experience of the operation of the scheme.  Deputy Brennan seems to have in mind that once a proposal is initiated that two years might elapse before the scheme becomes actually operative, but in the framework of the Bill, as interpreted by the draftsman and the legal advisers, there will be two years, after a scheme has actually come into effective operation, within which a claim for compensation can be made.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary explained that on Second Reading.  Possibly it is my fault, but I should like him to point out where we may read that into Section 11 or any other section of the Bill.  The section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever a sanitary authority has made a proposal and either such <Col N="960" /> proposal has been agreed to or a provisional order in respect of such proposal, has been confirmed...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy reads on, he will see:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...such sanitary authority may publish in a newspaper...a notice specifying the date...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section deals only with the method of notification.  The same principle will arise on a later section, when, perhaps, it could be debated in a more orderly fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which provides the period and it is the section which will be relied upon in law and which will govern the period.  The section does not set out that the scheme will be in operation at all.  The proposal will be agreed upon, or a provisional order will have been confirmed, but there is nothing in the section which says that the scheme will actually be in operation.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to read several sections together in order fully to understand it.  If the Deputy will turn to Section 12, he will find that it has a further bearing on it.  It sets out:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as may be after a sanitary authority has published a notice specifying the date on which a proposal made by such sanitary authority will come into force, such sanitary authority shall give to every person...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A notice will be served on the people whose names appear in the book of reference telling them the date upon which the proposal will come into force. In Section 12, we are making an amendment similar to that which we are making in Section 11, that is, extending the periods of three months and 12 months to 12 months and two years, during which the persons affected can make their objections.  That period will operate from the time the water is actually taken by the sanitary authority.</P>

      <P>(1) When a proposal made by a sanitary authority has come into force, it shall be lawful for such sanitary authority&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to take in accordance with such proposal a supply of water from the source of water to which such proposal relates, and</P>

      <P>(c) where particulars of any ancillary operations are stated in such proposal, to execute, on any land acquired by such sanitary authority either before or after such proposal comes into force or on any other land with the consent of the owner any works which are necessary for the purpose of such ancillary operations.</P>
      <P>(2) The powers conferred on a sanitary authority by sub-section (1) of this section may be exercised&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) notwithstanding anything contained in Section 286 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and</P>
      <P>(b) notwithstanding any right of any person to prevent or restrict the exercise of such powers, and</P>

    <P>This is really a recast of Section 13 as <Col N="963" /> it appears in the Bill.  The recast arises out of the provision adopted for carrying out ancillary operations.

      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary considered the implications of this section?  First of all the State, or what appear to be officers of the State, nominate the arbitrator.  If I am not mistaken the local authority has some kind of veto in respect of these appointments. Notwithstanding all the precautions taken in connection with particular nominations, there have been occasions when the person nominated has been against the local authority, and there are also cases where the person nominated has been against the individual. Many years ago a member of a local authority informed me that an arbitrator made awards very considerable in amount, but not sufficient to justify the local authority taking the case to appeal, because there was a limit in respect of the amount on which they could appeal.  While the arbitrator is generally assumed to be a person of professional standing, it may happen that at some time an arbitrator is appointed whose work, however well intentioned, may not be just to the parties, and while we should endeavour to avoid putting unnecessary expense either on the person whose property is to be taken, or upon the local authority, it appears to be desirable to have some method of dealing with cases of that sort, because even the Supreme Court cannot interfere at present.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider whether there could not be some kind of court of appeal?</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Brennan will not unduly press this amendment, because I am very much afraid that it would be anything but an improvement to the framework of the Bill.  Deputy Cosgrave made the point, and no doubt in certain circumstances there would be certain substance in it, that an arbitrator might not always be fair.  I am fairly sure that Deputy Cosgrave would agree with me that on occasions decisions in the courts do not always appear to be fair.  Leaving that aside, the system of arbitration in the matter of the acquisition of land under the Housing Acts and various other enactments, for the purpose of arriving at the amount of compensation to be paid, has been set up by definite statutes and has, so far as I am aware, worked satisfactorily.  If we depart from it in the matter of the damage that may be caused by proposed water schemes, I think we are heading for endless and expensive litigation in the courts.  It may be said with a certain amount of reason that if people want to go to the expense of prolonged litigation, for the purpose of asserting what they consider to be their rights, they are quite entitled to do so.  There is a good deal to be said for that but the method of arbitration will in general be found more satisfactory than the ordinary courts of law.  I do not think Deputy Cosgrave was right in saying that local authorities have a veto on the person selected as arbitrator.  I am not aware of that, but I will look into it.  Certainly if the local authority could, by objecting to suggested arbitrators, and by a process of elimination confine the selection of arbitrators to those who would very likely be favourably disposed towards the interests of local authorities, it would be an objectionable position.  If that is so, it would modify my views as between a system of arbitration and a system under the courts. I am not aware that it is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave knows, as I am sure most Deputies interested in this matter know, that the personnel of the arbitration panel is selected by the courts. It is not true to say that they are selected by the State&mdash;that is a slight <Col N="967" /> exaggeration of the actual position.  I understand they are selected by the courts.  They are not selected by the Government.  I do not suppose Deputy Cosgrave meant to convey that his statement was open to that interpretation. It is one of those matters on which we could argue for a long time, and I suppose there would be people who could say that there is a certain amount of right on both sides.  I feel very strongly that the weight of evidence and the weight of experience is all in favour of maintaining the system of arbitration for the purpose of arriving at the amount of compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something like 30 years since I first came into close contact with the matter.  I was then informed by a responsible officer of a local authority that an arbitrator had made an award of £900 odd in a particular case, and that nothing under £1,000 could be appealed from by the local authority.  They had to pay the £900 odd for property which was not considered to be value for one-fourth of the amount, and by reason of that act of the arbitrator, the Local Government Board was informed by the local authority that they would not attend before that arbitrator any more.  That appears to me to be a bad system. Whatever might be said for it, it was apparently open to very grave objection. It is some 20 years since I heard some criticism of another arbitrator, and the position then seemed to be the other way, that very little consideration was given to persons whose property was about to be taken.  In respect of property about to be taken by a local authority the usual compensation is awarded for value plus approximately 10 per cent. where it has to be yielded up whether the owner wishes it or not.  In this case the water that is about to be taken may leave property practically valueless. We are entitled to ensure, as far as we can, that the legislation we are passing will deal equitably between the citizens and the State, and that anyone who has any objection to the local authority getting what it wants, will be able to make a case.  The objection is to getting <Col N="968" /> it at a price that would penalise certain interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment is simply to secure the position of people dissatisfied with arbitration.  It does not at all suggest doing away with arbitration.  It is only persons who would not be satisfied with the arbitration who would have the right to go to court.  I think we should be very slow to take from persons the right to go to court if they so desire.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is convinced, apparently, that this would not be an improvement inside the framework of the Bill but he has not gone on to tell us in what way it would not.  Personally, I cannot see any prospect of endless litigation by giving people who are dissatisfied with an arbitration award the right to go to court.  If, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, the arbitration is fair, equitable and just, you will have no litigation and no appeals to the court.  If a man gets what is fair and just, he certainly will not risk his money in going further&mdash;and going to court is a very great risk.  This House should be very slow indeed to take from any man the right to go to court.  I do not see in what way it would interfere with the framework of the Bill, or how it would in any way encourage litigation, and I would not advocate the taking of that right away.  I do not know exactly in what way the board of arbitrators is selected, but this is not a question&mdash;as the Parliamentary Secretary seemed to think at one period&mdash;of the Government versus someone else: it is really a question of a local authority versus some individual.  Speaking on behalf of both, if you like, I think the right to go to court should remain, where people may be dissatisfied with the arbitrator.  I do not see why we should take the right away and would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy Brennan appreciates&mdash;I presume he does&mdash;that an objector has the right to go to court and seek the assistance of the court to prevent the provisional order coming into operation.

      <P>If he is materially damaged in his business or trade to such an extent&mdash;as it is conceivable that a man might be so damaged&mdash;that no amount of money would compensate him, in such circumstances I think we can assume that the court would not confirm a provisional order, so that the scheme would not come into operation at all.  Therefore, it is only the question now of the actual amount of compensation that we are withholding from the courts; and we are doing that because special machinery was set up by Act of Parliament for the purpose of assessing damage in circumstances such as these.  That machinery has been found satisfactory.  In actual fact, the panel of arbitrators would be more experienced in assessing the true values in such cases than even a High Court judge, as they are men of special training in that particular judicial function.  They are judges in effect, with that limited scope that they are only called into action as judges in the matter of compensation when land or other such rights are being acquired.</P>
      <P>I still think that the system is sound: in practice it has been found to work satisfactorily.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Brennan says, I do feel that, if we leave the matter of compensation one that can be determined in the ordinary courts, we will have a spate of litigation.  It is all right to say that the courts give satisfaction. They give satisfaction when you win your case and you are fully satisfied; but if you lose you are just as dissatisfied with the court as you would be with the arbitrator.</P>

That is what I would like to maintain.  The Parliamentary Secretary has endeavoured to draw a parallel in this with the right which a man has at the moment to go to court against a proposal.  I do not think there is any comparison at all to be made there.  After all, a man has a right to go to court against the proposal being carried out.  That is a separate matter altogether.  Then, when the proposal is carried out and in operation, and when damage can be seen and valued, I want him to have the right to go to court, if he is not satisfied with the value.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Before Section 17, page 9, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> (1) Any officer or agent of a sanitary authority who is duly authorised in that behalf by such sanitary authority may, subject to the provisions of this section, enter on any land at all reasonable times between the hours of nine o'clock in the forenoon and six o'clock in the after noon for either of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) ascertaining whether an adequate supply of water can conveniently be taken from a particular source of water;</P>
    <P>(b) repairing or maintaining any pipes, conduits or other works on such land which are used by such sanitary authority for the purposes of a supply of water.</P>
    <P>(2) A person entering on land under the foregoing sub-section of this section may do on such land all such things as are reasonably necessary for the purpose for which such entry was made and, in particular, may survey, make plans, take levels, set up gauges to record the flow of water, make excavations, and examine the depth and nature of the subsoil.</P>
    <P>(3) Before any person enters on any land under this section, the sanitary authority on whose authority such entry is proposed to be made shall either obtain the consent (in the case of occupied land) of the occupier or (in the case of unoccupied land) the owner or shall cause not less than fourteen days' notice in writing of the intention to make such entry to be given to such occupier or such owner (as the case may be).</P>
    <P>(4) Any person to whom a notice of intention to enter on land has been given under the next preceding sub-section of this section may, not later than fourteen days after the giving of such notice, apply to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which such land is situate, on notice to the sanitary authority by whom or on <Col N="973" /> whose behalf such notice was given, for an order prohibiting the said entry on such land, and, upon the hearing of such application, such justice may, if he so thinks proper, either wholly prohibit such entry on such land or specify conditions to be observed by the person making such entry.</P>
    <P>(5) Where a justice of the District Court prohibits under the next preceding sub-section of this section a proposed entry on land, it shall not be lawful for any person to enter on such land under this section, and where a justice of the District Court specifies under the said next preceding sub-section of this section conditions to be observed by persons entering on land under this section, every person who so enters on such land shall observe the conditions so specified.</P>
    <P>(6) Any person who suffers damage by anything done on any land under this section and, within one month after such thing is done, makes to the sanitary authority on whose authority such land was entered under this section a claim for compensation in respect of such damage, shall be entitled to be paid by such sanitary authority reasonable compensation for such damage and to recover such compensation (when the amount thereof has been agreed upon or has been determined under the next following sub-section of this section) from such sanitary authority in any court of competent jurisdiction as a simple contract debt.</P>
    <P>(7) In default of agreement, the amount of any compensation payable by a sanitary authority under the next preceding sub-section of this section shall, if the amount claimed in respect thereof does not exceed twenty pounds, be determined by the District Court or, in any other case, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (as amended by subsequent enactments) as if such compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <P>(8) Every person who shall, by act or omission, obstruct an officer or <Col N="974" /> agent of a sanitary authority in the lawful exercise of the powers conferred by this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding one pound for every day on which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>It is a formidable-looking amendment, but it is really a machinery amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have read this amendment correctly, it seems a most amazing proposal.  Sub-section (1) starts off by saying that a sanitary authority may enter land between the hours of 9 and 6 for doing two things. One of these is simple&mdash;to ascertain whether a supply of water can conveniently be taken from a particular source of water.  I think that is reasonable. But (b) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...repairing or maintaining any pipes, conduits or other works on such land which are used by such sanitary authority for the purposes of a supply of water.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I read that sub-section, if a water main crosses certain land and bursts at 6.10 p.m., it cannot be touched until after 9 o'clock in the morning.  The position is made even worse by sub-section (3) because, if the owner or the occupier of the land refuses permission to enter, entry on the land can only be made on 14 days' notice, so that for 14 days the fountain may go on, and the sanitary authority may look at it from the roadside and think what a wonderful waste of water is proceeding. I hope I have misread the amendment, but, if I have read it correctly, I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that it is a preposterous situation to have.</P>

      <P>That is one of the points.  The other refers to the hours of 9 o'clock in the forenoon and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, as set out in sub-section (1).  They are unreasonable. There ought to be the full 24 <Col N="975" /> hours for (b), but in the other case I think it should be 10 o'clock in the forenoon and 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I would not mind a later hour in the summer, but in winter 4 o'clock is more reasonable.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
      <P>(1) Where a sanitary authority is, immediately before the passing of this Act, taking water from a source of water for the purposes of a water supply provided by them under the Public Health Acts, 1878 to 1931, no court shall grant or issue any injunction or order to restrain or having the effect of restraining such sanitary authority from continuing to take water from such source of water at the place, by the method, or in the quantity at, by, and in which they are so taking water immediately before the passing of this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Doyle, I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 9, in lines 25 and 26, to delete the words &ldquo;Where a sanitary authority is immediately before the passing of this Act, taking water&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;Where a sanitary authority has been, during the whole of the period of six months immediately preceding the passing of this Act, taking water&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> This amendment is merely putting a period in respect of the taking of water.  For example, a local authority might come in and say: &ldquo;We will inspect that place next week, but in the meantime, for three or four days, we will take water from it.&rdquo;  We think there ought to be a period and we think six months is short enough.  It establishes a <i>bona fide</i> taking the water over a period and it does not give any loophole.  It is unlikely a local authority would do anything so shady as that.  We ought to have a period which gives them some standing and six months could not be considered unreasonable. If the Parliamentary Secretary would like to consider the matter, we can leave it over.</P>

      <P>Could we have a little enlightenment on this section?  I know we are not on the section, but I think it is relevant at this stage to have some enlightenment as to what is the purpose of the section.  The suggestion behind it, as it stands and as it would be if it is amended, is that there is a certain right which exists and this Bill is going to take that right away.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would explain to us what exactly is that right and why it is going to be taken away and, if there is no such right in existence, why is this section in the Bill at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <P>Leaving the amendment aside for the moment, with the permission of the Chair, and turning to the section, we find that where a sanitary authority is, immediately before the passing of this Act, taking water from a source of water for the purposes of a water supply provided by them under the Public Health Acts, no court shall grant or issue any injunction or order to restrain them.  As Deputies, I am sure, appreciate, the section applies to existing schemes, schemes that are at present operating or that will be in full operation at the <Col N="977" /> time this Act was passed.  The section merely ensures that, regardless of any doubt that might exist as to whether the law had been fully and completely complied with and understood in the past, if an objection has not been taken heretofore, when this Bill becomes law all litigation and the seeking of injunctions regarding existing water supplies shall cease.  It may appear drastic, if you like but, at the same time, unless the law were found defective, this Bill would not be before the House at all.  It has been found, in the case of people who complained of damage, that, so far as the application of common sense and reason could estimate any damage to them, the damage would be nil.  But people who, perhaps, live 10, 15 or 20 miles from the source of a water supply are beginning to wake up to the legal possibilities of securing damages from the local authority.  Perhaps this very debate will inspire them to increased activity, but at any rate the section is undoubtedly necessary in order to ensure that existing water supplies will not be interfered with by the courts or by anybody else in the future.  Since 1878 they have had ample time to seek redress or secure compensation if they were adversely affected by the water schemes.</P>
      <P>I will draw the attention of the House to Section 18 (2):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect the right of any person to recover from a sanitary authority damages for any wrongful interference by such sanitary authority with the property of such person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the sanitary authority in any way exceed their statutory rights, the person affected has still full legal right to go to court and secure damages against them.  The sanitary authority are bound under Section 18 not to take more water, not to vary the method or to increase the quantity that they have been taking in the past, before the passing of this legislation.  The section sets out that no court shall grant or issue any injunction or order</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;to restrain a sanitary authority <Col N="978" /> from continuing to take water from such source of water at the place, by the method or in the quantity at, by, and in which they are so taking water immediately before the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now they must continue to take it by the same method, in the same quantity, and at the same place, and I think they are fairly completely bound up in that and that, in return, having been so tied up by Section 18, they are entitled to protection from any injunction or any effort to restrain them from continuing to take the water they were entitled to take under the Public Health Act before this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the objection that the Parliamentary Secretary has to this amendment, or has he any objection to it?  It is perfectly reasonable. It puts a date.  It gives a period of six months, whereas, if the present Bill is passed, are they not clear if they take water on the day immediately before the Act is passed?  Perhaps I might be permitted to put a particular case to the Parliamentary Secretary. Some 30 years ago it was found that the water from the city watercourse was not getting into the Basin in Basin Lane, and the corporation started work pumping out mud, and so on.  Then, later, it was discovered that the water from the canal was getting into the Basin and that that had been going on for a long time.  Now, supposing that had happened yesterday, and that this Bill passes into law to-day, the corporation could claim that they could leave that stand and be perfectly entitled to take the water.  I do not think that is the Parliamentary Secretary's intention, but as the clause stands now, if passed, the very fact that the water was going in entitles the corporation to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The corporation would not be taking that water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was before the House on Second Reading I was rather suspicious of the reason for its introduction, and I was afraid that there was something behind Section 18, something specific in the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary. I am still suspicious because the Parliamentary Secretary has been unearthing a lot of bogeys here to-night, feeble bogeys, in regard to people asserting rights which they never thought they had.  He even said that it was possible that the discussion here now in the House would bring these people to a realisation of their rights. I was rather afraid that the Bill was being introduced to meet some specific case, where some local authority, without, possibly, exercising the care and attention which they ought to have exercised, went ahead with a scheme and then found themselves in the position that there might be litigation over it, and felt this section was going to get them out.  What I feel about this section is that we are going to let down somebody between two stools. The Parliamentary Secretary, apparently, says that this section is necessary. Very well, then, if it is necessary, we propose changing the existing situation by this section, but at the same time, in passing this Bill, we are making a certain provision here giving people the right to object.  That right cannot be exercised until the Bill is passed, but we are taking the other right from this man by this section, the right which, apparently, he had, and now he is going to have no right whatever. He has not the right of objection until the Bill is passed, and we are going to take whatever right he has at the moment by Section 18.  I am not at all convinced by the statement which the Parliamentary Secretary has made with regard to the possibility of a lot of litigation if we do not pass this.  This sub-section (2), which gives a man a right to damages, is a different matter <Col N="980" /> of course.  Damages, compensation, and the right to go ahead with a scheme are three different matters altogether, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary would need to do a lot better than he has done in order to convince the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid he cannot. I am afraid the Parliamentary Secretary is taking away a right that somebody has, although that person has not the right which we propose to give him under the Bill.  He has not the right of objection which we give him under the Bill.  He has a right in law, but we are going to take damn good care that he will not exercise it.  We need not go back as far as 1878, the year to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, but a scheme may be in operation for six months, three months, or even a month, and that man ought to have some right, but the Minister proposes taking that from him.  I do not agree with that at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary would do well to tell us exactly why this particular section is inserted at all.  This section, Deputy Brennan thinks, is going to interfere with or prevent somebody from seeking a legal right where they have been damaged.  As a matter of fact, the effect of this section is to stop a person, who has already taken legal action to protect his property against a local authority and who has already got an injunction from the High Court and has also got damages, from asserting his rights so long as an appeal is pending.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health, of which the Parliamentary Secretary is the spokesman, hopes that by this section, when the Bill is passed, this man cannot proceed one inch further, although the High Court has already granted him an injunction.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do well, and so does the Parliamentary Secretary know the case, and when it is said that the <Col N="981" /> person is 18 miles from the source of his supply you can put your finger on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, there are people in this country who have rights that are very important to themselves in particular, but that are equally important to their neighbours as a result of the services that these rights can render them.  They are various, but I am not going to particularise.  I am going to try to generalise from a particular case, because I am not an advocate for either the plaintiffs or the defendants in the case.  Here is a man who has a water right to run his mill for the grinding of oats, wheat, and several other things, and a local authority, without consulting him or serving any notice on him, comes along and builds a concrete wall across the source of his supply.  That having been done, he draws attention to the fact that they have encroached upon his rights.  Then they offer him £50 damages, but he wants the water rights because no money could pay him for the loss of them.  If you were to give him an engine you would have to supply him with coal or coke which, under present conditions, would be very little use to him, but this water supply is there and is useful to him. This local authority, as I say, builds a concrete wall across the source of his supply, which does happen to be a considerable number of miles away from him.  He then takes an action in the High Court, gets an injunction, and is awarded damages, but an appeal is lodged and, while the appeal is pending, the local authority is proceeding to use that water supply and he cannot do anything. If we do pass this section I want the Dáil to know what they are doing, and on the reading of this section it would appear that he might as well withdraw his case from the Supreme Court as there is no use in his proceeding further.  This section, in my opinion, is a dangerous section, and should not be allowed.  A person has a right to get damages under sub-section (2), but he can only get damages if the local authority exceeds <Col N="982" /> its statutory rights; therefore, he will get nothing, because no local authority will be allowed by the Department, I presume, to exceed its statutory rights. Therefore, I do not think the amendment exactly meets what I want, but I desire to protest in the strongest possible manner against the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the section mean that, if there is a flagrantly wrongful interference by the sanitary authority with the owner, that person cannot obtain any injunction from the court?  It seems to me to be contrary to all justice.  There is in sub-section (2) definite recognition of the fact that a person is to be entitled to damages for wrongful interference.  That must mean, as Deputy MacEoin pointed out, the exceeding by the sanitary authority of its statutory rights under this Act.  Surely the two sections are a contradiction of each other?  I take it that it is not the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to give to the sanitary authority protection under sub-section (1) where there has been a wrongful interference.  That, surely, is not the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary, but it is, I submit, the interpretation of sub-section (1).  Surely, that is not the intention of the section or of the Bill?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 19, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;navigable water&rdquo; means any river or canal on which any person is, by virtue of any enactment, entitled to navigate or in respect of the navigation on which any person is, by virtue of any enactment, entitled to receive tolls or dues, and the expression &ldquo;navigation authority&rdquo; means, in relation to any navigable water, the person entitled to navigate thereon or to receive tolls or dues in respect of navigation thereon.</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in this Act shall be construed as entitling a sanitary authority to take water in such manner, or from such source of water, or of such amount as to make the navigation of any navigable water impossible or unreasonably difficult.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a sanitary authority make a proposal, they may at any time, whether before or after such proposal comes into force, give to the navigation authority of any navigable water written notice of such proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where the navigation authority of any navigable water is given by a sanitary authority notice under sub-section (3) of this section in relation to any proposal, such navigation <Col N="985" /> authority may, before (but not after) the expiration of 21 days from the giving of such notice, give written notice (in this section referred to as an interference notice) to such sanitary authority that the taking of water in accordance with such proposal makes or will make the navigation of such navigable water impossible or unreasonably difficult.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a navigation authority has given an interference notice to a sanitary authority in relation to any proposal, such sanitary authority may alter such proposal by reducing the amount of water to be taken thereunder and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if such proposal had come into force before such notice was given, it shall continue in force as so altered and this Act shall apply accordingly, and</P>
    <P>(b)  if such proposal had not come into force before such notice was given, anything done in relation to such proposal in compliance with this Act by such sanitary authority before the giving of such notice shall be deemed to have been so done in respect of such proposal as so altered and this Act shall apply accordingly.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a navigation authority gives an interference notice, such navigation authority may at any time withdraw such notice by giving written notice in that behalf to the relevant sanitary authority.</P>
    <P>(7)  A sanitary authority to whom an interference notice relating to any proposal has been given may apply to the High Court for the annulment of such notice and, if the High Court on such application is of opinion that the taking of water in accordance with such proposal does not make or will not make the navigation of the relevant navigable water impossible or unreasonably difficult, the High Court shall annul such notice.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where notice of a proposal has been given under sub-section (3) of this section to a navigation authority and either such navigation authority has not within 21 days after the giving of such notice given an interference <Col N="986" /> notice in relation to such proposal or any such notice so made has been annulled by the High Court or withdrawn, it shall not be open to such navigation authority to contend in any court that the taking of water in accordance with such proposal makes or will make the navigation of the relevant navigable water impossible or unreasonably difficult.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions of the Public Health Acts do not permit a sanitary authority to interfere with a canal, and it is proposed to protect, similarly, navigable water as regards the taking of water under this Bill.  It is not a case for prohibiting altogether the taking of water, and, if there is more water flowing than is required for the needs of the navigation authority, the surplus should be capable of being taken for a water supply.  The reasonable requirements of the navigation authority are met and the sanitary authority are prevented from taking water to such an extent as to make navigation impossible or unreasonably difficult.  The amendment proposed will afford an opportunity for agreement between the sanitary authority and the navigation authority, if ever the question arises.  Should it appear to the sanitary authority that their proposals, for example, may possibly involve taking water from a river from which water is taken for a canal, they will give the navigation authority notice. If the navigation authority consider that navigation will be affected, they will serve an interference notice.  The sanitary authority may amend the proposal, or may appeal to the courts against the interference notice, and the court can come to a conclusion in the case having regard to any amendments made by the sanitary authority in its original proposals.  An amendment on those lines was referred to on Second Reading.  I undertook, on the Second Reading, to introduce an amendment protecting navigation rights.  I have tried, in this amendment, to protect navigation rights, and at the same time to permit of the possibility of taking from a canal surplus water that may be necessary for a water scheme and may not be necessary for navigation purposes.</P>

      <P>It appeared to me, when I saw this amendment, that the Parliamentary Secretary went a good deal of the way towards meeting the case that was put up on behalf of the Grand Canal Company by Deputy Alderman Doyle, the Lord Mayor. Now, my opinion is that the company is not quite satisfied.  Apart altogether from the navigation which is undertaken by the company, and which is rather difficult at the present moment, during the summer&mdash;particularly during a period of drought&mdash;the company has to take smaller loads on their boats in the higher levels of the canal. The canal's highest level is between the 18th and the 19th lock, and then from the 18th lock it comes down to Dublin very steeply.  In that 17 or 18 miles there is an average of a lock a mile. From the 19th lock, which is somewhere beyond Robertstown, it falls down to Shannon harbour.  In addition to its ordinary navigation, the company sells water to the Dublin Corporation for brewers and distillers and to the railroads at four different points&mdash; Inchicore, Harcourt Street, Sallins and Portarlington; to a factory at Kilmainham, to a factory at Dolphin's Barn, to the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company, to builders in Grand Canal Street, to the Glass Bottle Company in Ringsend and five other bodies or factories of one kind or another.  Whether a supply is going to constitute a drain on the resources of the company depends very much where the supply will be taken from.  The Dublin Corporation takes, I think, over 3,000,000 gallons annually and considerable expense was incurred in putting up filter beds somewhere between the 4th lock and the 7th or 8th lock.  I am not sure of the exact location but I have seen them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a feeling that while the amendment is designed to deal entirely with navigation, the fact of the existence of these supplies might be taken as a reason why they should be transferred to the local authority.  I do not think the Minister intends that but at any rate, between now and the Report Stage, I should be very glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would look <Col N="988" /> into that point and see whether or not they are covered with regard to those supplies.  I think that they supply under statute to the Dublin Corporation. Possibly they are not under statute with regard to the other supplies. As I say, I make no case whatever here&mdash;and I think the company would not make a case either&mdash;for refusing to supply water if it were there.  The objection is that in recent times, by reason of drought, they have not got a sufficiency of water for navigation purposes.  I think that we should hesitate before imposing any greater handicaps on a company which is performing a useful function, giving employment, and which is a source of very great convenience to traders, turf producers and industrialists generally. It would be a pity if, in a case of this sort, by reason of legislation we passed here, we were to make it difficult or impossible for the company to fulfil functions they had fulfilled in the commercial life of the country up to date.  I shall be quite satisfied if the Minister would undertake between now and the Report Stage to look into this matter and ensure that they will remain unhampered in their normal sources of supply to those concerns I have mentioned.  I think that would be as important to them as their navigation.</P>

      <P>In drafting this amendment, as the amendment indicates on the face of it, I had in mind, primarily and mainly, the question of safeguarding the navigation rights of a navigation company in navigable waters.  In so far as it has been possible, within the framework of the Bill, to protect and safeguard these rights I think the amendment does so. Deputy Cosgrave has now raised other matters which I have no doubt are matters of very serious concern to the Canal Company and perhaps to other navigation companies, and I shall readily undertake very carefully to examine the points and the representations he has made in the matter.  At the same time, I want to say that the Canal Company to which Deputy Cosgrave has referred, is clearly deriving a considerable source of its income and <Col N="989" /> revenue from the sale of water.  It has become a commercial business with the company, which is getting the water for nothing.  It has been very useful to have that water supply available, and it may be very desirable that it should continue, but what we have to bear in mind in relation to these matters is that we have to endeavour to try to strike a balance between the commercial rights of such concerns and the rights of the community as a whole, who may require a pure and wholesome water supply.  I felt that if I secured that the navigation rights would not be curtailed or interfered with, or that the navigation would not be made more difficult, that would be meeting all that the Canal Company could reasonably ask me to meet.</P>
      <P>I feel now from what Deputy Cosgrave said that I am asked to go a considerable distance further.  If Deputy Brennan had not left the House, he would not like, I am sure, to make this type of speech, but if Deputy Cosgrave were not here possibly he would&mdash;that we were quite prepared to interfere with the riparian rights of a farmer or, as Deputy MacEoin said, with the rights of the mill owner, and the only redress he had was compensation.  In logic and reason, it is hard to see why compensation should not be the only redress for the company, a commercial concern. There is a difference inasmuch as the canal company has certain statutory rights, but it has only statutory rights, as far as I understand the position, in relation to navigation.  I do not think it has any statutory rights in relation to taking water or holding water for the purposes of sale.  The magnitude of the interests involved is a consideration that one would have to bear in mind.  I gather from Deputy Cosgrave that the commercial interests involved in the disposal of water by the Grand Canal Company are very extensive, much more extensive than I was aware of, and one would have to bear that in mind in coming to a decision.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government has failed to make adequate provision of food supplies for man and beast in the coming year, and that the Government be requested at once to make a full and detailed census of land cropped and to be cropped in the present season.  That any shortage revealed by the census should be at once made good by the Government taking such action as it deems necessary to provide an adequate food supply so as to dispel the remotest possibility of famine, which now seems inevitable if extraordinary measures are not taken forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for about six months.  It is a pity that it is not out of date and that we are not back to normality.  Unfortunately it is still in date, inasmuch as it applies to any coming year as well as the original year.  We now have proof of the anticipation of six months ago.  We had an interesting debate for two or three days on the Supplementary Estimate for the Minister for Supplies and that showed us the difficulties which are ahead.  Let us look at the statistics for the last normal year, namely, 1938.  These are taken from the Agricultural Statistics published by the Minister for Agriculture for the year 1938-39.  I think the Minister will accept these as basic working figures.  Pre-war, we imported about half the feeding stuffs we required for our live stock.  We milled all our flour. We had from our flour, which was a 70 per cent. extract from wheat, about 200,000 tons of feeding stuff.  Starting this cereal year we had none of these. The food position in this country is, and has been since the war started, a question of providing the nation with sufficient wheat, oats and barley.  The problem before the Minister for Agriculture was primarily one of calculation. He required 500,000 or 600,000 acres of wheat to give us sufficient for our total needs.  He required oats and barley not only to fill the position that they had been filling pre-war, but also to stand against the 50 per cent. of the live stock feeding stuffs that could be imported no longer.  He had also to provide an extra quantity of oats and <Col N="992" /> barley for feeding stuffs instead of the 200,000 tons, or very nearly that quantity, of offals which, owing to the increase in the extraction of flour from wheat from 70 to 95 per cent., would be no longer available for feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>That was the problem that confronted the Minister and I do not think he approached that problem in any reasonable way.  It is true that in 1939 he made an order fixing the minimum amount of arable land that should be under tillage.  In 1940 he increased that minimum amount and for the present year he has increased it still further.  But he has not tackled the problem in anything like a scientific way.  As a matter of calculation, what was required?  He wanted, as I said, 500,000 acres of wheat.  Let us assume that a normal crop would give us the quantity required.</P>
    <P>That wheat can only be procured in one way, that is, by putting 500,000 acres under the wheat crop.  The Minister's tillage order has no relation whatever to the production of the wheat we require.  We want that amount.  We want that 500,000 acres of wheat.  I think it will be accepted by the Minister that about 5 per cent. of the arable land if put under wheat would give us our requirements. I think the Minister will accept that.  Why did the Minister not seek 5 per cent. of the arable land for wheat?  Any order he has made since the war started could be complied with 100 per cent. without one grain of wheat being sowed.  I do not think that was tackling the situation as it should be tackled.  That and similar considerations in regard to other cereal crops prompted us to put down this motion.  We are short of oats and barley for feeding stuffs.  In this year we had 778,900 acres of oats.  In 1938 we had 570,000 acres of oats.  That represents an increase of 200,000 acres, but I do not think the Minister will argue that that increase in oats will give us sufficient animal feeding stuffs to compensate for the feeding stuffs that we imported pre-war and also for the loss of flour-milling offals, not to say anything about the necessity which may or may not arise of having to mix some of those cereals in the grist for <Col N="993" /> our bread flour.  The barley grown went up from 117,000 acres in 1938 to 169,000 acres in the current year.  I do not think that is at all adequate to meet the deficiency caused by our inability to import barley.  The loss in maize is a very considerable item against which we have made no set-off here.  Another matter that aggravates the live-stock position is that in 1938 we had 3,600,000 acres of hay whereas in the present year we have only 1,983,900 acres.  In the present year we have 4,178,000 cattle whereas in 1938 we had only 4,000,000.  We had nearly twice the amount of hay in 1938 and we had considerably less cattle.  In every item of agriculture that matters there is a shortage and that creates a very serious situation for the country.  This is not a farming matter; this is a national matter.  It creates a very serious situation for the country when we permit a condition of affairs to go on without making any attempt to provide sufficient food for man and beast. I think the Minister will agree that in the present season, stall-feeding time, there is very little stall-feeding being carried on.  There is not sufficient hand-feeding being done to produce milk on account of the loss of fodder. The position is further aggravated by the increased cattle population due to restrictions during the epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease.  The existence of foot-and-mouth disease in the spring should have spurred the Minister to action and he should have foreseen that, even with the most expeditious handling of the scourge that he could possibly hope for, there would certainly have to be over-holding in cattle. Cattle that would in the ordinary course be marketed in the fairs of March and April had to be held over in the store cattle raising areas.  That, perhaps, more than anything else, has occasioned the great curtailment in the area under hay.</P>
    <P>It would be a very difficult matter to estimate how much barley and oats should be grown here to make up the deficiency caused by the non-importation of feeding stuffs, but there is no need for finely-cut arguments.  On the face of it, there is a large discrepancy and, as in the case of wheat, there <Col N="994" /> is only one way to produce substitutes and that is by growing them.  I would suggest to the Minister the only safe way of dealing with this situation, which is now perhaps aggravated more than in any of the previous years of the war, and that is by growing food.  If we want, say, the produce of 1,000,000 acres of oats there is no way on God's earth of getting that except by growing 1,000,000 acres.  I am not one who would advocate compulsion.  As a matter of fact, I am an absolute believer in individual freedom in every way but, up against it as we are now, there is no way of meeting the situation except by laying down the amount that must be cropped, not in the aggregate, but in the crops that we are short of&mdash;wheat, oats and barley.</P>
    <P>I submit&mdash;I do not mind whether it pleases or vexes farmer friends of mine&mdash;there is only one way of meeting the situation, and that is by ascertaining the percentage of home-grown wheat that is necessary to give us bread of an agreed standard, not counting at all the overseas trade.  Similarly in respect of oats and barley.  If we do that, we shall be safe; if we do not do it, we may look out for squalls, and the squalls will be of our own making, and made by us with our eyes open. It is the Minister's duty to tell us how he arrives at this 25 per cent.  This motion overlaps another motion.  I have to mention it in dealing with this point.  The Minister must have some figures.  I am sure that it was not as a result of just a chance shot that he prescribed 25 per cent. In looking for the figures, he felt, I am sure : &ldquo;There is not enough this year, and we shall have to do a little better next year&rdquo;, and I want him to tell us how he built up that percentage. If it meets the case and he can prove it, I shall be one of the first to admit that he has made proper preparation for the coming year, but if an order is to be made, I suggest that the Minister must have an order or orders within an order.  We must have enough of these feeding stuffs if we are not only to maintain the human and the live-stock population, but to have something to sell in a foreign market which will buy, on foreign exchanges, the <Col N="995" /> things we want here and cannot produce here.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal any further with the live-stock angle, but I propose to deal with the wheat position.  I thought the debate of the last few days on the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Supplies was very interesting. It put the case very clearly for anybody who wants to understand it.  The Minister made his case in tabloid form, and it is handy that it has come at this juncture.  I think it a pity that he does not come to the House with an estimate in advance and ask for £2,000,000 or £2,500,000, or whatever the subsidy may be which he wants next year.  If he did so, we would talk to him, but he came to us with a <i>fait accompli</i> in the last few days and, when cornered, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What are you to do?  This is the present position.  You cannot go to a mine and mine wheat.  We are dealing with the cereal year which has to carry us over to next year's crop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We could do nothing but give the Minister what he asked, but if he were dealing now with next year, and if he said: &ldquo;We expect so many acres of wheat to be grown this year and so much produce.  That will fall short of our requirements by so much as will make it necessary for us to import so much, and the prices to be fixed will aggregate so much above what we think fair that we shall have to throw in £2,000,000, or whatever the sum may be, to keep the loaf at its present price&rdquo;, we could talk to him on a business basis and could tell him: &ldquo;You are banking too much on supplies from abroad, and paying too much for the foreign product.  We will produce it at a price and the subsidy will be only so much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister for Agriculture to protect the agricultural arm of this nation, and to put it to the Minister for Supplies that he, representing agriculture, can guarantee a certain quantity of wheat, but that the price must be so much, and let them between them arrange what the subsidy should be and how it should be distributed.  I will make a suggestion to him.  To <Col N="996" /> start with, I think this situation should be handled now in a businesslike way, and he is no businessman who banks for his breakfast on flour which has to cross the Atlantic.  We must start off on this basis, that we must grow this coming year sufficient wheat to give us bread of whatever standard you like. We must pay for that wheat.  I am not going to argue prices now, but I may quote them to illustrate my case.  The Minister dealt with £2,000,000 of a subsidy, and he wants 370,000 tons of wheat.  That quantity on last year's price cost the country £5,800,000, and this year a similar amount cost the country £7,800,000.  He has got in 80,000 tons of wheat, and he banks on 290,000 tons from the native crop.  He says we cannot alter these figures, that this is the wheat we have on hands, and that the cost is so much. &ldquo;If we charge all the cost to the bread, the bread will be 1/2 per 4-lb. loaf,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I am asking the Dáil for £2,000,000 to stabilise the price of bread on the basis of the present extraction, so that there will have to be no increase in the loaf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that he set himself the task of raising sufficient wheat here for our own requirements and that he holds on to that subsidy of £2,000,000.  For his consideration, I put forward a method of using that subsidy and meeting all claimants under the scheme.  I will not argue whether wheat should be £3 per barrel or not, but, for the purpose of argument, I anchor my case to that price.  Instead of subsidising all the bread, let us subsidise half of it.  Let us throw the £2,000,000 into half the bread we require on a 95 per cent. extraction, and let us not subsidise the other half.  Let it be a 70 per cent. extraction and sell the flour at cost.  I suggest it would work out something like this:&mdash;95 per cent. extraction of wheat would represent 185,000 tons for half flour, and at £3 a barrel that would amount to £4,440,000. For a 70 per cent. extraction you would want 265,000 tons of wheat for half our flour requirements.  In the aggregate, under this scheme, you would want to produce 450,000 tons of wheat instead of 370,000 tons.  You <Col N="997" /> need not follow any further the 265,000 tons required for flour of a 70 per cent. extraction, because I suggest that the people who can afford it will pay the extra price for white flour.  Very well, let them have it and give them the opportunity of paying for it.  We need only follow the 185,000 tons of the 95 per cent. extraction.  That will cost £4,440,000.  Let us deal with the basic price that the Minister for Supplies wants to anchor himself to, namely, the cost of flour to the nation last year. That amounted to £5,800,000.  Half of that would be £2,900,000.  If you throw the £2,000,000 subsidy into subsidising half the flour, you have this position: that you have the cost of half the bread required for the nation at £2,400,000 instead of £2,900,000.  You therefore save £500,000 which you can put into the Exchequer or utilise it for the purpose of reducing the cost of the 4lb. loaf by another penny, and give the producer £3 a barrel for his wheat.  It may be asked who is going to pay the increased price for the white bread. I suggest that if my proposal is put into effect, more of the dark bread that we have at present will be left unsold than the white bread.  I am satisfied that the farmers of this country, if they get the price, will do their part.  I am not going to labour the question of price.  I simply refer to it to illustrate my point.  I am afraid the Ceann Comhairle thinks that I am sailing close to the wind.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture should give careful consideration to my point.  We are not living in a fool's paradise.  The Minister knows that what I have said is the case, and I know it.  I could take him to shops where the bread is not only sold but baked, and where the half-pound loaf, baked from white flour, is selling at 4½d.  I know that within the last week £74 a ton was refused for white flour in the City of Dublin.  That would run to £6 or £7 a barrel for wheat.  If we have people here who will pay that price for flour, and other people who will grow <Col N="998" /> the wheat, why are we not giving that price?  Why do we not grow the wheat and provide the flour when, with the 95 per cent. extraction, we could put up the flour at a cheaper cost to the State than we are doing it now.  I think I have stated the bare bones of the case, and that there is no need for me to say more on the matter.  I think the House understands the case I have made.  I am anxious to hear the opinion of the House on it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I do not know what the price would work out at if you had to pay £74 a ton for the white flour.  I know, as I have said, that that price was offered for white flour last week in the City of Dublin, and it would not be sold at that price.  I can tell the Minister this, that nowhere in the City of Dublin is there such a demand for this white flour as in the working class districts where the corporation has carried out its new housing schemes.  I think an effort should be made to provide it.  If we cannot provide the white flour generally, because the price would be too high, let us provide the other flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the bread we have is good bread.  I am not saying anything against it, but the majority of people would prefer the white flour.  I say, give it to them and let them pay for it, but do not ask the taxpayer to subsidise it.  Even if you continue to do as you are doing, to subsidise 50 per cent. of your flour, I am quite satisfied that in spite of that there would still be more of the white flour bought. It would be bought at nearly any price that you put on it.  It is quite easy to calculate what a ton of flour <Col N="999" /> would cost if you are paying £3 a barrel for the wheat.  It certainly would not be 74/- a cwt. or for 2 cwts. either.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton has stated that this motion has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  I do not agree with him that the Government have failed to make adequate provision with regard to food supplies.  I take the position as we found it in 1931.  For a generation, one might say, the farming community were reared up to and followed a certain system of farming. To change them over to a different system takes a long time.  In 1931, there were 20,000 acres of wheat grown here.  That would not give Deputy Belton many white loaves.  It would not provide the City of Dublin with bread for any extended period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Starting in 1933, the acreage grew each year, principally because this Government was prepared to pay the country more for wheat grown at home than for imported wheat.  That was the condition of affairs up to the outbreak of the present war.  In 1940, 305,000 acres of wheat were grown, against 20,000 acres in 1931.  In 1941, the acreage under wheat was increased by 186,000 acres to 491,000 acres, or practically 500,000 acres after this year's harvest.  That is a record that any Government might well be proud of, particularly a nation that was absolutely dependent on foreigners when the present Minister assumed office.  In order to provide our daily bread the nation has now practically reached a state of self-sufficiency. That is a big feat considering the odds and remembering that Deputies were depending on this, that and the other argument in the campaign that was carried on for three years against the growing of wheat; and that our daily papers day after day attacked the Government for advocating that policy.  In my opinion the Government performed a great feat. <Col N="1000" /> We grew 662,000 acres of oats in 1931. That was before motor cars took the place of &ldquo;nags&rdquo; and when there was a market for horses.  At that time we grew 115,000 acres of barley which was sold for about 13/- a barrel.  In 1940, we grew 680,000 acres of oats and in 1941, 778,000 acres.  We increased the acreage of barley from 115,000 acres in 1931, to 132,000 acres in 1940, and to 169,000 acres in 1941.  In fact, we doubled the acreage under grain crops. The acreage rose from 775,000 in 1931, to 1,438,000 in 1941.  I am not saying that we did sufficient but it was a big effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We may thank the farmers for doing that despite the codology that was preached by the deputy leader of the Opposition.  He stated that it was codology to grow wheat and that he would not be found amongst those who grew it.  We should remember that if the present war started in September, 1931, instead of in September, 1939, within a month we would have to turn to the British asking: &ldquo;What do you want from us, or what can we give you in order to get bread for our people?  How many hundred thousand men do you want as cannon fodder for Flanders so that we may get bread for our people?&rdquo;  We would have to pay the price whatever it was or starve.  That would be the conditions of affairs existing here now had this war started in 1931.  Despite that we have a motion suggesting that the Government did not take sufficient steps to make provision for the food supplies of our people.  I hold that the Government did take sufficient steps in that respect, and that the acreage grown proves that, considering all the difficulties, and the fact that the farmers were not told until April of this year to till more land.  I say that this motion is not justified.  Nobody in this House could justify it.  What about the future?  What is going to be the position of this nation in November, 1942?  That is the important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should issue an advertisement in the Press immediately, notifying farmers <Col N="1001" /> who cannot till the required 25 per cent. of arable land this year that they should so inform the nearest Gárda barracks on or before December 15. That would give them time to make up their minds; otherwise these lands could be entered on on December 16th and tilled, because there will be a big difference between land ploughed on December 16, and land ploughed in May, as was the case this year.  In the case of any farmer who does not notify the authorities, or who does not till his land, it is not 25 per cent. should be taken.  The whole of it should be divided up amongst those who are prepared to till, because we have to look to the future, and from present appearances this war is going to last, perhaps, a number of years.  We have to be in a position in 1949, if necessary, to be able to say that we have food enough for our people even if all the ships are sunk.  With the present fixed prices of crops I believe there is going to be an enormous change in the acrerage under grain during the coming year, and that instead of getting 491,000 acres of wheat at 41/- a barrel, we will be lucky if we get from 200,000 to 300,000 acres grown.  We must face the situation as we see it.  In mid-November of last year there were over 100,000 acres of wheat growing in my constituency.  I do not believe that if you go through the country to-day there are 100,000 acres.  Farmers when asked if they are tilling reply that it is time enough to do so after next March, and that oats will do next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <P>The motion suggests that the Government did not make sufficient provision for this year, but the figures I gave prove that they did. That is where this motion is wrong, <Col N="1002" /> and where the Deputy is mistaken.  If the Deputy had put down that motion last week he would be able to say something in its favour, but he put it down at a time when the Government had made provision and had increased the acreage under wheat from what it was in 1931, to 491,000 acres.  I say that the acreage next year, with fixed prices, will be roughly 300,000 acres of wheat.  I doubt if we will get that acreage as well as 1,250,000 acres of oats, and between 300,000 and 400,000 acres of barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is more serious than many Deputies realise.  It is too serious for jokes.  We have to do something now.  We may have to get compulsory powers and to tell every farmer with 100 acres of arable land that he must put ten acres under wheat as against other cereals. If a farmer is compelled to till 30 acres of land at least 15 acres should be under wheat.  We have either to go on that principle or to offer an inducement to farmers to grow wheat as against oats and barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there would be far better results if he offered an inducement to farmers now. It would be a cheaper and better economic proposition.  I have made a study of the matter and I say frankly <Col N="1003" /> that it has caused me some sleepless nights.  I come from a district where there never was any necessity to ask farmers to till 10, 15 or 20 per cent. of their land.  They generally till 40 per cent. of their holdings every year without any compulsion, so the Minister need not bother sending inspectors to that district, except to a few hardheaded sinners of the Deputy Dillon type.  We will see that the acreage is available and if we find that it is not that need not bother the Minister, because we will get the work done.  I prepared some rough data, but I find that my figures are not exactly what they should be.  From 490,000 acres under wheat, allowing seven barrels to the acre, we should get 430,000 tons of grain.  I allowed 62,500 tons for seed wheat for the coming year and that left me 367,000 tons of wheat roughly for delivery to the mills, at seven barrels to the acre.  Now, the Minister for Supplies, speaking here yesterday, told us that he banked on 290,000 tons only, and that out of that he had got up to then only some 200,000 tons. That makes the position far more serious than I thought it was.  I gambled roughly that he will be short 132,000 tons of wheat.  Imported at the price he informed us he was paying for it, that would be roughly £4,000,000. That must be paid in foreign securities and not in Irish currency.  It must be paid in American dollars.  That would be roughly about £2,500,000 more than the Irish farmer would be paid for the same quantity of wheat grown here.  I took a bonus of £3 an acre as a rough calculation.  If we offered that £3 for every acre of wheat grown, as against oats or barley, it would be £1,800,000, for 600 acres of wheat, and you would get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You would get it.  You would save £500,000, you would save all your foreign securities, as the money would stop at home; and we would see what the change would be. You would save £4,000,000 first of all in foreign securities, and then the freight space in the ships, and all the <Col N="1004" /> cash would remain here travelling around amongst the agricultural community and going from them into the pockets of the civil servants and the others who get a hold of it in the end. Also, we would not be depending on whether Herr Hitler had a submarine out or not, or whether the Japanese were watching for any freight coming from America.  All the stuff would be at home and we would be independent of outside supply.  Then, if we wanted anything in the shape of luxuries for the people, there would be freight space for 100,000 tons, and we could bring in something else&mdash;and I would suggest that that space could be very well used in bringing in artificial manures, if they can be obtained.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy deal with Deputy Belton's motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with it.  I have dealt with the first portion and I am dealing with the second portion. I have dealt with the portion where he stated six months ago that the Government had made no provision for this year, and I have proved that they have made provision.  No man will be short of bread in the present cereal year, and I hope there is not going to be a shortage in regard to animal food either; but the serious position will be that of the coming year and it is with that I with to deal principally.  Apparently, there is a divergence in policy&mdash;there is the policy of paying an uneconomic price for wheat to be grown from now on. If the present fixed price prevails, we will have to import somewhere around 200,000 tons of wheat, at whatever price the foreigner cares to charge, and at whatever price the ship owner will bring it in for.  Then there is the hope &mdash;and, to my mind, the very faint hope &mdash;that any ships will travel across the Atlantic without interference.  That is too much of a gamble for my taste, and I do not think we should gamble on what means the lives of the people, namely, our daily bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the figures I have given&mdash;which I believe to be correct&mdash;there is not only a saving, but there is a definite assurance of growing 600,000 acres of wheat at home.  I would be prepared <Col N="1005" /> to stand up here openly and pledge our farmers to grow it, and I believe they will.  I believe the farmers this year will do that, if they are told: &ldquo;You can grow oats if you like, at the fixed price; if you grow wheat, we will pay you £3 an acre bonus on it.&rdquo;  If that is too difficult for the Minister to arrange, let him give the equivalent of that £3 an acre in the price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

That is a far better insurance for Irish public money than trusting to the price the foreigner wishes to ask and to hope that the ships will bring it across the Atlantic without being sunk.  There are two ways of doing it.  One way is by compulsion. Go down to the rich lands of County Limerick where they tilled last year 5 per cent. of their holdings and, if they do not know how to till, bring down a bunch of Corkmen and they will do it for them.</P>

      <P>That is entirely a matter for the Chair.  I want to impress on Deputy Belton the situation as the Minister for Agriculture found it in 1931.  In that year there were 20,000 acres of wheat grown in this country. I am certain, if I got the files of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, or a little glimpse at the <i>Irish Times</i> or the <i>Cork Examiner</i> for 1937 and 1938, or even 1939, that I would find side by side with the advertisement encouraging farmers to grow more wheat an article against the growing of wheat in this country.</P>
      <P>We have to remember that there are certain ways in which this nation can be reduced to subjection.  Wheat is one of them, perhaps the principal one. It is very hard to expect a man to watch his family die of starvation.  If this war had started at the end of August, 1931, our neighbours across the water, instead of begging for ports and facilities of any description, could have said: &ldquo;Give us 500,000 men, the sons of Erin, for cannon fodder out in Flanders and we will give you six months' supply of bread for your people.&rdquo;  They could have said that in the absolute certainty of being able to starve us into compliance.</P>
      <P>That is what the Minister for Agriculture had to face and he had to build up the nation against it.  And that is what he did.  Take the wiseacres on the opposite benches.  We find that inside and outside this House they were shouting about the &ldquo;codology&rdquo; of growing wheat.  We increased the wheat acreage from 20,000 acres in 1931 to 305,000 acres in 1940 and 491,000 acres in 1941, the year Deputy Belton is complaining of.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon talked about wheat growing and referred to it as &ldquo;codology&rdquo;.  Then he talked about getting ships to bring in wheat. He did not get one man out of his Party to support his policy of being dependent on the foreigner for our daily bread.  Despite that type of preaching and all the manoeuvres that were worked for a number of years to prevent wheat growing here, the wheat was grown.  It was grown because this Government paid a few shillings to the farmers over and above the price of foreign wheat.  That was, in plain language, an insurance policy and it bore good fruit this year, because we grew 491,000 acres of wheat, which is sufficient to meet the country's requirements for practically 12 months.  At any rate, nobody will die of starvation here, nobody will die for want of bread.</P>
      <P>What I really am afraid of is the coming year, and it is with that position I am principally anxious to deal.  In my opinion, the Government have made a pretty fatal mistake, which must be immediately rectified.  It will not be enough to rectify that mistake after Christmas.  The time to rectify it is now.  The Government should mend their hand in regard to the fixed price of wheat for the coming year.  If they do not do so I, for one, will have very little hope of seeing a sufficient supply of wheat in the harvest of 1942.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister for Education to-day whether he had reconsidered the position with regard to boys who had lost second-class scholarships, or who had received second-class scholarships instead of first-class scholarships, by reason of the change that took place in the marking <Col N="1010" /> of the Greek examination papers subsequent to the issue of the provisional lists of marks to the managers of the various schools.  The Minister said that he did not consider that an injustice had been done, that he did not consider that the Greek examiner had been over-ruled in his original judgement, that he was not prepared to say how many boys were affected, and that he was not prepared to consider any question of compensation.  I told the Minister that, inevitably, the position would disclose itself, and that, inevitably, we would see that a certain number of boys, whose marks on the original markings entitled them to first-class scholarships, had been reduced to second-class scholarships and that a number of boys, whose marks on the original markings entitled them to second-class scholarships, would be reduced to getting no scholarship at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister to-day provided lists of the boys who had qualified for scholarships, with certain references to these, and an examination of these lists discloses that one of the effects of the raising of the Greek marks by 10 per cent. is that four boys: one in the Patrician Brothers, Ballyfin, Mountrath; one in Coláiste Muire na mBráthar, Cearnóg Parnell, Dublin, and two in Sgoil na mBráthar, O'Sullivan's Quay, Cork, were removed from their positions on the list of first-class scholarships, and brought down to the second class.  These boys will now receive scholarships of the value of £20 each instead of scholarships of the value of £40 each.  We do not know what the position is in relation to boys who would have been entitled, on the original markings, to be on the second-class scholarship list, because they are completely gone off the list, and, until the schools themselves, to which these boys are attached, make a careful examination of the lists, that position will not disclose itself, but at any rate there are four boys who, on the original marking of the Greek examiners, would have been entitled to £40 each, who are only getting £20 each.  The sum involved to the State there is £80, and probably another £50 would be involved at the other end of the scale in order to compensate the <Col N="1011" /> boys who, as a result of the markings, whatever be the circumstances in which they actually took place, have lost scholarships as a result of the remarking of the Greek paper.</P>
    <P>Now, it is an interesting thing that, whereas the Minister tells us that out of 4,400 boys sitting for the Intermediate Certificate Examination this year, 864 took Greek, of the 36 first-class scholarships 21 were persons who sat for Greek, and of the 36 second-class scholarships 25 sat for Greek.  So that, out of a total of 72 scholarships, divided among 4,400 boys, 46 of the people who got these scholarships took Greek, and I think that only 864 boys sat for Greek.  The number of first-class scholarships, with Greek attaching, would not have been reduced by four.  Probably, the number of second-class scholarships, with Greek attaching, would not have been reduced at all, but there would have been a change, between second-class scholarships and non-scholarships, of four or five boys.  However, that is the position, and the question is: how is it brought about?  On the 29th August, provisional lists of the marks got by all boys were circulated to the schools, and then, towards the end of September, when the scholarship list was expected, suddenly there was an announcement that the Greek paper was being revised, and as a result of the Greek paper being revised, certain boys, who were expected to get scholarships, did not get them.  The Minister has been asked how it happened that the Greek paper was revised.  He informed us that the present Greek examiner was a man who had been sitting and examining on the Greek papers for eight years, and that he was assisted by four assistant examiner, one of whom had acted as assistant examiner on five previous occasions, one on four, one on three and the other on one occasion. We are asked to believe that that group of men made an error of judgement, and the Minister explains that one of the reasons why an error of judgment was probably made by the revising examiner was that he did not <Col N="1012" /> see the sets of papers, that were examined by two different sets of examiners, all together.  Now, you have a certain number of marks allotted for translation of a passage from Irish or English into Greek, a certain number of marks for translation from an unprescribed Greek author into Irish or English, and a certain number of marks for translation from a prescribed Greek author into Irish or English, as well as a certain number of marks for grammer and for history.  Apparently, these were divided into two groups, and the examiner who examined one did not examine the other, but the assistant examiner reviewed the whole lot and was constantly in touch with the various examiners, and yet we are told that he did not know, until the marks were associated together, that there was an inconsistency in these marks in relation to previous years.  I submit that these marks must have been brought together by the middle of July or the end of July, that they had been brought together three or four weeks before the provisional lists were issued on the 29th August, and that nothing was done until, the provisional lists having been circulated to the schools and certain complaints arising from some schools, the attention of the assistant examiner was drawn to the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister asserts and emphasises that the revising examiner, on his own initiative, examined the situation.  If he did, then why was it that the examination did not take place before the 29th August?  Why was it that it was not until the scholarship lists were actually circulated in the end of September that there was any notification to the schools that there was any necessity for revision, or any revision? It is particularly important to know what took place, because, if there is to be any kind of satisfaction, or any kind of reliance or confidence, in the general scheme of things, the sort of thing which happened recently must not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us to-day that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Instructions were given in 1937 to the advising examiner in certain subjects, including Greek, that a <Col N="1013" /> gradual raising of the standard of marking should be adopted in future at the examinations in these subjects. The instructions applied to those subjects in which the large percentage of candidates obtaining high marks suggested that the existing standard was too low, and their purpose was to ensure that a higher standard was adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was noticed that in certain subjects, including Greek, a large percentage of candidates were obtaining high marks, and that suggested that the existing standard was too low.  Nevertheless, the figures which the Minister provides to-day show that the percentage of pupils who passed in Greek, and the percentage of pupils who passed with honours, and the percentage of pupils who obtained 75 per cent. marks and upwards, increased from 1937 onwards, in spite of the fact that Greek was one of those subjects in which it had appeared that the existing standard was too low, as disclosed by the fact that a large percentage of the candidates were obtaining high marks. The Minister tells us that under the revised figures, 13.3 per cent. of the boys who sat for Greek obtained 75 per cent. and upwards, and that if the original marking had remained, only 9.4 per cent. would have obtained that figure, and he spoke of the necessity for having uniform standards.  Last year the percentage of boys obtaining 75 per cent. and upwards was 19 per cent. in Greek, and only 3 per cent. in English and 11 per cent. in Science, although only 837 boys went in for Greek, 4,162 went in for English, and 2,240 went in for Science.  Why was there any discrepancy&mdash;3 per cent. obtaining 75 per cent. and upwards in English, 11 per cent. obtaining 75 per cent. and upwards in Science, and 19 per cent. obtaining 75 per cent. and upwards in Greek?  Why was the discrepancy allowed to be there?</P>
    <P>This remarkable revision of things this year calls for very special attention. I asked the Minister what revision of this particular kind went on before.  He had to go back to 1928 to find any example in which there was a general rise of marks.  Since the introduction of the provisional lists in 1931, <Col N="1014" /> there had been no such change, and to say that a change like this was contemplated when the marks were issued as provisional lists is saying something that nobody can credit.  Provisional lists, as the Minister said, have been issued since 1931.  They were marked &ldquo;Provisional&rdquo; just for the reason that errors might creep in here and there, as has happened now and then.  A particular paper may not have been examined or a tot might have been done incorrectly, but those lists were marked &ldquo;Provisional&rdquo; only for the purpose of safeguarding the Minister with regard to those matters.  Now, the whole position in regard to teachers is simply thrown into utter confusion.  The Minister starts a precedent by which, after the issue of those lists, there can be this wholesale change.  The Minister has intimated that certain schools made certain representations.  I submit to the Minister that that is what is at the bottom of the whole thing; that certain colleges which specialise in Greek have brought pressure to bear on the Minister to increase the Greek marks, and that those Greek marks have been increased to the detriment of boys who were concentrating on science and on mathematics.  It certainly will come as a revelation to people who are interested in secondary education to realise what great predominance is given to Greek in the scholarship results; what great predominance is given to Greek when you compare it with English and with science as to the percentage of boys who were able to get 75 per cent. in it.</P>
    <P>This matter calls not only for thorough explanation as to what has happened in this particular case, but for compensation to the boys who, in those extraordinary circumstances, have been deprived of certain sums of money by way of scholarship, the whole of which would not amount to more than, say, £160 or £180, and it does call for an examination into the standard that is being applied to Greek from the point of view of honours marks and the standard that is being applied, say, to English and to science. There was a slight suggestion in the Minister's answer to me a week ago that this change took place because of <Col N="1015" /> the number of failures.  I asked the Minister to-day how many boys who failed in the general examination under the original Greek marking had passed in the general examination as a result of the change in marking, and the answer was &ldquo;two&rdquo;, so that this rough examination of the position that Greek occupied in relation to other marks on the pass lists was not carried out because of the number of boys who were failing in the examination.  It was carried out because of the scholarship position.  I have indicated the different sections into which the examination is divided.  When we consider those things, and when we talk of the severity of the examination, we are asked to think that, with experienced examiners&mdash;even though divided into two separate groups&mdash;examining those various aspects of the Greek paper, history, grammar, translation from Greek into English or Irish, and translation from English or Irish into Greek, such an injustice was done that the marks could be increased in each of those sections by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is an utterly rule of thumb arrangement.  It is impossible to think that experienced men marked the papers either unjustly or unnecessarily severely.  It is impossible to accept the Minister's explanation that it was the assistant examiner whose conscience first suggested to him that he had been guilty of an injustice, and it is impossible to get it out of our minds that pressure is being brought to bear on the Minister by certain educational establishments to give Greek additional preference to the preference he felt in 1937 it already had by reason of its being one of the papers so leniently marked that there was an unnecessarily large number of people getting high marks in it.  Again I appeal to the Minister that, first of all, he has to get about £180 to remedy the personal injustice done to individual boys; secondly, that he has to explain the thing more satisfactorily if he wants the general public and the teaching fraternity to have confidence in his machine; and thirdly, that he should again review the position in regard to Greek in relation to English, <Col N="1016" /> Irish, Science, and some other subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone who has had any experience of examinations is aware that their results never give complete satisfaction to those concerned.  One very common cause of complaint, voiced in letters to the Press and otherwise, in the days of the Intermediate Board was the abrupt variations which sometimes took place in the standard of the same examination.  One year 70 per cent. of the candidates would pass in a subject and in the following year only 36 per cent. would be recorded as passing in the same subject.  School managers and teachers contended, and rightly so, that there could not be such a wide variation in the knowledge of the candidates and that the fault must necessarily lie either in the examination papers set out or in the standard of marking them.  Efforts have been made in recent years to guard against such abrupt variations in the standard of marking.  This is mainly secured by requiring the advising examiner, who sets the paper and controls the marking of the answer books by the assistant examiners, to exercise a close supervision over the work of each assistant examiner, according as the work of correction proceeds.  In the case of a subject like Greek, in which there are two separate examination papers, the answers to which are marked by different examiners, it is not easy for the advising examiner to know that a proper standard of marking is being observed.  He may assume that even if the marks obtained on one paper by a number of candidates are unusually low, these candidates may do better on the other paper.  This circumstance explains why it was not discovered sooner that too severe a standard had been followed at the marking of the Greek papers in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When the marking sheets were received in the office and the results tabulated, this became evident.  Since the percentage of candidates who passed was less than 53, while the corresponding percentage <Col N="1017" /> in the same subject for many years had been over 78, it could not be properly contended or assumed that the fault lay with the candidates&mdash;that they were not as intelligent as those in the previous years or had not been as well taught.  The same candidates had been examined in other subjects such as Latin and their answering in these subjects was up to the usual standard.  It was clear that the standard of the marking in Greek had been too severe and it was necessary to remedy as far as possible the injustice caused to the students concerned.  It was then the end of August and it had been the practice for the last ten years to let each school have a provisional list of the marks of its own students before the opening of the new school year, at the beginning of September.  It was decided to issue the results to schools as usual.  Since they were clearly described as being provisional, it was not expected that they would be regarded as final or that any claims would be based on them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim the right to make my statement.  The advising examiner for Greek then made a careful re-examination of a selected number of the papers, marked by each of the advising examiners.  It was found that each of these had done his work with great care and exactness.  There was no evidence that some of them had been more severe than the others or that some of the questions had been improperly marked.  It was admitted, however, that the standard was unduly and uniformly severe and it was agreed that all the candidates' answers merited an addition of at least 10 per cent. of their marks.  It may be contended that a better course would have been to have a complete re-marking of the candidates' answers on a more <Col N="1018" /> reasonable standard.  This would, however, have involved considerable delay and early decisions were necessary regarding the final results in order that the scholarship lists might be prepared.  In view of the fact that the severity of the marking was uniform, there can be no valid objection to the remedy adopted.  Moreover, it is quite possible that if the answers had been re-marked one by one, the increase in each candidate's marks would have been more than the 10 per cent. actually added.  Under the revised marking, the percentage of passes, 62.9, is still well below the average of 78 per cent. for the past 16 years.</P>
      <P>It appears to be suggested that the decision to revise the marks in Greek was made only when the list of scholarship winners was prepared.  I have already denied this and I repeat the denial.  It is true that the revision of the marks in Greek had some effect in determining certain candidates' places in the scholarship list but the actual extent of this effect was ascertained only when the matter was raised here.  I refused to give particulars of this in reply to Deputy Mulcahy's question to-day because I could not admit the implication that an injustice was done to certain candidates.  If the original unrevised marks in Greek had been allowed to stand, there would have been a change in four cases of the 36 boys who have been awarded first-class scholarships and in nine cases of the 36 boys who have been granted second-class scholarships.  I should add, however, that the final list of scholarship winners is not yet definitely settled since some of those to whom they are at first awarded do not avail themselves of them and their places are given to those next in order of merit.  As a result of this, a number of changes have already taken place in this year's awards.  Four first-class scholarships and five second-class scholarships have been relinquished. The filling of these vacancies has had the result that a first-class scholarship has been awarded to one of the four candidates already mentioned and second-class scholarships to three of the other nine candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot admit that there is any <Col N="1019" /> good claim on grounds of justice for the award of additional scholarships to these candidates.  The claim really rests on the basis that they would have got scholarships if an injustice had been done to other candidates.  No candidate has a right to a benefit which is obtained by imposing an injustice on another.  Apart from the fact that the claim has no merits on the grounds of right or justice, the granting of it would create an undesirable precedent and I am not prepared to consider it.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy's to which I wish to make special reference.  He alleged that the advising examiner in Greek was over-ruled by the Department.  I wish to deny that allegation in the most positive manner.  In fact, the advising examiner not only approved, but strongly recommended, that the original marks in Greek should be revised. Since this examiner is one of the Department's inspectors, the allegation in question is calculated to cause him embarrassment in his relations with teachers of Greek in the schools.  It is rather unfair that an allegation of the kind should be made at random without any evidence to support it and I wish to make it quite clear that the allegation is unfounded and that it was not necessary for the Department to over-rule the examiner in order to remedy the injustice to the candidates at the examination in Greek.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked by whom the investigation was initiated.  It was initiated by the chief inspector, whose duty it is to see that a proper standard of marking is observed in the marking of all examination papers.  The Deputy also asked when the investigation was initiated.  It was initiated on the 4th September, six days after the issue of the provisional lists.  The Deputy further asked had the advising examiner acted before.  The present advising examiner for Greek has been acting in that capacity for the past eight years.  Prior to that he had acted as advising examiner in other subjects&mdash;German, English, etc.</P>

I am not going into the question of the standard applied to Greek.  That is a matter that can be discussed on another occasion.  I simply want to say that no injustice has been done. As I mentioned in my statement, it could well be argued from the point of view of the boys who took Greek, that on a careful re-examination of each of the papers, they might have done better than a flat-rate increase of 10 per cent. would represent.  I hope that no person, who is acquainted with education, will be deceived by what Deputy Mulcahy has said into believing that the Department is interested in any school or in any subject to the detriment of other schools or the detriment of other sections of pupils. All the pupils are the same to us.  We are concerned only to see that fair play is given to everybody.  The number of examination papers has increased enormously in recent years; nevertheless, we had no serious complaints. On this occasion a mistake was made; there was an error of judgment.  As I stated, we rectified it and gave justice to those to whom an injustice would otherwise have been done.  I think that was all it was possible to do in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have not caused any specific inquiries to be made from the Government of Great Britain as to the amounts payable either in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland by way of compensation for personal injuries received by a civilian through bombing. I have, however, obtained a copy of the British Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme, 1941, which I understand applies also to Northern Ireland. Under the provisions of this scheme the compensation payable in the cases cited in the Deputy's question would appear, assuming that the civilian was normally engaged in, and wholly or substantially dependent for a livelihood on, a trade, business, profession, office, employment or vocation, to be as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the civilian was killed.&mdash; Assuming that he had lived with his wife and that the children remained, after his death, under the control of his widow, a pension to the widow not exceeding 22/6 a week, during widowhood, together with allowances not exceeding 8/6 a week in respect of the first child, 6/3 a week in respect of the second child and 5/- a week in respect of each of the other children, so long as each child remained under 15.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the civilian was totally disabled.&mdash;Assuming that he continued to reside with his wife or to contribute to a reasonable extent to her support and to the support of their children&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Where the disablement was temporary.&mdash;A pension to him, during disablement up to a maximum of 26 weeks, of 35/- a week together with allowances of 4/- a week in respect of each of his first two children and 3/- a week in respect of each of the other children, so long as each child remained under 15;</P>

    <P>(b)  Where the disablement was serious and prolonged.&mdash;A pension to him, so long as he remained <Col N="881" /> totally disabled, of an amount not exceeding 34/2 a week together with an allowance not exceeding 8/4 a week in respect of his wife and allowances not exceeding 6/3 a week in respect of his first child and 5/- a week in respect of each of his other children, so long as each child remained under 15.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where the person was killed: Assuming that the widow and children were totally dependent on the deceased, a lump sum to the widow of amount equal to her husband's earnings during the three years previous to his death, but not less than £200 or more than £300, together with a lump sum to the children of amount depending on their ages, but not exceeding £600; always provided that the total compensation payable could not exceed £600.</P>
