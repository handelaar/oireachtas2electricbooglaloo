      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has been requested by the tenants on the Wilson Fitzgerald estate, Drumnevin, Kilfenora, County Clare, to have an accommodation road repaired which would assist them in tillage and general farming business and if he is now prepared to have such work done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether he will consider introducing legislation to enable 66? per cent. subsidy to be paid in respect of houses provided by a local authority for persons with large families removed from houses, the accommodation of which is totally inadequate for their requirements, but which could, with alterations, be made fit for habitation by smaller families.</P>

      <P>The reply is in the negative.  The Exchequer is at present making a very large contribution to housing which is increasing from year to year, and any proposal which would add to the burden could not be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether men who rented and tilled allotments last year and who have since joined the National Army or have been called up for service will be <Col N="2123" /> allowed to retain their allotments for supplying food to their families if they are prepared to arrange for the cultivation of those allotments, and whether he will state if they will be given the same concessions in regard to rent, manures and seeds as are given to the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Where local authorities have put forward proposals to let allotments to persons who worked allotments last year, and who have since joined the Defence Forces, I have informed them that where satisfactory arrangements can be made for the working of the plot either for the benefit of the man or his family the plot should be let to him so that he might still have a claim to it on leaving the Defence Forces.  As to the second part of the question, concessions with regard to rent, manures and seeds are confined under the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act, 1934, to persons who are &ldquo;unemployed persons&rdquo; as defined by that Act.  Members of the Defence Forces do not come within the definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say what the cost of seeding will be, but the rent would be something under £1 so far as I know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I considered that matter, but owing to the arrangements which county councils are enabled to make for selling seed to these allottees by instalments or otherwise, I do not think it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to that.  Will the Minister consider amending the Act to which he referred in reply to the question so as to bring the men who have joined the Army within the Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies what are the full and precise terms of the price adjustment arrangement to millers in respect of imported wheat designed to offset any possible increased profit arising from the production of the new flour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price adjustment has been made by increasing the price of imported wheat allocated to millers by Grain Importers (Éire) Limited by 6/6 per 480 lbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how long it is proposed to continue that price increase, what it will cost the consumer during the period of its continuance, and the gross sum that it may be expected to yield the miller?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price adjustment will continue so long as the stock of imported wheat continues.  It will cost the consumer nothing in so far as there is no alteration in the price of bread and flour, and it will not result in any additional profit to the millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2128" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is an attempt being made to impose a tax of 6/6 per quarter on wheat.  I ask the Minister to lay before the House the surrounding circumstances of that tax, and what effect it is going to have on the price of wheaten bread over the whole period of tax and subsidy envisaged. Surely the Minister will agree with me that, on the occasion of imposing a tax of 6/6 per quarter on wheat, some information ought to be communicated to Dáil Eireann as to the nature of that tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, obviously, misunderstands the position.  The price of imported wheat has been increased to millers by 6/6 per 480 lbs.  Only a percentage of the wheat used in producing flour is imported wheat.  The increase is designed to offset the increased profit which millers would otherwise get due to the extra flour obtained from wheat, but these increased profits, if allowed to operate, would not be sufficient to reduce the price of bread.  The alternative, therefore, to allowing the millers to get an increased profit was to collect that profit into the hands of Grain Importers, Ltd., where it will be used for the purpose of preventing an increase in the price of wheat when, later in the year, we are depending solely on Irish wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it desirable to communicate to Dáil Eireann and to the country what 6/6 per cental on wheat represents on the sack of flour?  Say that it represents 2/- per sack.  I suggest that the Minister should say quite openly to the public: &ldquo;We are going to take that 2/- per sack into the Treasury and use it for the purpose of subsidising flour after next harvest, and because this represents a tax of 2/- per sack on flour to-day it is going to be used for subsidy purposes in the autumn.&rdquo;  Now that may be right or it may be wrong, but it is a tax of 2/- per sack on flour.  Surely, if the Minister is going to tax flour, directly or indirectly, he ought to take the precaution of giving Dáil Eireann the fullest possible information.  If he has not the facilities wherewith to do that <Col N="2129" /> now, will he undertake to explain this scheme in detail on some early occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's difficulty.  It has been said in public, and in official announcements, that this additional amount is being taken and is being kept for the purpose of subsidising flour later in the year.  That has already been said.  There is also this fact which must be kept in mind, namely, that if we did not take this action, if we allowed the price to adjust itself without any action on our part, it would not result in a decrease in the price of bread because, with a farthing, the lowest coin in circulation, there would not be sufficient additional profit realised by the millers to justify a decrease in the price of the 2lb. loaf by a farthing.  Therefore, this additional sum, whatever it may amount to in the course of the year, is being kept in the hands of Grain Importers, Ltd., solely for the purpose of subsidising wheat later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me that the effect of this is to tax wheat for the purpose of subsidising flour at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me, if we tax flour now with a view to subsidising flour at some future date, that in those circumstances, in view of the exceptional powers that have been conferred on him and in view of the Taoiseach's solemn undertaking that these powers would never be used for the purpose of imposing taxation, he should take the precaution of communicating this scheme to the House, and of saying that, if this, in the opinion of the House, means a tax on flour now for the purpose of being able to give a subsidy later on, he will do that by legislation so that the House can know the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, with reference to the statement published in the Press to the effect that the additional 20 per cent. extraction from wheat would not in fact mean a ½d. reduction in the 4 lb. loaf, he is aware that, in effect, it means a reduction of 5/- in the sack or two-thirds of a penny in the 4 lb. loaf; and if he will consider reducing <Col N="2131" /> the price of bread by this amount; or, if he intends to use the reduction to build up a reserve fund, whether he is aware that by the end of August, 1941, at a consumption of 250,000 sacks per month, that fund will have grown at the rate of £62,500 per month to £437,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has apparently misinterpreted the statement which appeared in the Press recently. This statement made reference to the price of bread following on the increase in the extraction of flour from 80 per cent. to 90 per cent., and not from 70 per cent.  Consequently, the figures quoted in the question appear to be based on a miscalculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the present price of bread is based on a flour extraction of 70 per cent., and was fixed by him at 52/6 per sack or £21 per ton?  About the 1st February we had added to the flour 20 per cent. of offals, which then sold at £11 10s. per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot deny the fact that the price of flour was fixed by him when the standard extraction of flour was 70 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Since that time &mdash; at 70 per cent. and not at 80 per cent. extraction &mdash; when he fixed the price of flour, there has been added 20 per cent. offals.  These offals were sold &mdash; I bought them myself &mdash; at £11 10s. per ton.  That was up to the first week in February. Now the relation of 70 to 20 is as three and a half to one.  If you take three and a half tons at £21 per ton, and one <Col N="2132" /> ton at £11 10s., you get a mixture which should sell at £18 17s. 9d. per ton.  The difference between £21 per ton and £18 17s. 9d. is £2 2s. 3d. &mdash; in other words, 42/3.  That means 5/3 per sack.  As the Minister knows, there are eight sacks in a ton, so that the difference of 42/3 means in round figures 5/3 per sack of flour.  Therefore, a reduction of 5/3 in the price of the sack of flour should mean to the baker and to the public a reduction of two-thirds of a penny in the 4-lb. loaf. I want to know from the Minister why the public is not getting the benefit of that?  There is no use in telling us that the price of bread did not go up since the war started.  We know the reason &mdash; that very little imported wheat came into the country.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is that the financial effect of increasing the extraction from 70 to 80 per cent. prevented an increase in the price of flour at the time.  No doubt, some Deputies opposite are not aware that there is a war on, and that as a result of the war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there has been a very considerable increase in the cost of imported wheat in this country.  In these circumstances, increases, and substantial increases, in the price of flour have only been avoided with great difficulty.  One of the methods of avoiding them last year was the increase in the extraction from 70 to 80 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The points are 50/- and 53/-.  If flour falls below 50/-, a decrease is justifiable, and if it rises above 53/-, an increase is justifiable.  The present price is 52/6d.</P>

      <P>I have tried to explain to the Deputy &mdash; and he will not understand &mdash; that a difference of 4/- in the price of flour would justify a difference <Col N="2135" /> in the price of bread.  I must relate the facts to the present price of flour. The present price is 52/6.

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state under what arrangement the road goods services of a corporation like the Great Southern Railways have sufficient petrol to maintain distributing services to small towns, while individual lorry owners in these towns, who depend on the earnings of their lorry for their livelihood, and whose services are cheaper and more convenient to local merchants, are unable to get supplies to carry on their essential work; if, further, he will in future cease to so discriminate between the corporations and the driver-owner of small lorries in the matter of petrol allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding stocks and future supplies of petrol has been such that it has not hitherto been possible to grant allowances to all owners of motor lorries, but I am making a concession in their favour for the remainder of the present month and an announcement on the subject is being issued to-day.  There is no discrimination in favour of the Great Southern Railways or other corporations over other licensed hauliers, all of whose requirements were reduced by the same percentage.  I presume the Great Southern Railways have reorganised their transport to give the best possible service to all areas within the limits of the petrol made available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if it is a fact that petrol <Col N="2137" /> allowances for clergymen and doctors are made on a uniform scale, whether they live in an urban or rural area; and if he is aware that it is inequitable to give the same allowance to a doctor in a remote scattered district in West Cork as to a doctor working in the cities of Cork or Dublin, where the area of work is restricted, and where public means of locomotion are available; and if he will reconsider an adjustment of allowances in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the very limited quantity of motor spirit available since the beginning of this year, the allowances to clergymen and doctors have had to be made on a uniform scale.  While I cannot accept the Deputy's general contention that it is inequitable to give the same allowance to a doctor in a country district as to a doctor in the city, I recognise that the needs of all doctors and clergymen are not uniform.  An attempt, however, to distribute the limited quantity of petrol available for those classes on a basis of individual needs, during the present month, would have involved an examination of the circumstances of individual cases which would have been impracticable, and would, furthermore, have involved considerable delay in the issue of licences.  If the supply position should improve, arrangements will be made to give supplementary allowances in exceptional cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a very large number of clergymen in County Mayo have got no coupons for the present month and have heard nothing from the Department, although they made application in the usual manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, as between parochial clergy and clergy who have no parochial duties, giving preference to the consideration of the claims of parochial clergy, because I know cases in which parochial clergy have not received their coupons, whereas clergymen engaged in colleges and in work of that <Col N="2138" /> kind have got their coupons?  It is very easy to understand how that might have happened, but I suggest to the Minister that he might consider preferring, for purposes of consideration, the claims of parochial clergy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the position is that only a very limited quantity is available, the task of carrying out an examination of the circumstances of individual cases is entirely beyond the resources of my Department and would involve very considerable delay.  If the supply position should improve so that we can issue a basic ration to everybody, we can deal with special cases by means of a supplementary ration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister not give a more definite assurance to farmers before they put in the beet crop &mdash; the Minister surely appreciates the necessity for it &mdash; that beet will not be left on their hands if it cannot be conveyed to the factory, and more information as to the measures he proposes to take to ensure that a supply will be available?</P>

      <P>Surely, the Minister can say that, whether we get it there in horse-carts or in wheelbarrows, we will take it from the farmers and get it to the factories somehow.  Surely, it is necessary to say that so that nobody need be afraid of sowing a crop on that account.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that during the last couple of weeks only one petrol company was in a position to deliver supplies of vaporising oil for tractors while customers of other companies were without any supply, and if, in order to ensure an equal supply to all tractor owners of whatever amount is available, he will consider pooling amongst the companies concerned all present stocks and future supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An arrangement for the pooling of stocks of vaporising oil has been made by the oil distributing companies, and is at present in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is no vaporising oil in the country except a very limited quantity in the hands of one distributing company and that a large number of tractors have been immobilised for the <Col N="2140" /> past fortnight for want of a drop of fuel?  The owners of the tractors, in pursuance of the advice given them, wrote to the Minister that they could not get a supply of oil and they got no reply.  Furthermore, representatives of the oil companies called on the Minister and warned him that there was no vaporising oil here but that they were prepared to make up a fuel &mdash; a compound, I think, of paraffin and petrol &mdash; for those special tractors which will not work on paraffin but must have a more volatile fuel.  Is the Minister aware that the scheme to make this compound-fuel is being held up because the Revenue Commissioners will not consent to its preparation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that supplies of power kerosene are very low but a substitute fuel, consisting of kerosene and petrol, is at present being distributed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that I am not misinformed on this matter.  If the Minister is being told that I am misinformed, I beg of him to get in touch with his officials and check up his information again.  As late as this very morning, a stoppage has occurred.  I do not believe that the Minister wants that and I, certainly, do not want it.  I assure him, however, that this morning a stoppage occurred and that the compound-fuel was not being distributed.  All I want the Minister to say is that, if there is an obstacle in the way of the distribution of that compound fuel, he will remove it to-day.  I appreciate that his difficulties are very great but will he give that undertaking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is obvious that I must give that undertaking, having regard to the fact that my information is that this fuel is already being distributed and that the obstacles have already been removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the danger.  I suggest that whoever told the Minister that incorrectly informed him.  I ask him to seek out the obstacle and to take whatever steps are necessary so that these people will have supplies <Col N="2141" /> made available to them.  The Minister advised these people to make representations to him if they could not obtain supplies.  They took the Minister at his word, and the Minister has failed them.  If they take his word again to-day, can they rest assured that this compound fuel will go out to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that the compound fuel will go out.  The distribution of the available supplies of kerosene has not been facilitated by a number of retail distributors and it may be necessary to bring them under control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if it is a fact that three-quarters of last year's importation of superphosphate will be available this year, and if he will arrange that those who purchased superphosphate last year will get this fertiliser proportionately this year; if also he will be in a position to inform such farmers where they can purchase their due supply in view of the many complaints that superphosphate cannot be secured in country towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the information now available as to deliveries already made to merchants and as to stocks held by the manufacturers, it is estimated that during the present season there will be available for distribution approximately one half of the quantity of superphosphate which was delivered during last season.  It is also estimated that there will be available this season about the same quantity of phosphatic compound manures as was available during the last season.  I understand that arrangements have been made by the Department of Agriculture whereby the quantity of superphosphate and of compound manures available for distribution this season will be allocated to the usual distributors throughout the country on the <Col N="2143" /> basis of their respective purchases in 1940.  These merchants have been informed that, in the distribution of these manures to their customers, it is desirable that they should be reserved for tillage crops rather than applied to grassland but, subject to this, farmers should be able to procure from the merchants with whom they usually do business a due proportion of their purchases in 1940.  It is unlikely that farmers will be able to procure any supplies except from merchants with whom they did business last season, and they are already aware of the names of these merchants.</P>

      <P>Many farmers have come to me and told me that they sent orders to the merchants from whom they usually got supplies and the reply they got was that they had no superphosphates to give them.  I hope the Minister will see that these farmers will get a fair proportion of the available artificial manures.  In the case of some land, you will get no green crops or potatoes if you do not use artificial manures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  A good deal of confusion and misunderstanding has been created by virtue of the fact that officials of the Department of Agriculture and certain county instructors stated at meetings, held to induce farmers to grow more food, that 75 per cent. of last year's supply of artificial manures would be available this year.  Farmers are going to the merchants and demanding 75 per cent. of the amount supplied them last year.  I think the point the Deputy wants made clear is whether the distribution will be 75 or 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will agree with me that we cannot regard as available anything that is not now <Col N="2145" /> in the country then the distribution will be 50 per cent., and that is represented by deliveries already made or stocks in the hands of merchants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the ex-works price of XXX superphosphate is now £8 per ton.  The increase of £1 15s. per ton over the price previously prevailing was sanctioned by me and is due to the rise in the cost of raw materials.  I am satisfied that this price is reasonable.  A few complaints of alleged overcharging by merchants have recently been made to my Department.  These are at present under investigation, and if the Deputy knows of any similar cases they will also be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say when did the last cargo of raw material arrive in this country?  If superphosphate was worth £6 5s. per ton ex-factory three weeks ago is there any justification for an increase of £1 15s. per ton to-day or did the last cargo of raw material influence the price to that extent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of price control is not quite as simple as the Deputy seems to suppose.  Allowances have to be made for stocks purchased previously and carried over from the <Col N="2146" /> past season as well as for the raw materials imported during this season. As an indication of the rise in the cost of these raw materials I may mention that phosphate rock was imported prewar at an average c.i.f. price of 30/- per ton; the price paid recently for the same phosphate rock, imported c.i.f., was 144/-.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that in many parts of the City of Dublin coal is purchased by the stone; that at present coal so sold is being charged for at the rate of 6½d. and 7d. a stone, which is the equivalent of 86/8 and 93/4 a ton; and if he will state what he proposes to do to prevent poor persons being charged these exorbitant prices.</P>

      <P>I am aware that coal is purchased in stone and bag lots by a large section of the community in Dublin and that for a short period up to a recent date a wide variety of prices existed for coal sold in this manner; this was due to exceptional circumstances in regard to both the supply and the quality of the coal available.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have now been made by my Department as a result of which it is hoped to maintain an adequate supply of coal during the period of the emergency for the consumers in question.  The arrangements also provide for maintaining uniformity in the quality of the coal to be supplied in so far as circumstances will permit, and I have made an order fixing the retail price at a maximum of 6d. per stone.</P>

      <P>It is difficult, without having a complete examination of the figures, to say to what extent coal imports during the past months would represent the normal imports for that time of the year.  It is only in the last month or so that exceptional difficulties have arisen.  Those difficulties are partially due to problems relating to shipping; they are partially due to the fact that the coal available to us in sufficient quantity is of much poorer quality or of different quality to that which previously was imported, and some merchants were reluctant to import that coal so long as they thought there was any prospect of getting better quality.  Now that it is quite clear that we have got to take the coal available, the supply position has improved somewhat.</P>

      <P>The uniform rate of 6/- per ton for the carriage of turf by rail ceased to operate on the 19th October, 1936, on which date the Uniform Rate (Peat Fuel) Order, 1934, was revoked.  The Order was revoked for the reason that the average length of haul of peat fuel by the Great Southern Railways Company was found to be almost double that which was anticipated when the rate of 6/- was <Col N="2155" /> fixed and the rate was consequently entirely uneconomic.  On the revocation of the Order, the company, by agreement with the Turf Development Board, introduced certain zonal rates, varying according to distance, for specified limited areas.  Amended rates based on the distance from Lyracrompane and Clonsast bogs have recently been introduced with the acquiescence of the Turf Development Board.  The existing rate from Clonsast to Kingsbridge which is inclusive of collection at Clonsast and delivery at Portarlington railway station is 12/1 per ton.</P>

      <P>In connection with returns of prices of agricultural produce at markets, prices of turf are obtained from six centres.  The prices given are, per load, of various weights and are used only for the purpose of estimating the value of turf produced or won in connection with estimates of agricultural output and are not published as real market prices.  Other than this no information as to the prices obtained for turf by turf-cutting societies or other turf-cutters is available in my Department.  Such prices vary a great deal with the district, the quality of the turf, and <Col N="2156" /> other factors, such as transport facilities and availability of other fuels.  The prices are nearly always on a per load basis and &ldquo;load&rdquo; for this purpose is not a constant weight.  For that reason, even if reliable figures were available, their translation into a price per ton would be impracticable.  The Turf Development Board, which at one time arranged for the marketing of hand-won turf, produced by the turf co-operative societies at standard prices, did not purchase hand-won turf in 1940 and is not purchasing it now.</P>

      <P>The sugar beet required by the Irish Sugar Company is grown under contracts entered into between the company and the growers which provide that the crop, when sown, be comes the property of the company. The credit granted by the company in respect of seeds, manures and advance payments is, therefore, secured by the crop.  Growers of cereals, however, do not ordinarily make similar contracts with the buyers of their crops and in some cases the crop, or the greater part of it, is not grown for sale but for consumption on the grower's farm.</P>
      <P>Consequently it is not practicable to provide for growers of cereal crops credit facilities similar to those provided for beat growers, but county councils are empowered to provide credit facilities for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers required by growers of grain and other crops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call attention to what the members of the Labour Party consider very unfair <Col N="2161" /> treatment at the hands of the Government. About a fortnight ago we submitted a motion urging the establishment of an economic council and, having regard to the vital importance of the motion, we assumed that the Government would be willing to make available Government time for its discussion and that no effort would be made to restrict the discussion to the short period of three hours.  I have been informed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that the most the Government will allow for the discussion of this vital matter is a maximum period of three hours.</P>
      <P>May I submit to the Tánaiste that this is a motion which goes to the very root of the economic policy that is being pursued by the Government?  We are faced with a dislocation of industry, and that has been emphasised by the question on the Order Paper to-day. We see the unemployment problem becoming worse from week to week, and there is apparently no plan for dealing with the situation.  I suggest the Government ought to provide us with an opportunity of discussing this motion in Government time.  This motion is of sufficient importance to require a whole day's discussion, particularly in view of the amendment which has been submitted.  It is not as if Ministers were fatigued by having undergone any long legislative trial.</P>
      <P>May I put this consideration to the Tánaiste, that last year the House sat only 49 days; in the last four months of 1939 it sat only 20 days, and, so far, this year it has sat only five days?  In the face of that legislative inactivity, is there any reason why we cannot get a day for the discussion of a motion of such importance as this one, to which the chief Opposition Party has thought it desirable, in its own wisdom, to submit an amendment?  So far as this motion is concerned, a period of three hours for discussion would be totally inadequate.  The least the Government ought to do is to allow a day.  They have plenty of co-operation from Opposition Parties and, in the circumstances, I think they should accede to a very reasonable request.</P>

      <P>I should like to <Col N="2162" /> appeal to the Government to provide ample time for the discussion of this motion.  It is not only an important motion but it is also a very urgent one.  The unemployment situation is growing more serious from day to day because of the dislocation of business arising out of war conditions.  With all respect to the motions that precede this one on the Order Paper, I submit that this is much more urgent.  If the Government cannot provide ample time for its discussion to-day, why not leave it over until to-morrow?  A period of three hours is really very short, particularly when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the Minister who will have to intervene in the debate.  That means there will be only two hours available for Deputies &mdash; if we have even two hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the leader of the Labour Party that the arrangement made by the Government for the discussion of this motion is rather disappointing.  The amendment that has been submitted in my name, and in the name of Deputy McGilligan, seems to point more to the importance and significance of the motion tabled by members of the Labour Party rather than to sidetrack the discussion along any particular lines.  We have all been waiting for the Government to take us into their confidence with regard to the plans they have been making to deal with the growing unemployment <Col N="2163" /> situation, a situation that will inevitably develop and become more serious.  That has been emphasised particularly in the development of the petrol situation, and the position has been made more serious by the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to the general trend of supplies and shipping.  I think the Government should let us know when they propose to make a statement on the general unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>What objection is there to the taking of Deputy Norton's motion as an opportunity of letting the Government hear what the various Parties have to say on the matter, and then letting the House into their confidence with regard to the actual position in the country? Our idea in putting down the amendment is that, before giving any consideration to the lines on which an economic council should be set up, we would like to know what the Government are doing in connection with this matter.  We could then best decide whether it would be necessary to supplement the Government machinery or to replace it by some other machinery.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste has referred to an agreement arrived at by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges under which it was decided that, in order to facilitate private members, discussion on a motion moved during Private Members' time should be confined to three hours.  That was an agreement come to between private members of the House, that in order to give one another fair play, they would not require more than three hours for the discussion of any motion put down for Private Members' time. At the same time, the Government having so much Parliamentary time to spare, indicated that in order to clear off some of the Private Members' motions on the Order Paper, they were prepared to allocate so much of the time on Wednesday and Thursday as they did not require, for the discussion of these motions.  I would ask the Tánaiste not to confuse the two matters or not to forget the undertaking that was given that the Government would assemble the House at the request of any Party.  There is a serious problem referred to in the motion down in the names of Deputy Norton and Davin, and it is a situation of which the Government should really take cognisance and deal with.  I would ask the Tánaiste whether his statement that he would reconsider the matter means that he is prepared, if the matter is put up as one of first class importance by the leader of the Labour Party or any other Party, to give a day to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 20, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2172" /> (1)  The council, by resolution passed under this section and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the council shall have voted, may authorise the expenditure by the corporation of moneys on the decoration of the city for occasions of public rejoicing or for other appropriate occasions.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every resolution passed under this section shall specify the occasion for which the decoration of the city wholly or partly at the expense of the corporation is to be authorised by such resolution and the amount which is to be expended by the corporation on such decoration.</P>
    <P>(3)  Subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section the corporation may expend moneys out of the Municipal Fund in accordance with and in so far as authorised by a resolution passed under this section but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>(4)  The aggregate amount of the expenditure of the corporation for the purposes of this section in any local financial year shall not exceed a sum equivalent to a rate of one penny in the pound of the rateable valuation of the city.</P>
    <P>This is a case in which it is sought to bring this Act into much the same position as the corresponding Act is in, in the City of Dublin.  There are no powers, as far as I can discover at present, to cover cases where the corporation in Cork spends money for the decoration of the city on special occasions.  It is unlikely that this would happen very often &mdash; it may happen once in a generation.  If and when it should happen, it would seem undesirable to have to pass an Act of Parliament in order to pay for it.  As far as the ordinary power is concerned, it is limited in the rate that would be raised to 1d. in the £.  It is a power that would be availed of but seldom, and I am sure that we could leave it to the discretion of the corporation as to whether they would exercise the power at all in any circumstances.  It would be undesirable not to have it there, now that there seems to be an apprehension on the part of certain members of local authorities that their <Col N="2173" /> powers are being taken away from them.  In this case I believe that this is a discretion that might wisely be left to them.</P>

      <P>This is a power which is also in the other Act &mdash; the Act dealing with Dublin.  I understand, from any examination that I have been able to make of it, that there considerable expense is put upon certain citizens of Cork who, if they were resident in Dublin and had to get the same accommodation from the Corporation in Dublin, would get it, while they have to bear the expense of getting it under this Bill, as it stands at present.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2), page 9, line 23, to insert after the words &ldquo;county of <Col N="2174" /> Cork&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and the South Cork Board of Health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision that, if there is a demand for an inquiry by the Cork Corporation, the Minister may hold a local inquiry at which the only representation would be the Cork County Council.  This amendment provides for the insertion of the words &ldquo;and the South Cork Board of Health.&rdquo;  I would point out that the disadvantage I am under here is that I have no idea to what degree the extension will take place.  If the extension merely referred to corporate property or lands upon which corporate property is now built there would not be any reasonable objection to it.  But if the extension of the Borough of Cork, on the demand of the Cork Corporation, is to include&mdash;what was formerly meant to be included&mdash;the extension of the suburban areas, then quite a different picture would present itself to us.  The amendment here asks that the South Cork Board of Health be represented at that inquiry. There are two points in connection with this.  In reading over this Bill, I rather feared that, if I put down an amendment asking that there should be a judicial inquiry, my motives would be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the inspector or in the Minister, but when the Minister views the enormous interests that are involved and that the area represents a rateable valuation of approximately half a million pounds &mdash; £498,000 &mdash; I think he will realise the necessity for such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The area concerned is certainly as large as many of your counties in this country.  The board of health has put up public services there and has pledged its credit and the credit of the rest of the county to enormous expenditure. In view of the many reactions that there are in connection with this Bill, I would suggest seriously to the Minister that there should be a judicial inquiry.  It must be remembered that in depriving the Cork County Council of that particular area you deprive them of a sum of 1/4 in the pound or £58,000 a year.</P>
    <P>That affects all the public services. It affects the provision for your agricultural <Col N="2175" /> committees and the other interests as well, and it particularly affects your technical institution.  I do not think an ordinary local inquiry, such as would be held by an inspector, would be sufficient in this connection, because such an inquiry would be one-sided.  There is the question of the loss of revenue and its effects on the various services to which the Cork County Council contributes, and I think it is only fair and just that a full picture of the matter should be taken into consideration and that the full reactions on all the various bodies that depend on the Cork County Council and the Cork Board of Health should also be borne in mind.  One can easily visualise what it would mean to all those interests and services if we were deprived of such an enormous amount of money.</P>
    <P>I can speak of a precedent in this case.  This is not the first time that this demand came from the Cork Corporation. About 30 years ago, or less, the same demand came, in a very acute degree, and supported very strongly, from the Cork Corporation, and a foreign Government then set up a Parliamentary Committee, which is tantamount to what I now ask for, that is, a judicial inquiry.  The result of that inquiry was that the demand of the Cork Corporation was refused and Cork County, with its territory and its revenues, remained intact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  The reason is quite obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what is obvious about it.  I do not wish to go into that matter, but to confine myself rigidly to the subject of the amendment.  Possibly that matter will come on in a later debate, but it is quite clear that Cork Corporation would benefit enormously, and they certainly would get rateable property from us in the Cork County Council, which brings in a revenue of £58,000, but it would not be £58,000 under the Cork Corporation &mdash; it would be £126,000 on Cork's present rate of 25/6 in the £. Our urban rate is approximately 12/6, while the Cork Corporation rate is <Col N="2176" /> 25/6.  However, as I say, I did not intend to deal with that matter in a big question of this kind, but it certainly will not be a nice thing for these people who have been paying about 12/- of a rate to have to pay 25/6. However, I shall confine myself to the rigid terms of the amendment.  The first is that we ask you to incorporate the most vitally concerned portion of the Cork area, the South Cork Board of Assistance, in this inquiry, and we ask you, in view of the reactions concerned in this matter and all the interests that hang on the ultimate decision of the Ministry, to give us a judicial inquiry into this matter, as was done previously by another Government &mdash; a judicial inquiry where all affected interests would have the right to be heard.</P>
      <P>There is another motion coming on afterwards, and a good deal of the detailed arguments will be covered in that.  Accordingly, I merely move this amendment: first, for the incorporation of the South Cork Board of Health, and secondly &mdash; I have already explained my reasons for not putting down an amendment to this effect, as I did not want my attitude to be misinterpreted &mdash; I would ask, in view of the enormous reactions in this question, if such a thing is contemplated as an extension of the borough boundary, including the four divisions of the suburbs of Cork in our area, that a judicial inquiry on the matter should be held.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, formally, to second the motion.  I think that the South Cork Board of Health will be even more affected in this matter than the county council.  We have had an enormous amount of property built there during the past few years, and we have had to take on numbers of people who have been thrown out of Cork City because they were not able to pay rent of rooms.  As a result, if there is any incorporation of that area in the city we are going to suffer and lose very heavily by it.  Then there is any amount of lighting facilities, sewerage, and so on, involved, and I think it would be only plain justice that the South Cork Board of Health should be allowed at least to be present and represented <Col N="2177" /> at such an inquiry.  They are an interested body and surely they are entitled to representation.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not be influenced by the statements of Deputies Broderick and Corry, because this is a long-standing grievance, and the City of Cork has extended a much greater distance than Deputy Broderick or Deputy Corry have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the City of Cork to-day is in a smaller area than the urban area of Macroom, and I do not think people should have a grievance in this matter. If people are living in the city and enjoying all the amenities of city life, I do not see why they should not contribute towards the expenses of the carrying on of the city.  Some 2,000 houses have already been built in the county area.  I am not looking at it merely from the point of view of the Cork Corporation, and I think that the people there have a wider outlook on this matter than the parochial view that has been expressed here.  I think it is a terrible thing that the boundary has not been extended long ago.  There was an inquiry set up in that connection in 1887, and another in 1903.  If it was necessary then, I do not see how Deputies Broderick and Corry should not realise how much more necessary it is now, with the development of modern transport &mdash; trams, and so on.  Deputy Corry knows as well as Deputy Broderick that the residents of suburban areas are the very people who have been making a very good living out of the citizens of Cork, and for that reason we believe they should contribute towards the upkeep of the city.  I hope the Minister will not make the burden on the citizens any greater but will bring in the suburbs by having the city extended.</P>

      <P>The incorporation of the area would vitally concern Cork County, and South Cork Board of Health, representing a valuation of <Col N="2178" /> £589,000.  What is asked is to have a judicial inquiry set up where the position could be argued for and against. The county council desires nothing but equity and justice and is prepared to have the whole case heard before a judicial tribunal which would report to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any objection to the amendment.  I think the omission of representation of South Cork Board of Health at any inquiry is an oversight, and that that was due to the fact that the matter was conceived when other things were in the offing, for instance, the County Management Act, under which boards of health would be abolished.  If the position is that this Bill could be implemented as an Act, before there is other legislation, it is only right and just that South Cork Board of Health should be represented.  That body is more intimately connected with the administration of that area than the county council.  I am sure it does not need any eloquence to convince the Minister that the board of health should be represented at the inquiry, and its views heard.  I hope the Minister will not have any objection about accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any point in the setting up of a judicial inquiry or in having any procedure other than that adopted in other cities and towns.  I do not see any reason for having any different procedure.  An inquiry will be held, and all interested parties will be able to attend.  I understand that Deputy Broderick has in mind a judicial inquiry, and that whoever held it would report to the Minister. There is not very much difference in that proposal from an inquiry held by an inspector who reports.  I am sure the inspector could elucidate the facts just as well as any judicial inquiry. As far as the amendments are concerned, the board of public health is composed of members of the Cork County Council, and is elected by the <Col N="2179" /> county council.  It is quite obvious that an inquiry that affects the county council affects the subsidiary body, and that the county council will get all the assistance from the board of health, if it is in existence at the time.  All the information will be available, and any representation that it wishes to make or any evidence will be heard.  The board of health in conjunction with the county council will be able to submit a case and all the facts connected with it to whoever holds the inquiry.  There is no point whatever in bringing in this amendment.  A further objection, as Deputy Hurley pointed out, is that the County Management Act abolishes boards of health in the country.  If the County Management Act is put into operation before any inquiry could be held, the board of health would not be in existence. Deputy Broderick need not have any worries about not bringing in the Cork Board of Public Health, because in the ordinary way it will be able, through the county council, to make any representations and to submit any facts in opposition.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The new Borough of Cork City shall be made a separate area for board of assistance charges and Article 13 of the Cork County Scheme made under the Act of 1923 shall be hereby amended accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could make a better case for this amendment than that made by Deputy Hickey when speaking on behalf of Cork Corporation.  Why should citizens who avail of the public <Col N="2180" /> services in the City of Cork, and who derive their livelihood and pleasures in the city, not pay for them?  It is always incumbent on people who have advantages that they should share the disadvantages too.  If Deputy Hickey's argument holds good in one case it should hold good in the other case, and if people have the advantages of the city why should they not have the liabilities?  On that ground Deputy Hickey must agree with the amendment. He cannot have it both ways. The question affects South Cork area vitally.  We have never been disposed to take a parochial view about the question but we want equity and justice. The position seems to be an extraordinary one at present.  Prior to the amalgamation scheme every board of guardians was responsible for home assistance, and for health and hospital services in its area.  These bodies had local knowledge and had control of the money they spent.  When amalgamation came the City of Cork was enthusiastic for that scheme, particularly when it incorporated what is now known as South Cork Board of Assistance. Incidentally, the amalgamation scheme relieved the ratepayers of Cork City of £30,000, and that amount was planted on the backs of people living in rural areas, where home assistance was needed more than in the City of Cork.  It has been argued that the City of Cork should be made an entity for home assistance.  In the rural areas concerned with Cork I should point out that we are paying more than double the amount of rates of the entire area. Cork City pays about £47,000.  In other words, they collect very nearly three times the revenue in the rural areas. But, when it comes to the distribution of that money, Cork City gets about £4,0000 more than all the rest of the county.  That is a most inequitable and unjust proceeding.</P>
    <P>In asking the Minister to make Cork City a separate entity we are only asking him to do what has been done in the City of Limerick.  If Limerick is a separate entity, why should it be denied to Cork?  Why should this liability on the rest of the area of £30,000 per year be perpetuated?  At the present time it is more than that owing to the increased <Col N="2181" /> expenditure, because in the City of Cork it is necessary to give larger amounts in home assistance than in the rural areas.  But the rural areas have to pay practically two-thirds of the entire amount.  That is one argument for this amendment.</P>
    <P>There can be very little administrative difficulty in adopting it, because the services can remain as they are. We can pay, as we are paying in other cases, on a capitation basis to the various boards and hospitals.  All we are asking is that the City of Cork should be made a rateable area for the upkeep of its own hospitals and for home assistance, and that the rest of the area be included in one unit so that it will only be responsible for the liabilities in that area and not be carrying the City of Cork on its back, particularly as so strong a case has been made in favour of the City of Cork being one entity.  It has been strongly argued that those people living outside the city boundary enjoy all the amenities of the city.  Why should they not pay for the upkeep of these and for the maintenance of the poor?  Under this scheme our valuation is being reduced by approximately £74,000, and our liability is being increased by the extension of the boundaries of the city.  No argument can be put forward in justice or in equity for perpetuating what was done under the amalgamation scheme nearly 20 years ago, when the City of Cork was relieved of the payment of £30,000 for the upkeep of hospitals and home assistance&mdash;at the present time that liability would possibly amount to £45,000&mdash;and it was transferred to the unfortunate struggling ratepayers in the provincial towns and mountainy districts in Co. Cork.</P>
    <P>I think that was most unjust, and that this amendment has everything to commend it.  I say without fear of contradiction that this scheme in its conception in the first instance was most unjust to the rest of the area in County Cork, and I hope sincerely that it will be reconsidered.  I have already made it clear that we do not want to have different boards and staffs set up for administration purposes; <Col N="2182" /> that the administration should be carried on as it is being carried on, but that there should be two distinct areas as regards liability for the services&mdash;the South Cork Board of Assistance area as one, and the City of Cork with its extended boundaries as the other.  That is all we ask for, and I submit that it is a matter of clear justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the amendment I wish to ask what have the farmers of the South Cork area done to this House?  What did they do to the gentlemen who got this brain wave? Why should Dublin be regarded as a separate entity, and why should Limerick, which is only one-third the size of Cork City, be regarded as a separate entity?  Why should the rural population of Cork be scourged in this way?  We are entitled to ask what was the reason for making Dublin and Limerick separate entities for home assistance purposes and then taking in a portion of Cork county, which was considered so far away from the city that it was put into Waterford County for Parliamentary election purposes? Why should the area represented by Deputy Broderick, which is now in the Parliamentary constituency of Waterford, pay for the poor of Cork city? Did anyone ever hear of anything so outrageous as that?</P>
      <P>Those people knew well what they were doing.  I will give some figures to show what it means.  In 1921-22 Cork City paid to the board of guardians £54,190 for poor law purposes. In 1924-25, after the amalgamation, the demand on the city was £23,000 odd.  That meant that £30,000 was clapped on to the ratepayers in the rural areas stretching as far as the constituency of Waterford.  If there is anything more outrageous than that, I do not know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking for justice now for an outrage committed 17 years ago. For 17 years the unfortunate people of that area have been groaning under this injustice, and we are only looking for fair play for them.  I do not know what reason, political or otherwise, brought about that extraordinary condition of affairs.  Limerick City, as I <Col N="2183" /> said, was made a separate entity for home assistance purposes, but Cork City was not.  I will now give the figures for 1939-40.  The demand of Cork City for poor law services for that year was £46,990.  The amount paid in home assistance alone in Cork City was £24,440.  The demand in the South Cork area was £113,927 and they got back only £22,000 of that.  In other words, they paid over £50,000 last year for the upkeep of the poor in Cork City.  It is time that was ended. As representing the unfortunate agricultural community in that area, the small farmers, the cottiers and the workers generally, we are only looking for the same justice that was meted out to similar classes of the community in County Dublin and in County Limerick.  Surely we are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>We should be told the reason, if there is a reason, for keeping that area in Cork.  If there is a reason, there should be an equal reason for extending the area in Dublin and Limerick on the same lines.  If it is right that this liability should be put on to the South Cork area, it is equally right that a similar liability should be put on the County Dublin and County Limerick people.  On the other hand, if it is right and just that Limerick City should pay its own poor law demands, it is equally right and just that Cork City should pay its own poor law demands.  You cannot have it both ways; you must have it one way or the other.  If it is right and just that Limerick City and Dublin City should be separate areas for home assistance charges, it is equally right and just that Cork City should be made a separate area for home assistance charges.  On the contrary, if it is right and just that the South Cork area should pay for the upkeep of the poor of Cork City, it is equally right and just that County Dublin and County Limerick should be made pay for the poor of Dublin City and Limerick City. You cannot blow hot and cold.  It must be one thing or the other.  I do not know why this iniquitous procedure was first put through by the Department <Col N="2184" /> of Local Government.  What did the unfortunate farmers in the South Cork area do either to the Local Government Department or to the Government of that day?</P>
    <P>If Limerick City is treated as a separate area for poor law purposes, why should not the same apply to Cork City?  Why should the agricultural community down as far as Waterford&mdash;the constituency represented by Deputy Broderick&mdash;have to pay for the poor of Cork City?  That area is so far away from Cork City that a piece of Cork had to be sliced off and transferred to another county, but the people there, under the present arrangement, have to pay for the poor of Cork City.  If there is any justice at all, this amendment should be accepted by the Government.  That is if there is any justice left in them, and I have my doubts.  The position, at any rate, is that since 1923, under an Act passed by the last Government, the agricultural community surrounding Cork City, and extending, as I have said, into the County Waterford, have been saddled with a charge of £50,000 a year.  That means that almost half a million money has been taken from them in the last 17 years. It is time, I think, that that injustice was removed.  If it is held to be a good thing that Cork City should have other areas attached to it, then why not apply the same principle to the cities of Dublin and Limerick?  If, on the other hand, it is right that Dublin and Limerick should be separate entities, surely there should be the same consideration for the agricultural community surrounding Cork City.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broderick made the point that if the borough boundary of Cork were extended the loss in valuation would amount to something like £74,000.  That would represent something like 1/8 in the £ on the area within the jurisdiction of the Cork City Management Act for unemployment assistance.  It would mean raising another £38,000 in addition to what is already being done.  There has been a lot said to the effect that the agricultural community have been <Col N="2185" /> asked to pay for the poor of Cork City.  It is obvious that, where you have a population of over 80,000, a greater sum of money will be required for relief purposes than in more sparsely populated areas.</P>

      <P>I am not going to discuss that, but if the Deputy's argument on this is to hold as regards the agricultural areas, then why should not those areas or parishes be called upon to provide the sum required for the allowances to their parliamentary representatives?  I hope the Minister will not accept the point of view that has been stressed by Deputy Corry.  What we are asking is that the borough boundary be extended.  I am certain that the citizens of Cork are quite prepared to bear any burden that may be placed on them to meet home assistance demands.</P>

      <P>All this matter was debated as recently as last year on the Public Assistance Bill.  Deputy Broderick and other Deputies raised it.  With regard to Cork, we have a public assistance area covering Cork City and a southern public assistance district composed of representatives of the county council and of the city council.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the county council has not a say in the granting of home assistance. Deputy Corry and Deputy Broderick are now trying to avoid the position we have in Dublin City and Waterford City.  Emphasis has been laid on the Limerick position.  I believe it was a mistake and has been proved to be such.  I do not know how the Limerick position was brought about, but I think if the representatives of the Limerick County Council and of the Limerick City Council could have foreseen what the setting up of separate institutions was going to cost them they would never have arrived at the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not suggested the setting up of separate institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>You have said that they are costing you so much, but it has to be remembered that Cork County is having the benefit of those institutions.  In 1925 a commission was set up to inquire into the relief of the sick and destitute poor.  That commission, in its report, referred to the position in Limerick&mdash;a position that had been then a few years in operation.  This is what it has to say on the matter, at page 130, paragraph 35 of its Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In Cork, as we have seen, the County Borough is for poor relief purposes part of South County District. Waterford County Borough is joined to Waterford County and both areas administered under one Board of Public Assistance, Limerick <Col N="2187" /> County and County Borough on the other hand elected to have separate schemes and in doing so we consider that from the point of view of the interests of the poor a mistake was made.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Except in Limerick County Borough the areas of administration have everywhere been enlarged. Limerick County Borough formed only part of the old Limerick Union, and the County Borough Board of Health, therefore, has a smaller functional area than the Guardians of Limerick Union.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The local authorities in Cork and Waterford acted wisely, in our opinion, in framing joint schemes, and an examination of the working of separate schemes in Limerick has strengthened this opinion.  The Limerick County Board of Health have incurred heavy expenditure in creating central institutions at Croom and Newcastle West.  Whilst not approving of the arrangements made for either the County or County Borough, we cannot see our way, having regard to this expenditure, to propose a radical revision of the schemes and our recommendations must, therefore, be considered as making the best of circumstances as they are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Except for the enormous expenditure incurred by the county council in doing what I think was foolish, and what I think they recognised themselves as foolish, in setting up separate institutions through the county, instead of throwing in their lot with the city of Limerick, it would have been much better for both the city and the county.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Restrict public assistance to the smaller areas and let every little place pay for itself.&rdquo;  That is going back to the times of the union area, and it is going back even further. If you pursue it to its logical conclusion, it means going back to the faroff days of the electoral division, and then into what position would you get yourself?  The position would be that the poorest area would have the highest cost of assistance.  How could <Col N="2188" /> it be done?  If you want to pursue this matter of separating various areas and keeping them all in compact compartments, it means that the cost will be so high that the very poor areas would have no hope of meeting it. Whether some Deputies agree or not, the object of the amalgamation scheme was to spread out the area.  I believe that was the most satisfactory and the best way of meeting the position, but to suggest now that we should go back and separate the City of Cork from the county for various purposes is to suggest a retrograde step and I cannot recommend the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with two points in his reply which we did not suggest.  We believed it was a mistake for Limerick to set up two distinct services and our suggestion was that the existing services should remain, that the two areas should form two distinct rateable areas in respect of revenue and expenditure within them but that the public services and public institutions should remain as they are.  There is no great difficulty at all about that.  I entirely agree that the larger the area you have, consistent with conditions being approximate in the areas, as would be the case in rural areas, small urban towns and villages, the more equitable will be the position, but I do not agree that it is carrying out the spirit of the Act when you incorporate a huge industrial place like Cork City, with its great wealth on one hand and great poverty on the other, with its revenues derived from many sources, which are entirely denied to such little places as I refer to, with the county.  There ought to be two distinct ratings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that where you have areas approximately the same, small urban areas and rural areas, the larger they are, the more equitable will be the levy and the more equitably will they be looked after, but I think it is entirely against the interests of the ratepayers to incorporate a huge industrial city, with enormous wealth and expenditure, which in themselves, bring, I suppose, a good deal of poverty.  In respect of these two points, I agree that it was a mistake for Limerick to set up two different forms <Col N="2189" /> of administration.  I think it is a very simple matter to have two distinct rateable areas and to allow the public services to be availed of.  I do not agree that it is in the best interests of everyone, except those of the financial interests of the City of Cork, to have a huge industrial area foisted on the rest of the area with which it has nothing in common.  It has been proved, in relation to value and output of the last 17 years, that the first transference represented a relief for the City of Cork at the expense of the rest of the community of £30,000 a year, and now of £45,000 a year.  These points, I think, have not been received by the Minister with the seriousness with which they were put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Minister's statement I think he has not got a leg to stand on.  He says that it was wrong for Limerick to set up two forms of administration.  Why was it not changed in Limerick?  Because he knows that the Government responsible for changing it would not send any representatives back to this House again.  This is an injustice on the agricultural community around Cork City. The Minister talks of an entity.  Why does he not take in the rest of Waterford? He has already taken in a portion, and Deputy Broderick, a representative of Waterford, is speaking here for the South Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, on that argument, I would have no right to speak for Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the Deputy is a representative of the Cork area, and entitled to speak for it, but to-day, though he represents the constituency of Waterford, and though the particular portion of the constituency which he represents is still in Waterford, he has to pay for the poor of Cork City.  I think it is absolutely unjust and unfair, and the fact that it is brought up here at every opportunity shows that it is an injustice which we feel, and feel keenly.  I do not know by what political ramp it was engineered, but it was undoubtedly engineered by some political ramp.  No man can say otherwise, or could say that any Local Government Department would solemnly say that Cork City shall have <Col N="2190" /> attached to it, for home assistance purposes, a portion of the constituency of Waterford, and that Limerick City, which is only one-third of its size, shall be a separate area for home assistance purposes.  We have often heard of lunacy in Government Departments, but that was the worst yet.  We are appealing only for justice, because that one stroke, that single act, threw £30,000 a year on to the rural areas concerned. In discharge of its poor law liabilities, Cork City paid the board of guardians £54,190 in 1921-22, but, in 1924-25, they paid only £23,934.  The rest was thrown back on the country boys by the deliberate act of this Dáil, engineered by the Local Government Department.  We are looking for justice now in asking the Dáil of to-day to remedy the injustice then done.  We are asking for no more, and either the Minister agrees to it, or we shall have to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry, as usual, is very loose with his words.  It is all right to talk very fast, but another matter to talk very loosely.  He says that I have not a leg to stand on in this matter, because I did not remedy the position in Limerick, but it is very difficult to remedy a position when you find it as it exists in Limerick.  Two institutions have been set up in Limerick consequent on allowing the separation of the city and county.  There is a hospital in Croom and a home in Newcastle, and when you have these institutions, with their staff, it is very difficult for anybody to remedy the position.  At the time this was done there may have been some measure of agreement on separation, but I think that they did feel, very shortly after, that it was a mistake.  Perhaps I may quote one sentence from the report of that commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was raised by Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="2194" /> on the Second Reading and we have tried to meet the position.  What is proposed to be done under this amendment is that the valuation of land that is taken in will be reduced by half.  There is practically no differential rating in Cork City.  When this schedule was inserted in the Bill we understood there was such a thing as differential rating in Cork City.  Apparently there is differential rating only with regard to half rents, that is charitable properties, and such like where the owner is rated on half the rent, which are very few and very small.  The differential rating so far as it applies to them will still apply.  That is a matter that we overlooked when the Bill was being drafted.  It was discovered that in 1919 a provisional order was made which abolished differential rating except with regard to those half rents that I have referred to.  In this Bill we propose to leave the position as it is except to secure that land that is taken in by any extension of the city boundaries shall be reduced by half the valuation.

However, there is only one question I would ask the Minister to look into.  The area of arable land in Cork Borough is not very large.  It seems to me to be unreasonable that a man living in the City of Dublin would get the benefit of differential rating but he would not get it in Cork.  It is obvious from the provisional order and from other inquiries which I have made that no part of the agricultural grant goes to the Cork Borough, so that as far as they are concerned they have no means of providing for a reduction in the rates.  It seems unreasonable that land in one part of the country should be subject to an imposition which it does not have <Col N="2195" /> to bear in any other part.  Would the Minister look into this matter between this and the next stage and see how much it would cost to make that concession? I think the Minister has met me fairly with regard to the other part.</P>

      <P>I doubt that, because my impression is that there is very much more land in the Dublin Borough, and I have the gravest doubts that the agricultural grant which was payable in the Dublin Borough would be anything like that.  The agricultural grant in question is about £600,000.  I seem to have a recollection that the sums which were since made available did not pour out into the county boroughs. In this particular case it is unreasonable that Cork should not get the benefit of that part of the agricultural grant, and I do not believe it could possibly cost £1,250.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That gives me great courage.  This is the furthest I have ever got, and I have been at it seven years.  This is the ninth time I have returned to this issue.  The proposal contained in this amendment is that we should establish in the City of Dublin a clinic run on lines not identical with but similar to clinics operated in London, Glasgow, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, and in most of the big cities of the English-speaking world with which I am familiar, for a specific purpose, and the specific purpose is to separate the sick children from the truly delinquent children who come before the Juvenile Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has interested himself in the subject of juvenile delinquency recognises that if you are dealing with the problem of the juvenile delinquent <Col N="2197" /> under 16 years of age, the hope of redeeming that child and making a good citizen out of him is very high, but when you find yourself confronted with a juvenile delinquent of 18, 19 or 20 years of age, the hope of redeeming that individual is comparatively low. Therefore, the aim of any prudent Government should be to secure that when a child under 16 years of age comes within the ambit of its authority for correction for some extra legal act, no pain should be spared to secure that the result of that correction will be that that child will never come in conflict with the law again.  To do that, you have got to ensure that whatever correction is administered will be appropriate to the circumstances surrounding the delinquent act.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of the late District Justice Cussen, who for many years presided with distinction over the Juvenile Court in this city, I was privileged to sit on the bench with him, and no one who had that privilege could avoid being struck by the fact that a high proportion of the children who were brought in there were manifestly suffering from psychological or physical disability.  Let us bear this in mind, and it cannot be too often repeated: we should not over-sentimentalise the problem of juvenile delinquency. Many people going into the Juvenile Court would get the idea that all the juveniles brought before the magistrate were poor injured little angels.  Well, they are nothing of the kind.  Amongst those children who are brought into the Juvenile Court there are some pretty tough eggs, and they have to be dealt with by the most effective method for dealing with a tough egg.  It has to be borne in mind that no child is taken away from its parents and put into an institution by the Juvenile Court until he has been before the magistrate on substantially more than one occasion.  Now, some children may keep coming before the magistrate because they are tough eggs, and require a discipline which they are not getting in their own homes, and, when the magistrate makes up his mind that he cannot persuade the parents of those children to administer the discipline that is necessary for their own <Col N="2198" /> salvation, it then becomes his duty to choose a suitable institution and to see that those children are sent there, so that they may have the discipline that will rescue them from themselves and convert them into decent, law-abiding citizens in their maturity.</P>
    <P>Very frequently children come before the court and it would appear from their general conduct that they are manifesting initial criminal tendencies. But the trained observer would immediately detect in a child's demeanour and conduct evidence of some physical or psychological injury from which that child was suffering which was causing it to perpetrate delinquencies, although the child itself could not explain to authority why it was doing the things for which it was continually being brought before the police court. Not infrequently, on close and expert inquiry into the family surroundings of the child, it will emerge that the defect is not in the child at all, but that one of the parents, either through ignorance or psychological defect in himself or herself, is so handling the child that it is being driven to distraction and is manifesting that distraction by breaches of the law that society cannot tolerate and that must be ended.</P>
    <P>If you take a child who is suffering from a psychological injury, or who is the victim of some psychological or possibly physical weakness in an overworked parent, and submit that child to discipline that would be salutary and good in the case of the normal little tough egg, instead of curing the child who is suffering from the psychological affliction you are going gravely to accentuate his psychological trouble, and you may inflict a scar upon his entire personality which will be concealed, and which will not manifest itself until that child turns up as a young man in the Borstal Institute and subsequently in Mountjoy Jail.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Education that every child committed to his care by the Department of Justice, through the Juvenile Courts, is a trust from which he cannot escape.  It is not enough for him to say: &ldquo;I have visited the industrial school and I have visited <Col N="2199" /> the reformatory, and found them clean and well-run and generally satisfactory.&rdquo; He has to ask himself not only: &ldquo;am I providing in the institutions to which these children may be sent, proper care for normal children&rdquo; but he has to ask himself further: &ldquo;Is the care that I am providing for each of these children adequate to rescue the child, for whom I have taken responsibility, from the dangers that beset it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember what the Minister undertakes to do.  He is going into a Christian family and is talking out of the hands of the child's father and mother the authority that was vested in them by God to bring that child up.  It may be that is a good thing in certain cases to do; it may be a necessary and proper thing to do; but if you do it, you take upon your shoulders a terrible responsibility.  No Minister for Education is entitled simply to shovel a child into an industrial school and forget all about it.  He is bound to satisfy himself that once having taken the responsibility for removing the child from the family circle, he will secure for it the best treatment that it is possible for the State to provide in order to compensate it for the loss of the natural family surroundings into which it was born under the dispensation of God. My suggestion is that without this institution that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>I approached this question at least nine times, and when you do that you are sometimes a bit shy of repeating the same old arguments that you feel you have expounded so often before. But I have to cover the same ground because it is the same case, and I cannot get it listened to; I cannot get anyone to give a damn about it.  The last time I spoke about it, no newspaper in Ireland considered it worth while mentioning, the reason being, apparently, that nobody gave a damn about it.  The Minister just shovels them into an industrial school.  Deputy Byrne and myself fought rings around on a previous occasion here, and nobody just gave a damn.  The Minister even did not bother to rise in his place to comment upon what Deputy Byrne <Col N="2200" /> and I said.  He merely rail-roaded the section through.  I do not make any apologies for covering the same ground, and so long as I am in this House I will repeat my statements until a scandal&mdash;and it is a scandal&mdash;of this kind is abated.</P>
    <P>I will put this case to Deputies. Suppose one of your children became unruly and intractable; suppose you administered the necessary correction, what you thought was proper correction for a serious fault, and the child persisted in it to the point when you felt that correction could effect no more.  What would you do?  Would you send for the Guards?  Would you have the child taken to the police station and sent to Summerhill and thence to an industrial school?  I do not think so.  I think you would go to the family physician and say: &ldquo;Doctor, I do not know what has come over this child at all.  Punishment, remonstrance, lectures have no effect on him, and if he were not my own child I would say he was going to become a little criminal&rdquo;.  The doctor probably would say: &ldquo;There is nothing to worry about.  There are two or three excellent children's consultants in Dublin. Bring the child to one of them and have him examined and you will find some psychological trouble or physical defect and, when it is corrected, the child will be restored to normalcy and he will be like any other kid, and you will have no more trouble with him than you had with any of the others.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Or he might say: &ldquo;Let me see this child's mother before we determine what it is best to do.&rdquo;  It may turn out that the child's mother was a nervous woman and was suffering from some trouble, and her short temper and nervous condition were reacting on the child, and the child did not understand that it was suffering from the effects of its mother's neurasthenia, and the mother would not understand it.  But the net result would be that the little child would be so conducting itself that it had become the despair of its parents.  By adopting proper measures you would put the mother in good health, you would help to eliminate the physical and psychological defects in <Col N="2201" /> the child and that little creature would be turned into a normal, happy child, to grow up into a useful normal citizen.</P>
    <P>If that is the course that any one of us would adopt&mdash;and I cannot doubt that it is&mdash;why should we withhold from the poor what we stipulate our own children must have?  I am not asking for a luxury; I am not asking that we should give Ford V8 cars to every resident of Gloucester Street; all I ask is that we should not impose on the children of the poor a system of reform designed to turn their children into criminals, when for our own children in similar cases we could secure, and would secure, treatment that would convert an unhappy, fractious child into a healthy kid, destined to grow into a useful citizen.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be lecturing Deputies.  There is not a Deputy who has not as much expert knowledge in these matters as I have.  There is not one of us but knows that if in your youth, in your extreme youth as a child, you are unsympathetically and imprudently handled in a time of childish mental crisis, you may carry into your manhood an injury which will render you abnormal for the length of your life.  There are, many of us know, hundreds of men and women walking this world in misery, as a result of a psychological injury that was done to them when they were children, and the tragedy of it is that 99 per cent. of them do not know the reason of their eccentricities of maturity.  But the skilled observer, whose duty it is to become learned in such matters, can watch them alienating their friends and become the &ldquo;odd man out&rdquo;, simply because some foolish discipline was imposed on them when they were small children at a time when they wanted a cure, care or medical help, instead of the punishment they got.</P>
    <P>The plan I have in mind is this. Some people may say here, why should we want a Juvenile Court at all? Because we are practical, sensible men. The poor very frequently are not in a position to get the kind of medical assistance out of their own pockets that the more well-to-do may provide. The children of the poor play in the <Col N="2202" /> streets and, for a variety of reasons, the deliquent child of the poor very frequently requires the intervention of the State to rescue it from what would otherwise be the consequences of what it may do.  What I want to see happen is this.  Under the new Children's Bill, the district justice will sit in his office like the head master of a school. That is as it should be.  Say that a child has forced the Guards to proceed against it.  Let us bear in mind that the Guards are, if anything, too softhearted. There is no question of the Guards going out like ravening lions to persecute the children of the poor. No child is brought before the juvenile court until the Guards have made up their minds that it is the best thing that can be done for the child's own good.  A Guard in plain clothes tells the parents to have the child in court on a Friday morning in Dublin. The child is brought by the father or the mother or by both of them and the Guard in plain clothes, and usually a voluntary officer, into the district justice's room off the court.  There, I anticipate, in a paternal domesticated kind of atmosphere, the justice will inquire into the circumstances that brought the child before the court.</P>
    <P>Now comes the critical moment. Under the existing dispensation, the child is remanded to the filthy hole in Summerhill.  When I say &ldquo;filthy hole,&rdquo; I do not mean that it is crawling with vermin or covered with dirt. It is not; it is as clean as a new pin but it is a horrible old house with bars on the windows.  A decent respectable man is doing his best to occupy the children with no means of occupying them.  There is a miserable concrete yard at the back where the children are supposed to march up and down.  There is no other place to accommodate them.  Instead of sending the child to a place such as that, I want the district justice to be able to say to the parents of the child, &ldquo;Well, now the best thing you can do is to bring him home and give him a &lsquo;skelping&rsquo; and let this not happen again. Let that be an end to it.&rdquo;  The child is taken home by either the father or the mother and gets the &ldquo;skelping&rdquo; and that is the end of it. But, suppose the justice makes up his <Col N="2203" /> mind that either the parents are unsatisfactory, or that there is something about the case that makes him uneasy and that he wants another opportunity of considering the matter with the assistance of expert opinion, I want him to be in a position to say &ldquo;I am going to send the child to the nuns at St. Teresa's Road&rdquo; or wherever the place may be.  He can say to the parents &ldquo;You can see him there every day in the week.  There will be a doctor and a matron there to look after him and the nuns will be there to keep their eye on him.  Do not get distressed about him.  If you like, you can go down to the home with him now or you can see him to-morrow evening or the evening after.  My only purpose in sending him there is to have him examined so that when he comes up before me next Friday, I shall have before me the report of a physician on the state of his physical health and the report of a competent psychologist on the condition of his mind.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I have these facts before me, with the record of what he has been doing, I shall do my best for him, whatever that best may be.  If the child is a sick child, then steps will be taken to provide better treatment for him.  If the child is suffering from nervous strain or anything like that, perhaps the doctor will recommend that he be sent to an aunt in the country.  &ldquo;It might be as well for you to get away with him, too, for six months and try to become settled down.  It may be that the report will show that the child is suffering from nervous strain, as a result of association with a neurasthenic person. Whatever we do, the decision will be taken after the best expert advice it is possible to get to save that child, so that when it leaves our hands it will have the best possible chance of turning over a new leaf and getting a new start.&rdquo;  The cost of this proposal will be so microscopic that no tax can be conceived small enough to appropriate to this object.</P>

      <P>I am not asking for anything calculated to embarrass the Exchequer.  I am not asking for a luxury for any section of the community. I am not asking for any concession. It seems to me that I am merely asking for bare justice for these children.  If I have established that the alternative to my proposal is to run the danger of injuring these children permanently, that to withhold this precaution is to do the most defenceless section of the community, the children of the poor, grave injustice, I do not believe there is any Deputy sitting in the Dáil who wants to see that injustice done.  For these reasons, for the ninth time, I ask for justice for these children.  I ask no substantial sympathy from the people of whom I make the request, and I challenge any Deputy of this House or any interested party outside to make a case against the proposal that I have laid before Dáil Eireann, because there is no case to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon says that there is no case to be made against the proposal.  The Deputy really has not given the House very much information. In putting up proposals in which the expenditure of public money is necessitated, particularly in times like the present, definite and adequate reasons must be given for such expenditure. In view of the emergency conditions prevailing, I feel that the House might have expected a more reasoned argument from Deputy Dillon, to show the advantages of this proposal.  Even if I were in agreement with him, I do not think that I could accept the amendment in its present form, because what in fact has happened is that, by a <Col N="2205" /> skilful and ingenious piece of draftsmanship, we are discussing an amendment which certainly would involve Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>We cannot expect a new development of the nature which the Deputy has in mind merely by conferring upon the Minister certain powers in a Bill of this kind to &ldquo;make regulations accordingly.&rdquo; If I were to go to the schools to-morrow and ask them to provide a clinic&mdash;or whatever the place of observation and examination might be called, from the medical point of view &mdash;the schools would immediately retort that this is a matter which the Government themselves should undertake. They would say that with reason. Even, therefore, if we were agreed upon the principle of the amendment, it would be impossible to accept it in its present form.</P>
      <P>Moreover, its terms render it impossible of implementation from another point of view.  It presupposes that every single child who would be brought before a court would be examined. The interpretation, I think, could be put upon it, if this examination were to take place in an industrial school, that the managers of the schools were bound to accept the child.  There is a very important question which Deputy Dillon and other speakers have not adverted to, so far as I know and that is that, under Section 52 of the Principal Act the managers of a certified school have full discretion as to whether they would accept or decline to receive such child.  The amendment proposes that the Minister should make regulations which would compel acceptance, contrary to their statutory rights.</P>

I presume that he is simply taking advantage of this amendment to place his views on this matter before the House, to get some ventilation for his point of view, and to hear the arguments against it.

If it is proposed that this should be allied to the courts and corollary to the work of the courts it seems to me that it would be a question for the Department of Justice, but I do not feel that Deputy Dillon has established the case which would justify him.

      <P>The Deputy may keep repeating &ldquo;It is true&rdquo; and may continue to interrupt me as long as he wishes, but he can represent only his own point of view.  I happen, for the time being, to be responsible for the Department of Education and I have to take public responsibility, and if anybody tries to suggest in this House that injustice is being done to those children or that I am not undertaking my proper responsibility in seeing that they are not eventually on the road to becoming criminals, that they are not on the high road to the Borstal institutions, surely it is only in the nature of things that I should be permitted to reply to those charges.  I was angry and annoyed with Deputy Dillon, but I must say that, since his speech got no support, with a single exception, from the remainder of the House, I did not think it worthy of consideration, and apparently the Irish newspapers, as a whole, did not consider it was worthy of very much consideration either.  There is no foundation whatever for the suggestion, and it seems to me to imply definitely that there is something radically wrong in the present system.  I admit that the present system was taken over from the British Government.</P>

That is that we have these institutions and these children entrusted to our religious, our own people, our own flesh and blood, working under an Irish Government; and to suggest that, because of some weakness on my part, or some weakness in the people who run these institutions, we are neglecting our duty, and <Col N="2209" /> that if certain steps which Deputy Dillon has in mind were taken we would not have so many boys going from the industrial schools or the reformatory to the Borstal, is altogether wrong.

      <P>Here is what Deputy Dillon said on the last occasion.  I am quoting from Column 1844, Volume 81:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: That is what tries my patience, this unimaginative, blindalley outlook of the Minister responsible for education.  What does he think is the ultimate end of the children who pass through his hands as juvenile delinquents?  Does he lose interest in their future the moment they are shovelled into reformatories, or put into industrial schools?  Does he ever sit down to ask himself when he is dealing with children of 11, 12 13 and 14, what is the effect of the treatment going to be on them when they are 21 or 22 years of age?  Is not that his problem?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on the Deputy continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He gets up here and boasts of the fact that he has never done that, and that it is unfair to ask him to do that.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Who said so?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Derrig: The Deputy said that I got up and boasted that I had no responsibility for the children.  If the Deputy wants that kind of thing he can have it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: I say if the Minister says he has no responsibility for the Borstal and objects to references to it, that suggests that he does not realise how vital an interest of the Minister for Education in the Borstal ought to be, because the whole burden of my complaint is that by the imprudent treatment of juvenile delinquents, many of them end up in the Borstal.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Derrig: It does not suggest any such thing.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: I say that if one goes to the Borstal and asks those in authority to produce the history of the boys there, one will be told that many of them are boys who were shovelled into industrial schools without adequate inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the delinquency for which they were put into these schools, and that if he had a clinic in which children could be segregated on the occasion of a first delinquency, and then properly treated, they would never be in the Borstal.  They are in the Borstal because no premises were provided in which these could be looked after when there was still time to look after them.&rdquo;</P>

The position is that some years ago we had a commission which dealt with this whole matter. <Col N="2213" /> Incidentally, I may mention that Mr. Cussen, to whom the Deputy has referred, was chairman of that commission. The Deputy says that anybody who visited the courts during Mr. Cussen's time must have been impressed with the fact that this clinic was necessary. It is rather strange, if that is so, that in spite of the fact that the matter was adverted to by the commission during the course of their inquiries, Mr. Cussen, who certainly had an excellent experience of the matter, and for that reason was made chairman of the commission, made no recommendation whatever in regard to it.</P>

      <P>Before the Cussen Commission the manager of the Borstal explained that the total number of boys from industrial schools committed to that institution in the five years I have mentioned was 15, an average of three per year.  As regards former reformatory schoolboys, only two were committed to the Borstal in the same period, the offence for which one was committed being, escaping from the reformatory.

      <P>That recommendation was carefully considered, and it was felt that a medical report of the nature suggested would not be of great value. In coming to that decision we had in mind that, at present, every child committed to an industrial school is examined by the school medical officer on admission, and if he reports that for any reason the child is not suitable for industrial school training, and if the report of the local medical officer is confirmed by the Department's medical inspector, the child is immediately released.  Children in industrial schools and reformatories are also examined individually, where it is found necessary, by the Department's medical inspector, and suitable treatment is provided for them.</P>

      <P>As to the case of poor people who have children in these schools, the Deputy brought a case under my notice and the child was examined on three separate occasions. He was examined before he left Glencree Reformatory and then examined at Dangean.  We called the attention of our medical inspector to him, with the result that she went there specially to examine the child.  Although she felt that there was then no evidence of disease, in order to make quite sure she had the child removed for X-ray treatment to the local hospital, and satisfied herself that detention could continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is the same case about which the Deputy wrote me, but I took the necessary steps, and that is the position.  Every thing that we can possibly do within reason to look after these children is done.  In addition to that, so far as poor people generally are concerned, Deputy Dillon suggested in some way that the poor children are being deprived of medical facilities at present. The Deputy must be aware that there is a school medical service, that there are nurses and doctors visiting the schools, that cards are sent to parents where the doctors consider it necessary to call attention to the state of the children's health, that these children are brought back again for reexamination, and frequently, if there is evidence of disease and need for treatment, they are brought to a clinic and looked after by the medical officer of Dublin City.  In addition, there are dispensary and other facilities under local authorities such as the tuberculosis scheme.  I cannot see, from the strictly medical point of view, how parents have not ample facilities at present to interview doctors, even if they are poor.  I cannot see where they are deprived of facilities to get adequate information as to the state of health of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> If we take up the attitude that this is not a medical but psychological question, and that what is needed is an examination of children in clinics, by some expert person with an understanding of children, who will be able to advise the best curative treatment, I do not know that a case for the appointment of such a psychologist was fully made.  Some 90 per cent. of the children sent to industrial schools are committed on the ground of destitution. In these cases it is difficult to say how such conduct, health or character has any bearing on committal.  A child might be defective physically or otherwise, but that does not seem to arise in connection with the committal of a child, on the ground of destitution, to an industrial school, unless it is suggested that all these children should be submitted to psychological examination. I think when it is realised that 90 per cent. of these children are committed on the ground of destitution, and that of the other 10 per cent. half are committed for failure to attend school and other offences, such as theft, it is difficult to see how ordinary sensible people, such as those responsible for the administration of the law with regard to juveniles, are not in a position quite amply to make up their minds with the information at their disposal as to what should be done with these children.</P>
    <P>The district justice consults the probation officers, and through these officers he gets a fairly complete report of the home conditions of juveniles. The probation officer, judging by the reports received, maintains connection with these young delinquents, and, as Deputy Dillon admitted on the last stage of the Bill, it is only when juveniles are again and again brought under notice, that the justice takes the serious step of committing them.  The Children's Court at present is not the same as the former children's court.  Now it simply means that the district justice sits down and has a friendly conversation or, if you will, conference with the parents.  The parents, the probation officer, and the representatives of any other organisation that the justice may think it well to consult, discuss the <Col N="2217" /> best steps to be taken to safeguard the future of the child.  One would imagine that there is nothing whatever to be said for that system.  If that is the position, as I understand it is, in the Children's Courts at present, then the parents, the public, and the House have ample and sufficient safeguards already, because every possible aspect of a case is brought under notice.</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy contend that, when the parents are there, the justice does not discuss the question with the parents and hear their side of the case? I must again emphasise that we are not talking about justices appointed by a foreign Government.  We are talking about justices who are just as much or more interested in the welfare of these children as those who talk a great deal more about them.  The justice may put the child on probation; he may not feel that the offence is sufficiently serious to send the child to a reformatory or an industrial school.  He may not feel, however, that the home conditions are entirely satisfactory and he may decide to place the child under the care of a probation officer.  I think that that recent development is a considerable improvement on the scheme of things so far as the treatment of juvenile delinquents is concerned.</P>
    <P>The probation officer may not be a psychologist, the justice may not be a psychologist; but they are ordinary common-sense people accustomed to dealing with this problem from day to day.  They have the advantage of being able to call on social and religious organisations for further information where necessary.  Some of these religious organisations, as a matter of fact, have taken it on themselves to carry out certain duties and, as is well known, there is a special organisation in Dublin for looking after young people generally.  The justice, therefore, has these varied interests, all of whom are interested in the problem, to consult.  He can also consult the clergy of the parish.  Is it suggested that the district justice is so lacking, or that so little interest is taken in the problem of the child's future by all these people concerned, that a reasonable and fair decision will not be given?  One would imagine <Col N="2218" /> that there was some sinister influence working in the administration to put children into industrial schools without reason.  Anybody who wishes to understand what the real background is should go down to the Children's Court and see what actually happens.</P>

      <P>I have had the advantage of discussing the matter with the justices who are responsible for the courts, both in conversation and through written memoranda.  Deputy Dillon spoke of the very serious responsibility that rests on my shoulders.  He almosts made the welkin ring telling the House the fearful responsibility that rested on my shoulders for taking those children out of the control of the parents.  That has to be done in process of law, as I have explained, and I have really nothing to do with it. What happens frequently is that after the child has been committed some Deputy comes to me and asks that the child should be released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a reasonable case, if the district justice, who is just as anxious as I am to have children released, feels there is a sound case, that the home conditions which may have been unsatisfactory are now satisfactory, or, in the case of an older boy, that employment is available, if we are satisfied that the boy can be released without danger we do it.  If we do not choose to release the boy, it is for very good reasons.  It is because we have reports from the police and the probation officer as to the circumstances. Deputies who come to us with stories of children being wrongfully detained forget that they have only heard one <Col N="2219" /> side of the case as a rule; they have only heard the case from the child's parents.  They have not had the advantage of having had a report on the home conditions; they have not had the advantage of knowing what the career of the child has been up to that time.</P>
    <P>Take cases of petty thefts on the part of children.  Are these due to some psychological weakness?  Are they not due in the main to lack of parental control, lack of discipline in the home?  The vast majority of these cases where children are committed for actual offences under the code, I venture to suggest, arise through some lack in the home conditions and, arising out of that, a manifest lack of parental discipline.  Thefts are committed in order to get money to attend picture-houses or for similar purposes. I submit that no psychological examination is necessary: that any ordinary jury of citizens would reach the conclusion that the proper cure for such children, if the home conditions are definitely unsuitable and the children cannot be sent back home, is to take them away from that environment for a period of time, and we would all like the period to be as short as possible.</P>

      <P>It is really painful to hear the case made here that there is some psychological disease or other in the City of Dublin, just because clinics have been established in Chicago or Detroit, or some other city.  Where is the comparison between conditions in the Catholic City of Dublin and in the City of Chicago?  There is no comparison. I am quite sure that justices will scout the idea that there should be a medical and psychological examination of every child brought before them, but if justices in particular cases feel that they should have some medical report, that they would like to have the benefit of medical advice, I feel certain that that is a matter which the Department of Justice would consider.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, if it is a question of advising the parents, I feel confident that under the present system there can be no lack of good advice for the parents, if they are only prepared to take the advice.  The trouble is that, although they get the advice over and over again from priests, from officers of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, from probation officers, and, in the end, from the district justice, they are not prepared to take the advice.  In all these matters we must have co-operation, and if we cannot get co-operation from the parents of the children we will not get any further.  Therefore, whatever case there may be, I do not think Deputy Dillon has established one for giving the district justice facilities to enable him to get further medical reports on the children who come before him.  I feel that, on the psychological side, no real case has been made, and there is no necessity in Dublin for a clinic of this kind.  I also feel that a comparison with other countries does not bring us anywhere. We would require to have a complete examination of our own conditions, and a case based on a close analysis of these conditions.</P>
      <P>There may be a small number of boys convicted of a certain type of crime, and I do not think it should be beyond our power, if it be thought well in these and other cases, to provide the district justice with a special kind of knowledge.  I know that when boys, even those convicted of vicious offences, are sent to reformatories they are treated with the greatest consideration. The whole effort and object of the boys' reformatory is to approach the rebuilding of a boy's character, and to place his feet upon the proper path from a religious point of view.  That task is being approached in a definitely Christian way.  I think that, from treatment of that kind, more valuable results can be obtained, and are being obtained in all these institutions, than could be obtained from having a psychological clinic.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dillon put up his case for this the last day the Minister kept silent.  I am <Col N="2221" /> expressing my serious opinion when I say that I am sorry the Minister did not adopt the same attitude to-day.  It would be much more in keeping with the seriousness of the subject than the revelation he has just given of his attitude on this matter, and of the way he treats arguments that are seriously put up in this House by Deputies.  If he had kept silent, his own reputation and the reputation of the institutions that he is pretending to defend, would be in a much better position.  I cannot now deal adequately with his gross misrepresentation of the case made by Deputy Dillon both to-day and the last day.  It should have been apparent to the Minister, even if his attention had not been repeatedly called to it by way of interruption, that Deputy Dillon was dealing with one class of case and one only, the case of delinquents.</P>
      <P>Dealing with delinquents, is it not, if not intentional, at least an effective effort to mislead the House to quote figures for all committals to industrial schools; to quote the figure of over 2,000 spread over a number of years, and to suggest that that had anything to do with the case that was made by Deputy Dillon?  I cannot say that it was a deliberate attempt to mislead the House, but, so far as the Minister could do it, it was an effective attempt to mislead the House.  What did we learn afterwards in an entirely different context?  That 90 per cent. of the figures quoted by the Minister had nothing to do with the case; that 90 per cent. of the figures, according to the Minister himself, dealt with committals to industrial schools on the ground of destitution.  Therefore, they had nothing to do with the case of delinquents.</P>

      <P>We have here a clear example of the complete irresponsibility with which this problem has been faced by the Minister.  The case made was in connection with delinquents, and the Minister ignores it. He did so until attention was fixed on <Col N="2222" /> it by way of interruption.  Surely, it must have penetrated the mind of the Minister that Deputy Dillon's whole case was to deal with one particular class&mdash;delinquents.  I would say so far as delinquents are concerned, that there would be no difficulty even about the number of these.  Did the Minister try to say that there are not a number of cases in which it would be a help to the district justice to have medical opinion, and in which he cannot get it?  The Minister, when asked could the district justice get it at present, did not return an answer.  I will give the Minister an opportunity of saying so now.  Has the district justice power, at the present moment, to call for a medical or a mental examination of the child before him?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>And yet the Minister stated to this House that the district justice could.  Is that a serious way to face up to a problem of this kind?  The Minister does not know. Why not give the district justice that power?  If the Minister thinks it advisable that the district justice should have this power, why not give it to him?  The Minister says that the district justice is not a medical man, that he is not a mental expert and not a psychological expert.  Let us for the moment leave aside the psychological expert and confine ourselves to the question of the medical and mental expert. The district justice is not either. There is no reason why he should be, but give him the power to get the opinion of a man of that kind at least in cases in which he is doubtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tries to ride off on the Catholic ticket, but it will not do.  It is a bit too cheap.  It is dragging Catholicism a bit in the mud to bring it in in defence of the attitude which the Minister is now taking up.  It was that portion of the Minister's speech that offended me most.  Does the Minister pretend that because this is a Catholic city, there is no mental trouble among young children?  Is that his contention?  If it is not, his whole case in reference to Catholicism and the city falls to the ground.  There <Col N="2223" /> are a number of children who commit crimes because they have not got proper medical treatment.  I do not suggest, and neither did Deputy Dillon, that every crime of which a young delinquent is guilty is due to the lack of proper medical treatment, but there may be a number of crimes due to that. If so, is it not worth while, even with the present stringency of money, making an effort to save those children? You cannot blame the industrial schools, if you hand over to them to be dealt with by their particular methods children who should be dealt with by medical methods.  That is what you are doing.  There is no use pretending that there has been any attack on industrial schools or on their methods for dealing with normal cases, but how do you expect them to deal with cases that are abnormal, and that cannot possibly yield to the particular treatment which they are so well fitted to give?</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister to say that they are not bound to take anybody, but if they refuse, the Minister is then up against the problem of finding some place of detention for those children. He started off with the excuse that industrial schools are perfectly free to refuse to take certain children, but if they do the Minister himself is faced with the problem of finding a place of detention for them.  Hence his own argument falls to the ground.  Could anybody who listened to the Minister's speech know what his attitude on this question was&mdash;I mean his own personal attitude as Minister for Education? Could anybody say whether he is in favour of medical inspection or not? An unwary person, listening to certain portions of his speech, might think that he was in favour of the principle of the amendment if certain difficulties could be got over.  A great portion of his speech was directed to throwing cold water on the whole business, to suggesting that it was entirely unnecessary and that no case had been made. I put it that an excellent case was made, but even if the case had never been made, from the initial attitude taken up by the Minister, that he had <Col N="2224" /> an open mind on this important matter, he should have made the investigations. It is primarily his responsibility, and he cannot shelve that responsibility by pretending that a private Deputy has not made a case&mdash;and misrepresenting him, because he did make a case.  His own responsibility is a serious one, even if the case had never been made, but apparently all he thinks it is necessary to do is to give a display of bad temper and to make petty debating points in a serious matter like this.  That is simply shocking and he has not faced the problem.</P>
    <P>He has an open mind on the matter. What is the result of that openness of mind, except not to keep anything in it so far as the children are concerned? What is he prepared to do?  That question has been asked, and we have not the slightest indication from the Minister of the line he intends to take, or whether he intends, in the case of the children who may require this medical examination, to take any step to approach a solution.  Imagine bringing forward as an excuse here that these children are not to get the necessary mental examination because it would cost money to the State!  Imagine that excuse being made by the man who finished up with a pean of Christianity and Catholicity!  It is almost incredible that a thing of the kind could happen. At a time when we are shovelling out money by the million, a couple of thousand pounds cannot be saved for this important work.  I do not mind how many children&mdash;whether it be ten, 20 or 30&mdash;have to be dealt with.  Their salvation is much more important, and money could be much more justifiably spent on it than on any of the plans and undertakings upon which it is at present being spent.</P>
    <P>Then we have the old excuse that one Government Department does not know what another Government Department is doing, that they shut themselves up in hermetically-sealed boxes and apparently never consult each other.  It is not the first time we had an example of that in this House, but it is certainly no excuse.  The Minister does not shelve any of his own responsibility by trying to throw it over on to the shoulders of somebody else, especially if he does not <Col N="2225" /> give evidence that he has even consulted the Ministers or the heads of other Departments.  The way in which the Minister approached this matter is really appalling, and I was surprised that he took up the line he did.  I was surprised that he gave a quotation from Deputy Dillon without indicating that there was a <i>lacuna</i> in the quotation. I was still more surprised that, in spite of repeated interruptions, he, unintentionally, I have no doubt, quoted figures that were bound to mislead the House in regard to Deputy Dillon's intentions.  He would not listen when an attempt was made to set him straight.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the case of the Minister, his hurt feelings, and his misrepresentation of Deputy Dillon, there is a much more important point involved, that is the fate of these children and their proper care.  To be fair both to the children and to the industrial schools, it would be well if the Minister and his colleagues tackled this problem a great deal more seriously than he showed any evidence of doing in his speech in answer to the amendment. He said there was an attack on the House of Detention.  There was not. Deputy Dillon pointed out that it was cleanly kept, and that the two people responsible there were doing their work as well as they could.  But why is there not a proper playground there?  On account of the rules of the House, we cannot move an amendment to that effect at this stage, and the Ceann Comhairle has kindly told me that the amendment down in my name, asking that power be given to the Minister to acquire land for that purpose, is out of order, but if we deal with the unsatisfactory condition of a place like Summerhill, we are not criticising the people who manage it.</P>
    <P>We are criticising the facilities at the disposal of the people who manage it, and though I cannot argue the question of providing a satisfactory playground because I am a private Deputy, and cannot move an amendment to that effect, the Minister who is responsible might, in another place, be able to introduce an amendment giving himself power at least to provide a playground for the children there <Col N="2226" /> during their period of detention, until the court makes up its mind as to how these children should be dealt with. That is a reasonable request, and at a time when we are shovelling out money, as I said, it will not break the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the Government went in for economy.  It was the only occasion on which I ever saw any evidence that the present Government were going in for economy in anything except useful things.  Here was a case made by the Minister on the expense involved in the present national crisis. The present national crisis is responsible for many things, but up to the present I have not seen that it has been responsible for any economies so far as the Government are concerned. It is responsible for many economies elsewhere, but not in Government circles, and the only time when that plea is continually thrown in our teeth is when we have a case like this in respect of the proper care of these unfortunate children.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied that youthful delinquency is properly dealt with. Firstly, I think that grown-up people have a completely wrong outlook on young people's so-called delinquencies in many cases.  There may be &ldquo;tough eggs&rdquo;, as Deputy Dillon mentioned.  I never had the problem of tackling a &ldquo;real tough egg&rdquo;, so I do not know how to deal with such a case, but still there are &ldquo;tough eggs&rdquo;.  There are children who are vicious, and how to deal with them is a very complicated matter, but when I hear grown-up people speak, I often wonder how they ever grew up, because they apparently were never children.  They call crimes in children what are really instances of impishness in many ways.  I have heard serious grown-up people saying what a terrible future is before these young children guilty of these so-called crimes, and one would think that the whole future of these children was at stake.  If we look back to our own childhood, how many members of this House might not have run the risk of being sent into an industrial school for something they did in their childhood?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2227" /> The whole thing is treated wrongly, and instead of additional children being sent into these institutions, I think fewer children should be sent in, and that another kind of care should be given them, and especially should care be taken, if they are mentally unfit children, that they will get the proper kind of treatment.  The unfortunate industrial schools should not be saddled with the impossible task of giving mental treatment which they do not profess to be competent to give.  The Minister goes off into all sorts of by-ways and, after listening to his speech, which was meant to be largely abusive and partially informative, we do not know whether or not he is going to take any steps to deal with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Mr. Dillon made an earnest appeal that people should not get sentimental on this question of the treatment of children.  I think that he had in mind that I might have gone a little bit too far on the last occasion when I spoke of the treatment of children.  The children I had in mind were those who were taken from their parents because they had not been attending school. I have found that the school-attendance officers have discovered a remedy in some of these cases.  Barefooted children were being brought to the courts for not attending school.  It is true that they had remained away from school for a long time.  An ordinary school-attendance officer with very small wages went to a shop and purchased a pair of boots and stockings for one of these children.  That was the remedy.  The mother sent the child to school as soon as the boots and stockings were forthcoming.  Without the boots and stockings, the mother would not risk sending the child to school.  If that had continued the child would, eventually, have found itself in an industrial school.  It would have been thought by the district justice&mdash;properly, I suppose&mdash;that the mother could not provide boots and stockings for the child and that there were places for the reception of such children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2228" /> A large number of children could be saved from the industrial schools if the suggestion of Deputy Dillon were put into operation.  I have mentioned the words &ldquo;industrial schools&rdquo; and I should like to avail of this opportunity to join in the protest of other Deputies against the deliberate misinterpretation by the Minister of Deputy Dillon's statements regarding these schools.  Neither Deputy Dillon nor I, nor, indeed, anybody else, said an unkind word about the treatment of children by these schools.  We did say that some children would be better at home with their parents.  I have seen, in various parts of America, and in Glasgow, these clinics at work.  Those in charge of them told me that, after a month's voluntary attendance&mdash;the parent bringing the child and leaving it there for a few hours each day and the child being watched closely by mental experts, physicians and teachers&mdash;the child was sent home and was never heard of afterwards either in court or in the clinic.  I join in Deputy Dillon's appeal to the Minister. The Minister said that the Bill was framed, 20 years ago, by another Government.  It was thought a proper Bill at the time.  Now is the time to amend it.  I do not think that a penny would be involved in carrying out the suggestion made.  The district justice, the school-attendance officer or the plain-clothes Guard could get the child examined.  The Reverend Mother in charge of one of these institutions could be asked to take the child for a month and report as to how it was going on, instead of bringing it before a district justice and having it sent to an industrial school for five years.</P>
    <P>In many cases the hearts of parents are being broken.  Dublin T.D.'s are aware of the number of parents who come to them.  As the Minister said, we probably get only one side of the story but, if we had a clinic, we could ask for the other side of the story. The Minister said that children are medically examined but they are not medically examined until after they are sentenced.  It is when they go to the industrial school that they are examined by the medical officer to the school.  The child has then no chance of getting back to his parents.  I feel <Col N="2229" /> nervous about addressing the House on this question when I think of some of the cases which have been brought to my notice.  I may mention one case of which I heard.  A certain lady who was in public life and who has since passed away took an interest in the welfare of children.  She went to the courts and had an interview with some of the authorities there.  I cannot mention the name but the reply made to that lady was &ldquo;You know these schools have to be maintained.&rdquo;  Is that a proper spirit&mdash;that you should snatch children from their parents so that a school, which has a couple of hundred &ldquo;empties,&rdquo; should be maintained? These institutions should be maintained at the expense of the State.  They should get their proper grants for making available accommodation for suitable children but it is not right to take a doubtful case from the charge of the parent and put it in one of these institutions because the institution has to be maintained.</P>

      <P>I could get sentimental about these cases because, during my residence in Dawson Street, parents from Dublin and outside came to me and asked me to state their case to the Minister so that their children would be sent home to them.  I advise the Minister to get his officials to write to Glasgow and get the opinions of the authorities in charge of the clinic there.  The Minister referred to Catholicity and used it as a sort of cover but, in Glasgow, I found a body of nuns&mdash;a Catholic organisation&mdash;in charge of the children and I was told that 50 per cent. of the children are sent home after a few days.  The mother brings the child to an ordinary private house in a park where there is a room full of a certain type of toys.  In another room, there are educational exhibits and in another room there are mechanical toys for boys.  Experts go round and <Col N="2230" /> visit the children.  I was told by volunteer workers in connection with the clinic that 50 per cent. of the children were saved from the courts.</P>
      <P>I shall not go any further because I do not want to spoil the effect of the case made by Deputy Dillon.  He made an exceptionally good case.  I have heard on many occasions Ministers, in their replies, blundering and misrepresenting Deputies, but I never before heard a Minister trying to cover up a bad case by deliberately misrepresenting Deputies and, thus, endeavouring to carry the House with him.  The suggestion of Deputy Dillon is a most worthy one.  Even if the present Minister for Education or Minister for Justice or Minister for Local Government and Public Health do not adopt it, I congratulate Deputy Dillon on the matter because some future Minister for Education will see the advisability, for the sake of the children, of bringing forward such a scheme and giving us the clinic.</P>

      <P>I feel very much like Deputy Byrne in this matter.  I have almost lost sight of the point at issue on account of the matters that have been introduced by the Minister in his attempt to reply. The Minister proceeded, in the course of that reply, to give the advice to people that before they talk in this matter they should go to the court.  I asked him if he had been there and he said no, but he had got reports.  I wanted to hear from whom and then he told me from the justices. No doubt they give him reports to the best of their ability, but I think it should have been quite clear to any man sitting in an impartial judicial position in this matter that he might have inquired further to find out was there another side to the case than that which, say, a district justice might get put before him.  I want to say, in the forefront of what I am going on to say, that as far as I know anything about the matter, the whole question of delinquent children and destitute children is receiving far better treatment. The matter is being much better treated than it used to be.  That is not to say that there is no room for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2231" /> Deputy Byrne has referred to individual cases.  Through Deputy Byrne I got in touch with certain of these cases, and the one thing that appalled me was a comment made by the district justice in the case, that if these or other boys were not sent to industrial schools the schools might have to close.  The Minister has told us about the help a district justice gets&mdash;probation officers' reports, the parents, and then I think he talked about help from clergymen and others.  In the case I am speaking of the only thing that was not before the court was the report of the probation officer.  The district justice said that he had such a report in front of him, but what was in that report was not revealed.</P>
    <P>There was no question of having any criticism of what was in the report, nor was there a question put to the parents, when they gave evidence, which would indicate that the probation officer reported something different. There was no possibility, in other words, of meeting a case against the parents if the probation officer put that up.  The report was kept secret.  In the cases I am referring to the parents came into court in every single case, and there could be no denying the evidence given by these people that the homes were good homes, that the parents had sufficient means to keep good homes, and did in fact keep good homes, and there was not a suggestion of controversy as to the statements made that it was the first offence of which the parents had found these particular children guilty.  There were letters from Christian Brothers, the superiors of schools and from nuns.  Some of these children were sufficiently infantile to be still at infant schools under nuns. There were records produced from every one of these places to say the children, as far as they knew them at school, were of excellent behaviour. There was the help given, and the comment that was made by the district justice in these cases&mdash;and the only comment behind which I could find there was any real determination&mdash;was, that if sufficient children were not sent to these schools the schools might have <Col N="2232" /> to close.  That, I must say, was an appalling situation, an appalling business, but there is this to be said in mitigation of whatever the justice would say under these circumstances&mdash; I only heard it said once&mdash;that the people who are dealing with these cases are getting a whole lot of the bad type of people coming before them, and they may occasionally err and may tar good people with the bad brush.  The Minister has no such excuse.  The Minister adopts that phrase.  He adopted it here in the House on the last occasion&mdash;I listened to him speaking on this matter &mdash;he put forward as a defence that, if a sufficient stream of children is not going to them, the schools might have to close.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is going to call me in question in that general way&mdash;he attempts to slander me by saying my quotations are not <Col N="2233" /> reliable&mdash;I would ask him to indicate any case where I was found out in giving a wrong quotation.  I adhere to the suggestion that the Minister adopted the same viewpoint as, to my horror, I heard adopted by one person in a court.  The Minister, who is the controller of the whole institution here, stands by that.  I did get one further shock on the particular occasion I had to visit these courts.  In this case it appeared quite clear at the end that, although the district justice was going to find in a certain way and sentence these children, that was not going to stand on appeal, and the question was raised as to what was going to happen to these boys while the arrangements were being made and bail bonds being entered into.  The attitude adopted on that occasion in the court was that these boys would go forthwith to the institution and that they would stay in the institution even though it was only a matter of two or three hours until they were released and the bail bonds were effected.  In fact, these children were torn, squalling, from their parents' arms, packed into a taxi which was hurriedly summoned, and rushed up to an industrial school. They were taken up about 4 o'clock that evening.  Of course, on appeal, the matter was readjusted and they never went to the school, but they were kept there for just as long as could be managed.  After that one experience, which the Minister has not had, much as I admire the work done in these courts in these matters, I am not entirely disposed just to take everything from one angle.  As I say, whatever view I might have had in this matter, in connection with the courts, I see there are all sorts of excuses there.  There may be verdicts that are not in accord and all sorts of reasons to excuse them, but I do not see what excuse there is for the Minister, removed from all these things, not having his mind swayed in these things at all, adopting here the view that the first thing you have to consider is the keeping alive of these institutions.  If the same thing were applied to the prisons we would have everything in the nature of reform of criminals done away with simply because you might <Col N="2234" /> leave yourself in the situation that you would have a lot of jails built and a lot of warders and no prisoners going to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this specific matter of the amendment, as I say, the amendment has been entirely submerged for me in what I have heard.  I would like to say again to the Minister that I have often heard the word &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; used with regard to an argument, and I have heard it used in an extravagant and misplaced way, but does the Minister now, looking back on what he has said, feel there is any other adjective to be attached to him in this matter than &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo;?  If Dickens were alive to-day he would welcome the Minister as a person about whom he might write something. There would be reason for writing a full length novel of a psychological type about the Minister personally in his attitude to this problem.  What is the simple matter that is asked for here&mdash; that there should be in connection with delinquents, not the destitute, something in the nature of a medical examination, and that there should be observation of the medical psychological type.  I do not understand the Minister's arguments on this matter. On this amendment, put down on the Report Stage, he said he has not had time to consider the inter-actions that are necessary as between three Government Departments.  It came out later in his speech that the commission which had sat in connection with this matter years ago reported in favour of medical examination.  As far as I remember the context of their report&mdash; I have not got it with me at the moment&mdash;it was mainly in connection with contagious diseases, but they did nevertheless report in favour of medical examination.  I should have thought it was the duty of any Minister bringing legislation into this House, when he pretended to found it on the report of the commission, that he should at least have considered this: What are the recommendations of the commission which I am not accepting, and what are the reasons for their nonacceptance? If he was going to consider medical examination of children <Col N="2235" /> suffering from contagious diseases, he could have discovered what was the difficulty about the inter-actions that would have to take place between three departments before he could get that attended to.  I do not regard his arguments on the grounds of expense as worthy of a moment's consideration. There has been no thought given to the pouring out of money for lunatic schemes, and, with the record which that Government has behind it, the argument of any Minister who comes to this House to say that he objects to anything on the grounds of the expenditure which might be involved would simply not go down here.</P>
    <P>What is the other difficulty?  The Minister said that if a district justice, in a particular case, feels that there ought to be a medical examination he can get it.  I do not think he can.  We have asked the Minister about that, and he has advanced to the mid-way point that he does not know.  I think before the debate concludes he will have advanced to the further point of saying he knows he cannot get it.  I have grave doubts whether the district justice can call for and exact a medical examination.</P>
    <P>If that is the situation, another argument of the Minister has not merely proved to be without foundation but must have been put forward by the Minister without having any background of knowledge on the point at all.  There is still another matter to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred. The Minister said that we are not going to govern the children or the examination of the children in this country by comparison with a place like Chicago, the reason being that this is a Catholic city and Chicago is not.  The Minister's point of view apparently is that, in a city which is not blessed with the religion we have here, you may require psychological examination of the children to see where they have gone astray, but if children go astray in a Catholic community the one thing you need not examine is their mentality.  How the logic of that argument runs I cannot understand.</P>

This matter was discussed by the commission, and they reported in favour of it.  All I say is that if, when the child comes before the district justice, there is a medical report which says that the fault is not due to any inherent vice in the child, but is due to something which attention can relieve, I think it would be the bounden duty of the district justice not to send the child to the school, but to get whatever was the medical recommendation followed in order to get the particular fault eradicated from the child.</P>

      <P>In any event, the Minister's alternative is not to have any examination at all for fear something might be revealed that would require attention instead of simply packing the child off to an institution. I think the Minister is getting deeper into the mire according as his scanty store of information is being added to. It becomes quite clear that the Minister has not considered the commission's report, the evidence given before the commission or any argument for or against the proposal.  The only thing he falls back upon is the view that if you do not keep the courts grinding out people for those institutions the institutions may close down, and, to the bureaucratic mind, that is the last emergency.  As I say, I feel that the amendment is one which might be pressed, but it is really hopeless to pretend to deal with any measure of this sort as long as we have the mentality which the Minister has revealed in the course of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; 5th February, 1941. Here is what the Minister for Education said:</P>
      <P>If the Deputy feels that more ought to be done for destitute children in another way I think he ought to raise the matter in a different fashion.  At present he wants to benefit these children, assuming that his own theories are the right ones, at the expense of the industrial schools and possibly at the expense of closing down all the industrial schools altogether. Of course, I could not stand for that....</P>

      <P>Of course, I could not stand for that, and I am satisfied that the schools are carrying on an essential work and carrying it on satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Does that cover the ground?  We have the astonishing thesis that the schools are to be kept for the purpose of looking after destitute children and there is no consideration whether the arrangements made in respect of destitute children are the most suitable. However, let the Minister's word stand and let the public judge.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something in support of this amendment, particularly as the Minister said that Deputy Dillon seemed to be alone in the House and there was no other Deputy of the same opinion, with possibly, the exception of Deputy Byrne. Deputy Dillon has made a very good <Col N="2240" /> case.  In fact, a good many of us refrained from speaking after Deputy Dillon because we felt we would only be repeating his arguments.  I am a country Deputy and this amendment applies principally to the city of Dublin. Deputy Dillon merely asks that an experiment be made in Dublin, but I should like to have experiments carried out through the provinces and let them be applied not alone to delinquent children, but eventually to the numerous destitute children who are committed.  I do not want to enter into any arguments with the Minister on psychology.  I do not think I am fitted any better than the Minister to go into psychological discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When he was making a case against the amendment, the Minister, when he compared Chicago and Dublin, took up the attitude of the Pharisee&mdash;&ldquo;We are not like other people, thank God; we are giving the children Christian treatment.&rdquo;  He ended up his argument by suggesting that Deputy Dillon was insinuating that the children in Dublin&mdash;where they get good, Christian care, as everybody knows&mdash;were not getting proper treatment in the religious institutions. There was no such insinuation made.  The Minister, in his rather heated defence, put it this way, that we in this country have put these children in institutions where they are taught religion and he said that was better than any psychological treatment we could give them.  These may not have been his exact words, but they are as near as common English can go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to say anything against religious treatment.  Everybody knows that as far as religion is concerned the children are well cared for, but religious treatment is not the only treatment that should be applied to children who, because of destitution or delinquency, are committed to industrial or other schools.  One could argue that there are psychological reasons why certain children are delinquents, <Col N="2241" /> and various reasons can be put forward why certain children are destitute, such as lack of care&mdash;that parents were not capable of caring properly for their children.  For one reason or another the State assumes care of children, either because the parents are unable or unfitted to take care of them or because of some delinquency. In these circumstances the State assumes the function of guardian of the children, and proper provision is made for their up-keep.</P>
    <P>So far as proper provision is concerned, I suggest that it should not be confined to what the natural guardians would have applied to the children. Most of the parents are in poor circumstances, and I suggest more is required than what the natural guardians would have provided.  The State ought to make every provision for the children placed in its care, and they should see to it that the children get every opportunity to become respectable citizens. If there are any defects in a child's surroundings that would make the road to such a desired result difficult, they ought to be wiped away.  If, in other countries, they have found that observation schools have produced good results and that a psychological as well as a physical examination has produced evidence that certain treatment for different children is desirable, then we ought to follow their example.</P>
    <P>I am more interested in the care of destitute children than in delinquency, because destitute children come more within my sphere than delinquents. <Col N="2242" /> Anybody who has had experience of children knows that every child has a different disposition.  I believe that committed children require greater medical and other care than ordinary children.  If one is permitted to expand the theory to the training of animals, any man or woman who has had experience of animal training&mdash;I have had some experience of that&mdash;will know that even amongst animals you cannot approach any two of them in the same way.  One is gentle and the other is vicious and the treatment you apply to one cannot successfully be applied to the other.  That applies to a greater extent in the case of human beings.  There are no two children in ordinary schools who are similar in disposition. In the case of the delinquent, the difference is multipled a thousand-fold. For natural or physical reasons the children are incapable, in some cases, of imbibing the teaching given to an ordinary child.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister to tell us that the State has provided that the children will be sent to religious institutions and that their souls will be taken care of.  We want their bodies, their physical beings, to be taken care of, so that they will grow up not alone good Christian, religious citizens, but good citizens in other respects, good in intellect and physique, and that it can be said that the State has done everything possible for their development.  I am sorry that the amendment has not a wider scope.</P>

    <P>Question declared lost.</P>
    <P>The following amendment appeared on the order paper in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before Section 8, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice shall have power to acquire compulsorily or by agreement such land not exceeding in any case one half of a statute acre as may be required for the purpose of providing playgrounds or other amenities for any place of detention provided by him under Section 108 of the Principal Act, as a remand home for the care and detention of children and youthful offenders pending the making of an order for committal to an approved school or other determination by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to empower the Minister for Justice to acquire lands for the provision of playgrounds for certain places of detention.  As the exercise by the Minister of this power would involve the expenditure of public moneys, the amendment creates a potential charge on the Exchequer and may not be moved by a private Deputy.  On other grounds, the amendment introduces a new principle, not dealt with in the Bill nor raised on Committee Stage.  It would not, therefore, be a proper amendment on this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that we have just discussed at some length an amendment that might seem to involve public expenditure as much as this?  They are both empowering amendments.  Secondly, may I point out that there is a clause in the Bill dealing with the particular schools and playgrounds?  I think that would be found in Section 7.  I wish to direct the Minister's attention to that, and think an opportunity should be given to do so.  If I am ruled out of order, <Col N="2245" /> I will willingly accept your ruling, though I would like some clarification of the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know, firstly, whether the last amendment is out of order, and, secondly, whether there is not a reference to playgrounds and buildings in the Bill already.  Realising that there might be a difficulty of this kind, I was anxious to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  It has been pointed out here to-day that Summerhill, for instance, is an excellent institution, well run, and kept very clean, but that it has no adequate playground whatsoever.  Half an acre will not impoverish the State, whatever anything else may do.  It is a pity there should not be given to the Minister an opportunity of this kind.  Elsewhere perhaps, when it comes to another House, he will have an opportunity to deal with this problem, since I cannot deal with it here, and he may be able to move an amendment then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 47, to insert before section 9 (a) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) by the deletion of the word &ldquo;fourteen&rdquo; and the substitution in lieu thereof of the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is introduced in deference to the views expressed by Deputies in the course of Dáil debates and having regard to the recommendation made in paragraph 44 of the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Schools, where it is recommended that the maximum age for committal to industrial schools should be raised from 14 to 15 years.  This was not proposed in the Bill, as it was understood that the managers would, as a rule, be opposed to it on the ground that they could not effect much improvement in one year and that, for physiological reasons, particularly in the case of girls, this restriction would be undesirable. <Col N="2246" /> It is felt now, however, that, having regard to the matter which was raised on the last Stage of the Bill&mdash;that the number of such cases would be small and that the managers have the right of refusal under the existing Act&mdash;there seems to be no reason why we should not introduce this amendment.</P>
    <P>I think that I departed from the correct description of the provisions of the Bill on the last stage, when I referred to 16 years where I should have said 14.  Fourteen is the maximum age for committal.  Of course, the children can be kept until they reach 16.  The idea of this amendment is to increase from 14 to 16 the age at which children may be committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points were raised on that whole section on the last day and some of them were considered to be of supreme importance, involving important principles. The Minister undertook to consider in the interval between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage how far he could meet our views and, though I had very recently to express profound dissatisfaction with the Minister's attitude on another matter, I can say that on this one he has met the principal points in the series of amendments which he has put down now.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the permission of the House to withdraw amendment No. 4 as on the Order Paper and to propose instead the following amendment as circulated to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 48, Section 9, to add at the end of paragraph (e) the words &ldquo;and by the deletion in the said paragraph of the words &lsquo;no parent or guardian, or&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Children Act, 1908&mdash;Section 58&mdash; says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Any person may bring before a petty sessional court any person apparently under the age of 14 years who&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  is found wandering and not having any home or settled place <Col N="2247" /> of abode, or visible means of subsistence, or is found wandering and having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship;</P>
    <P>We decided to recommend to the Dáil that the words &ldquo;wandering and&rdquo; be deleted, and that amendment was carried; and, as the Act would now stand it would be:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  is found not having any home or settled place of abode, or visible means of subsistence, or is found having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan pointed out that &ldquo;having no parent or guardian&rdquo; did not seem to make sense.  In any case, it is provided for otherwise by a special section in the original Act, which provides for orphans.  The Deputy pointed out that, whereas taking out the words &ldquo;wandering and&rdquo; in the first case might be all right, taking them out in the second case would leave a rather indefinite phrase.  It would read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>or is found having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship;</P>
    <P>In any case, in order to meet the Deputy's point, we are now proposing to take out the words &ldquo;no parent or guardian, or&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not having the Act before me, I cannot say that I am quite clear on this, but I take it that the Minister's contention is that this is to make what is in the Bill more sensible?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 49 to 52, to delete Section 9 (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that imprisonment or penal <Col N="2248" /> servitude of a parent should not, of itself, constitute a ground for committal, as there might be cases where one parent might be in prison and the other might be attending satisfactorily to the welfare of the children, and where there was no danger of destitution. Section 58 (1) (c) of the Principal Act is allowed to stand.  That clause reads: where a child&mdash;</P>
    <P>is found destitute, not being an orphan and having both parents or his surviving parent, or in the case of an illegitimate child his mother undergoing penal servitude or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>We are leaving that, providing for committal where a child is found destitute and having both parents or his surviving parent, or the mother in the case of an illegitimate child, undergoing penal servitude or imprisonment, but we are introducing an amendment in Section 9 (e).  That would be amendment No. 8, which is in two parts.  We are amending it, as compared with the amendments with which we have dealt before, so as to put it in the same category as the cases covered by the 1929 Act.  That provides for cases of destitution where parental consent is required before an order for committal can be made, and what we are providing under this other amendment is that where one of the parents is undergoing imprisonment or penal servitude the consent of that parent may be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>(c) by the insertion in paragraph (d), before the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; of the word &ldquo;reputed,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to meet the point raised on the last stage.  We are accepting the suggestion of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo; has a particular meaning in the courts, and that it would be an advantage to add it in this case.  Otherwise, <Col N="2249" /> we are leaving the Bill as it stood.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, section 9 (e), to delete lines 24 to 32 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the Court is satisfied that owing to mental incapacity or desertion on the part of the child's parents or his surviving parent or, in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, the consent of such parents or parent may be dispensed with, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  one of the child's parents consents to such order being made and the Court is satisfied that, owing to mental incapacity or desertion on the part of the other parent or to the fact that the other parent is undergoing imprisonment or penal servitude, the consent of that parent may be dispensed with.</P>
      <P>On the last stage I withdrew an amendment to consider whether the word &ldquo;mental&rdquo; should not be put in before &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; and it is now being put in as suggested.  The effect of the amendment, if accepted by the Dáil, would be that we would have three different methods of dealing with consent. First, there is the plain case where the child is destitute and both persons agree.  There is no difficulty there and it is provided for under the law already.  The second case will be covered by paragraph (ii), where &ldquo;the court is satisfied that owing to mental incapacity or desertion on the part of a child's parent or his surviving parent or, in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, the consent of such parents or parent may be dispensed with.&rdquo;  If there is mental incapacity or desertion, the consent of the parents or the surviving parent may be dispensed with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2251" /> The third case is where &ldquo;(iii) one of the child's parents consents to such order being made and the court is satisfied that, owing to mental incapacity or desertion on the part of the other parent, or to the fact that the other parent is undergoing imprisonment or penal servitude, the consent of that parent may be dispensed with&rdquo;. It is not likely, if one parent is only in prison for a short period, that the other parent will agree to have the child committed, and I think we can take it, therefore, that it is only for very good reasons, and where the second parent is going to be in prison for a considerable time, that the parent at liberty is going to agree.</P>

      <P>I move: That this Bill be now read a Second Time. This Bill is a simple measure, the main purpose of which is to place members of the Defence Forces in the position of being assured that the unemployment benefit rights they had acquired before they joined the Forces will be preserved for them during their service in the Forces, and that irrespective of the duration of their service they will have these rights available in full on the termination of it.  It is also proposed in the Bill to ensure that Irish seamen who are employed on ships the registration of which has been changed from Irish ports to ports in another country since the outbreak of war, will have these contributions to their credit in the Unemployment Fund still available to them for unemployment benefit purposes, even though further contributions have ceased to be payable for them.  The Bill will cover all members of the Forces, and all members of the Reserve called out on permanent service, with the exception only of those commissioned officers who, having adopted the Army as their career, will retire on pension at the end of it.  The Bill will cover all those who have joined the Army, irrespective of whether they joined before or will join after the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £156,487 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Gárda Síochána including the Taca Síochána (No. 7 of 1925, No. 10 of 1926, No. 5 of 1937 and No. 28 of 1939); and for certain Expenses of the Local Security Force including Grants-in-Aid (No. 28 of 1939).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote is mainly necessary for the provision of expenditure for the Local Security Force.  The extra amount required for the Gárda Síochána under sub-head B&mdash;Allowances&mdash;amounting to £4,000 is mainly due to extra rent allowances.  A change in the rent allowances was provided last year and the amount was under-estimated.  It was thought that the rent allowance would be between £30 and £40 a year. The maximum in Dublin was £40 a year, and in most cases £40 had to be allowed.  Some 78 per cent. of the serving rank and file are married. There is an item of £1,000 for plainclothes allowance, as more men have been employed during the emergency for protection duty of that kind. Under sub-head D&mdash;Locomotion Expenses&mdash;£2,700 is required.  That was due to extra police activity.  Car-hire involved £1,700 and £1,000 was for locomotion allowance to officers who used their own cars.  Sub-head H&mdash; Transport and Carriage&mdash;£8,000.  That is a big item and is due to increased expenditure in the maintenance and running expenses of Gárda transport, as well as the extra cost of petrol and oil.  In Dublin the cost of petrol in bulk rose from 1/3½ to 1/8¼ per gallon, and in barrels from 1/7 to 1/11½, while spare parts increased by 10 per cent. A large proportion of the expense was incurred by Gárda officers doing Local Security work and in going to different parts of the country, organising it. Then there was an increase of cars for <Col N="2255" /> protection purposes.  These are the items that make up the amount in that sub-head.</P>
    <P>The next is sub-head I&mdash;Fuel, Light and Water&mdash;£5,100.  Six months' supply of fuel was provided in advance&mdash;two months of that will run into the next financial year&mdash;for barracks throughout the country in case of a fuel shortage.  That is the biggest item under this heading.  As to sub-head K, Escort and Conveyance of Children to Industrial Schools and Places of Detention, £215, of course the expenditure depends on the number of committals which cannot be forecasted accurately, and it amounted to £406 for the year 1939-40.  That item was not estimated correctly.  As regards sub-head L&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones, £8,000&mdash;65 Gárda barracks outside Dublin which were not connected with the telephone system have now been connected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>With great benefit to their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It took the emergency situation to get that done, as we have been trying for some years to have it done.  The extra cost is due to the annual rentals and cost of 'phone calls from these stations and an increase in the number of calls generally owing to the emergency conditions and arrangements by which members of the Local Security Force can 'phone police barracks about their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item is Subhead N&mdash;incidental expenses, £10,690.  Of that, £7,960 was for wireless apparatus for communicating with headquarters. Patrol cars in a very large area outside Dublin keep in touch with headquarters by wireless.  Unfortunately we had to pay more for that equipment than we thought.  There was a delay in getting it, and when we did get it the price had gone up.  A sum of £6,482 was voted by Supplementary Estimate last year for this purpose. We could not get the equipment then and, when we did get it it cost the extra money.  Also included in the £10,690 is a sum of £2,730 for safes for Gárda superintendents' <Col N="2256" /> offices in the country for the purpose of keeping confidential papers.  These safes were only supplied in the Dublin offices previously and for a long time we have been trying to get safes provided for the other barracks, so that confidential documents might be securely locked up.  These are all the items that concern the Gárda as a whole.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the Local Security Force.  Under this heading provision is made for expenditure incurred by the Local Security Force, Groups A and B, up to 31st December and also what was formerly called the B Group to 31st March.  A sum of £136,182 is included to cover the expenses of the Local Security Force up to and including 31st March, 1941.  This amount includes £93,990 for general expenses and £42,192 for grants-in-aid of the funds of the Force.  That £42,192 is on a basis of £1 per head capitation grant which has been granted.  Already £10,358 had been made available as a grant-in-aid for boots.  That has been deducted from the total.  As £10,358 has already been paid out, a sum of £42,192 remains to be paid. Under Subhead NN 1, £93,990 is for expenditure on uniforms and equipment, badges, armlets, etc. for A and B Groups up to 31st December, 1940, for expenses in connection with cleaning, heating, lighting and renting of accommodation for training purposes, postage, stationery, and other incidental expenses for Group A up to and including 31st December, 1940 and for the Local Security Force for the current financial year.  There will not now be any such thing as A and B Groups.  The portion that remains with the Gárda will be called the Local Security Force and the other will be called the Local Defence Force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the sum under sub-head NN (1) for expenditure in <Col N="2257" /> connection with the Force that is now under the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The £93,990 is for that Force as well, because these things were provided while they were under the Department of Justice&mdash;uniforms, badges, armlets, etc.  That item may recur when the uniforms are worn out, but it will come under the Vote for the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be your responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As to sub-head NN (2)&mdash;Local Security Force: Capitation Grants (Grants-in-Aid), £42,192, as I explained, that is the balance after having paid £10,358.  Then we come to sub-head O&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid, £2,600.  That is a payment from the Road Fund, which was £2,600 more than we anticipated.  Two per cent. of the sum paid into the Exchequer from the Road Fund in the year ending 31st March, 1940, is paid over to the Gárda Síochána Vote for expenses of the Gárda Síochána in the execution of the Roads Act, 1920, and Road Traffic Act, 1933, and we got £2,600 more than we expected.  There was a saving in other sub-heads of £15,800, made up of £10,000, due to the Force being below the strength provided for in the Estimates. Then there was a variable sub-head of £300, and another item of £5,500, as the main issues of unmade clothing are being held over until April, 1941.  These are the items that make up the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned one amazing sum, and that is £2,730 for safes for the custody of official documents.  How many chief superintendents and superintendents are there altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 124.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you must have paid £25 each for the safes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very substantial ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that that is an extraordinarily high price to pay for safes for the <Col N="2258" /> custody of official documents in the offices of Garda Superintendents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were to try to buy a safe now he would know what one would cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if I tried to buy one it would not cost me the sum set down here.  I suggest that if the Minister had looked around, or if the officials in his Department had done so, they would have been able to get quite good safes for about £10 each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The safes were purchased for us by the Board of Works, which is very experienced in making purchases of this kind.  I do not want to pass &ldquo;the buck&rdquo; to any other Department, but the point is that we do not make purchases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if some firm wanted a number of safes, and got somebody to look around for them, it would be able to get them at a lower price than that mentioned by the Minister. The Minister must admit that the price paid for these 124 safes was an extraordinarily high one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>How many were purchased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>124.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price works out at about £25 each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known that there are purchasing departments in the State.  They have great experience in these matters.  I do not think it would be advisable that we should go out and purchase them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of a recent experience I had myself, I do not think you would have got them more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point I would like the Minister to clear up.  It concerns the Local Security Force.  It is not easy to differentiate between the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; groups. Under sub-head NN (1), there is provision for clothing and equipment&mdash;the issue of uniforms and armlets to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; group.  Under sub-head NN (2) provision is made for the expenditure <Col N="2259" /> of £42,192.  The Minister mentioned the figure of £1 per head.  Is that included in this £42,192?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where it comes from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister then mentioned the sum of £10,000 for the provision of boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>For the &ldquo;B&rdquo; group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what money is coming out of this £42,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This sum of £42,192 is to cover Grants-in-Aid of the funds of the Local Security Force from the 1st January, 1941, on the following basis: (a) payment of an initial Grant-in-Aid of £1 in respect of each person who is certified to have been an enrolled member of the former Group &ldquo;B&rdquo; of the Local Security Force on the 31st December, 1940, and who had not on or before the 31st January, 1941, tendered his resignation.  The strength of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; group, Local Security Force, on the 31st December, 1940, was 52,550, and the Grant-in-Aid of £42,191 represents the payment of £1 per head in respect of these 52,550 men less a deduction of £10,358, the amount already advanced to purchase the 13,811 pairs of boots for the &ldquo;B&rdquo; group.  This is the point that I want to bring out: that the Grants-in-Aid are intended to assist in the payment of the following items of expenditure, and they will be supplemented by any funds that may be raised locally by members of the Force.  There is: (1) grants for the purchase of or repairs of boots for members in necessitous circumstances; there are a great many such; (2) rent of halls or other necessary accommodation and cost of fuel, light and cleaning; (3) cost of transport where the use of transport is duly authorised; (4) postage, stationery, telegrams and telephones (except where telephone facilities are made available by the Gárda Síochána or by the Army) for official purposes; (5) such other purposes as may be authorised by the Minister for Justice.  The <Col N="2260" /> Minister for Justice will have a discretion as to whether he thinks there is a necessity for authorising expenditure in regard to particular items.  I think that covers all the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has made all this clear in his statement.  An extraordinary impression was apparently created in the minds of some people through the country.  Listening to them one would think that the Minister was introducing this Supplementary Estimate to meet an entirely different set of circumstances. How the idea got about I do not know, but somebody told somebody else that every man who was a member of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; group on the 30th January, 1940, was to get £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what was said in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That view is not general throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that quite a number of people held that view.  Some one did a very wrong thing in telling members of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; group in various districts that surprise meetings were to be called for a certain night at the end of January: that they were to be visited by an officer of the Gárda Síochána in the locality, and that everyone who attended the meeting would get £1.  What, I think, happened was, some people went round and said to others that, while they had been very regular in their attendances at meetings in the last six months, they were unlucky to miss the meeting on the previous Friday night, because those who attended were to get £1.  I am glad that the Minister has cleared up this matter with regard to Capitation Grants (Grants-in-Aid) for the Local Security Force.  The note to the sub-head states that the provision is required for Capitation Grants to district funds of the Local Security Force, and that these funds will be administered in accordance with directions given by the Minister.  This money then is going to be utilised for defence purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2261" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is merely a grant-in-aid to whatever funds a district may collect itself, and is on the basis of £1 for each man enrolled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say that it is fixed according to the number of men in the Force, and is not going to be handed out to individuals.  In conclusion, all I have to say is that the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate reflects what a big change has taken place in this country. Imagine how nice and mild all the Opposition Parties here to-day are.  But can anyone imagine what the present Minister for Justice would have to say if some Minister came along ten years ago and introduced a Supplementary Estimate for the Gárda Síochána for £156,000.  What is wrong with the world at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big war on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that wars, calamities, catastrophies, or even the end of the world would satisfy the Minister for Justice ten or 12 years ago if some Minister came into this House and tried to justify the introduction of a supplementary estimate for the Gárda Síochána of £156,000.  I am sure the Minister must feel a very happy man since he is able to get away with it, and that no one worries him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to accuse the Minister of rushing the Estimate, but it has very much that appearance. There is a very considerable item for transport charges.  Most of the machines employed are very high powered cars, and consequently there is a big consumption of petrol. Their initial cost is high and their running costs are high.  At a time when a great many people in the country are anxious to get petrol, there ought to be a lead from the State as regards economising in the use of petrol.  I seriously suggest to the Minister the desirability of purchasing only 10 h.p. cars in future.  You can get a very good 10 h.p. Ford car.  It may take some time before you are able to get that standard all through the service, but it is a matter that ought to receive <Col N="2262" /> the Minister's attention.  I wonder if the Minister received within the last 12 months or two years a very courteous communication from someone in Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.A.?</P>
      <P>It appears that the casualty list for motor traffic there was so high that everybody was concerned to find a solution of the problem.  The Chief of Police made the experiment of starting two cars simultaneously through the city with a run of about three miles.  One car was instructed to disobey all police instructions, traffic lights, and so on, while the other car was to obey every regulation and to travel at 20 miles an hour.  In the three miles, there was a difference of less than half a minute in the time of the two cars with the result that they brought in a regulation restricting the speed of cars in that city to something like 25 miles an hour and the casualty list diminished almost to vanishing point.  It may be held that the smaller powered cars are not fast enough, but I suppose the Minister has sufficient experience of motoring to know that the difference in time in getting from one place to another is not commensurate with the risks involved in going fast.</P>
      <P>The other point is in connection with the clothing and equipment of the Local Security Force.  The clothing does not appear to be weatherproof, and I wonder if the Minister has considered the advisibility of having it waterproofed. It may cost a little more, but it is advisable, in the interests of the health of these who are so generously giving their time and their attention in the public service at present, that every precaution should be taken to ensure that their clothing is waterproof.  My second point in this connection is in regard to the cap.  I do not know whether it was an artist who designed it, or a person accustomed to being in a penal settlement.  The cap has all the appearance of having been modelled on what would be seen in Portland or Dartmoor.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is neither comfortable nor useful, and the question is what was the purpose of the design. If the uniform be meant for active service&mdash;and I presume that must have been at the back of somebody's mind when the uniform was first considered &mdash;the obvious headdress would be a tin hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, if it were possible to get enough, but that is the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be worth while to wait?  What use would the present cap be?  If one considers incendiary bombs, would there not be a much better chance of a portion of such an engine of destruction hopping off a tin hat than in the case of the beautiful headdress the Minister has perpetrated in connection with this uniform?  Would it not be advisable to have some sort of guard around the face and head?  It was discovered in the first or second year of the Great War, that British soldiers were subject to a much greater number of casualties than the Germans, because the German hats were protective while the British hats were decorative, and, even if the tin hats cost money, would it not be advisable to pay some regard to the safety of those engaged in this work? So that the Minister will not be under any misapprehension, my first point is 10 horse-power Ford cars, and none other; secondly, the waterproofing of the uniforms, and the issuing of no more of these peculiar boat-shaped hats, but to wait until you got tin hats. The difficulty in connection with the tin hat, I presume, is the metal itself. Has any effort been made to collect the metal, or can old tin be used again? Would it not be possible to get some sort of metal and to have it chromium-plated, so that it would be of some use?  My third point is in connection with boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, the position, so far as I recollect it, is that the intention was to grant 15/- as a grant-in-aid towards the purchase of boots. If a man wished to buy a 25/- pair of boots, 15/- would be advanced towards <Col N="2264" /> their purchase.  I understand that that is what is being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

According to returns, every second day, on an average, is a wet day here, and if these men have to operate in fields&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister ever looks at a field nowadays or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in practically every one of which there are loughs of water, no ordinary boot, and certainly not the boots I have seen, although they are very big and strong, would stand very much of it.  Even if extra pairs were supplied, which the men could throw across their shoulders and put on when required, it might be a solution.  I do think that if these men are to be employed on night-watching, looking for incendiary bombs, or anything of that sort, it is absolutely essential that they should have tin hats.</P>

      <P>In the first place, bad and all as the uniforms are, 50 per cent. of the men are not yet supplied with them, and if we had an emergency in the morning, we could call out only 50 per cent. of the Local Defence Force.  That is the position in my area. Secondly, these are the cheapest soldiers in the world.  They are soldiers for nothing.  They are costing the country nothing, and the least they might expect is that the State would give them decent uniforms, a decent overcoat, or something to keep out the cold and rain, a decent hat and, at least, a pair of boots per man.  At present the issue of boots is one pair to every six men.  At least, the 63 men under my control have 12 pairs of boots between them.</P>

      <P>We are told that was all that was to be got.  I sent forward at least three applications for boots as group leader in the district, and the total number of boots served out was 12 pairs for 63 men.  As to the 15/- grant, unfortunately the boots cost only 15/6 and all we got was 11/3.  The Government paid only three-quarters of the purchase price and did not even give the 15/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We got good boots, although we got them cheap.  We were not clever enough to put a few &ldquo;bob&rdquo; extra on them and draw the full amount, with the result that the local people had to pay for them.  These men are the cheapest the State has.  The State has soldiers for nothing.  These men are producing food in the fields for the country's needs by day and they are the Minister's soldiers by night.  I have seen them out on wild nights with hardly a bit of covering except something between the threads of which you could almost throw a dog.  A slight shower would go through it.  Not 50 per cent. of the men in the Local Security Forces have even uniforms. We have 25 uniforms amongst 63 men.  I am giving the facts as I know them.  If there were an emergency in the morning and these men had to be called out, you would have no uniforms to give them.  As regards the cap, that is a joke.  I remember when members of the Local Security Force went up for training to Collins Barracks.  They had to go round and chalk a number on them.  The uniforms and the whole turnout was next door to a convict uniform.  It was unfair to serve out anything like it to men who are serving the State for nothing.  These uniforms might be all right in Central <Col N="2266" /> Africa, where men would only want something to cover their nakedness, but they should not be served to men who may be called out on duty in this country. These men should, in the first place, get some decent uniform; in the second place, they should get overcoats and, in the third place, a pair of boots per man and not have this concession confined, as was stated in the circular sent to us, to the needy members.  They are all needy cases from what I saw. You have unfortunate labouring men, earning a pittance from the farmers, turning out without even a pair of boots to their feet to tramp the roads and fields at night.</P>
      <P>That is unfair and unjust to a section of the community which deserves better from the State.  These men are giving their services voluntarily.  They should be given some decent thing to put on their heads and to keep out a shower of rain, instead of a convict's cap, and they should be given a pair of boots.  The State is not so far gone that it cannot afford to give unpaid troops a pair of boots per man.  That is the position, as I know it, and I suggest that it be remedied at once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all with Deputy Corry, because I think that the least expense possible should be incurred in connection with these voluntary forces until such time as they are brought under some control.  At present, they are loose ends of either the Department of Justice or the Department of Defence.  There is need of provision of some kind for certain men in both these forces, and that can only be done by the disbursement locally of moneys from the Department.  There is hardly any use in saying that men in the Local Security Forces must be provided with boots, uniforms, overcoats and other things.  They do not even want them, but the trouble is that, if boots are provided, some men do not like to take them because others are not provided with them.  The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice ought to consider seriously dealing with this matter from the local point of view instead of by order from here. You cannot deal with men in two or three parishes by order from here without <Col N="2267" /> antagonising them or hurting their feelings, even though there may be necessity for supplying them with boots or other things.  Both Ministers ought to consult the Army chiefs and the local officers as to how they would dispense overcoats or caps or boots.</P>
      <P>As regards the uniform, I can see no objection to it at all.  Deputy Corry says that the heads of the members of these forces get wet.  The ordinary uniform will, certainly, satisfy these soldiers of the State if it is necessary for them to go into action.  If, in the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Force there is one section which does not want boots and another which does, the Minister should secure that those who receive boots will not feel under an obligation to the State.  I should like the Minister to do that in such a way that the recipients would not feel that they were a type of pauper in the movement.  I do not agree with Deputy Corry that all the members should be provided with this, that, and the other thing.  If it is necessary to provide some things, we should do so but we should not ask for more than we want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is right that this debate should take place in the atmosphere of complaint created by Deputies from Cork.  The Local Security Forces in my district have no such complaints as we heard here to-night.  We created a voluntary fund, and we were made aware that there would be a contribution from the Exchequer to augment that fund. What we did&mdash;and it worked very satisfactorily&mdash;was: we invited anybody who required boots or overcoats to make application, and we dealt with these applications.  I feel it to be my duty to tell the House how we operated in connection with the Local Security Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested that rubber boots be substituted for leather boots.  Personally, I would prefer the sound, solid boots, and I am sure a great many others would also prefer them.  I feel that that is the view of most of the people who will be supplied with boots.  I <Col N="2268" /> would ask the Minister, if it is a question of making an order with regard to boots, that it should be voluntary, and that the men should have a choice as to whether they would take ordinary marching boots or rubber boots.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the members of the Local Security Force will be thankful to Deputy Corry for the line he has taken in this matter.  He seems to forget that this Force was established in a very great hurry, when it was a question of putting people into some sort of uniform.  I quite agree that it is not anything like a becoming uniform, but we were faced with the situation that we had the Army increased to three times its strength, and we had to get cloth and uniforms made for the Army.  We had to accept anything we could get for the Local Security Force.  It was not a question of cheapness, although that was a consideration, too, when we were dealing with something like 150,000 men, including the A and B Sections.  We had to get them in a hurry, and if anyone will just go back to the atmosphere at the time the Force was started, he will realise that we did not know the moment we would have to meet anyone who might attempt to invade the country.  We had to make some attempt to put them into uniform.  Consequently, we did the best we could on the occasion, and, I must say, it is the first time I have heard any complaint. They are not becoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that that cap is reminiscent of what we saw in Portland or Dartmoor.  I was not there when he was there.  They are just like the Glengarry a convict was served out with.  We were in a war situation and we could not pick and choose.  The element of price, I suppose, did enter into it, but I can assure Deputies it was only a secondary consideration. We had to take what we could get, and those in the regular Army had to be clothed with the best cloth we could get.  I am quite sure, if this emergency is to last, the Minister for Finance will not object if the authorities are able to get a better uniform, including coats, for the Local Security Force, but Deputies ought not to <Col N="2269" /> forget the circumstances under which we had to undertake this collosal job. I think it is simply amazing that so many men were put into any sort of uniform at all in such a short time. They are not all in uniform.  About 57,261 uniforms have been issued.  I think I am right in saying that that is as much as the factories that were available were able to turn out.  I think that is the explanation.  We had to mobilise all the available factories, which were not engaged on other work for the Army, to do this work.  The reason they all have not got their uniforms is the reason I have given.  I do not think there was any discrimination. I do not know what procedure was adopted in issuing them.  I have an idea&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that where Ministers were going to review them they may have got them before others. That may be the case, and it would be quite understandable.  In any case, that is all the uniforms that have been issued so far and, as to the kind of uniform, that, I am satisfied, will be settled.  I believe they will get a more substantial uniform.  I believe the Minister for Finance or anyone else in the Government will not object.  I think no member of the Local Security Force is going to thank Deputy Corry for making the sort of remark he did make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to remember the circumstances in which we were placed at the time these uniforms were designed.  People of all classes of society have worn them, and all I have ever heard expressed on their part was a pride that they were in some form of uniform and that they were in a position to give some sort of national service in a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the boots, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Walsh said it was a volunteer force.  So it is.  Amongst the members are people who would not require boots.  Everybody is giving all he can.  If a man is prepared to lay his life down for a cause, that is the thing that counts.  If one happens not to be as well situated <Col N="2270" /> financially as another that is no fault of his.  His sacrifice is not less than the sacrifice of the man who has more.  As it is a volunteer movement, one in which everybody feels impelled to defend the country in its hour of danger, there should be no question of what one man got and what another man did not get.  I am quite certain that if every member of the Local Security Force puts in a request for boots he will get them.  I made a mistake when I said 15/- was being granted.  That was our proposal and I did not keep sufficiently in touch with what really happened.  We thought 15/- would be about 75 per cent. of what a serviceable pair of boots would cost.  Apparently, when bought in bulk they are cheaper.  The Department of Finance said 75 per cent. up to a maximum of 15/- was the grant-in-aid they would give.  That is all right because the balance will be retained in the Local Security Force fund and will be there for other purposes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said people were refused boots or did not get them. If they did not get them it was merely because the boots were not there. There is no question of anything of that kind at all.  Every unit in the Local Security and Local Defence Forces is treated alike.  There may be some areas in which trouble may be expected before others from an invasion point of view.  Deputy Corry's area may be one of these.  I am surprised they are not better equipped, but there is no such thing as discrimination against anybody and I am satisfied the people in charge have <Col N="2271" /> done their best to meet any demands as quickly as they could.  We were limited to the output the factories could give us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">

      <P>Is it not a fact that any person who wants boots or who the local people think wants them, gets 75 per cent. if he pays the 25 per cent.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right&mdash;75 per cent. of the cost will be granted, up to a maximum of 15/- I was wrong when I said the 15/- was given.  A profit could be made in that way, of course. Deputy Cosgrave raised a number of points about the 10 horse-power cars. That was not in regard to the Local Security Force but in regard to the Gárda.  I will put that up to the Minister for Finance.  I am sure the Deputy does not expect us to get these now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Absorb them, yes.  We will see.  Of course, Deputy Cosgrave was referring to emergency conditions, but I am sure he would not expect the Guards to be in a 10 horse-power car when a man who had just robbed a bank had a 30 horse-power car.  Fast cars would be required to catch some of these people.  I put it to him that that is a consideration that must not be overlooked.  You might be putting the Guards into cars that could not travel as fast as the fastest car made. Modern crime is done very quickly very often.  The Deputy may not have thought of that.  Of course, as far as petrol is concerned, it would be a saving, and I will have the matter examined. He also referred to waterproofing the uniforms.  I do not think that would be desirable at all; I think it would be unhealthy.  We are providing, I think, about 10,000 waterproof capes which would serve as ground sheets when men who have not waterproofs are going out at night. We are getting out as many of those as we can, and are trying to meet the position in that way.  In regard to tin <Col N="2272" /> hats, we are making arrangements with the Army to provide 7,000 of those tin hats for certain scheduled A.R.P. areas.  I do not think we would be able to get sufficient to cover the whole lot, but, as far as we can do it, it will be done.  The Army will naturally have the first claim, because normally they would be the first to be called upon&mdash;they may not be the first in some places&mdash;but after that we will try to do the best we can.</P>

    <P>The net sum of £16,000, provided in this Supplementary Estimate. is required to meet expenditure on the following items: (a) gratuities and additional allowances provided under sub-head B of the Vote for officers retiring <Col N="2274" /> or dying, and for female officers on marriage; and (b) agency payments on behalf of the British Government under sub-head D of the Vote.  It has been necessary to make a further provision of £26,200 under sub-head B, that is, additional retiring allowances, as the original Estimate of £65,800 has proved inadequate to meet the charges arising in the present financial year.  As the charges under this sub-head depend entirely on the incidence of deaths, marriages and retirements, and are further subject to fluctuation according as those occur among the higher or lower ranks, it is very difficult to estimate exactly for the sub-head.  The expenditure on those items for the first nine months of the present financial year has been higher than in the same period of any previous year, a situation which could not possibly have been forecast when the Estimate was being framed.  The further provision of £1,900 under sub-head D is necessary, in view of the rise in the official cost-of-living index number since the Estimate was framed.  The expenditure under this sub-head is recovered in full from the British Government, but payment for the last quarter of the present financial year will not be received until after 31st March this year.  The total supplementary provision required is £28,100, of which £12,100 can be supplied from savings on other sub-heads, leaving £16,000 as the net supplementary provision to meet the further sums which it is anticipated will come on charge in respect of sub-heads B and D up to the end of the financial year.</P>

      <P>In view of the depletion of herds and the heavy losses being sustained by farmers in certain districts due to contagious abortion and sterility in cows, the Dáil is of opinion that Section 1 of the Live Stock Breeding Act, 1925, should be suspended in so far as it applies to shorthorn bulls in such districts while the disease is prevalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2275" /> At the time this Bill was passed in this House the Farmers' Party agreed to it, but at that time our export trade in butter alone was worth £7,000,000 from possibly a quarter of a million cows, and it was expected that as a result of that Bill our exports would increase by probably £2,000,000, plus home consumption.  When that Bill was passed, we expected that the Government would take up the matter of these two diseases, as a result of which the farmers of the country have been practically robbed, but the Government has done practically nothing.  I do not want to press for many more bulls like those we have been getting, because I do not think they are desirable in the country. Sometimes we have bulls presented which are not by any means up to standard.  It was my privilege for some years to hold an annual sale, but it collapsed completely because the supply which was produced was not up to standard.  I think if those diseases are to be stamped out, if it cannot be done by veterinary means, you will have to increase the number of bulls through the country, but I do not know that I would recommend a further supply of the dairy bulls which we are in the habit of seeing around the country.  I do not think that would be a great advantage, but I do think that we should get back to more of the Roscommon type.  The only way to introduce them would be by giving prizes at agricultural shows to farmers who can breed these bulls at much less expense than they would incur if they were breeding pure-bred shorthorns or any other bulls of that kind.  If that procedure were encouraged it would achieve far better results.</P>
    <P>There is not very much that can be said on this motion, but I do think the Government should try to remedy the depletion of herds through this disease, which has caused such heavy losses amongst the farmers over many years. I suggest we should try to get many more bulls of the shorthorn type into the country.  The farmers should be encouraged to keep them by giving prizes in the way I have suggested.</P>

      <P>I wish to second this <Col N="2276" /> motion.  It is a very important one. There are certain districts where contagious abortion and sterility prevail. Unfortunately, in parts of County Cavan and the neighbouring counties, the disease has been very prevalent for years.  Men who have had a great deal of experience, who have kept bulls and dairy herds, are all agreed that it is partly due to a shortage of bulls of the half-bred type of shorthorn.  It is a well-known fact that pedigree bulls that are very well fed when young are not able to serve the same number of cows as the half-bred bull.  When this disease becomes prevalent in a district and the cows continue to come every few weeks, the bulls are over-worked, yet the farmers have no alternative but to continue bringing to them the cows that are affected and in that way they spread the disease to their neighbours' cattle.</P>
      <P>It would be much better if there were other bulls provided, even though they were not quite so good as bulls of the shorthorn type.  This would give the farmers a little latitude, because, where the disease is prevalent, they could use the other bulls&mdash;send the cows giving the trouble to those bulls at their own discretion.  This method has been found very successful in the past and I think the Minister should carefully consider it.  I do not want to criticise the policy of the Department in selecting the best animals.  I quite agree it is a great idea to select the best bulls.</P>
      <P>This disease does not apply to the whole country.  It is only in certain districts that animals are affected with this trouble.  Unfortunately, numbers of farmers have been left without cows or calves.  There may be very strong arguments against this motion, but it is really a matter of trusting the farmers to use their own judgment and discretion in obtaining the best calves they can get.  If something is not done there are certain districts where there will be no cows or calves.  Once a cow runs for a year or two and becomes dry, all it is then fit for is Roscrea or some other such place, and it will not fetch more than a couple of pounds.  That is what happens in the districts where the disease is prevalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion merely asks that in <Col N="2277" /> affected districts there should be a temporary relaxation of the present scheme.  As regards the method by which this could be done, it is quite simple.  The Department have in every country at least one competent representative in the person of the agricultural instructor, who is in many cases at the same time the secretary of the county committee. Where this disease is giving trouble the farmers could get in touch with the agricultural instructor.  He could visit the district, meet the farmers there, have a consultation with them and ascertain whether the disease is so prevalent as to justify a relaxation. He is, I think, a man who can be trusted to advise the Department correctly.  He knows the local conditions and he could easily ascertain whether the disease had reached a serious stage.  I strongly recommend the Minister to give careful thought to this matter.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that if there were any relaxation the quality of our cattle would deteriorate.  I do not agree. Even if they did deteriorate a little, it would be better to have some cows and calves than to have dry cows and no calves.  I do not agree, however, that there would be deterioration.  You should trust the farmers in these matters.  As Deputy Cole pointed out, the cattle are far from being improved under present conditions.  In parts of County Cavan and neighbouring counties, where they were in the habit of breeding from the Roscommon shorthorns, anyone with practical knowledge who visits the fairs can see that they are entirely the other way.  If you ask any dealing man he will give you the answer that he cannot find the suitable type of cattle now that he used to get 15 or 20 years ago.  I do not say that the Department's scheme is responsible for that, but whatever is responsible it is a well-known fact that they have deteriorated.  Possibly it is that they have become mixed up with too many breeds.  The fact is, at any rate, that they cannot get the sort of shorthorn that they used to get; the animals now are not nearly so useful or suitable for breeding purposes.</P>
    <P>If a little latitude were given to <Col N="2278" /> farmers in the selection of bulls no harm would be done; indeed, there would be a great deal of good, and the quality of the cattle would not deteriorate. All the motion asks is that you relax Section 1 of the Livestock Breeding Act for a limited period in certain districts.  Then as soon as the disease even partly disappears, the scheme could be put into working order again. I know this is not an ideal solution; indeed it is very far from it.  The ideal solution would be to find a cure for the disease, but, unfortunately, no cure has been found so far, and nobody knows better than the members of the Department's veterinary staff that they have not found the means of stamping out the disease.  This is the second best thing.  The Department admits that they cannot stamp out the disease, that it is a very difficult thing to do so.  The second best thing is to relax the restrictions and give the people a chance and the Department's bulls a chance, and have others to which these troublesome cows can be sent.  That is the object we have in view.  I believe the suggestion is a good one, and the Department can learn many things from time to time from practical farmers who know the difficulties they are up against.</P>
    <P>It would do them no harm to listen to deputations now and again, or to listen to the representatives of the people in this House and elsewhere. Deputy Cole is a man who has much experience of cattle.  He knows what he is talking about and his opinions should not be lightly turned down. Indeed, for that matter, the representations of any practical farmer should be listened to even by the Department. We would be only too glad if the Department could find a cure for this disease and stamp it out altogether, but unfortunately, that does not seem to be practicable at the present time. We have to carry on as best we can and, in the meantime, try to save our herds of milch cows, the numbers of which have already been seriously diminished.  I have heard of very poor men who had four or five cows and they had to sell as much as three out of the five for a few pounds, whereas they could have retained these cows if <Col N="2279" /> there were any remedy for this disease. As I stated before, the Minister has in every county a representative of the Department.  He could get in touch with the farmers, investigate the grounds for these complaints and report to the Department whether it would be advisable to relax the restrictions in such cases.  I strongly recommend the Minister to inquire into the matter.</P>

      <P>I have heard the case made by Deputies McGovern and Cole on this motion.  The motion has been on the Order Paper for some time, but obviously it is a motion that deals only with one portion of the country that seems to be affected, at least in their opinion, rather more severely than other portions of the country.  There is something rather frightening in the implications of the motion because the two Deputies who have spoken seem to suggest that the dairy shorthorn bull, the bull that has come along from the South of Ireland in the last few years particularly, is, to a certain extent, the cause of the trouble, and that the other type of bull, the Roscommon shorthorn bull, is quite up to the mark.  As the Minister is aware, the constituency which I represent is the home of the dairy shorthorn bull in Ireland.  The Minister has had long associations with the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society.  I think this was the first year we missed him from our annual Congress.  If there is contagious abortion and sterility in this country, nobody can tell me that it is peculiar to bulls coming from our area.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested that a different type of shorthorn bull might be allowed into Cavan, and that the dairy shorthorn bull from the South was not wanted there.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us to-night whether any progress has been made by the officers of the Department in the research work they are doing to find a remedy for this disease.  It is, as Deputy McGovern said, a tragic feature of life in this country that many <Col N="2280" /> farmers have been almost wiped out as a result of their herds being affected by this terrible disease.  For quite a number of years the Minister has been warning people, in the Press and over the radio, against specifics that were being sold as a certain cure for contagious abortion.  He warned them that they ought not to buy them, but the warning did not seem to have much effect.  There were certain specifies that were supposed to be perfect cures sold throughout the country, and, mind you, at a very high price.  Farmers bought these specifics at a cost in some cases of £35 or £40, despite the fact that the Minister warned them.  They found that the stuff they bought was useless and even a danger to the cattle. That was nothing else but pure robbery. I was consulted in my professional capacity by a number of these farmers.  They knew their money was gone, but they could do nothing about it.  I suppose the Minister was not to blame; he had warned them; but it was the greatest pity in the world that he did not come down on the people who were selling these cures and stop the sale of them altogether.</P>
      <P>There is just one matter I should like to put to Deputies Cole and McGovern in reference to this Act.  The two of them made the case that the Act could be relaxed in one area which seems to be very badly off.  I do not agree that you can relax the Act for any area and leave it in operation in other areas. You may be able to amend the Act, but you certainly cannot successfully relax it in any area and leave it in operation in other areas.  If you relax the Act for one area, and if that means that farmers in other areas are going to be prosecuted for having unlicensed bulls, the Minister will be harried by every Deputy and Senator in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are not, but do these two Deputies not think that if it is going to be relaxed in their area, in other words, that people in that area will be allowed to get away with something that other people are prevented from doing, that every Deputy in the House will not be after <Col N="2281" /> the Minister to relax it in his area too? My opinion is that if you relax the Livestock Breeding Act in one area for one second, you will never enforce it again.  Whatever be the merits or the demerits of the Cavan case, it would be quite impossible to relax the provisions of the Act in that area while they are in full operation in other areas.  Ever since the Act was passed there has been a campaign against it, even for political purposes. It was suggested that it was passed for penalising farmers and there was a campaign against it from other points of view also.  I do not believe that anyone could suggest that the Act did the slightest bit of harm to any part of the country.  Indeed I think everybody must admit that it has done a great deal of good.  I repeat that if you relax it for one moment in any area in the country you will never be able to enforce it again.  I have too high an estimate of the value of the Livestock Breeding Act of 1925 to wish to have any of its provisions relaxed.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy McGovern &ldquo;pinched&rdquo; the case from me in saying that they were not asking it to be relaxed for County Cork.  I do not say that the Cork people want any of its provisions relaxed, but if there were any relaxations granted to County Cavan, what would Deputy John Flynn of Kerry, for instance, say?  You would have the unfortunate inspector of the Department in each county almost murdered, unless he were able to promise people in these counties that he would get the Act relaxed.  You would have complaints constantly coming to the Minister, the Department, and the Secretary of the County Committee in places like Kerry and even West Cork.  If the Act were relaxed in certain other counties, I should not like to be the T.D. representing an area where they had a longstanding grievance in respect of the Act, as they have in several counties at the moment.  Whatever consolation it might give some Deputies to have the Act relaxed in their areas, I would strongly urge the Minister not to relax the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want again to impress on the Minister that the Department should <Col N="2282" /> investigate quickly the case of all these alleged &ldquo;cure-alls&rdquo; that are being sold all over the country as specifics for the cure of contagious abortion, and should take some stops regarding them, if his Department is satisfied that they are not all that they purport to be.  There is no earthly use in warning farmers over the radio and in the Press, for there always will be some silly farmers who will buy them.  If his Department is satisfied that any firm in this country is still selling these articles and that they are not what they purport to be, he should jump on them as hard as he possibly can and stop them from selling them. I say I regret, as a pure non-expert as a farmer&mdash;either in practice or in theory&mdash;that I cannot agree with two very great experts in this matter like Deputies Cole and McGovern.  I again reiterate that I think highly of the Livestock Breeding Act of 1925, and think highly of the type of cattle that the Minister wants.  I ask the Minister, when he is replying to find out from Deputy McGovern what kind of bull he should have.</P>

      <P>The present Minister for Agriculture has been talking for quite a long time about what his Department has been doing about the type of cattle in the North Cork area, about the statistical test for cattle in that area, and I think that that is an unanswerable argument in favour of the Livestock Breeding Act of 1925 in an area where it was always carried out.  That statistical test was made in 25 mixed farms for the protection of cattle and dual-purpose cows and is an unanswerable argument in favour of that Livestock Breeding Act.  I say that it should not be relaxed for one second nor in any area of this country and, if it is going to be relaxed, that it should be dropped altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer I have deep sympathy with the views expressed by the proposer and seconder of this motion.  Nevertheless, as the motion is worded, I feel I could not possibly support it.  It asks that the Livestock Breeding Act of 1925 be suspended, but I think anybody who takes note of the quality of cattle generally in this country will acknowledge that the general standard is not anything too high at the moment, and that, as a matter of fact, anything that can be done should be done to improve that standard. Certainly, no step should be taken at the present time which would lower that standard.</P>
      <P>I have noticed quite a considerable number of bulls which have been licensed, and I have found some of them inferior enough.  It may be that in some portions of this country it is difficult to obtain licensed bulls, or that they are either scarce, or that the price is too high, but I know that in the counties in Leinster with which I am familiar, the position is that the price of licensed bulls is not excessive in comparison with other cattle, and in comparison with the cost of rearing such cattle, and in comparison with what it would cost to rear them if there never were any licensing scheme. Therefore, since there is in a considerable area in the country quite a large number of bulls already licensed, it is naturally a matter of having them distributed if they are scarce in other districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certainly no case for suspending this Act.  As a matter of fact, I would say that it does not go far enough, and sooner or later steps will have to be taken, by registration or in some other way, to improve the quality. Some of the best results of this Act are nullified through the inferior quality of heifers kept in many districts. So far as disease is concerned, the suspending of this Act would make no great difference.  I know that, in my own part of the country, there are quite a sufficient number of bulls.  Unfortunately, we have that disease very prevalent amongst our cattle, and so far no effective remedy has been found. <Col N="2284" /> I suggest, therefore, that if there is a local grievance in regard to the supply of licensed bulls in any particular part of the country, the Minister should look into it to see if bulls can be obtained from other areas where they are plentiful.</P>
    <P>I have only one complaint to make in regard to the licensing of bulls, and that is one which was brought to my notice on a couple of occasions.  In one particular instance a farmer was found with an unlicensed bull and was summoned but, shortly afterwards, he applied to have a bull licensed and his application was refused.  In that case, I think the Department had no reasonable ground for believing that the bull which he sought to have licensed was the same animal in regard to which proceedings had been taken against him.  As a matter of fact, it was not. This is a matter into which the Minister should inquire.  As far as this motion is concerned, I am sorry that I cannot support it, although I have sympathy with the proposer and seconder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than pay tribute to or support this motion, I rise to pay tribute to the good effect the 1925 Act had on our live stock generally.  Very few people can dispute the fact that it was a very wise precaution to do away with scrub bulls generally and make the people realise that, if they were to improve the stock, it would be necessary to improve the standard and the type of bull used. Everyone will agree without hesitation that live stock generally shows an improvement here in recent years.  The improvement would be more marked but for the fact that, in the autumn of each year, thousands of the prime heifers are exported&mdash;heifers that in shape, appearance and colour are suitable as choice heifers for first class milkers, and which command a very attractive price.  Unfortunately, they leave none of their progeny here at all, so that the position is that we generally breed from second rate heifers, as those are the only ones left with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister <Col N="2285" /> before that a subsidy should be paid to encourage farmers to reserve these heifers, or at least to arrange that they should leave one calf after them before exportation.  Surely it could be arranged to pay a subsidy of £2 per head on selected heifers.  If there were heifer shows, as there are bull shows and meetings for the licensing of bulls, it should be possible to select suitable heifers for breeding&mdash;heifers of good shape and quality and giving every indication of proper milking qualities. A premium of, say, £2, would encourage the farmer to breed from the heifer rather than to export it as a maiden heifer, and would thus leave at least one calf.</P>
    <P>I think that in the long run it would be money very well spent in the interests of the live stock of this country.  I have suggested it before, and, as far as I can see, it is the only solution.  It would be a hardship, and, perhaps, a misfortune, to prevent the export in any particular year; I mean, until a heifer breeds.  It might be a real hardship on a man who had only a small amount of stock to compel him to do that, but you could induce him or attract him to do so by putting a premium on prize heifers to breed here for at least one year before export.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be rather silly for Deputies to suggest that where abortion or sterility in cows is present the suspension of the 1925 Act is going to improve matters.  For the life of me, speaking as a practical farmer, I cannot see how that would improve the position at all.  I know that some of the county committees of agriculture recently have invited some eminent professors from town here to give lectures on this matter: notably Professor Kearney, who is an authority on this particular disease.  I, personally, have listened to a most interesting lecture from Professor Kearney on that particular subject, and I suggest that if you want to attack this problem properly in County Cavan you should get Professor Kearney down there to give a lecture on the matter.  That would be a better way of going about the business than letting every sort of <Col N="2286" /> scrub bull operate in the county.  As I said, that is not a solution at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to that matter which I have already mentioned, the necessity for preserving at all costs and keeping here, at least until they breed, those choice heifers that are exported from this country year after year.  Very keen prices are offered for them, so keen that our own buyers are unable to compete.  I want to emphasise the necessity of preserving that basic stock.  I would go even further and say that in my opinion it is a pity that we use so many other breeds.  After all, the shorthorns are the basic stock of this country, and we are inclined, I think, to grant too many premiums for the Aberdeen Angus and the Hereford.  After all, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Argentine and other countries can provide meat for the British market, but this is the only country in the world that provides the milker for the English people.</P>
    <P>Beyond what they produce themselves, they can only buy the cow here, and they are not able in England to rear an animal with the bone and quality that our cows have.  The soil to produce bone and muscle is not there; they have not got it, and we are fortunate enough to have it in this country.  There is no doubt about it, we are able to produce the very best type of cow that will eventually produce the best milk.  I say to the Minister that we should concentrate particularly on producing the best type of milker for that market in which we have a monopoly, and I hold that we are disimproving our livestock by the introduction of too many Aberdeen Anguses, Herefords, and other crosses. I take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that the number of Hereford and Aberdeen Angus premiums granted by his Department should be reduced as much as possible. I quite appreciate the advantages of the Aberdeen Angus bulls in mountainous or poor districts where fodder is scarce and it is difficult to carry over the winter, because, as we are told&mdash;whether it can be proved or not &mdash;they are a hardier breed and easier <Col N="2287" /> to get into condition, and they are slower to rear, but, possibly, if an experiment were carried out, it might be found that in the long run the shorthorn would prove just as profitable. Taking the interests of the country as a whole, however, from the livestock point of view, we should concentrate on the shorthorn, the basic stock of the country, particularly as we have a monopoly in supplying the stock that will eventually produce the best milker for the British market.  The Argentine and other countries can supply meat to that market and we have to compete with these countries, but we have a monopoly in that market of providing the basic stock for the milkers that will eventually produce the milk they require.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Linehan referred to these patent cures, or supposed cures, that are being pushed on the people all over the country.  I do not think the Department can do very much about it beyond what they are doing at present, and that is warning the farmer that they are not cures.  I do not think you can prosecute these people, if the farmers are foolish enough to persist in buying these alleged cures. Well, it is their own kettle of fish if they are being robbed for something that has no value at all.  It is necessary, however, whenever the Department is publishing such a warning, to put it in as prominent a position as possible in the newspapers, so that the farmers will see it and so that those foolish people will not buy these patent things, which are supposed to be cures, and which we know very well are not cures.</P>
    <P>The agents of the companies that sell these supposed cures are very active and persistent, and they have sold them in many districts and to people who ought to know better.  As a matter of fact, I know of one particular case where a supposed cure of this type was sold to one of the biggest colleges in this country.  It was sold to the management of the college, where they have a big farm attached, and they felt very sore about it and thought that they were badly treated because the <Col N="2288" /> Department had not warned them.  We all know that it is not the policy of the Department to encourage that kind of thing at all, but in some cases that warning is overlooked and some farmers are not aware that the Department do not approve of these things. Accordingly, when you are warning the farmers about these supposed cures, you should make the warning large enough and its insertion in the papers prominent enough to enable the farmers to see the warning at all events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hopeful that the movers of this motion would give more cogent arguments and reasons for it.  We have heard criticism of the Livestock Breeding Act from time to time, and it is generally criticised on the basis, first of all, that the bull carries the disease of contagious abortion; secondly, that on account of what is regarded by some people as the strict licensing system we have not enough bulls in the country; and, thirdly, I think there was an added reason given here to-night, that the shorthorn bull in particular was to blame in this particular respect. Now, it has been proved, I think, fairly satisfactorily&mdash;in fact, quite satisfactorily&mdash;that bull does not usually carry the disease of contagious abortion and that the disease is carried by cows from one to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the bull can carry the disease, but he is not the real mischief maker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  He can carry it, but the cows are the real carriers.  It is true, of course, that if every farmer could afford to keep a bull the disease could not travel so much because, in that case, you would not have the cows being driven so much from one farm to another, and there would not be the same danger of the spread of the disease as there is where you have one bull serving ten or 15 farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really a fact that when a cow is brought to a farm where there is infection, or comes from a farm where there is infection, the disease is spread more than where a bull is used by a number of herds.  As to the argument that there are not enough bulls, I think <Col N="2289" /> there are.  For the last three or four years there were more bulls licensed than were actually required.  A number of bulls that were shown at the Dublin Show one year were killed by a butcher when they were not disposed of for breeding purposes.  The same applies to other parts of the country. If bulls are passed for licensing and if those who show them find it hard to sell, they may think it better to fatten the animals and sell them for beef rather than keep them for breeding. It is fairly obvious that there are, in fact, more bulls licensed than there is demand for.  I do not think there is anything in the contention that Shorthorn bulls are more likely to spread the disease, or more useless for combating it, than other types of bulls.  I do not know if Deputy Cole or Deputy McGovern have got any information to rely on in making such a statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>

      <P>I have tried to find out whether Cavan is particularly affected by contagious abortion.  I do not think it is.  There is no evidence to be found in the Department, from the live-stock inspectors or from the officers of the committee of agriculture to show that Cavan is particularly affected.  Deputy Linehan spoke of the position in North Cork.  We had reports in the Department that the disease was particularly prevalent in North Cork.  We carried out a special investigation and found that it was very prevalent there.  We are prepared to carry out the same investigation in Cavan if Deputies would like to have that done.  We could tell them then the districts affected.  When we are trying to deal with a problem <Col N="2290" /> like this, the first thing necessary is to get good reliable information, to find out how many cows are affected and in what way.  There are various forms of the disease, and it would be well to know the position before doing anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were.  There is a good supply of bulls in Cavan.  My information is that the number of bulls shown in Cavan was high, and that some people had considerable difficulty in disposing of them.  They got licences in order to dispose of the bulls, and, in fact, they were sold very cheap. There was no difficulty in the way of any farmer who was prepared to buy a bull in the ordinary way getting one in County Cavan.  The Department distributes a leaflet, No. 13, which deals with the disease of contagious abortion. There has been a very small demand for that leaflet in Cavan.  That is not due to the fact that County Cavan farmers are backward in any way, as they use other leaflets extensively.  As Deputies know, these leaflets indicate what other leaflets are available, and I am quite sure Cavan farmers are curious enough to look at the back to see if any further information is to be got about contagious abortion.  That being so they could apply for copies of the leaflet.  Such has not been the case there and the leaflet has not been used to any great extent.  I agree with Deputy McGovern that we should listen to everybody prepared to give advice, but it is not possible always to agree with it.  If Deputies are not satisfied with what I say, that there are enough bulls, that there is no great demand for leaflet No. 13, and that the disease is not any worse in Cavan than anywhere else, but contend that they believe it is worse there, I am prepared in that case to carry out some kind of investigation in County Cavan to find out whether the disease is very serious and, if so, to see what can be done about it.</P>

    <P>I agree with what Deputy Linehan, Deputy Cogan and Deputy Hughes <Col N="2291" /> said that, on the whole, the effects of the Live Stock Breeding Act have been very good.  In fact, the effects have been as satisfactory as the framers of the Act hoped.  There is no doubt that our store cattle have been improved.  I have gone to the trouble, when meeting people from Scotland and England at shows, who are large purchasers of store cattle, of asking them whether they believed there was an improvement, and in every single case those who have been purchasing here for the last 20 years, told me that there was a remarkable improvement in the quality of our store cattle.  I think that is due to the Livestock Breeding Act.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister say that the quality has improved in every county?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, it is only to be expected that there would be an improvement.  After all, we have, through the operation of the Livestock Breeding Act, eliminated what was known as the scrub bull, and that must have had good effects.  Undoubtedly, on the other hand, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, we are losing the good effects of that Act by keeping a poor class of heifers and cows for breeding.  It is rather hard to deal with that.  I will deal with it on a point raised by Deputy Hughes. I doubt if we have achieved very much in the milk yield of cows and heifers.  On the whole, the general average milk yield is not very much improved since the passing of the 1925 Act.  I do not know if that is due to any mistake in the policy pursued by the Department, or to the fact that some farmers are inclined to keep poor heifers and poor cows and, when in hard circumstances, sell off the best.  I do not know what it may be due to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Linehan asked if anything had been done to combat the disease. I do not think we have achieved very much.  We have worked harder on this disease in our research department than on any other disease.  Our veterinary surgeons when applied to give good advice as to how to avoid <Col N="2292" /> the disease, as far as possible, and how to keep it out of a herd.  It is something that we are able to prevent the disease coming, but once it has entered a herd it is extremely difficult to cure it.  Certainly we have not discovered a specific cure for contagious abortion.  That may be too much to expect.  We are a small country and we have not big funds to devote to the problem, but some big countries with great resources in the way of money, that have been working on it, have not been any more successful.  I only wish we could do something to discover a cure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specifics that Deputy Linehan mentioned, I should say that they give us a lot of trouble. I am not sure but we must amend the law before we deal with them.  We are considering that.  Deputies should think about it as I will have proposals to lay before the Dáil.  There are three things to be considered.  Some agents actually demonstrate their cure. That is a thing that should not be permitted.  Everybody will agree that we should stop that.</P>
    <P>The second is that some of them canvass.  Probably we should prevent that.  The third point is that some of them advertise.  It may be going a little too far to stop advertising, as we might be stopping business houses advertising remedies that are good.  If we say that we must stop advertising completely, it would be impossible to draw the line.  There are, therefore, three things&mdash;demonstration, canvassing and advertising.  I have no hesitation in saying that we must stop demonstration; I probably would go so far as to say that we must stop canvassing; but I do not think we can go so far as stopping advertising.</P>

      <P>If the Department are satisfied that a certain article which is being sold or advertised for sale is worse than useless, can you not amend the law to stop the sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we will not come across it until it is fairly widely distributed.  It means really, I think, that we will have to go back to a proposal <Col N="2293" /> which we adopted before and which was ineffective, but which we will try to make effective, namely, that every proprietary remedy must be registered and will not be registered unless it is considered useful.  We found it was rather impracticable to administer that, but we may try it again.  However, we are considering legislation on those lines and we will see what we can do.  The next point mentioned by Deputy Hughes was that the best heifers were being exported. That has been stated for many years, but I do not know that it is true; at least I do not think the situation is as bad as some Deputies and others outside think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister visited a country fair, particularly in the South of Ireland, he would see that it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that good heifers are exported; still we have carried on.  At any rate, I can say that the matter is under active consideration to see whether we could not do something to stop those heifers going out, and what has been suggested by Deputy Hughes is one of the schemes under consideration, namely, that we should give something like the premium given to brood mares.  Of course, that would be a huge thing.  The number of mares would be in the hundreds, but the heifers would run into hundreds of thousands and it would be an enormous thing to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It would show good results in a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that it would show very good results.  I agree that even if we spent hundreds of thousands of pounds it would be very well spent money.  We are considering some scheme of that kind.  It is a matter on which a decision must be come to rather quickly if we are to bring in the scheme this season, because the big exports commence in April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean if we want to <Col N="2294" /> catch the spring cattle.  It applies more to the autumn, but a number will go out in the spring.  Deputy Hughes also raised the point that there were too many Hereford and Polled Angus bulls licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I understand.  We have certainly advised county committees of agriculture so far as possible to go in more for shorthorns, and there is a slight movement in that direction. If there is trouble in Cavan, as was stated by Deputies, it would be impossible, as Deputy Linehan pointed out, to administer this in certain areas only.  We will have to have the same rule all over the country.  I ask Deputies to be satisfied with a special investigation being carried out in that area if we think the thing is more prevalent there than elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you send down a good veterinary inspector to examine the matter?  In the neighbouring county of Leitrim it is just as bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister from practical experience that the bull does not carry the disease.  The small farmers are not in a position to purchase bulls at the Dublin Shows and the ordinary bull which you find in the country is not the type to produce the sort of cattle you want.  What the farmer wants is a good wide bull that will produce stock which will grow into large animals.  If nothing can be done by way of research and investigation the only thing to do is to encourage every farmer to keep his own bull. The Department, of course, will not advance money for these as they do for premium bulls, but the farmers are not in a position to purchase the bulls at the Shows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the different cures which have been referred to, I would not go so far as to say that they are all useless. Our experience is that when a cow comes into a place where there is no disease or abortion, if that cow is sufficiently disinfected there will not be any trouble or at least, only occasionally. <Col N="2295" /> If the remedies recommended by the advertisements are of the proper disinfectant class there is no doubt that they will prove useful.  I do not want to go outside the motion, but the trouble, as far as I can see, arises from allowing Aberdeen Angus bulls down to Kerry.  We have been getting what <Col N="2296" /> are supposed to be Aberdeen Angus calves that are not Aberdeen Angus at all.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 20th February.</P>
