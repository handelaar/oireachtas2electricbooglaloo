      <P>I am aware that in a number of cases improvement works approved under the farm improvements scheme were not, owing to various special reasons, completed by the date on which works under the scheme for the season 1940-41 were intended to be finished, viz., 24th July.  In the circumstances, I have arranged to extend the time for the completion of such works to 31st October next.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is a continuation of legislation that was passed last year.  The original intention was to have it made permanent, but there was a wish expressed to have it annually, so we passed it for one year.  The Act expires on the 3rd of September this year and this Bill is introduced to give <Col N="2191" /> it currency for another year, to the 3rd September, 1942.  Under the Act various sums of money were seized, one amount consisting of 20,000 dollars. We also seized eight motor cars, some duplicating machines and other things of that description.  There is a right of appeal.  If anyone objects to articles being seized, he can go to the courts, but so far there has not been any objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As I said during the consideration of the Estimates, the state of the law as regards malicious injury to the Gárdai in the discharge of their duties is unsatisfactory.  The Grand Juries Act, 1836, lays it down that there must be malice proved if a policeman is killed or injured in the discharge of his duty. Unless it can be shown that the man who injured or killed a Guard had something against him, had some malice towards him, it was ruled, almost half a century ago, that the Act <Col N="2192" /> did not apply.  There were six cases within recent times in which three Gárdaí were killed, while others were severely injured.  The courts held, in five cases, that there was no evidence of malice and that, therefore, the Act did not apply. In the other case an award was given by the Circuit Court.  An appeal was taken in that case, and it has not yet been decided.  Under the Act to which I have referred the local authority was liable for the damages. In this Bill the proposal is that the Government and not the local authority should pay the damages.  Some confusion may have arisen about the words in the Bill, &ldquo;any other police force.&rdquo; Some people thought these words applied to the Local Security Force. That is not so.  They apply to the Taca, which is only a temporary police force at present.  Mention of the Taca is not made in the Bill, because it is hoped to make this a permanent measure.  In the course of time some other kind of a temporary police force may be recruited, so that the Act would apply to it, so long as it was a whole-time police force.  The Local Security Force is not covered in this Bill, but provision is made for it in another way. This Bill has nothing to do with injuries accidentally received.  It does cover cases where there has been deliberate wounding or killing, but does not cover injuries accidentally received. The memorandum that was circulated fully explains, I think, the various provisions of the Bill, so that for the present I do not think there is any need for me to say more.  If any points are raised I can deal with them when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am glad, when the principle of giving compensation to the Gárdaí when they are injured was adopted, that it has been introduced here as a very wide measure, covering all injuries received by members of the Gárda when they are hurt in the discharge of their duties.  This measure sets aside the decision in Murphy's case which, as the Minister has stated, gave a very narrow interpretation indeed to the old Grand Juries Act.  Under that Act no <Col N="2193" /> compensation could be received by any member of the Gárda unless he was killed or maimed because of his exertions in bringing disturbers of the public peace to justice, and it had to be held that it was because of his previous exertions, of something that he had done on a former occasion, that malice was entertained towards him, and that for that reason he was injured.  If a Guard was injured in the course of a riot, and by a person who was only anxious to injure a policeman, he was not entitled to compensation.</P>
      <P>I am glad that this measure has been introduced.  I am glad for another reason.  The Minister on a previous occasion in speaking about the Gárda&mdash; he did it possibly inadvertently&mdash;did, I think, rather give a shock to the country by conveying, though I am sure he did not quite mean it, the opinion that there was something very rotten in the Gárda force, and that certain officers would have to be removed.  I am very glad to see that this Bill is a concrete statement that the Government, as well as the whole country, recognise the excellence of the Gárda force, and that we have here a police force of which the country ought to be and is, I think, proud: that is a police force to which we are anxious, in every way, to give fair play.  One of the measures of fair play is to see that if a man is killed or injured in the discharge of his duty that he will, in the one case himself, and in the other case his dependents, receive adequate financial compensation.</P>
      <P>There are two features of the Bill which I do not like, and which I would ask the Minister to amend in Committee. The first is that the application referred to has to be made to the Department of Justice, the Minister being put in the position of a judge to decide as to whether a man is, or is not, entitled to compensation.  I do not like that provision.  I am quite aware that there is another provision in the Bill which states that if a person likes he can apply to the Minister who will then send the matter on to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  In my opinion every case should be investigated by the courts. As a matter of fact, it is much more important to have matters investigated in court when persons are hurt than when persons are killed.  When a person is killed it becomes an actuarial matter, to make a valuation of what his loss meant to his dependents; but when a man is injured, you have a very much more difficult problem.  The Minister has not got the machinery to enable him to come to a decision on that.  Suppose a Guard is hurt, the first question that may arise is&mdash;did the Guard receive the injuries in the course of his duties?  That may mean that he will have to call half a dozen witnesses and that the State may have to call witnesses.  In such a case the Minister has got no machinery by which he can investigate that adequately. Then, again, take the amount of injuries that a man has received, the likelihood of his recovery, how long it may take him to recover, has he been damaged to a very large extent or only to a small extent.  These are all matters on which medical opinion may differ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ordinary running-down actions and workmen's compensation cases, we often have a very considerable difference of opinion between the most eminent medical men.  They are cross-examined in court, and the judge has to make up his mind between them.  If one particular surgeon thinks that a man will have completely recovered in six months, and if another surgeon thinks it will take him two years to recover completely, how on earth is the Minister to have that investigated? There is no provision to enable him to call these surgeons before him, even if he were competent to investigate a case of that kind.  Really, nobody is competent, unless a man is put in the witness box.  The medical expert is put in the witness box, and is subjected to cross-examination.  From a cross-examination of medical witnesses on both sides there gradually emerges a measure of agreement, or at least it is made possible for the court to come to a conclusion. There is, however, no possibility <Col N="2195" /> of that being properly done if the matter is going to be investigated by the Minister with the mere statement before him from the injured person.  I cannot see the advantage of the Minister outing the courts and taking upon himself duties which ought to devolve upon the trained judges of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that there would possibly be extra expense if the matter were investigated in court and properly done.  My reply to that would be twofold.  If the cases can be settled out of court, if the injured person is satisfied with the amount of compensation which the Minister offers, well then the case is settled, as, one might say 75 per cent. of the running-down cases in this country are settled; they do not come to court at all.  But if the Minister thinks a certain amount is sufficient, and a Guard thinks it is entirely insufficient, then the Guard should be able to have the matter investigated in court.  The Minister would lodge in court the amount which he thinks is sufficient, and if the Guard is wrong then the Guard suffers in costs.  I cannot see that there is any advantage at all to be derived from this ousting of the courts.  I would press upon the Minister very strongly, so that this may go through the House entirely as an agreed measure, that instead of making application to the Minister application should be made to the courts in every case.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I do not like in this Bill.  Under Section 13 the Minister may, by order, apply this Act to any force other than the Guards who, for the time being, are doing police duties.  I do not at all like legislation by order.  I think it would be better if a short Act, <i>ad hoc,</i> were brought in.  If there is a new force like the Taca Síochána to which the Minister wishes that compensation should be given in case of injuries, it would be better that a short Act should be brought in for that purpose, or let Section 13 of this Bill be amended so that it would not require any order by the Minister.  I do object to legislation <Col N="2196" /> by order being pressed forward.  If a new force is established, and compensation is to be given to them, let the Minister come to the House and let the House consider whether it is right and proper to do so.</P>
    <P>Those are my two objections to the Bill.  Neither of them goes to the root or substance of the Bill.  They are questions of procedure; they are questions of detail.  I would ask the Minister to amend the Bill on the lines which I have suggested, but, taking the Bill as a whole, I welcome it very heartily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced this Bill, but I think it is rather a pity that he spoils the benefits of the Bill by putting into Section 6 the arbitrary powers which are conferred upon the Minister under that section.  A Guard who has been injured may make an application to the Minister for compensation, that compensation having already been refused by the court.  The Minister is the defendant in this particular case, and the Minister takes power under Section 6 to say, as the defendant: &ldquo;I refuse to admit the plaintiff's right to compensation.&rdquo;  If the Minister takes up that attitude in that case, then under sub-section (4) of Section 6 the Minister's decision shall be final and conclusive, and there is no appeal against that decision.  I know the Minister has a very deep sense of fair play, and I know that normally he would say that that is a rather arbitrary power for a Minister, as a defendant, to possess against a plaintiff. The Minister can refuse to pay compensation; he can refuse to admit that the case is one in which the compensation is payable.  When the Minister does that, the plaintiff has to accept the Minister's judgement, and there is no means by which the plaintiff can get to the court.  I would have less worry about this section if the present Minister were likely to be Minister for Justice for ever, because I am sure he has such a highly developed sense of fair play that he would not consciously do a wrong thing.  That certificate does not extend to the political activities <Col N="2197" /> of the Minister, but merely to his administrative activities.</P>
      <P>The Minister, under Section 6, is taking very wide powers.  He is simply preventing an applicant for compensation from having his case heard in court once the Minister elects to say: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  We all live in 1941, and we all know what Government Departments are.  The Minister may very well be advised by his advisers in the Department of Justice that this is a case in which compensation should not be paid, and all the pressure in the world will be brought on the Minister to refuse compensation in that particular case.  With the best intentions in the world the Minister would be scratching his head and saying &ldquo;I would like to do it, but the case put up by the Department is so strong that it is not easy to overrule it, and in any event I cannot do that too often if good relations are to continue in the Department.&rdquo; Does the Minister want to be put in that position?  Would it not be easier to say: &ldquo;Well and good, if you think you have met with injuries in the course of your duties as police officer, go to the courts, convince them that you have a case, get a decree, and I will pay&rdquo;?  From the Minister's point of view, that is a particularly suitable arrangement; it is not likely that there will be a tug-of-war between the Minister and the Department to prevent an applicant from going to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister might very well allow the courts to adjudicate in the whole matter.  The courts must adjudicate where the application is in respect of the death of a member of the Gárda Síochána.  Where the application is in respect of injuries sustained by a member of the Gárda Síochána that person cannot get to the courts.  His only hope is that the Minister may, in his own discretion, grant compensation, but, if the Minister elects to refuse compensation, that person has no further remedy, and cannot even have his case heard by the court.  I think the Minister might very well provide that the case should be dealt with by the courts in instances of personal injury. But if the Minister still wants to <Col N="2198" /> retain some of the machinery of Section 6, he ought to provide that, where he refuses to pay compensation, the aggrieved applicant would at some stage have the right to appeal to the courts against the Minister's decision, because one has got to remember all the time that the Minister is the defendant in this case, and he also sets himself up as the judge.  Obviously, the Department of Justice ought not to mix up the functions of a defendant with the functions of a judge, and that is what the Minister is doing in this case.  He appears as the defendant, and he acts as the judge.  He may, as defendant, decide as the judge that he is not going to pay compensation in such a case.  I should like the Minister to look into that matter with a view to remedying that very serious blemish in the Bill, a blemish which might very well be used unfairly on some future occasion.</P>
    <P>I observe from the Bill that it is to operate as from 1st January, 1940, and I am wondering whether those cases have arisen only since 1st January, 1940.  Were there any cases at all before that date, and, if there were, what does the Minister propose to do in those cases?  If the position is that we had cases before 1940 and have had other cases after 1940, what is the idea of drawing a line at 1st January, 1940, and saying: &ldquo;Before that date, you will get no compensation, but after that date you will get compensation&rdquo;? It seems to me that if there is a like case before 1940 it ought to get like treatment after 1940.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one small point which I should like to make, and it is a point which I think applies equally well to the ordinary Criminal Injuries Acts.  This Bill provides that compensation payable to the Guards will be paid out of the moneys of the Exchequer.  Let us assume that some person assaults a Guard and does him bodily injury to some extent, so that the Minister feels that the Guard is entitled to compensation.  That person is tried and convicted.  If that person is a substantial mark in law, I think he should be made liable for the compensation <Col N="2199" /> which the State has to pay to the Guard.  The very same thing arises in connection with the Criminal Injuries Acts.  Somebody burns a rick of hay.  The person whose rick is burned applies to the Circuit Court and gets an award against the county council.  The ratepayers pay the amount of the award.  Somebody is prosecuted and gets two months in jail, but otherwise he gets off scot free while the ratepayers pay the compensation. In a case where somebody assaults a Guard, and the Guard is awarded £500 compensation for injuries occasioned to him in the assault, if the person who is tried and convicted of that assault is a mark in law I do not see why the money should not be recovered from that person instead of being paid by the taxpayer.  It is entirely unreasonable if anybody, even a Deputy of this House, should assault a Guard and is a sufficient mark to be able to pay compensation in the ordinary way, that the taxpayers should have to pay for that person's wrong-doing.  I suggest that the Minister should put in some section in this Act to the effect that where persons, who are marks in law, are convicted of being guilty of the injury or death of a Guard, who was doing his duty, these persons should be made liable for the amount of compensation that the State will have to pay to the Guard, because if such a person commits that wrong I fail to see why he should not be made pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to repeat the arguments put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney about the provisions of Section 6, and I suggest to the Minister that the point raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, which I think appeals to every section of the House, can be met by the introduction in line 28, of sub-section (5) of Section 6, after the words &ldquo;in respect of,&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;injuries to the applicant or of the death of a deceased person.&rdquo;  That leaves it open to the applicant, whether the application for compensation is in respect of injuries or death&mdash;to himself in the one case or to his personal representative in the other <Col N="2200" />&mdash;to apply to the Minister to have the matter determined by a High Court judge.  I have no doubt that that would meet Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's case if, in every case of injuries and otherwise, it was left to the Guard himself whether he wanted the adjudication to be made by the Minister or by the High Court.  Personally, I think that the Minister himself would find it very much more convenient if there was an obligation upon him to refer every such case to the High Court.</P>
      <P>I do not share Deputy Norton's illusions about the Minister's incapacity to sin, because I regard him as being human like the rest of us, but whether it be he or his successor, I think you are in great danger if you leave the option of determination to the Minister, in cases which are very questionable, strong pressure may be brought to bear on the Minister, to decide the case himself <i>ad misericordiam</i> rather than in accordance with the terms of the Act.  He may be in the very embarrassing position that the Guard is anxious to have the Minister settle the case himself and that several influential people will come along and say: &ldquo;This Guard ought to be looked after, he is a decent fellow,&rdquo; and so on and so forth.  You can easily imagine the kind of representations that would be made, and the Minister, eventually, would feel constrained to give a very liberal interpretation to the Act.  We know what has happened with regard to the housing code.  Parliament thought that it was going to build houses for agricultural labourers, but we are now building houses for seamstresses and hotel keepers because the Minister made up his mind that &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; meant anybody in rural Ireland who was not a plutocrat. I think the same will apply to the interpretation of this Act if the Minister is constrained to determine whether a Guard has been injured in the course of his duty or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Volumes have been written in connection with cases under the Workmen's Compensation Act on that one point alone, as to whether an injury was sustained in the course of the applicant's duty or not.  The most extravagant interpretations have been <Col N="2201" /> given under that Act.  You will find such a case as that of a fellow cycling 25 miles away from his work and being entitled to compensation for an injury arising out of his employment on the ground that, at some time during the day, he intended to cycle towards the factory where he was working.  That, however, has all been worked out by careful codification in the courts, and it is a matter for lawyers to wrangle about.  If, however, it is possible for the courts so to extend the law, in the detached and invulnerable position of a judge, what hope has the Minister of giving anything like a judicial decision on a case brought before him for adjudication under this Act?  Every argument for granting liberal compensation will be strong, and every argument for protecting the public purse will be weak.  It will be represented that the sum claimed by the officer is trivial in comparison with the amount of the Budget, and that it is a criminal thing to leave an officer injured, or his relatives, in the event of his death, poor, because the Minister will not give a few hundred or a few thousand pounds to compensate him out of the £40,000,000 Budget.  Therefore, I suggest that, not only from the point of view of the Guards, but from the point of view of the Minister himself and his advisers, the duty of assessing damages in a matter of this kind should not be laid on the Minister but should be a matter for the courts.  If the Minister will insert the words I have suggested in sub-section (5) of Section 6 I think he will have gone the whole way to meet the representations that were made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. I would urge him to go even further and make it mandatory on himself to refer every application to the courts, leaving himself no discretion whatever to adjudicate such cases, and I think the Minister would be well advised to take my advice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton I think referred to the cases that have been already disposed of.  Will the Minister, when he is replying, make a short statement as to what is to be done about these cases?</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the matter raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as to the limiting of this Bill to actual members of the Gárda Síochána.  He has raised an objection to the power given to the Minister, by order, to include temporary police of another kind, or any person who may be acting as a police force for the time being.  I think that is a very objectionable thing, and it is a power that I think the Minister would rather not have.  I think it should be laid down in this Act that compensation in cases of this kind should apply to certain persons, and that the persons should be named or defined.  I would take it even further than that, and apply it to other than temporary police officers, because it would be possible that a civilian might get involved very seriously in a matter of this kind.  We can easily visualise a case where armed robbery would be taking place, and where a police officer in the course of his duty might be overpowered by armed men, and a civilian in the discharge of his duty to the State might go to the help of that police officer, and in the course of the affray lose his life or be badly maimed or injured. There is nothing in this Bill to help a man in a case of that kind, and I think the Bill should go a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a case recently in Dublin where some military officers, who were not on duty, went to the help of a policeman who was endeavouring to arrest armed people in a motor car.  Luckily, these officers did not suffer any injury, <Col N="2203" /> but they might have lost their lives. Then, in the County Leitrim, at the present time, we have the case of a military officer and a soldier being wounded by armed robbers, and this Bill does not apply to them.  Accordingly, I think the Minister should enlarge the powers under that section to include not only policemen, killed or wounded in the discharge of their duty, but persons of any kind coming to the help of a police officer in the discharge of his duty and helping him to enforce law and order.  I put it to the Minister that the Bill might be made a little more comprehensive in that regard, because a civilian at present has no right to claim compensation if he gets maimed or injured, or his dependents if he loses his life, in helping to enforce law or order or follow up the ends of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the last point, this Bill only deals with police officers. If such a case as the Deputy refers to does arise, I suppose it would have to be dealt with.  We are not attempting here to deal with any case except cases of actual whole-time members of the police force who are killed or injured in the discharge of their duties.  If other cases arise, they can be dealt with; but we are not proposing to do it here.  I do not propose to extend the Bill to include any case of that kind, but if such a case arose it can be dealt with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>By legislation if necessary. In this Bill we are simply dealing with the police force.  It is another day's work to deal with any other case.  On the point about the Minister fixing the amount of the award, the intention was, of course, that in well-established cases, which could be very easily settled, the Minister would award compensation.  But, as there has been objection taken to that, I will consider amending Section 6.  The intention was that difficult cases would be sent to the courts.  Of course, in any death case, if the next of kin wish, they can insist on going to the courts.  But it was thought that <Col N="2204" /> it would save expense and time in the case of ordinary injuries, where the facts were well known and there was no dispute, if it were left to the Minister. I do not think it is right to say that the Minister for Justice would be the defendant.  If any Minister were the defendant, it would be the Minister for Finance.  It would not be the Minister for Justice who would perhaps err on the side that Deputy Dillon mentioned; he would be likely to do it, if the Minister for Finance would allow him.  In all the circumstances, I suppose it is better to have the matter go to the court in its entirety and I shall have the Bill amended in that way.  It is a matter which we considered carefully, and we thought that in simple injury cases it would save time and expense.  We did not bring it in without thinking well over it.</P>

      <P>I would say so.  I examined this matter fully and I agreed that it would probably be better as it was, but, having heard the case made, I think it is better to let it go to the courts.  As to Section 13, I cannot see what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney objects to, because I do not think there is any likelihood of there being a second police force unless in some emergency situation like the one which exists at present.  The Taca Síochána were established by order under the Emergency Powers Act.  Unless you want to bring in a new Bill whenever this may happen again, I think this section is all right.  I do not think that is a very sound objection. As to Section 11, that means that, so <Col N="2205" /> far as the Gárda Síochána are concerned, the Grand Jury Act does not apply.  This is the Bill which will apply to them and the local authorities will not have to pay.</P>

They are taken out of the Grand Jury Act.  The only persons left in then would be magistrates or district justices if they were murdered or injured.  We are simply taking the Gárda Síochána out of it, and they will be dealt with under this Bill.  It does not repeal the Grand Jury Act. Deputy Norton asked about previous cases.  There was a previous case where the officer was married, and the court gave an award in that case.  There were some cases where there was a dispute about the amount of compensation given, where there were parents concerned.  They can be settled without legislation.  I believe they are being settled.  There are very few of them. The only case that I know of where there were dependents was the case of an officer who was murdered in Tipperary, and his widow was given compensation by the court.  The other case was settled.  There was a dispute between two Departments, and finally the matter was satisfactorily settled. There are a few outstanding small claims, but they will be adjusted, and they do not require legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It proposes to extend for a further period the time within which local elections are to be held.  Last year, owing to the conditions then prevailing, a similar course was adopted. The period of extension then fixed will expire on the 30th September next. Conditions are in many respects more serious than a year ago, particularly in regard to food and fuel supplies. At a time when everything possible is being done to increase supplies it would not be in the interest of the country to hold local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, while postponing the elections up to September, 1942, leaves it open to hold elections on a day in 1941, if that course should be decided upon before the close of the year.  It is thus necessary to define the position with regard to annual or first quarterly meetings in the year 1941.  The year 1941 is declared to be a year in which triennial elections are not held but if the appointed day were earlier than the 21st October next the portion of the year ending on the appointed day will be regarded as a year in which no triennial elections are held.  The effect of this provision is that the validity of the meetings held between 23rd June and 1st July of this year as annual or first quarterly meetings is established definitely.  If any local authority, on the assumption that the year 1941 was a year in which triennial elections <Col N="2208" /> would be held, did not hold an annual or first quarterly meeting during that time, the secretary or clerk of that local authority can now under the authority of Section 11 of the Local Elections Act, 1927, arrange for the holding of an annual or first quarterly meeting of the local authority on a convenient day.</P>

      <P>When discussing the Taoiseach's Estimate the other day and touching on the general dislocation of Government machinery, I referred to the attitude of mind of the Government implied by the suggestion that we were going to postpone local elections and a certain amount of objection was taken to some of the things I then said.  The present county councils have been in office for seven years.  An election was due in 1937, but it was postponed because there was a general election. When the postponement that year was discussed, the then Minister for Local Government indicated that, while he took power to postpone the elections for three years, it was not his intention to hold up the elections for the full period.  He agreed with Deputy Brennan who criticised the postponement that it was wise to hold these local elections at regular intervals and that the intervals should not be prolonged. It might have been the intention to hold elections in 1938, but, again in that year, there was a general election.  When we came to 1939 and 1940, we were discussing the Managerial Bill, and I take it that the Minister felt there was not much use in holding local elections until he had got his Managerial Bill through the House and was in a position to make the changes in local bodies entailed by the passage of that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the legislation bearing on the reconstruction of local councils and the introduction of the managerial system has now been passed, and we find ourselves in the middle of an emergency. The nature of that emergency has been referred to in various ways by different Ministers comparatively recently, and all kinds of administrative devices have been adopted to meet that emergency of one kind and another.  Speaking in Waterford, and reported in the papers <Col N="2209" /> of 28th June, the Minister for Supplies said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulties which face us are utterly appalling.  The public has been informed of it, but their full extent will not be understood until they are actually upon us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One part of the machinery which has been planned for use, if necessary, is the appointment of regional commissioners for different areas, the idea being that they will take over the general administration of Government, if the development of the emergency here brings about such conditions that the central Government will not be able to reach these areas.  Parish councils and committees of various kinds have been set up for the purpose of helping and showing the willingness of the people generally to help.  In the meantime, it has been found necessary to use some of the local machinery for production and in other ways.  The valuable assistance which can be given by local machinery through county engineers and surveyors is demonstrated in connection with the drive for the production of turf, and in connection with the general arrangements for evacuation in some of the reception areas, the valuable services which can be rendered by the county medical officer of health have been shown.  If there is any officer who can be equally useful, or even more useful, in circumstances in which communication with different parts of the country was difficult, there is the county secretary or county manager, but the very fact that it is necessary to fall back on that local machinery, the very fact that regional commissioners have been appointed, shows the necessity of having the ordinary local representatives elected in present circumstances and facing the emergency in an emergency spirit.</P>
    <P>The present councils have been seven years in office.  Hanging over them has been the sword not only of the elections but of the whole change in relation to the managerial system.  If there is to be any attempt to rally the people to face their problems, to get that closer touch with local machinery <Col N="2210" /> which will make it more effective, I submit that it is a great mistake to postpone these elections.  When I suggested that these elections should be held and that it was entirely wrong not to hold them, Deputy Corry said that I did not like to see the people united too long and that I wanted to see them cutting one another's throats in local elections.  He made the statement that he knew the kind of friendship there was between people, parties and factions in every parish after the local elections.  I asked what the people would be cutting one another's throats about and the only answer he could give was: &ldquo;In local elections, people say a terrible lot of nice things to one another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was surprised, however, to hear the Taoiseach following that up and asking if I were really serious.  He indicated that a partial election such as this&mdash;an election for local bodies&mdash; would be capable of all kinds of misrepresentation. He added:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy is not so foolish as not to know that you could not hold these elections without political malice coming in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the fact is that if you are going to have these elections you are going to have present-day politics brought into it, and the next thing would be the whole question about Government policy in every direction.  You know it cannot be stopped and we are simply in a dream world if we think it can.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think we are in a dream world, if we think we can face the difficulties of the emergency, even at their present standard, with our present arrangements.  If we are to run into the situation pictured for us by the statement of the Minister for Supplies, when he said, with regard to the difficulties, that the public had been informed of them but their full extent will not be understood until they are actually upon us; if we are to run into circumstances in which we shall have these regional commissioners working, and the local representatives whom <Col N="2211" /> they have to fall back on are people who have been in office for seven years, and who are under sentence of administrative death, due to the fact that they have run nearly three normal political lives, I say we are going to be utterly unprepared.</P>
    <P>It is the spirit of the whole thing that is more striking than anything else. The Government did not particularly invite the kind of co-operation which they got on the Defence Conference, but when it was suggested they accepted it. The country has made use of the spirit of that co-operation with very marked success, and there was a great strengthening of our position throughout the country.  While it is a fact that matters connected with national politics have been introduced into local government elections, and they have created, perhaps, the results that Deputy Corry spoke about, and what the Taoiseach says seems to be a fundamental fact in this country, it was political divisions not of an ordinary kind that dragged politics into local government machinery, into local government administration and into the general arena of local government.</P>
    <P>I think that if we do not face to-day the fact that we want our local bodies set up in the atmosphere of the present emergency to stand over their local problems and carry out local work in the effective way in which it must be carried out, and to be there to assist any divisional commissioner that circumstances may require to shoulder his responsibilities there, we are missing a tremendous opportunity.  I think the opportunity is a Heaven-sent one to hold our local elections this year in the spirit in which the emergency calls upon us to hold them, and we should cut out, as they ought to be cut out, all purely Party or political considerations in the matter of local administration.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I think the country deserves a chance to show that it can face its local problems without dragging the political divisions of the last 20 years across local discussions or into local administration.  In the second <Col N="2212" /> place, the very atmosphere of the present day makes it possible for the Government to appeal to all Parties to set up their councils now in the interests of local administration, pure and simple.  In the third place, it gives us local authorities with a definite mandate from the people, as distinct from a mandate that is seven years old, a mandate that is already old and withered, to deal with whatever arises in local administration or in the general public service in any special circumstances that may arise during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I think that in taking up this attitude the Government misjudge the country and they are losing a valuable opportunity of wiping out the artificial introduction of purely Party and political divisions into local government. They are depriving the country of giving a fresh mandate to those who are prepared to stand over local administration to-day.  A fresh mandate is badly wanted and I appeal to the Minister to drop the spirit or the implications of this Bill.  If you do not hold local elections this year, you are not likely to hold them until the emergency has passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not indicated whether, even assuming he persists in his intention not to hold the elections, he is going to put the managerial system into operation.  I should like to emphasise once more that the opportunity is there, and the need is there to take that opportunity, and I believe the Minister will find that he will get as big a response from every Party in the country as he could expect and he will get vigorous and live local bodies returned at the election, whether they are 95 per cent. of the present people or not.  Even if they were 95 per cent. of the present people, I believe they would be in a better position to stand up to their work than the people who got their mandate seven years ago.  I urge the Minister to drop the implications of the present Bill and he should appeal to the country to face the local government elections this year in the spirit that I suggest and for the purpose I mention.</P>

      <P>Parish councils will also be expected to help him, and how the local elections would assist the parish councils to operate, I do not know. There are many reasons, to my mind, why local elections should not be held this year.  I should like to have a guarantee from Deputy Mulcahy that there would be no Party politics introduced into the elections.  I should like to see local elections held without any Party politics being introduced, without any political slogans.  Unfortunately, our experience has been that it is not possible to hold local elections without Party politics being introduced. If we could guarantee elections without Party politics being brought into them, then I would be very much in favour of the holding of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see how you could have that.  I can see several things arising out of the holding of any elections at the present time.  I should like to know if Deputy Mulcahy, in his fervour for local elections, has considered the question of by-elections to fill vacancies in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit different.  If you think you would not have Party politics introduced into local elections, you could also think on the same lines of not having Party politics introduced into by-elections for the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>By-elections for this House would be for the purpose of carrying on national work, whereas local elections would be concerned with purely local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>And the administration of national work affects local elections very much, as the Deputy well knows. There are many reasons, from the point of view of the people who live in the rural areas, why the local elections should not be held.  Apart from other <Col N="2215" /> reasons, we have a great shortage of fuel, we have no lighting and we have no transport whatever.  In that situation we know that 25 per cent.  of the people who live in the urban areas would, in the event of the local elections being held, be able to get full control of all the county councils, if they so wished.  They would have no difficulty in doing so owing to lack of transport.  In addition, there might be a great lack of public interest if the local elections were held.  You would probably have from 15 to 20 per cent. of the people voting.  That would be very unfortunate from the point of view of our democratic institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better than throttling the people and denying them the right to elect new public bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be far more damaging to our democratic institutions to have local elections held in the circumstances I have described. We remember the Seanad election which was held in which only 5 per cent of the people voted.  There were no more Seanad elections held on the basis laid down for that particular one. The rural areas, as I have said, would not get fair representation if the elections were held at the present time. Even if a by-election were held for this House, I would be afraid that the opinions of rural dwellers would not be properly recorded at it.  In fact, I do not think that, I am convinced of it.  I am sure that the members of the local authorities are sick and tired, and would be glad if elections were held from the point of view of letting other people come along and take over the responsibilities that they have held so long.  I would welcome elections myself for that reason alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there is any reason why the Minister should not operate the Managerial Act and the other local government measure, which is at present before the Seanad, through the old councils.  I think many of them would welcome the putting into operation of these measures.  The Minister would have a better chance of operating <Col N="2216" /> the Managerial Act with the help of the old councils than he would with new councils, because the former have a good knowledge of local administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What I say is that the members of the old councils have a better knowledge of local administration than the members of the new councils could be expected to have. My main objection to the holding of the local elections is that the rural community could not possibly get a fair opportunity of recording their views in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from Deputy Allen that his contention is that the rural community would not get fair representation on the new councils mainly because of the lack of transport; that the people in the towns, who would be convenient to the polling booths, would vote 100 per cent., and would, therefore, capture representation on all the new councils?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best thing that could happen to this country would be that there should be a complete lack of transport at every election, local and general, and further that the sending out of cars to take people to the polling booths should be made a criminal offence.  It is ridiculous to suggest that people living in the rural districts are not interested enough, even in this time of emergency, to go out and vote if the local elections were held.  I think that the sending of cars for voters should be made a criminal offence.  If the Government were to introduce legislation to that effect to-morrow it would probably hurt them more than it would hurt me.  Deputy Allen said that the present members of local bodies were sick and tired and that they would welcome the holding of the elections.  They are not half as tired as the people who elected them are for having put them where they are.</P>

      <P>When the Managerial Act and the Local Government Bill that is now before the Seanad were under discussion in the Dáil I pleaded with the Minister that, unless they were going to be put into operation during the emergency, they ought to be held back until such time as they could get a calm consideration.  I said they should not be passed in an atmosphere of political uncertainty.  Now we have Deputy Allen making the case that both these measures ought to be operated by the Minister through the old councils.  I do not think that would be a good plan.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Allen or with the Tánaiste or Deputy Corry that it was ever necessary to introduce politics into the local elections.  Deputy Allen asks how they are going to be kept out.  The Government was responsible for introducing them into local councils, and now it is being hoist on its own petard.  The present Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Local Government, said that politics ought to be introduced into the local elections and that the new Fianna Fáil Government wanted them.  That statement is on the records of the House.</P>

      <P>Of course we had to when the then Minister for Local Government, from the benches opposite, advised that politics should be introduced.  His reason&mdash;possibly, it is reasonable enough&mdash;was, as he said, that they wanted their Party on every county council to carry out their instructions. In view of that, I do not see how the Government can go out now and say that there should be no Party politics.  They were responsible for introducing politics into local councils. If the Government were to go back on that now it would mean that they would have to break up their caucus meetings and the jobocracy that they have established in the country. That is what you have going on in the country.  We do not want politics in the local bodies.</P>

I do not think that the kind of administration we have at the moment is worth preserving.  Therefore, I say that if we have a chance of holding the local elections we ought to go ahead with them.  I believe that, even in the present emergency, the people might be allowed to elect new councils.  We have had a Defence Conference set up, and in the spirit of that Defence Conference I think very much good has been done in this country.  Considering that we have passed so much new legislation, I do not think it is fair to the country not to put that legislation into operation, <Col N="2219" /> and I do not think it is fair not to put it into operation in regard to the local authorities.  If you go into any of the recent transactions of the local authorities, it will be seen that those people are becoming stale.  They have become more open about doing things that they would not do in their earlier years in regard to looking for jobs for members' wives and people like that. That is something which should be ended, and we should take this opportunity to end it.</P>

      <P>When I mentioned here last year, in reply to a query, I think, from Deputy Dillon, that it was proposed to hold the elections, both Deputy Brennan and Deputy Dillon held up their hands in horror at the prospect of holding elections in this emergency period.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Brennan expressed his disapproval of my bringing in here the Local Government Bill, because he said that during this crisis Deputies could not give it the concentrated consideration which it required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I may state straight off that both last year and this year I have been anxious to get the elections held.  I was particularly anxious to get them held this year if I saw that there was any possibility of holding them. When the Managerial Bill was going through, and when asked whether it was my intention to put it into operation without an election, if Deputies will look it up they will find that I said: &ldquo;It is not my present intention to put the Managerial Bill into operation without an election.&rdquo;  I had various reasons for that view.  It was introducing to other parts of the country a system that was in operation in the cities.  It was introducing a system with which perhaps some members of public bodies down the country were not familiar, and not being <Col N="2220" /> familiar with it I could conceive a considerable amount of objection to it by existing members of boards.</P>
      <P>It was indicated by some members in this House that, to put it mildly, there would be no assistance in letting it work.  Some Deputies on the Labour benches expressed that view.  With those views expressed I thought&mdash;and I hold still&mdash;that the best method of ensuring the success of the managerial system was to have new elections, where the candidates going up know what their powers will be, and will come in as members of the council prepared to carry out the powers with which they have been vested.  It has now come to the point where, personally, I do not see how you could hold the elections.  I welcome the views expressed here as to trying to eschew politics in local bodies if that were possible.  It may be possible at some time; I do not see that it can happen now.  No matter what Government you have, and no matter what Opposition leaders say about trying to eschew politics in local elections, you will have them springing up here and there through the country, and a good deal of harm can be done in that way. People through the country who were more in touch with events than I have been, or could be, view this thing with considerable alarm as to the dangers that may be inherent in it.  That is their view.  Whether the dangers are there or not, there is always the possibility of them.</P>

      <P>That is somebody else's affair.  So far as I am concerned, I would not take responsibility for putting through a measure here that may in any way create any danger of disunity at the present time.  We may <Col N="2221" /> criticise some boards, and we may criticise some public bodies, but I do believe that at the present time you would have a very small poll.  If we want to have elections, I suppose nobody would suggest that we should have them before October.  You would be up against the difficulty of transport at that time.  For a good many years now people have been in the habit of being conveyed to the polls, and I do not think we should get the idea which Deputy Linehan has in mind that they will walk miles to get there.  I do not see how you would work up an interest in elections at the present time. People are not thinking on those lines.</P>

      <P>It has been said that people were voting in the dark, but they would certainly be voting in the dark that day.  If you held the elections in October, there would be shortage of light and shortage of transport. It is perfectly true that, even if you could work up an interest in them, the only place you would get any voting at all is in the urban areas where people are convenient to the polls.  I do not think it could be suggested that they ought to be held at an earlier period, when you would be taking people <Col N="2222" /> away from their work in the fields and on full production.  Although there may be only one polling day, there is also all this canvassing which goes on beforehand, and in a small poll I do not think you are going to get good representation.  I am afraid there are elements that would take advantage of that.  With a very small poll you may get elements&mdash;I will not say undesirable elements&mdash;that will not be any better than any we have there already.</P>

      <P>Before the Committee proceeds to consider the Money Resolution perhaps it would be advisable to state that I have informed Deputy Mulcahy of my decision to rule out certain amendments&mdash;Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 14, 19 to 24, 27, 28, 31 to 35, and 39&mdash;on the ground that they seek to extend the compensation terms of the Bill and would thus impose a statutory charge on the Exchequer.  In respect to three or four border-line amendments I shall give Deputies the benefit of the doubt.  Three of the amendments tabled by Labour Deputies would be more appropriate to a Landlord and Tenant Bill.  Owing to the special circumstances and to the fact that there is no prospective legislation to that effect I intend to permit those amendments to be moved.</P>

      <P>In regard to consequential damage, I propose to move an amendment which would have the effect of enabling payment of a sum not exceeding £30 for consequential losses arising out of the necessity to move out of a house and the cost that would be incurred by doing so.  Before Section 20, it is proposed to insert a new section to meet points raised by Deputy Benson in regard to town planning of sites where bombing had taken place.  These are the main amendments.  There are some minor amendments which will be explained as we go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to discuss the point the Minister makes in regard to consequential damage.  I am glad, at any rate, that the Minister accepts the principle of consequential loss in respect of the provision of alternative <Col N="2226" /> housing, the removal and storage of articles of furniture, and alternative accommodation for business.  Is the Minister not aware, however, that in the Donore Avenue area, where damage took place in January, there are houses to which families are not yet able to return?  We are now coming on to August.  If anybody was carrying on business in the way mentioned by Deputy Byrne the other day, it is fantastic to think that £30 is anything like adequate to cover the out-of-pocket expense of a person so affected. Again, I think the Minister cannot ask the House to accept the principle that because people get £30 they must be satisfied to be saddled with an increased load of debt by reason of the fact that this affliction has fallen upon them.  I gave the Minister some cases that were only up to date, say last week or so.  In one case I pointed out that the alternative housing accommodation for three months had cost the person £27, plus £7 10s. rates; that the removal and storage of the furniture had cost £24.  Now £30 in relation to that expenditure is not the kind of thing that we would be expected to agree upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case I mentioned was where a flat had to be taken at £1 5s. a week over a period of six months. The greater part of the furniture had to be stored and the cost was something like £37.  I think the Minister will have to raise the limit of £30 in such cases, because each one of these cases will be examined by very careful and exact machinery and all the expenditure will not only require to be vouched for, but I am sure it will have to be substantiated that it was necessary. I think it is a frightful blemish on the Bill when you take ordinary residents who are not the owners of the property and perhaps are just trying to hang on in present circumstances and maintain their families.  These are the more numerous cases.  These are the people who are affected by consequential losses running along the lines I speak of.  By far the greater number of people require this consequential damage provision in order to cover them for the monetary losses which will be a substantial part of their <Col N="2227" /> losses.  I am sure the Minister will be persuaded to leave out that £30 and examine all those cases on their merits. Apart from the fact that this damage was done by other people, to whom we are looking to make good that damage, if there never was any chance of any of that money being recovered, I think we would show a lack of understanding of those people and their conditions and problems of life if we did not see that this consequential loss was covered to the full extent to which it reasonably should be covered.</P>

      <P>This makes the situation even worse.  We are now faced, under the ruling of the Chair, with this situation, that a Bill has been brought in and there will be no estimate whatever of the cost to the Exchequer of even its limited provisions. It is, therefore, not possible to come to any conclusion as to what would be the increase thrown on the State by the acceptance of more liberal conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a Bill, the outstanding characteristic of which to anybody reading it is that it represents a meagre way of dealing with a catastrophe, and that meagre way of dealing with a particular catastrophe is enshrined in a Bill which would definitely limit the burden upon the State, because the whole suggestion of the Bill is that it is to be limited to such damage as may accrue to property, while the State is not at war.  One could imagine the State finding it a difficult matter to make any sort of liberal provision ahead for the damage that might be caused by a bombing attack on this city, if it were subjected to air attack while at war, but in the limited circumstances of the type of accidental damage to property that may happen while the State is not at war, while it is still neutral, the Government puts it in the way that consequential damage, with the exception of this £30, is ruled out, and, under the ruling of the Chair, we cannot move to exclude that £30 as the higher limit, because that would be regarded as imposing a burden on the State.  We cannot even seek to impose the costs of court applications, under the ruling we have got from the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The really ghoulish feature of the whole thing&mdash;and one can at once see the Civil Service hand in it&mdash;is that if the Minister, when doling out compensation on a limited scale to people who have suffered the misfortune of having their houses destroyed, finds a debt owing to some State Department, he is going to whack out of the compensation that debt, although, if the property remained, the Minister would <Col N="2229" /> have no resort against it.  He is taking advantage of a catastrophe in which people have their property destroyed to liquidate State debts by these people before they are put back even into what is a near approach&mdash;and it is not much of a near approach&mdash;to the position in which they stood previously. It is all done in an atmosphere in which we do not know how much it is going to cost, but it is definitely limited to such damage as may accrue while we are still neutral. I could have understood the Minister if he had said: &ldquo;This is an appalling sum&rdquo;, but, in the conditions this year, in which we have so far outrun our resources that the Minister is forced to come in here with the situation with regard to borrowing which he described in his Budget statement, although he has discovered a certain amount of profiteering in the State, he throws back £500,000 to the people whose books, on examination, had shown that they were making substantial profits out of the war situation, and would not cash in on that, even for the purpose of doing justice to the poor people whose property and homes were destroyed by reason of these accidental bombings.  The thing reflects no credit on the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this feature to the Minister.  In this House we are incurably addicted to approaching matters of this kind <i>in globo</i>, which I think is an unhealthy thing to do. There is a kind of a saw that you cannot legislate for the exceptional case, and that is used for the purpose of persuading this House to turn its eyes away from the practical aspect of the question, and to take the Civil Service viewpoint which looks at everything from the point of view of the Exchequer. I want to ask what would any individual Deputy do if a bomb fell on his house in the morning, and he was obliged to take a flat or rent a house for himself, his wife and his children and pay rent he had not got, until such time as his resources and his ability to borrow were exhausted, and if he were then offered £30 wherewith to pay the debts he had contracted in order to keep a roof over his head, <Col N="2230" /> never mind to make provision for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like each Deputy to ask himself what would he do in those circumstances.  Would he go to the matron of the South Dublin Union and say: &ldquo;You take the wife and kids, and I will go into the men's section&rdquo;?  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Finance is a heartless and cruel man who wants to see all these people go into the South Dublin Union.  What I am putting to him is that he is allowing his influence to be unduly swayed by the classical Exchequer approach to problems of this kind. I do not think this is a problem that we, as a community, can afford to approach from the Exchequer point of view.  I think we have to ask ourselves what would each of us do if a bomb fell on our particular house.  I know that I should feel that I was betrayed by my neighbours if I met that catastrophe and was involved in very substantial expenditure, far beyond the capacity of my means to meet, and was then told: &ldquo;They are going to give you £30,&rdquo; whether that approximated to my outlay or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we ought to ask ourselves why we are introducing this Bill at all.  The reason we are introducing the Bill is that, in the ordinary organisation of the State, the individual citizen has the right to demand of the Government that it will protect him from casual lawbreakers within the community, and that it will vindicate the right of the citizen of Éire against any external aggressor.  If the casual wrong-doer assails you, the Guards arrest him and he is brought to court and punished in accordance with the law, or his goods or property are made liable for the damage done.  You are compensated in that way, and the State sees that you get your compensation. Circumstances may arise in which damage is done by an external evil-doer or an external negligent person, and the State says: &ldquo;We <Col N="2231" /> recognise that you have a claim against that person, but it is not a claim which, in all the circumstances, we deem it expedient to enforce at present.  That does not mean that we are going to renege on our duty to you. We will take over that external misfeasor's liability, and, rather than go to the trouble of enforcing your rights against him, we will make ourselves liable for any damage you have suffered, and pay you whatever is due to you.&rdquo;  Then it seems to me that the measure of what we ought to pay the injured party is the measure of the claim that we would be <i>bona fide</i> prepared to stand over, if he lodged it with an external aggressor or misfeasor.</P>
    <P>In that connection, we have to bear in mind that if we are making claims against the British or German Governments, we would be very willing to send forward a claim which was on the generous side on behalf of a citizen of the State, believing that, in the course of negotiations, it would be whittled down.  I do not think it would be reasonable to ask our Government to pay these suffering people on the basis of the limit that we would allow them to claim against a foreign Government.</P>
    <P>I think you have to make up your mind what figure you would have a falling-out about with a foreign Government, and should say: &ldquo;That is what we will pay our own people.  We would like to be generous, if we could afford it, but the future is so uncertain that we cannot afford to be more than just.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance says he does not know what this is going to cost, and I have a certain sympathy with him, because we have no guarantee that accidents or injuries of this kind will not occur in future.  While, God knows, the North Strand was bad enough, we might wake up any morning to discover that two or three streets have been destroyed and, instead of 30 or 35 people being killed, we might have 50 or more dead, and we would then be faced with the problem of making provision to meet the losses sustained.</P>
    <P>We ought to consider carefully what <Col N="2232" /> compensation would be adequate to meet the losses sustained by the people in this particular instance.  We are purchasing immunity at the expense of their claim to full compensation against the person who injured them, whoever that may have been.  That being so, surely we ought at least to be just?  I do not think the Minister will argue that £30 is a just figure.  He may say: &ldquo;It is the most that I think it is right to offer in all the circumstances,&rdquo; but I do not think he would say that it is a just figure.  We ought, so long as we are able&mdash;and we are still able&mdash;to offer a just figure.</P>
    <P>It could happen that we would be confronted with such a bill of damages hereafter that we would be barely able to keep these people afloat, but if we are now able to offer them a just figure, we ought to give it to them.  If the Minister has to come in here following a subsequent disaster&mdash;which, God forbid&mdash;we may have to reconsider the whole position, but while we still have what will give these people justice, how will anyone argue against giving it to them?  I shall be glad if the Minister will address himself to this question.</P>
    <P>I admit that this business of consequential damage is an extremely difficult and dangerous one and, if the Minister accepts Deputy Mulcahy's amendments in principle, I expect there will have to be some midnight oil burnt in order to arrive at a suitable statutory definition of consequential damage which will be applicable to these cases, and we shall have to have an agreed formula for that which the courts will use.  But do not go to the people who suffered in this horrible disaster and in their distress and misery and perplexity say to them: &ldquo;Although you are in debt and have lost your home, although your prospects are hopelessly jeopardised as a result of this catastrophe, here is £30 and be glad to get it.&rdquo;  I do not believe anyone of us would want to do that and I think the Minister would be well advised to face the problem of defining consequential damage explicitly in the Bill, leaving it to the judges to determine what would be bare justice.</P>
    <P>Let us make up our minds that, for <Col N="2233" /> the present, in any case, we cannot contemplate offering anything more than bare justice.  If we come safely through all this business and do not suffer heavier losses, it might be possible to do something more for those people when the clouds roll by but, in the meantime, we should endeavour to do them bare justice as long as we are able.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am almost nervous when I stand up here after reading this Bill and the motion that has been submitted.  Deputy Dillon has asked for bare justice for these people.  May I say that at the present moment the victims are not getting bare justice, and I appeal to the Minister to enlarge the measure that he has presented to us?  The people in that area have suffered very great hardships.  To-day there are numbers of them unemployed. They have been shifted into cottages by the corporation, but they are unable to pay the rents of those cottages.  Some of them have been only five or six weeks in the cottages and already they have been informed that they are five or six weeks in arrears with their rent. That is largely due to the fact that they are in receipt of a State allowance of only 24/- a week, and out of such a small allowance men with four and five in a family cannot afford to pay 11/6 or 12/- for a cottage and pay for the electric light and other things over and above that.  They have many payments to meet out of the miserable pittance of 24/- a week that they get from the State by way of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one reads this measure one sees the narrowness of the outlook of those who prepared it.  There is nothing in it to give consolation to any of the victims, the unfortunate people who experienced such terrible hardships.  I should like the Minister and those who prepared the Bill to look at the problem in a bigger way.  They should try to do a little more than bare justice for those people.  The people who suffered so much deserve the sympathy of the whole country.  For a week or two they got that sympathy, but some of them did not get very much bread and butter.  I think it is a shame the way <Col N="2234" /> they have been treated.  Some of them have lost their means of living.  I know of some people who lost their tools, and they could not get the price of new tools from any source.  In that way they were deprived of an opportunity of earning their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I am terribly disappointed with this measure.  On the question of personal injuries, we do not know yet what the Minister is going to do for those who have suffered or are in hospital.  Many people were maimed and they are in hospital to-day and they do not know what their prospects are when they come out of hospital.  I will make special reference to one case, that of a girl who is in hospital.  The Minister should try to see her before she leaves hospital and perhaps it will induce him to enlarge the terms of this Bill in order adequately to compensate her and other people for the damage done to them.</P>

      <P>There is no question of Party in the matter.  I was struck by one word that Deputy McGilligan used when he talked of the ghoulish aspect of this.  The practice of looking up precedents is not confined to this Government.  When a precedent was being looked for for this Bill it was found in the 1923 Act.  The ghoulish section that Deputy McGilligan refers to is in that Act.  When it was going through the Dáil in 1923 it was defended on every stage by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been referred to as a ghoulish section was introduced into the 1923 Act which I regard as the foundation Act.  As I have said the 1923 Act was introduced by Deputy Cosgrave, and that particular section was defended by him.  That is no reflection on Deputy Cosgrave and my reference to the matter is not to be taken in that sense at all.  I think that Deputy McGilligan's reference was somewhat misplaced.  With regard to what has been said from the other side I, too, would like to be generous.  But, as Minister for Finance, I believe that all this money will have to be paid by Irish citizens, and I do not know where we are going to get it.  Perhaps some day we may get compensation, but I am going on the basis that the money will have to come out of the citizens' pockets.  As I said the other day, my early training <Col N="2237" /> in public life made it necessary for me to be scrupulously careful about every penny of public money.  I had often to deal with finance.  If it were a question of my own money, I could do what I liked with it, but in my position as Minister for Finance, where I am dealing with public money, I must fight for the interests of the ratepayer or the taxpayer with all the strength that is in me.  I try to do that.  I do not want to be unjust or unfair.  I cannot, as Minister for Finance, afford to be generous.  That is my position. I would like to be just as Deputy Dillon asked me to be.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill the other day Deputy Cosgrave admitted that there are bound to be extravagant claims made.  You will have claims made that will be out of all reason.  I do not know what the position would be if we were to make ourselves responsible for consequential damage.  It is a very wide term, and I do not know how we would define or restrict it.  The lawyers might be able to do it.  I could not attempt to do it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows how the courts decided in similar cases under the 1923 Act.  The courts under the 1923 and 1933 Acts gave reports that were not regarded by the Government of the day as fair decisions, and the amounts reported for were not paid.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not know that the result was that the 1923 Act was twice amended?  The Government first of all added a 10 per cent. all round increase as a gift, as they were convinced that the original amount was too low.  The second amendment was a wise provision.  It provided for a remission of rates for a seven-year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>But the last Government never gave way on the provision dealing with consequential damages.  I believe there is a case for doing something, but my difficulty is how to keep it within measurable limits.  I have told Deputy McGilligan what the cost of this is likely to be, even at the present stage.  We do not know what this Bill is going to involve us in, because, as Deputy Dillon said, if the same thing were to happen again, the figure might be a very big one.  At any rate, whatever the sum is going to be, the bill that we will have to bear may be a very big one.  As Minister for Finance, what I am doing in this measure is to try to meet the <Col N="2239" /> cases that have occurred of war damage to property.  With regard to consequential damage, in the beginning I was afraid to face it.  I took courage when I found out that it was ruled out under the 1923 Act.  Arguments similar to those made here to-day by Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy McGilligan, and Deputy Dillon were advanced when the 1923 Bill was going through, but the Government of the day resisted them.  I have read over the debates and know what was said.  I am prepared to go somewhat further on the matter, but I honestly fear for the Exchequer if we were to say that we would accept the principle of consequential damage and let the courts decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has relied, to a large extent, on the 1923 Act.  I have certain scruples with regard to it in retrospect.  As I have already indicated, that Act was amended twice because there was a recognition that an injustice had been done under the original Act.  The 1923 Act was passed in a time of widespread damage.  If this was a measure to deal with damage to property done during a period when the State was at war, and if claims for widespread damage had to be met, you would have the position of people taking money into one pocket and paying it out of the other &mdash;a sort of scuffle in which people were receiving and paying out at the same time.  The situation with which we are faced now is that of a limited class.  I suggest that the feeling throughout the country with regard to that limited class is that those who have escaped are so glad to have escaped that they would not regard any financial sacrifice, in income-tax or otherwise, as being too great, in order to put this limited number of people back in the position in which they were.  I think the populace have a liberal mind far outstripping that of the Government. I think they would put those people back in the position in which they were, even though it would mean that a roof which would have lasted for only 30 years will be replaced by a new roof which will last for 100 years.  People <Col N="2240" /> are not going to be so meticulous about compensating somebody who has had an unfortunate accident.  I can guarantee for this Party, and I think I can guarantee for the House, that if the Minister made this a liberal measure, putting those people back into the position in which they were, so far as the courts can discover it, and flanking this measure with an addition to the Finance Bill imposing new financial burdens on the country, they would accept it, for the reason that there was an unfortunate group of people who got hit in two or three bombing accidents, and there may be others, and those who escaped from that do really feel that they owe it to the people who have been unfortunate enough to be hit that they should be put back in the position in which they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to consequential damage, with those limited objectives that he has in his amendment, and the £30 limit.  That really will not go any distance to meet those cases. The Minister refuses to add compensation in regard to chattels.  I take it the phrase here really means chattels of any description.  It is put down as jewellery, coin and articles of personal ornament.  I suppose that is intended to cover clothing.  It is going to be very hard to get a strict definition of consequential damage.  But suppose he does not advert to consequential damage at all except by that phrase, throwing the burden on the applicant to show what were his losses, and providing that unless he established it to the satisfaction of the court then the court will give him no compensation. There is also the principle with regard to the remoteness of damage. I think the impression of the average citizen who has been through the mill with regard to ordinary running-down accidents is that the courts have a rather narrow and restricted view as to what are the consequential damages that have to be added to the special damage which a person suffers.  The Minister need have no great fear that the courts are going to ladle out public money in that way.  If anything, I think it will be found&mdash;I do not speak from a professional point of view&mdash;that the people who have been through the mill <Col N="2241" /> have not got the impression that the courts are liberal.</P>
    <P>I now come to what I regard as a ghoulish suggestion; I do not care who started it.  In effect, you are going to say to those people in the North Strand or Donore Avenue that they are in this position: that if any of them had owed a debt to the Revenue Commissioners they have to invite the Revenue Commissioners to come down and take a bit of the roof.  You are doing that in another way.  The roof is worth a certain amount in cash.  They will not get the amount of cash required to put it back; you are going to take a little bit off because somebody owes a debt to the Revenue Commissioners. Let the Minister say he is more liberal than the Government he has so often criticised ever thought of being, and let him take that to himself for virtue, and we will applaud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been somewhat surprised at the extraordinary terror which the expression &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo; appears to inspire in the minds and hearts of departmental officials and of the Minister for Finance.  One would imagine that the question of consequential loss is one that is very seldom met with or dealt with by our courts.  I would say that this bogey of consequential loss exists almost exclusively and entirely in the minds of civil servants in the Department of Finance.  Twelve ordinary jurors of the City of Dublin during every term in every year deal with consequential loss as a matter of routine, and find no difficulty whatever in doing it.  There is no running-down case that is heard by an ordinary jury in the City of Dublin in which the jury is not called upon, as a matter of fulfilling the oath which they take, to assess compensation on the basis of consequential loss. Every person who is injured through the negligence of the driver of a motor car is entitled as of right at the hands of a jury to get compensation for the consequential lossess sustained by reason of the injury inflicted on him through the negligence of that driver. The general principle of all compensation is very clearly defined in our courts.  It is a matter of routine to <Col N="2242" /> lawyers ordinarily practising in the courts.  The general principle of compensation is that a person who is damaged by the wrong of another is entitled to be put back, so far as money can do it, in the same position in which he was before the injury was occasioned to him.  That phrase which I have used is used by counsel in every running-down case where they appear for the plaintiff.  The jurors are told that that is their duty in assessing damages, and that that is the principle upon which they are to act.  When a plaintiff appears in court asking for damages for injuries sustained by him in consequence of the negligence of a driver, 12 ordinary jurymen of the City of Dublin assess consequential loss without the slightest difficulty. Men who have no legal experience, men who perhaps have never sat in a jury box in their lives before do what is admitted, after the experience we have had of jurors, to be substantial justice between plaintiff and defendant.  In my experience, and I have had considerable experience, there has never been a case of a successful appeal from the award of a jury based on the award of too much damages for consequential loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the methods by which the damages are put to the jury is by asking: &ldquo;What has the man suffered?&rdquo; If a farmer is knocked out for six or 12 months, we have evidence given that he had to employ a man to do his work, that he lost so much crops, and that in consequence he lost so much profit.  Those 12 jurymen&mdash;even city men, as they may be very often, dealing with loss sustained by a farmer by reason of the negligence of a driver of a motor car&mdash;have no difficulty whatever in assessing the proper compensation that has to be paid, and in doing justice between all parties.  That is consequential loss&mdash;the loss which a man sustains by being deprived of the opportunity of earning his living; the wages he has lost if he is a workman; the amount of profits he would have made in his business if he is a business man; the amount of fees he would have earned in the period during which he was incapacitated, if he is a professional man.  Those matters which <Col N="2243" /> I have mentioned are matters that come within the ordinary common experience of even junior barristers during those cases in the Circuit Courts and even in the District Courts.  Consequential loss is assessed by our courts daily, and there is never a word about it.  There is no fuss about it. The bogey has been raised in the minds of the departmental officials, and in the mind of the Minister for Finance&mdash;I would say successive Ministers for Finance&mdash;about the appalling amount of money that is going to be poured out as compensation for consequential loss.  The principles of damage are well recognised in our law.  Judges have not the slightest difficulty about them.  Counsel appearing in those cases have known the principles about assessing compensation from the time they were very young students.  The law has been settled for the last 100 years.  It has been adopted and carried over in our Constitution here, and everybody knows it.  There is no trouble whatever about it.</P>
    <P>The door is not wide open, in the cases that are brought into our courts daily, for a flood of gold to be poured into the pockets of some person who comes in seeking to get compensation for an injury that happened to him, although daily, in our courts, consequential loss is claimed and given.  I do suggest to Deputies that if twelve jurors in the City of Dublin, or twelve farmers in the country, sitting at the Circuit Court, are capable of assessing, as they do assess frequently during the year, consequential loss as between private individuals, there is no reason why our Circuit Court judges or our High Court judges should not be properly able to assess consequential loss in cases of this kind. As I said, at the start, I was surprised at this discussion, and it appeared to me to be entirely unreal because the principles of compensation are so well settled here that there is no possible danger, in a just case, of any injury being done to the taxpayers in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister does not expect the House to accept his general statement with regard to <Col N="2244" /> his conscience, in relation to the expenditure of public money, as an adequate explanation of the numerous deficiencies in the Bill in respect of payment for consequential loss and payment for property not included in the schedule to the Bill.  For instance, take the case of a trader who has lost his business and who feels that he has a right to claim a certain amount of compensation for the loss of goodwill. Surely, in a case of that kind, the Minister could base the compensation payment on the compensation provisions in the Acquisition of Land Act of 1919. Furthermore, might I say that in the case of property such as jewellery and so forth, which very often may be of considerable value and which, in many cases, has been insured, the Minister has readily available to him a method of assessing the value of such articles? It seems to me altogether unjust that the Minister is not prepared to take these matters into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that I should like to raise at this stage.  The average owner of property may not be a very wealthy person, and seeing that the Bill merely provides for the payment of compensation at the market value of such property, that person may not be able to afford any extra expense of rebuilding if the local authority should step in and insist on the new building following certain specifications. In the event of property of that kind being destroyed, the local authority may step in and insist that the new building be according to certain specifications that would involve an expenditure of, perhaps, £200 or £300 in excess of the market value of the property.  The owner of that property may be altogether unable to raise that amount of money to rebuild, and in the case of a person like that the provision for compensation that is laid down in the Bill is purely illusory.  The Minister ought to make up his mind to make such provisions in this Bill as will ensure that claims for compensation will be dealt with on their merits.  Surely, that is a reasonable request and a reasonable way to go about awarding compensation. It is no earthly use telling us about the Minister's conscience in <Col N="2245" /> regard to the expenditure of public money.  Nobody doubts that the Minister is very careful so far as the expenditure of public money is concerned, but that is no explanation or excuse at all for such a Bill as this which is teeming with so many deficiencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister said, that the prohibition against compensation for consequential loss was introduced into the Damage to Property Act of 1923, but I think that the reason, or one of the reasons, why it was introduced into that Act was that there was a legal controversy before that time as to how far the court assessing compensation could go, under the old code, in making the award.  I think it was in order to put an end to that controversy that there was that prohibition against consequential loss.  The position at the present time, however, is entirely different.  I think that the persons who have been injured in these cases, either in their property or in their lives, are entitled to the fullest possible measure of compensation, and a very large part of that measure of compensation, of necessity, must come under what is familiarly referred to as consequential loss.  In my opinion, it is possible that the actual damage to bricks and mortar, in some cases, may be quite small as compared with the consequential loss sustained.  There is no doubt that the inclusion of compensation for consequential loss would involve a fairly large amount in most cases, but it can be defined in various ways, as, in fact, it has been defined in the Minister's amendment where compensation is to be paid in certain cases up to a limit of £30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that these people who will be seeking compensation now are entitled to the fullest possible measure of compensation, and we hope that they will be treated generously. Let us hope that there will not be any more such damage before the end of the present hostilities, but of course we have to look to the future, as we do not know what may happen, but I think that adequate compensation should be paid to these people. <Col N="2246" /> I think that there is a general feeling in the country, especially in the districts where these bombings and destruction have occurred, that the compensation for loss should extend beyond the actual damage to bricks and mortar.  I think the Minister would be well advised to enlarge the scope of the Bill in that respect.  After all, we may assume that the moneys involved will be collected, in the first instance, from the taxpayer or the ratepayer, as the case may be, but subsequently a bill is going to be presented to someone and, for that reason, apart from anything else, in connection with this opportunity of assessing the basis upon which compensation will be paid, I think the Minister should have regard to the fact and not deal with the matter entirely from the point of view that the final person from whom this money will come is the Irish taxpayer or the Irish ratepayer.  For that reason, the Minister should extend the scope of the Bill to deal with consequential loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill, but listening to the appeals from the Opposition&mdash;mostly from lawyers &mdash;asking for a blank cheque to be given and telling us that the courts will do justice, I wonder, when they were talking about the courts and the jurors, were they talking about 12 jurors assessing damages which the nation would have to pay?  I could afford to sit quietly here if I knew that that was all we had to meet, but I do not know what the future has in store for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly would have great pity for these people if they were to be given a big cheque and then find that there was no money to meet it.  I was anxious to know where the money was to come from to pay this.  In the first instance, I understand, this country is to be accountable, but if we are to put up these fabulous sums and leave it to a Dublin jury of 12 men to give these blank cheques for the Twenty-Six Counties to pay, then I think that I, for one, would not be doing my duty to my constituency if I did not protest against that.  I think the Minister is wise in not leaving this thing open <Col N="2247" /> to the exorbitant demands which we know will be made.  I have every sympathy for these unforunate people, and I say that they should be given everything reasonable, but I am not in favour of giving them any sum that 12 Dublin jurors would assess.  We had experience of that kind of thing before, and I think it is hardly in accordance with common justice.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, after paragraph (c) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d)  every person to whom the persons enumerated in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this sub-section have assigned their rights to compensation under this Act.</P>

      <P>I put down an amendment for the purpose of getting information.  Why is it that sub-section (2) was put in?  Was it merely a shelving of responsibility?  A local authority which may find that certain property in respect of which it is interested has suffered damage cannot claim compensation.  I presume it was <Col N="2253" /> simply a matter of saying that the local authority could take it out of the ratepayers, but will not take it out of the people who subscribe by way of taxation.  There is another point, but I presume it is a matter which is decided by the inter-action of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 3.  Paragraph (b) sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If the said property is real estate, the said personal representative shall hold such compensation upon trust for the person who became entitled to the said property under the will or on the intestacy of such deceased person.</P>
      <P>The only other provision made is a sort of general provision in (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>... such compensation shall be deemed to have formed part of the estate of such deceased person at his death;</P>

      <P>Sub-section (4) provides that where a person who has suffered injury has got any compensation from a Government or authority outside the State, no compensation shall be paid under this legislation to such a person.  I direct the Minister's attention to the idea expressed in my amendment No. 9, which has been ruled out of order on the ground that it would impose an additional charge. It is quite possible that a person may get compensation from a Government or authority outside the State which may be entirely inadequate in view of the loss or damage sustained.  I wanted <Col N="2254" /> to have the sub-section so changed that a person, who considered the compensation he got from a Government or authority outside the State inadequate, could make an application under this Act, and that in circumstances where the Minister for Finance or the court was convinced that a person within the scope of the Bill had suffered injury to a greater extent than that for which he actually received compensation, he should be paid the difference between what the Minister or the court judged to be the proper amount of compensation and the amount actually received.</P>

      <P>It would be absolutely impossible to do that.  There are 2,000 applications with the Dublin Corporation now.  Suppose we get these immediately this Bill is passed. It would take more than three months to have them investigated, no matter what staff we put on them.  Even if we made it six months, I do not think we could guarantee that every applicant would have received some award from the Minister within that time.  What the Deputy suggests is that every application must be answered and we could not do that with justice to the applicant or to ourselves.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the entire machinery in this Bill for the assessment of compensation is far too cumbersome. I had considerable experience <Col N="2259" /> of the working of the Damage to Property Act of 1923.  Unfortunately for myself, I had sheaves and sheaves of files in connection with the investigation, not of claims, but of actual decrees by circuit judges and those things went through for years in the Department of Finance and through the various legal sections.  I have no doubt that unless this machinery is changed or some amendment of the type proposed by Deputy Norton and Deputy Mulcahy is accepted it will be this time five years before one quarter of these claims under this Bill are even brought to a circuit judge.  I have no doubt that when this machinery operates these applications will go into the limbo of the Department of Finance and there they will stay for a very considerable time before they are released from bondage.  I do not see any reason why the machinery is so complicated as it is.  What should be done is that the claims should be given in detail to the Department of Finance in order to allow them to investigate the matter&mdash;that is very proper&mdash;but they should only be given a reasonable time to investigate the matter and then the applicant should be entitled to go into court inside a very limited period of three, or six months.</P>
      <P>People who have suffered this loss are not going to get what we have been talking about earlier in the day, consequential damage.  It will take years before they can get their house rebuilt, or before they can get their business started, because it will take them years before they can even get the claim out of the Department of Finance and into the court.  It will take some time in court, and it will take some time before the money is paid and it will take some time for the reinstatement condition to be fulfilled.  I cannot see any practical effect being given to this Bill inside a period of half a dozen years on the machinery that is here at the moment.</P>

      <P>The case would be met if the Minister would agree to let the applicant go to court to have his claim dealt with after the lapse of a certain period, six months&mdash;or 12 months, if the Minister likes&mdash;if the matter is not dealt with by the Department of Finance.  They will have a sufficient period in six months to enable their valuers and investigators to go into the matter, and if they have not come to a conclusion within that time as to what offer they are going to make then the applicant ought to be entitled to go into court and say to the Department of Finance: &ldquo;You will not make an offer.  Let the court decide between us.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery, as far as I can see, is only to enable the Minister to avoid costs.  He is entitled to have ample opportunity of investigating the claim, I think, and he should get ample opportunity of investigating the various claims put forward but if, after the expiration of a reasonable period, something concrete does not emerge from the Department of Finance, the applicant ought to be entitled then and there to go into court.  I think that is only reasonable.  Otherwise, there will certainly be court proceedings: there will be very great hardship.  The Minister is probably aware of all the difficulties caused by reason of delays in connection with military service pensions. He will have exactly the same <Col N="2261" /> thing under this Bill.  This difficulty is caused by the machinery of the Bill, not by any inherent difficulties in having these matters heard by the circuit judges.  The whole thing can be avoided if the applicant is entitled, after a reasonable period, to go into court.  The Minister then can go into court again and ask for an adjournment and get it from the judge if he is entitled to it.  He will not be damnified in any way.  But unless the applicant is entitled to go into court within a reasonable time I cannot see the North Strand being rebuilt inside half a dozen years.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but the courts are there to decide these cases.  They are well able to do it. They have got ample experience, far more experience than the Department of Finance officials.  It is their job.  It is their training, and why not put the thing straight into court, after giving the Minister an opportunity, through his valuers and investigators, of investigating the matter?  All that the Minister should require is an opportunity to investigate the thing so that <Col N="2262" /> he can rebut evidence and give evidence, and let the people who are paid by the taxpayer to decide these matters decide them without putting further expense on the taxpayer by having file after file after file in the Department of Finance and various other Departments.  I know&mdash;I have seen it myself operating&mdash;that these files will circulate through half a dozen Departments, that they will go from the Department of Finance to the Chief State Solicitor, from the Chief State Solicitor to the Board of Works, from the Board of Works to the Department of Industry and Commerce, from the Department of Industry and Commerce down the country to the local State solicitor, and back again; then to the Revenue Commissioners to find out if there are any claims against it.  There will be simply circulation of files, and the cost to the taxpayer would probably pay the entire cost of the damage to the North Strand before it gets into court at all.</P>

      <P>At the end of Section 5, page 5 to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shall not in any case impose under the foregoing section <Col N="2265" /> any condition which has not been provided for under regulations made by the Minister under this Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) (a) of this section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Minister may, when making the offer, attach thereto such (if any) conditions as he thinks proper in relation to the expenditure of the compensation thereby offered;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister should make regulations which could be objected to in this House in the usual way and that, when making an offer of compensation under this Bill, he should not attach conditions which could not be challenged in this House if they were of the general nature that required such challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation now is that the Minister has to consider the applications, possibly within 12 months, and in the end he may make an offer or say he will make no offer. Then the rest of the section applies. May I point out that the objective in this machinery of making an offer or no offer is to give the applicant the choice&mdash;that he will take something from the Minister or go into court to be mulcted in costs?  It probably will be a relatively small amount that will be at issue, and I do not see why the Minister desires to set up this complicated machinery.  He gives himself leave to make conditions and attach them.  He has said that the conditions he has in mind are in regard to reinstatement. That is especially referred to in Section 9.  In fact, the compensation is, in the main, to be subject to reinstatement, and would not require any regulation of the Minister at all.</P>
      <P>There is another thing in Section 9 &mdash;that payment may be made by instalments and that the Minister may stagger them over a considerable number of years.  The time is entirely inside the Minister's control, as far as this section is concerned, and it is absolutely wide open.  I had an amendment down to sub-section (2) (e), but it has been ruled out of order as imposing an extra burden on the State.  I ask the Minister to consider a case.  Supposing a person has a property which, after the accidental discharge of a bomb or a mine, suffers a particular type of injury.  He puts in a claim based on the injury as known at that particular point.  The Minister, seeing that the damage easily may be greater, suddently shoots out an offer, which the man is unfortunate enough to accept. Then the building collapses or it is revealed that there is worse damage. What happens then?  May he make a new claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking a very extraordinary case of a building that appeared to have superficial damage and then collapsed. There is a fundamental difference between the original injury thought to have been caused and that <Col N="2267" /> discovered later to have been caused. One can narrow that to buildings where they appear to be damaged, and an offer is made and accepted and then worse damage appears, though not so bad as a collapse.  If the owner is prohibited from making an extra claim, I think that is a hardship on him.  It is not likely to occur often, but we do know that some of the houses in other parts of the city stood the first shock of the last bombing and then collapsed afterwards.  That might happen over a longer period and yet be traceable to the bombing.</P>

      <P>In regard to what Deputy McGilligan says, I was in conversation with a technical man who has been examining certain houses in the city and whose attention has been called to the appearance of very serious cracks and defects immediately after the bombing.  He informed me, in the course of conversation last week, that he feared the effect of the bomb damage never would be adequately measured. That is a support for the case made by Deputy McGilligan, that a claim may be made for a small amount of compensation for damage which appears on the surface at this stage, but that the effect of the bombing may be that the house subsequently collapses or appears much more seriously damaged than was thought at first. That person should be entitled to make a new claim.  There is no question at this stage of paying compensation on the claim.  A person ought not to be prevented from making the claim and having that claim investigated if, in fact, it subsequently transpires that the house is much more seriously damaged than was, at first, thought to be the case.  Will the Minister examine the matter?</P>

      <P>Would it not be up to the person concerned to make <Col N="2268" /> an adequate claim in respect of his building, whether it be a house or garage? Is not that what will happen in a hundred per cent. of the cases? They may have to modify the claims later, after thorough examination, but I should say that in all cases adequate claims will be made.  Deputy McGilligan had in mind a different type of case&mdash;a case in which the person accepted the offer made and later discovered that much greater damage had been done than was covered by his original claim.  It is suggested that he should be allowed to make another claim.  If we were to allow that, there would never be an end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That difficulty arises from the machinery.  I gave the Minister an example put to me by one of the corporation officials who examined the Donore Avenue area.  A house there, apparently, escaped all damage.  Something happened to an adjoining property, which led to an investigation.  The amazing discovery was made that this house had been moved several inches.  It had been shifted from its foundations and rocked, with the result that there would be a subsidence of that house, though it had not occurred at the time and may not occur for some time.  One of the inspectors under the Dangerous Dwellings Act brought the matter to my notice.  That may be an exceptional case but, in an exceptional case, why should not a claim be allowed?  Take the case I have mentioned of a house, apparently only slightly damaged.  A person was paid for that damage and the house collapsed.  It seems to me that the person concerned would have a new cause of action but I am not sure that the phraseology of the section would permit of a new claim being made.  There ought to be some omnibus provision for special cases.  It will cause a certain amount of Departmental trouble and Departments are loth to have to keep on dealing with such cases.  They prefer to shut down the hatch but the people concerned may not get justice.</P>

The provision in the Bill is that the application must be made not later than a month after the date on which the applicant refuses an <Col N="2270" /> offer by the Minister or the date on which the applicant was informed by the Minister that he did not intend to make any offer.  Why should there be such a narrow limit as a month?  The Minister may not know the difficulty that attends the bringing of an ordinary civil bill even in a case where there is a clear cause of action.  I have suggested that the time allowed be six months.  Some enlargement is necessary. The Minister is not likely to be embarrassed by proceedings being held over.  A person is likely to move speedily, but more time should be allowed for putting in the formal application.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the case which I put before&mdash; where a person has suffered damage, that damage has been investigated and valued at a particular point, the valuation has been put before the Minister and the Minister makes an offer.  At that particular point, suppose the applicant refuses the offer on the ground that it is not adequate and he discovers, when going into court, that the damage is much greater than he originally thought.  Back of this provision, there is an effort to save costs. The Minister will say that he should have had this new fact brought before him when the application was being considered by him and that the applicant is tied rigidly to his original claim.  He has to make his application in prescribed form and we do not know if there will be an opening for any addition to or enlargement of the application if evidence of additional damage should be forthcoming in the meantime. I do not think it is right that the applicant should be tied to the allegations of fact contained in the form which he sends in in the first instance. If there should be grounds for a new statement of fact, why should he be prevented from bringing it in?  Take the case of a person who refuses an <Col N="2271" /> offer in connection with damage to a house and, before the case comes on, the house collapses.  Why should he not be allowed to go into court bearing with him the tale of a collapsed house instead of that of an injured house? This is merely an effort to save costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very strong objection to sub-paragraph (c) because I think it is likely to do very serious injustice.  It will be extremely difficult to fill up the forms which will be sent out by the Minister in accordance with a previous section.  A very technical judge may rule out very material evidence on the ground that the fact on which it bears was not precisely alleged in the form.  Deputy McGilligan said that this was a question of costs. The Minister will be protected in that regard by the ordinary court procedure. If an applicant makes a different case in court from that which he has made to the Minister, the Minister may be absolutely certain that that will be taken into account by the judge. The judge will either refuse to allow him to make such a case or, otherwise, see that he pays the costs resulting from the making of the new case.  That is the ordinary procedure in court, and I do not think that this provision will give the Minister additional protection, while it may result in crippling an applicant in advancing his case in the ordinary way in court.</P>
      <P>These forms will, probably, be filled by valuers, auctioneers, engineers, or people of that type who may not be trained as lawyers.  They may not cover every material fact that should be brought to the attention of the Minister. If they leave out something of that kind, on a strict construction of this paragraph, it cannot be referred to in court.  The Minister should drop this paragraph.  He has ample protection in court procedure against the costs of the making of a new case.</P>

Those concerned put everything into the particulars that comes into their head so that, instead of narrowing the issues, they widen them, and one is left obfuscated.  The Minister may find that his investigators will, by reason of this provision, be put to the trouble of investigating a lot of things unnecessarily owing to the number of a allegations of fact put in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister might reconsider this matter of looking for costs.  I had drafted amendments on the matter but they have been ruled out.  I took them from the Transport Act.  The Minister may remember that when the Transport Act was passed here it allowed the railway companies&mdash;I am putting it crudely&mdash; to go in on private property, and to confiscate it.  The situation that was developed by the Act was that the applicant for compensation never had to pay the costs of the railway company which sought, or whatever company sought, to take his property. Sometimes he had to pay his own costs, on occasions where an offer was made by the acquiring company and the arbitrator's award did not come up to that.  In no case had a person to pay the acquiring company's costs.  I suggest that this is a small matter and the Minister is put in here between the courts and the applicants&mdash;I would think it an admirable procedure&mdash;with a view to getting speedy decisions. The Minister is here in a superior position and I do not think he should take stand as if he were an ordinary litigant. He might be a bit generous in this matter.  It is not going to run to a whole lot and applicants will be all the more likely to take their money than to go to court if they feel that the Minister does not hold this terror over them.</P>

      <P>I am intrigued to know why the procedure is being adopted of referring matters in dispute to the Circuit Court particularly as Circuit Court judges may lack the technical knowledge to enable them to deal with issues in respect to compensation for property where conflicting evidence is submitted.  Why is the Minister not adopting the usual practice of referring the matters in dispute to an arbitrator as is done in the case of a local authority where a dispute arises in connection with the acquisition of land?  As far as I can see, that would be a much more satisfactory way of dealing with these disputes than referring them to the Circuit Court because, as I pointed out, it is quite on the cards that a judge may not have the necessary technical knowledge to give a good judicial decision where there is conflicting evidence.</P>

With regard to paragraph (c), I only put down the amendment to get information.  In paragraph (c) compensation is confined to damage done to ships or boats which are either registered in the State under the Merchant Shipping Acts or else are owned by an Irish citizen or an Irish company. It may be that there is some other provision made for some other ships.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that war insurance applies to damage to ships inflicted inside territorial waters. It seems to be limited to risks on the high seas.  The Minister might consider the case of foreign boats which are lying in our docks and which get damaged.  It might be well worth considering at a time when we are suffering from dearth of supplies, part of which could be borne by foreign ships.  We have had to search the world to get the few ships which we have at the moment.  Is it worth while for the sake of a few pence to make conditions less attractive for foreign ships to come to our ports?  The fact that these ships are not eligible for compensation may well prove the deciding line when we are seeking the services of foreign ships to bring commodities to our ports.  Owners of foreign shipping may say: &ldquo;We are not going to send any ship in there because if anything happens we shall get no compensation although nationally registered ships will.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That may not occur to the Minister as a very important point but I suggest that it would loom very largely in the consideration of ship owners, and it might mean a very considerable difference to us in the hire of foreign ships to bring commodities to our ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) is important.  We said on the Money Resolution that much change is not going to be got from the Minister on this paragraph. I said then that it is a definite hardship if the Minister is going to weigh against the claimant the difficulty of rebutting claims.  If he is going to weigh that in the balance and press <Col N="2276" /> the balance in his favour on the other side, there is a question of doing justice.  Let the Minister take the case where people have chattels.  Most people have chattels in their houses, and they are not always of the jewellery type, but there might be people with personal property of the watch type and other articles that are here called personal ornaments.  I asked a question on the Money Resolution, and I thought I got an affirmative nod from the Minister, that the phrase covered clothing.  You have in the ordinary middle-class family a certain amount of the wealth of the family in articles of clothing and furniture and other things.  No matter what a person could prove by way of the production of dockets or invoices or bills from shops to show that certain clothing was in the house, or if he produced evidence from other people that the daughter of the house had so many changes in outer garments in a particular period, or a man had so many changes in his outer garments, he is not going to get very much.</P>
    <P>The only case made here so far is with regard to the difficulty of rebutting possible extravagant claims that will be made.  The commonest feature in an ordinary running-down case is a claim for compensation for damage to clothing.  If a person gets into conflict with a bus, a tram or motor car and gets tossed about the street, obviously his or her clothes suffer, and one of the items in every special claim is in respect of clothing.  The courts rule on that very rigidly, and they insist on damage to clothing being carefully considered.  All sorts of queries are raised&mdash;could the clothing not have been repaired, invisibly mended or cleaned?  If it is a question of destruction of clothing, particulars have to be set out as to what the garment cost and when it was bought.  There is not going to be such an amazing amount of difficulty in rebutting claims as the Minister imagines.  The main point is to try to set up a person in the same position as he occupied before the damage was caused.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would take a more lenient view of this matter.  The committee recognise that some people <Col N="2277" /> will make extravagant claims, but the majority of these falsified claims will be found out.  There is not going to be very much in the way of special damage claimed, and not proved, that a person will get paid for.  I think the Minister should tip the balance a little more favourably towards the claimant. Most people will not have a great deal of postage stamps in their possession. That is not going to amount to a whole lot.  Then, again, postal orders and post office orders are not generally held to any great extent.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>(1)  The following provisions shall apply and have effect in relation to compensation under this Act awarded by the court in respect of an injury to which this Act applies to a building, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the compensation shall be subject to the condition (in this section referred to as the reinstatement condition)  that it shall be applied either in or towards erecting a new building on the site of the injured building or in or towards repairing the injured building, but so that the new or repaired building shall be not less valuable than the injured building and shall be either of the same  as the injured building or of a character suitable to the neighbourhood;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the amount of the compensation shall not exceed the cost of compliance with the reinstatement condition less the amount (if any) by which, in the opinion of the court. the price of the building as <Col N="2280" /> reinstated would by reason of the reinstatement exceed the price of the building in the condition in which it was immediately before it was injured, the price in each case being estimated according to normal market conditions as at the date of the award and on the basis of a sale of the fee simple interest in the building;</P>
    <P>(e)  the compensation shall be paid at such time or times, in such instalments, and upon production of such evidence (in the case of payment of an instalment other than the final instalment) of partial compliance with the reinstatement condition or (in the case of payment of the final instalment) of complete compliance with the reinstatement condition as the Minister shall require, and the decision of the Minister as to whether a reinstatement condition has or has not been complied with (whether wholly or partially) or as to whether sufficient evidence of such compliance has or has not been given shall be final.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 50, after the word &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or serviceable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill compensation is to be subject to a reinstatement condition to this effect that it:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall be applied either in or towards erecting a new building on the site of the injured building or in or towards repairing the injured building, but so that the new or repaired building shall be not less valuable than the injured building....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The test there is value.  We all know that building costs have gone up.  If a person is to put up a new building on the site of the old building, the position, I take it, will be somewhat like this.  He will first of all get a valuation of what the old building was worth at the date of destruction, and then a certain amount of money will be given out.  But even with that, taking into account how building costs have gone up, it will not be possible with the amount of the award to put up a building of the same value as the old one, though it may be possible to put up an equally serviceable building. Suppose the old premises consisted of a shop on the ground floor and some living accommodation above.  It may have been a three-storey house.  The new building might be collapsed into a two-storey house, and it might be an equally serviceable building.  What I am aiming at is that the person given the compensation will have a limited amount of money to deal with.  The sub-section provides that the new building shall be not less valuable than the old one.  With the amount awarded it may not be possible to do that, but it may be possible to put up a building equally serviceable, and to do that within the amount of the award.</P>

      <P>Take the case of a building erected 25 years ago that was damaged or destroyed.  To put up one of the same type to-day would, I <Col N="2282" /> suppose, cost two and a half times the price of the original building.  Our idea is that the compensation should be such as would put up a building that would be as useful and as serviceable as the building that was destroyed.  I am advised that the word &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; is meant to include &ldquo;serviceable&rdquo;.  I take it that the compensation award will be such as will enable the owner to put up at least as good a building for his purpose as the old building was, whether it was a factory or a home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a small factory in which there is a certain amount of machinery.  I understand the scheme of the Bill to be that someone will come along and put a value on the old building.  He will find out the date it was erected, and get particulars with regard to depreciation, both of the old building and machinery.  The owner will be told that he is now getting a new building and new machinery: that instead of having written off ten out of 20 years' life of the machinery, and ten out of 50 years' life of the building, he is getting a new start.  Some deductions will be made in respect of these items.  That might be all right in the case of a company that had some money in reserve.  But take a proprietary business, in which you have an individual living from day to day, with no bank balance.  What is his position going to be if he is told that, instead of being given a 40-year-old house he is getting a modern, substantial structure, but that it is going to cost him a bit?  He has no money to add to the amount of the compensation awarded.  In a case of that kind, I do not think the provision in the Bill should be insisted on, provided he puts up a building that is equally serviceable and does that within the limits of the amount of the award.  Suppose you had a lot of damage done in Dublin by bombing, you might have a big number of people of that class in the position I have described.</P>

Paragraph (e) provides for the payment of compensation in instalments&mdash;according as to how much of the reinstatement condition has been complied with.

The compensation would be tied to a reinstatement condition, and the Minister would dole out the money in instalments according as the building went up.</P>

If a person gets money tied to a reinstatement condition and there is a difficulty at the end as to whether that reinstatement condition has been complied with or not&mdash;the Minister having certain retained moneys in his hands, towards the end&mdash;I think that the final decision with regard to the disbursement of the retained moneys ought to lie with the court and not with the Minister.  I urge the same point in connection with the case where a reinstatement condition has become impracticable or where, in the end, it has <Col N="2284" /> to be modified or abandoned.  I would not mind having the power in the hands of the Minister if there is an appeal to the court, but where it is a final and conclusive thing the court ought to be brought in.

    </Speaker>
    <P>To insert at the beginning of the section the words &ldquo;Subject to the <Col N="2285" /> provision of the next following sub-section of this section&rdquo; and to add to the section a sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the occupier of a building which sustained an injury to which this Act applies was compelled by reason of such injury to vacate such building and thereby incurred expenditure in excess of what he would have incurred if such injury had not been sustained, on the provision of housing accommodation for himself, for his family, or for his business or on the removal or storage of any movable article, compensation may be awarded under this Act in respect of such expenditure, but such compensation shall not exceed, as regards any particular claim, £30.</P>
    <P>The effect of this provision is to enable compensation up to a maximum of £30 to be awarded in respect of out-of-pocket expenditure incurred, in circumstances arising out of injury to property, on the provision of alternative housing accommodation, or on the removal or storage of household effects or other articles such as shop goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing the Financial Motion, we referred to this matter.  We impressed on the Minister that there was really no necessity for imposing a limit of £30; that, if justice was to be done, each case ought to be dealt with on its merits.  We pointed out that, where persons may claim that they had to get alternative housing accommodation, that they had to go to another place of business, or that they had to remove or store furniture, all those are expenses which can be easily vouched for, and that it is an unreasonable hardship and injustice to impose a limitation.  There is not here the same necessity for safeguarding the Minister against the unknown as there is in the case of jewellery and so on.  I would very strongly urge the Minister to drop that limitation of £30. He may ask what other limit should be put in.  I suggest that there is no necessity to put in any limit.  I should also like to have that section amended in such a way as to cover a case in which a person who had been ill in <Col N="2286" /> one of the houses which was damaged or destroyed, and who could have been adequately treated at home, had to go to hospital and incur expenses there.  Again, that is definite and vouchable expenditure necessarily undertaken, and it ought to be met under this Bill.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at fair length already on the Money Resolution, and I do not think I can add anything to what I have already said with regard to it.  I do intend to meet here the type of cases mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy when he spoke on the Second Reading.  In one case of which he gave details&mdash;he gave details of more than one&mdash;the total cost of moving and storing the furniture amounted, I think, to £50 or £51.  I am prepared to go up to £50, in order to meet the Deputy to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that there are people from Donore Avenue who have not yet got back to their normal accommodation? I quoted a number of cases on the Second Reading, as reported in columns 1956 to 1959 of the Official Debates.  In one particular case a family had to go into a flat and pay £1 5s. 0d. weekly for six months, and the removal and storage of their furniture cost £37.  In a case like that, assuming that those figures can be vouched for, £50 is only part of a definite and necessary expenditure which had to be undertaken.  It is inconceivable that people who suffered this damage on, say, 3rd January, and who are still in alternative accommodation, could get out of it for £50, including the cost of removal and storage of furniture.  When it is a question of a limited number of cases, in a definite catastrophe like this, and the sum involved is only the difference between £50 and £80, or between £50 and £100 or £110, I do not think anybody could see the necessity for imposing a limitation.  Certainly the amount of money involved is not such as would create that necessity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 11 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>11.&mdash;Where a building is destroyed or damaged to such an extent as to be rendered uninhabitable by an injury to which this Act applies the following provisions shall apply, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the ground landlord of the site on which such building was erected shall be stopped from claiming <Col N="2292" /> or recovering ground rent in respect of such site so long as such building is uninhabitable or as the case may be until a new building has been erected thereon and the tenant thereof has entered into possession of such building, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the owner or other person entitled to receive from the occupier of such building or from any other person having an interest therein any rent or equivalent payment shall be stopped from claiming or recovering such rent or equivalent payment so long as such building is uninhabitable or as the case may be until a new building has been erected to replace the building which has been destroyed and the tenant thereof has entered into possession of such new building.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent ground landlords from claiming or recovering ground rents in respect of a site, the building on which has been rendered uninhabitable, until such time as a new building has been erected there and the tenant has entered into possession.  The second portion of the amendment is designed to impose a similar restriction on the owner of the house so far as the collection of rent from the occupier is concerned.  The general purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there will be equality of sacrifice all round.  It would clearly be an injustice to impose on people, who have suffered the inconvenience of being bombed out of their houses, the obligation&mdash;or rather not to exempt them from the obligation&mdash;of having to pay ground rents.</P>

With all respect to the Chair, I would say that, in my opinion, this does not come within the ambit of this Bill, which is a compensation Bill.  If this principle were adopted here, then the next thing would be that you would have the ground landlord applying for compensation also.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. This amendment is concerned with agreements between a landlord and a tenant, and such agreements are outside the purview of a Bill of this kind. At any rate, it does not come very adequately into this Bill&mdash;the dragging in of something that, as far as I, at any rate, can see, would not come easily within a Bill of this type, the purpose of which is to give compensation to people whose property is damaged.  I cannot see how it could properly be brought in here.  I was told this morning that something of the kind was done in England, but it was done there by a special Act dealing with matters of this kind, such as contracts between landlord and tenant and local authorities with regard to rates and rents.  In England, however, it certainly was regarded as not being within the ambit of a Compensation for Damage to Property Bill.  If it is to be dealt with at all it should be dealt with by an Act entirely separate from an Act such as this.</P>

Supposing the occupier is leaving a house on which, under the Rent Acts, the rent is strictly controlled; when the house is rebuilt I presume that the landlord will be able to go into court and get what is called the permitted increase, and a very heavy rent may be fixed thereafter. People who are quite content to live under certain conditions and do not want better premises will find themselves possibly faced with a rent beyond their means.</P>

I am simply aligning paragraph (d) with that, to say that the Minister or the court, on application to the court, may apportion the compensation.

They give him £50 compensation, and then the Department says that he owes £4 odd for income-tax and they are going to take that out of the compensation.  It seems a scandal to recover it in that way.  Are not the ordinary processes of law still open for the recovery of the debt?

      <P>Whenever the Government recovers from the government of any other State or from any other authority outside the State compensation in respect of an injury to which the Act applies, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b)  if any person has been awarded compensation under this Act in respect of the said injury and the compensation so recovered from such government or authority exceeds the compensation so awarded, the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, pay out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to every person to whom compensation was so awarded such sum (if any), in addition to the compensation so awarded to such person, as the Minister shall think proper subject to the limitation hereafter imposed;</P>

      <P>My intention was to bring about a situation in which this would be a State contribution and not a contribution from the local authorities, and in anticipation of that, which refers to a later section, I am moving to delete paragraphs (e) and (f).  I presume the Minister is going to insist on this being partially borne by the ratepayers of an area, instead of being a nation-wide charge.  The circumstances, I think, are such that the nation would not be disposed to object to its being made a charge on the taxpayer, instead of on the ratepayer, because it has to be recognised that this type of damage is more likely to fall on certain areas than on others and, even inside the ambit of neutrality and not being at war, it is quite conceivable that a large amount of damage could be done in a particular area.  I thought it better that it should be spread, instead of having part of it borne by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 47, 48 and 49 go together.  Amendment No. 47 is consequential on amendment No. 48. Section 16 (1) is defective as it stands inasmuch as deductions made under Section 11 (d), in respect of insurance, would fall to be included in ascertaining the amount of compensation paid within a particular year.  The first part of the new sub-section (2) proposed in amendment No. 48 rectifies this.  The second part of the new sub-section is to ensure that the entire amount recouped to the local authority under Section 18 (1) (a) should rank for the 25 per cent. assessment against the general body of local authorities under Section 16 (3).  Amendment No. 49 is a drafting amendment, consequential on the new sub-section (2).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of this sub-section, where the amount of a deduction authorised by paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 18 of this Act is less than the amount of the relevant recoupment under paragraph (a) of that sub-section, the amount of such deduction shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the <Col N="2303" /> amount of such recoupment&mdash;(Aire Airgeadais.)</P>

    <P>20.&mdash;(1) Where a building has been injured by an injury to which this Act applies and the relevant district planning authority considers that the acquisition of the land consisting of such building and its site is expedient for the purposes of a planning scheme for their district (whether already made or in contemplation), such planning authority may take steps to acquire in accordance <Col N="2305" /> with the Schedule to this Act such land.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a district planning authority has acquired in accordance with the Schedule to this Act any land, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b)  the said amount shall, in default of agreement be determined by arbitration under and in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as amended by the Acquisition of Land (Reference Committee) Act, 1925 (No. 22 of 1925);</P>
    <P>(c)  for the purposes of the determination of the said amount, the value of such land shall be deemed to be the same as if the relevant building which sustained an injury to which this Act applies were still in the condition in which it was immediately before such injury occurred;</P>
    <P>(d) no compensation shall be payable under this Act in respect of such injury;</P>
    <P>(e) the Minister shall pay to such district planning authority the difference between the value of such land immediately before such injury occurred and the value thereof immediately after such injury occurred; and</P>

      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE.</P>
      <P Just="Center">ACQUISITION OF LAND BY DISTRICT PLANNING AUTHORITY.</P>
      <P>1.  A district planning authority proposing to acquire any land shall by order (in this Schedule referred to as a preliminary order) declare that they propose to acquire such land.</P>
      <P>2.  A preliminary order shall not be made save within&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the relevant injury to which this Act applies occurred before the passing of this Act&mdash;four weeks after such passing, or</P>
      <P>(b)  where it occurs after the passing of this Act&mdash;four weeks after its occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The occupier or any person having an estate or interest in or right in respect of the land to which a preliminary order relates may, not later than 21 days after the posting in accordance with paragraph 16 of this Schedule of a copy of such order <Col N="2308" /> on or near the land to which such order relates, apply to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for the annulment of such order, and, on such application the said Minister may at his discretion either annual such order or restrict the application of such order to portion of the land to which it originally related.</P>
    <P>4.  Before determining an application under paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may hold a public inquiry into the subject matter thereof and Article 32 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments). Order, 1898, shall apply in respect of every such public inquiry in like manner as the said Article applies in respect of the local inquiries therein mentioned.</P>
    <P>5.  If no application is made under and in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Schedule for the annulment of a preliminary order or if, where any such application is made, on the determination thereof such preliminary order is not annulled, the district planning authority by whom such preliminary order was made shall by order (in this Schedule referred to as a vesting order) acquire the land to which such preliminary order relates or, where such determination has restricted the application of such preliminary order to part of such land, such part of such land.</P>
    <P>6.  The time within which a vesting order shall be made shall be&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) where no application is made under and in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Schedule for the annulment of the relevant preliminary order&mdash;14 days after the expiration of the time within which such application could have been made, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case&mdash;within 14 days after the determination of the application under the said paragraph 3.</P>
    <P>7.  Where a district planning authority, before making a vesting. <Col N="2309" /> order, become aware that the land to be acquired by such order is subject (whether alone or in conjunction with other land) to any annuity or other payment to the Irish Land Commission, to any annuity or other payment to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland or to any charge for estate duty or succession duty payable to the Revenue Commissioners on the death of any person, such authority shall forthwith inform the Irish Land Commission, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland or the Revenue Commissioners (as the case may be) of the intention to make such order.</P>
    <P>8.  A vesting order shall be in the form specified by regulations of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (which he is hereby authorised to make) and shall contain a map or plan of the land acquired by such order.</P>
    <P>9.  A vesting order made by a district planning authority shall operate to vest the land to which it relates in such authority in fee simple free from incumbrances and all estates, rights, titles and interests of whatsoever kind on a date stated in such order, not being earlier than 14 days after the making thereof.</P>
    <P>10.  Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 9 of this Schedule, where a district planning authority has acquired by a vesting order land which is subject, either alone or in conjunction with other land, to a purchase annuity, payment in lieu of rent, or other annual sum (not being merely a rent under a contract of tenancy) payable to the Irish Land Commission, such authority shall become and be liable, as from the date on which such land is vested in them by such vesting order, for the payment to the Irish Land Commission of such annual sum or such portion thereof as shall be apportioned by the Irish Land Commission on such land as if such land had been transferred to such authority by the owner thereof on that date.</P>
    <P>11.  The district planning authority <Col N="2310" /> by whom a vesting order was made may enter on and take possession of the land acquired by such order on the date on which such land is vested in them by such order or on any later date and, if any person obstructs or interferes with such entry or taking possession, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this paragraph and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £20 or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or, at the discretion of the court, to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>12.  Where any land has become vested by means of a vesting order in a district planning authority, such district planning authority shall, as soon as may be after the date of vesting, send to the registering authority under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891, such vesting order, and on receipt thereof the registering authority shall cause the title of such district planning authority to the ownership of such land in fee simple to be registered under the said Act and such registration shall comprise a statement that such land is vested in such district planning authority subject to the payment of any purchase annuity, payment in lieu of rent or other annual sum or portion thereof, payable to the Irish Land Commission under paragraph 10 of the Schedule to the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941.</P>
    <P>13.  A district planning authority may use any land acquired by them by a vesting order for any purpose connected with their powers and duties (whether as such district planning authority or otherwise).</P>
    <P>14.  Where the whole or any part of any land acquired by a vesting order is not required by the district planning authority by whom it was acquired, such authority may sell or let by public auction or private treaty in any one or more lots the whole or such part (as the case may be) of such land, but no such sale or letting shall take effect unless and until the Minister for Local Government <Col N="2311" /> and Public Health has consented thereto.</P>
    <P>15.  Every sum received by a district planning authority in respect of the sale or lease of land acquired by a vesting order shall be applied by such authority for the purpose of their powers and duties (whether as such district planning authority or otherwise) in such manner as such authority, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, think proper.</P>
    <P>16.  Whenever a district planning authority make a preliminary or a vesting order, they shall, within seven days after making such order&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) post a copy of such order on or near the land to which it relates, and</P>
    <P>(b)  give a copy of such order to the occupier (if any) of such land and to every (if any) person having an estate or interest in or right in respect of such land whose existence and name and address of ordinary residence can be ascertained by such authority by reasonable inquiries, and</P>
    <P>(c)  give a copy of such order to the Minister.</P>
    <P>17.  Where a preliminary or vesting order contains a map or plan of the land to which such order relates, such map or plan may be omitted from the copies of such order posted and given in pursuance of sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) of paragraph 16 of this Schedule, but a copy of such map or plan shall be deposited in the office of the district planning authority making such order and shall there be kept open for inspection at reasonable times and the said copies of such order shall contain a statement that such map or plan is deposited and kept open for inspection as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>18.&mdash;(1)  Where a copy of a preliminary or vesting order is required to be given to any person, such copy shall be addressed to such person and shall be given to him in one of the following ways, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2312" /> (a)  by delivering it to such person;</P>
    <P>(b)  by leaving it at the address at which such person ordinarily resides;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in the names of Deputy Bennett and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the prices fixed by the Government for cereals are insufficient and that, in view of the present prices of grain and feeding stuffs and the higher cost of production, increased prices are necessary to afford producers a reasonable margin and to encourage an expansion in production next season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2314" /> In considering this motion the House must bear in mind that, during this emergency and in the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves with regard to supplies, the dominant consideration for the Government and for the country must be the production to our maximum capacity of essential food for our people and for the feeding and maintenance of our present live stock population.  It is this major consideration, above all others, that has induced Deputy Bennett and myself to table this motion.  In this national effort at food production people were compelled by the Tillage Order to grow all crops, with the exception of wheat and beet, without a guaranteed price. Since the commencement of the emergency the Government has been asked, both in this House and in the Seanad, by motion and otherwise, to guarantee prices to the farmers in order to stimulate production.  The Minister's answer to that was that it could not be done.  The Taoiseach told the House last week that in this food campaign they looked for a 50 per cent. increase in the amount of land under cultivation, and that they secured a 25 per cent. increase.  To my mind, that was a confession of failure.  I believe if reasonably attractive prices had been announced earlier last sowing season the position to-day would be much better than it is.  The Minister said a few months ago that the question of guaranteed prices for cereals and other crops was impossible, but now we find him, after six months, adopting a policy of fixed prices.  The farmers have been appealed to, on patriotic grounds, to produce food for the nation.  While I believe that people living in rural Ireland are as patriotic as any other section of the community, they are only human; they have their financial and economic problems and they do not and cannot exist on patriotism alone.</P>
    <P>The prices for this year's grain were announced, I think, on 12th July last. I know for a fact that farmers generally throughout the country were very grievously disappointed.  They expected that, in appreciation of their efforts to produce the necessary food this year, they would be rewarded by a <Col N="2315" /> higher price, at least, than was announced for wheat and, certainly, a better price for oats and barley than has been announced.  I want to make it clear that I am not saying that the present prices are bad prices.  I do certainly say they are not good prices, and that they are not by any means attractive prices.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Minister persists in these prices the stimulation necessary for further effort next year will be completely absent.  In view of the likelihood of an almost complete absence of artificial manures next year, the incentive of a good price is a vital consideration.  I think now is the time to adopt a policy that will ensure that the necessary incentive will be present for further production next year.</P>
    <P>Viewing the whole supply position as it has been presented to us in recent weeks by the responsible Minister, one will appreciate the necessity for a further effort next year.  For that reason I do not approve of the poor prices that have been announced by the Minister.  On the other hand, I personally am not looking for prices that will leave excessive profits to the producer. I think we simply want fair prices that will compensate the farmer for his outlay, his time, his anxiety and his efforts.  The Minister may say that he is carrying out the policy of the Government Standstill Order, No. 83, which fixes wages, and that a farmer is not more entitled to higher profits than a wage earner.  I am not suggesting for a moment that he is.  In fact, I believe that the profits arising out of the production of grain this year&mdash;taking the cost of production and everything else into account&mdash;will not be as good as they were pre-war.</P>
    <P>Take the price of wheat.  Immediately before the war we were getting 30/- as a guaranteed price, but we actually made 31/6 and 32/-.  I believe that that left a higher margin of profit to the farmer than that for which he is attempting to grow wheat to-day &mdash;£2.  I suggest only that the farmer is entitled to the pre-war level of profit: I am not suggesting that he should get any more, in view of the <Col N="2316" /> policy of the Government and the difficulties of the poor people of the country.  At least, he is entitled to that.</P>
    <P>The cost of production to-day is much higher.  Take the cost of artificial manures this year as against last year. The ex-factory price of manure here is £8 a ton&mdash;that is, 100 per cent. increase over last year, while the pre-war price was about £3 a ton.  The price of sulphate of ammonia last year was £10 a ton, and this year it ranges from £12&mdash; if you bought it very early&mdash;to £21 or £22 a ton, showing a substantial increase in cost.  We all know the rise in the cost of seeds this year&mdash;particularly seed wheat, which costs as much as £3 or £4 a barrel.  Ploughs and all plough parts are very much higher.  On the mechanised farm the cost of kerosene has gone up considerably, and the cost of threshing will, no doubt, be very much greater.  Wages, of course, are fixed much higher than pre-war. The cost of transport and delivery will be higher.  In dealing with this matter, therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that, taking the costings into account this year as against a pre-war year, when the price of wheat was guaranteed at 30/-, that price in the net was better for the farmer than a guaranteed price of £2 this year.</P>
    <P>If I were asked my opinion as to a fair price for the three cereals, I would say in round figures, 20/-, 30/- and 50/-. Deputies will observe that I am leaving a considerable margin between the price of wheat at 50/- and the price of oats and barley at 30/-.  I think that is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that the food produced for home consumption will be so used.  We must take into account the present cost of the meal mixture, which is round about 22/- or 23/- a cwt.  On the figures that I suggest for both oats and barley, the cost of that mixture would be considerably less, even on the Minister's own figures as announced.  The margin left between the price of oats and barley and the price of wheat is not sufficient to ensure that there be an inducement left there for farmers to keep wheat for animal feeding.  There is a great danger that that may happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2317" /> With our present position with regard to the supply of wheat, and assuming that we will get an average yield again next year, we certainly have a very big gap to make up between what we hope to produce this year and our normal consumption.  Any arrangement or price fixation that might tend to induce farmers to use wheat for feeding purposes would be disastrous to the country.  In order to ensure that that danger will not exist, I suggest that it is necessary to leave a considerable margin between the price of oats and barley, on the one side, and that of wheat on the other side.  If that is not done, there will be a good deal of illicit traffic in grain between farmers, and there will be all sorts of blending and mixing going on. A certain amount of wheat will be kept back and mixed with oats and barley to make a better food.  I am convinced that that is bound to happen if the Minister does not take the precaution I suggest, to ensure that there is a decent gap that will be attractive and that will make certain that farmers will deliver for milling purposes all the wheat they produce.  There is no method by which you can ensure that except by making it sufficiently attractive for the farmer to deliver the grain for that purpose rather than keep it for the feeding of animals.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has taken the advice of the Consultative Council in this matter.  The method of doing that does not justify its being called a Consultative Council.  The Minister presents his prices to the council and permits them to express an opinion and, no matter what they say about it, he does not appear to change his mind.  Before the Consultative Council is informed as to what prices the Minister intends to fix, he and his officials already have made up their minds definitely about them.  I hope that will not apply to what has been said in this House.  I believe that this is the proper place to have this matter discussed and to have the various views expressed and a decision taken.</P>
    <P>Again on the question of the price of wheat, when I suggest a price of 50/- the Minister may say that, in fixing <Col N="2318" /> a lower price than 50/-, he has to take into consideration the purchasing power of the people&mdash;particularly the poor people&mdash;but that is not a logical reason why the farmer should be asked to produce at an uneconomic price.  If the price that I suggest is so high that it will result in what the Minister or the Government may term a prohibitive price for the poor, then there is no reason why we should not subsidise flour here as they are doing in other countries.</P>
    <P>If that is necessary, it should be done.  We ought not to overlook the paramount consideration&mdash;to ensure maximum production.  Even a subsidy that would reduce the cost of the loaf to poor people would not cost an enormous amount of money when one regards it from the point of view of what we are spending at present on the maintenance of the Army and on other services of the State.  We have been considering a Bill this evening under which it is proposed to pay compensation for damage done by bombing. That, in itself, will involve a considerable sum, but suppose that one of the main thoroughfares in this city&mdash;say O'Connell Street&mdash;were bombed, the cost of compensating for that damage would be much more than the subsidy which would be necessary on bread or flour to bring it within the purchasing power of poor people.  If necessary, that consideration should be gone into.</P>
    <P>In announcing the prices the Minister informed the farmers that the price of wheat at 40/- is the price delivered to the nearest dealer or at the nearest station.  It includes the cost of delivery and it includes the cost of sacks.  To my mind, the Minister has worsened the position from the time the price was originally announced. When the price of 40/- was announced, the country understood that the incidentals to the price&mdash;delivery and that sort of thing&mdash;would be allowed for, same as last year or previous years. The price announced in previous years was the ex-farm price, so that the Minister in recently announcing that the farmer would have to pay for sacks and for delivery, has definitely worsened <Col N="2319" /> the position.  When I suggest 30/- for feeding barley, I make a very modest demand in the present circumstances. Thirty shillings per barrel means 15/- a cwt.  If that barley be put up alone without mixing in oats&mdash;the Minister has not informed us whether he proposes to continue the mixture or not&mdash; and if it is sold back to the farmer in a dry state, made up in cwt. bags, it will cost around 18/- per cwt. delivered to the farmer.  That allows for the shrinkage, milling and merchants' profits.</P>
    <P>Wheat at £2 amounts to 16/- a cwt., so that the farmer, in buying back barley at 18/&mdash;even at its present price, which I believe is not sufficient&mdash; will have to pay 2/- per cwt. more for feeding barley in its dry state than he is getting for his wheat.  The tendency on the part of any intelligent farmer who goes into costings will be to keep a portion of his wheat back and feed it, with oats, instead of buying barley. That point must weigh with the Minister when considering this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also fixed the price of malting barley.  I do not know why he interfered with the price of malting barley at all.  He is aware that Messrs. Guinness and the Beet Growers' Association negotiated the price of malting barley in recent years.  More or less the price of barley was anchored to the price of wheat.  If the price of wheat went up, the price of barley would automatically go up.  The price of wheat was 35/- last year and, in relation to that, a price of 30/- was fixed for malting barley.  It is unfair to those people who have always been producing malting barley that the Minister should interfere and fix a price of 30/-.  That applies only to a limited quantity of malting barley, grown on light, sharp land, which will produce barley of excellent quality, the yield being very often low.  Farmers know that they cannot grow an excellent sample of bright, malting barley on rich land.  Such land will grow too much straw and produce poor grain, dark in colour.  You will not get from it that excellent, bright sample that you get on other types of soil.  If you grow for quality, you must sacrifice to <Col N="2320" /> quality.  That sacrifice to ensure quality must be made good somewhere. The people who are buying that barley are prepared to pay for the quality, and I think it is unfair that the Minister should interfere at all.  If the people who represent the barley growers, those who have looked after the interests of those who grew malting barley in the past, are able to negotiate a better price with Messrs. Guinness, I do not think that the Minister should interfere.</P>
    <P>I believe that Messrs. Guinness would be prepared to pay a higher price. What is the Minister doing in effect? He is simply taking money out of the pockets of the farmers who grow malting barley and putting it into the pockets of the shareholders of Messrs. Guinness.  I have nothing to say against Messrs. Guinness.  They are a very useful firm to this country and, in recent years especially, I think they have behaved in a decent way and paid a decent price to the people who grew malting barley for them.  On reconsideration of the whole matter, I think the Minister will have to agree with me that there is no necessity whatever to interfere or fix a price for malting barley.  I do not know whether the Minister may think it necessary to fix a quota in respect of the malting barley that will go to Messrs. Guinness, but at all events the amount of barley that will go to Messrs. Guinness will be of first class excellent quality, and the people who load that type of barley are, at least, entitled to the price that Messrs. Guinness are prepared to pay. They are entitled to the price that the people who represent these growers are able to negotiate with Messrs. Guinness.</P>
    <P>As to the price of oats, what strikes me as rather peculiar is that the Minister in fixing the prices of all grain has fixed one price only.  Take the price of oats at 1/4 a stone or 18/8 per barrel.  Irrespective of quality, the Minister fixes a maximum or, if you like, minimum price.  Is the man who grows a sample of oats of excellent quality that will bushel well, that will bushel 42 or 43 lbs., to get only the same price as the man whose oats will bushel 37 or 38 lbs.?  I do not think it fair <Col N="2321" /> to suggest that the man who grows a good quality oats, or indeed grain of any description, should be asked to accept the same price as a man who grows a poor quality and who possibly saves it at a bad time, in wet weather. The man who gives his grain the attention necessary to ensure that it will be in good condition, and that it will bushel well, is not going to get any credit for that work when it comes to fixing the price.  If the Minister is afraid that prices will go too high and wants to prevent that&mdash;after all that is the meaning of fixing a price for anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not mean that last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Many of us would be glad to see a guaranteed price to ensure that people who have to sell early when there is a glut on the market, and when prices are likely to fall, would get that minimum guaranteed price.  The Minister, however, thinks it necessary to peg the price so that it cannot go up.  I suggest that there should be a minimum and a maximum price&mdash;that is a minimum quality, and a maximum quality, price so that a poor quality oats would be worth a certain minimum price and a good quality oats worth a certain maximum price.  The same argument applies to wheat.  When the Minister says that there is a price of 40/- for wheat bushelling 59 lbs., what about wheat that will bushel 65 lbs.? Remember that wheat bushelling 65 lbs. gives a poorer yield per acre than wheat bushelling say, 59 lbs.  If you take Queen Wilhelmina, it will bushel about 59 lbs., whereas April Red which is a high bushelling wheat of excellent milling quality is a low yielder.  Is it fair to ask a man to take the same price for wheat of a high bushelling quality, which gives a low yield as for wheat of a low bushelling quality which gives a higher yield?  Incidentally, one is a white wheat and the other is a red wheat and, from the bakers' point of view, the gluten content of red wheat is greater than that of white wheat.  For that reason it makes better baking flour altogether.  Taking all these <Col N="2322" /> factors into account, I think the Minister in fixing prices ought not to overlook quality and the only way to determine quality is by bushelling.  If the Minister fixes a price on the basis of 59 lbs. per bushel, he should fix a rising scale allowing for so much per lb. above that so as to ensure that the man who has wheat of good quality in good condition will be paid for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister in considering this matter ought not to overlook the fact that there is a possibility of a bad season.  Let us hope that it will not be a bad season; it would be disastrous if we had a bad season but, if we are to experience bad conditions during the harvesting operations, is the man who does his job well, to ensure that the moisture content is reduced to the minimum, going to get no more for his wheat than the man who is careless about his job and who is satisfied to deliver it in any sort of reasonable condition?  There is no inducement or no encouragement there for a man to put his best effort into the job, to do it as it should be done, in the best possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the order made by the Minister that grain must be sold to a dealer only.  I think that is not fair at all.  Why should a dealer be brought in where a deal can be effected between one farmer and another?  I do not think it would be necessary to give a dealer a profit in that case.  In any case, I think it unnecessary to have a dealer's licence to buy grain generally.  I would agree with the Minister that it is absolutely right that a man should have a licence to handle seed&mdash;seed wheat especially. It is right that the Minister should license certain men to assemble wheat for next year, men who would be properly equipped for that purpose, who would have sufficient lofts and cleaning machinery, who will be in a position to select the best samples and to know something about the job.  That in itself is, if you like, specialised work.  For that reason it is right and proper that we should select the best people to do that job so as to ensure that we shall have good seed next year but, generally, I do not think it necessary that grain should pass through <Col N="2323" /> the dealer all the time or that he should get his bit of profit out of every transaction, particularly if one neighbour wants to buy grain from another. A question on this matter was put down recently by Deputy Keating and the Minister promised to consider it. I think that on further consideration he will come to agree to our point of view.</P>
    <P>When speaking about dealers' profits, I might mention that there is a margin of 1/6 allowed to grain merchants who handle wheat for the miller.  I suggest to the Minister that when a farmer sells direct to the miller, the miller should not be permitted to put that 1/6 in his pocket.  It is only fair in that case that the farmer should get the 1/6.  If he is in a position to act as his own agent, he is entitled to agent's fees.  In that case the farmer ought to get the 1/6 instead of letting the miller put it in his pocket. I know for a fact that that allowance of 1/6 has meant that certain organisations have been set up in this country to capture that commission and divide it amongst themselves.  I know that one particular organisation was set up last year.  It practically amounted to a racket.  They simply came in and claimed the 1/6.  There was no question of handling the wheat. It was a question of buying and asking that grain should be delivered to a certain miller.  It was bought by a group of people who formed themselves into a company to capture that 1/6.  They were not a group of farmers. The way to stop that is to allow a farmer who delivers his wheat direct to the miller to earn his own commission.  That will be an inducement to farmers to arrange as far as possible to deliver directly to the mill.</P>
    <P>I take it that we shall hear the views of Deputies representing agricultural interests on all sides of the House on this motion, and I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House. It is a very important matter.  We want to be very reasonable about it.  We are not asking excessive prices in any way.  We are asking a reasonable price, a price that will encourage people to till more land next year.  We merely <Col N="2324" /> ask a price that will prove to men who have done their work in a very indifferent manner, and who do not believe in tillage&mdash;and I have observed many of them; I have observed grain crops that are thin and poor because they were neglected at a critical stage when they most needed attention in the way of rolling and harrowing&mdash;that it is a really profitable pursuit, well worthy of more care and attention.  The reason their crops were neglected was simply because they did not believe there was any profit in tillage.  Those people believe that the man who carries out extensive cultivation can only do so at a loss.  I suggest the Minister ought to take his courage in his hands and adopt a bold policy, and show those people that tillage is profitable, if a man is prepared to do his job well.  If the Minister does that, he will find our people are sufficiently enterprising to respond to the call.  Let him take off his inspectors, and let the farmers do their work voluntarily&mdash;and they will do it in that fashion if it is made worth their while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion. When, during the last two years, I appealed to the Minister at various times to prevent the farmers from being victimised in the sale of their grain&mdash;as they were being, to the Minister's knowledge&mdash;I little thought that when the Minister eventually came to arrange, not a minimum price, but a fixed price, that he was prepared to victimise the farmers almost to the same extent as they were victimised in previous years.  The prices fixed for this year's crop are relatively little better than those obtaining last year, if we make allowance for the increased cost of seeds and manures, the almost certain increase in the cost of reaping and, eventually, an increase in the cost of threshing and transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the knowledge of every Deputy, seed wheat was sold almost universally this year at £3 to £4, 20/- to 40/- above the price the Minister has now fixed.  The same occurred in the case of barley, though I have not the same knowledge of barley as I have of wheat.  Oats were sold at 1/6 a stone, or 21/- a barrel, over the fixed price. <Col N="2325" /> If we relate this to the ultimate crop it has this effect, that it reduces the fixed price by something like 2d. a stone.  If the farmer was forced to pay 1/6 a stone or 21/- a barrel more than the price now fixed for seed oats, it necessarily follows that when he is compelled to sell his oats for 18/8 a barrel, or 1/4 a stone, the loss on the seed that he put in will have the effect of reducing the average return by something like 2d. a stone. You actually knock 2d. off the 1/4 by the increased cost of seed this spring.</P>
    <P>The cost of manures, as Deputy Hughes said&mdash;where they can be procured, and very few farmers can procure sufficient&mdash;is up by 80 per cent. or 100 per cent.  Farmers who cut their own grain will have additional expenses in the cost of petrol, oil, etc.  Smaller farmers who engage a hired reaper will have to pay more.  The reapers have already intimated that they will charge more.  Threshing will be dearer.  A well-known man who threshes a good deal in the Minister's county told me the prices there would be considerably advanced.  That applies to every other county.  The cost of the transport of the grain will be dearer and there will be difficulty in some cases in carrying the grain.  That difficulty may be got over, but it will cost more.</P>
    <P>The increase the Minister has offered has disappeared at the start by reason of the increase in the cost of seeds, manures, harvesting, threshing and transport.  The farmer will not be any better off than he was last year and he will still be the victim of the indisposition to give him a fair crack of the whip.  If the Minister had not chosen to interfere this year, there is almost a certainty that the price of grain would be higher than the fixed price.  I am not advocating anything along those lines.  I have been appealing to the Minister as a fair and just man for two years to prevent the farmers being victimised.  I did not expect the Minister to adopt the rôle of victimising the farmer.</P>
    <P>Some nights ago the Taoiseach said that the food supply was the most important thing in the life of the State, that it probably ranked in front of defence. I am in total agreement with <Col N="2326" /> the Taoiseach's statement, but if we expect the farmers in the first line of defence to make the maximum effort to meet the nation's needs, just as we expect the soldiers in the other line of defence to make theirs, it is only reasonable that the farmer should get some adequate compensation for making that effort.  None of the farmers can afford to be, even if they so willed, unpaid volunteers in this fight for existence. As regards the price of wheat, the Government are at the moment endeavouring to obtain wheat from other countries.  It is right and proper that they should, and more luck to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are anxiously endeavouring to get it anywhere and at any cost.  I believe its cost at Dublin port is £3 to £3 3s. 0d. a barrel, and maybe more.  They are prepared to pay for ships anywhere to bring that wheat here.  They are prepared to pay almost any price for the ships to bring the wheat here at £3 a barrel, yet the same Government are not prepared to give the farmer at home a reasonable price for producing the wheat that they say is as good as the wheat they are getting from other countries.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that practically our full requirements in wheat could be produced next year if the State were as generous in their payment to the farmers as they are for wheat, imported under grave difficulties, from foreign countries.  Deputy Hughes covered practically all the ground necessary in order to make our case for increased prices.  The increases that we are asking are not exorbitant. We have no objection to the Minister fixing prices, as we want to prevent a repetition of the ramp experienced last year and the year before.  In preventing that ramp, we do not want the Minister to set such a low price for the farmer as will leave him little better off than he was last year, in fact no better off.  The Minister himself admitted that the prices given last year to the farmer were out of reason, lower than they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> Deputy Hughes said that there should be a premium on quality.  I agree that wheat bushelling 63 or 64 lbs. ought to get a better price than wheat bushelling 58 or 59 lbs., and that oats bushelling 43 and 44 lbs. ought to bring a higher price than oats of lower grade. There should be some attempt made to fix a price according to quality.  The main point is that the prices fixed by the Minister are not fair in relation to the cost of production this year, which included an extra price for seeds this spring, the extra cost of threshing and harvest transport.  I believe that if there was an honest expression of opinion by Deputies they would agree with me on that.  Therefore, I say that the margin left to the farmer will be very small if last year's prices are not considerably increased. We know that there was considerable dissatisfaction in connection with last year's prices.  If that situation is going to be repeated, then the same dissatisfaction will exist this year.  In this hour of the country's need an inducement must be made to every section of the community to pull its full weight. Such inducements have been offered in various directions, but so far no inducement has been offered to the farmer.</P>
    <P>The argument will be made that present prices are fair prices.  They might be in normal conditions, but they certainly are not in a war period when the Government ask and expect, as they have every right to, a maximum effort from every individual in the country in the production of essential commodities.  While a genuine extra effort was made this year to increase production it would, in my opinion, have been far greater if fair prices had been offered to the farmers.  We are not asking extravagant prices.  A price of 50/- for wheat is just a relatively good price, as is 30/- for barley and at least 21/- for oats.  No one can say that 21/- is an extravagant price to ask for oats when we consider the times in which we are living.  I know the Minister's answer will be the effect that such a price would have on the cost of feeding stuffs.  Whenever any of us mentioned feeding stuffs <Col N="2328" /> during the last four or five months we were told that there were certain people who could make money out of feeding, and that there was a good time ahead this year: that even if the Minister advanced the price of grain a couple of pence per stone it would be all right, since it was held that feeding stuffs would be considerably cheaper than they were during this spring or summer.  I do not think there is any farmer in this State who feeds animals who will hesitate to give his support for a little extra for the various cereals, oats, barley and wheat&mdash;that is, so long as the price is not an extravagant one.  Considering the times in which we are living, no one, I think, can say that the prices suggested by Deputy Hughes, 21/-, 30/- and 50/-, for oats, barley and wheat, respectively, are extravagant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think conditions have altered so much since as to warrant the change of front that we have witnessed this evening.  I think it is reasonable that the price of barley meal should be anchored to the price of wheat.  I say that definitely as a farmer who is anxious to see all the wheat that is grown in the country this year used for human consumption instead of animal consumption.  If you have to buy barley meal round about £18 10s. 0d. a ton, and if farmers have to sell their wheat at £16 a ton, then, naturally, they are going to feed the wheat to animals.  That risk is there, and it is a very definite one.  I urge <Col N="2329" /> on the Minister to see that the price of barley meal and the price of wheat are at the same level If that is not done, then roughly about 20 per cent. of the wheat grown by the agricultural community this year will be fed to live stock.  Anyone who has any knowledge of the value of wheat for feeding purposes to fowl or live stock, as compared to barley, will admit the truth of that assertion.  If to-day's prices for oats and barley are bad, the unfortunate farmers of the country can put the blame for that on Deputy Bennett and Deputy Linehan, who put a motion down asking the Minister to fix prices. Deputy Bennett comes from the large grain-growing county of Limerick, where they always ploughed and grew grain, and with him is Deputy Linehan, who has no knowledge whatever of agriculture.  They asked the Minister to fix a price for oats and barley.</P>

      <P>Then they come along here and complain because the Minister has taken advantage of the situation which they created.  I consider it very unfair of Deputy Bennett, after making the trouble, to come in here <Col N="2330" /> and complain about it.  He should not do so.  I do not think Deputy Bennett's constituents will thank him one bit for what he is doing, because we will have to feed them this winter.  We have always had to feed them.  There is not enough grain grown in County Limerick to feed the hens that are there.  Deputy Bennett's constituents will not be thankful to him for trying to increase the price to them.  I do not think the Minister had any right whatever to interfere in the price of barley to brewers.  For the past five years we have always met the brewers every year and fixed fairly good prices with them.  We had fixed the price for this year, and the Minister, in fixing the price of malting barley, is taking at least £1 a barrel out of the farmers' pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to face facts, and facts are stubborn things.  We fixed the price last year with Messrs. Guinness, and we entered into an agreement with them for this year.  We anchored the price of barley to the price of wheat; let the Minister lift one as far as he likes, the other follows.  We did a good job for the farmers in any case, whatever about anyone else.  I have no sympathy as far as the brewers are concerned.  From 1919 to 1922, the price of barley was somewhere between 48/- and 52/- a barrel, while the price of the pint of stout was the same as it was up to last year, and the duty on the pint of stout was the same as it was up to last year.  For 14 or 15 years in this country, when the brewers succeeded in forcing the price of barley down to 14/- a barrel&mdash;and I saw it at that&mdash;they took the difference between 14/- and 52/- and put it into their pockets as excess profit.  At the price fixed by the Minister at present, 30/- a barrel for barley, the brewers have 22/- a barrel more profit than they had during the last war.  Despite that, the moment there was an extra bit of duty put on here, they jumped the price of the stout and jumped the price of the whiskey.  I have no sympathy with those profiteers, who apparently have succeeded in closing the eyes of the <Col N="2331" /> Prices Commission, and I have my doubts as to how they closed them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but the fact remains that we have had that continuing for a number of years, as must be apparent to anyone who watched the dividends on Guinness shares from 1918 to 1922, and who watched the price which the farmers got for their barley being knocked down step by step, month by month and year by year, until the time came when the farmer had to deliver his barley to them in September, and they told him at Christmas what they would give him for it.  That was the condition of affairs in Cork county in 1930 and 1931. The price of barley at that time was 14/- per barrel, and the difference between that 14/- and the 48/- or 52/- paid during the war was taken by Messrs. Guinness and put down into their pockets.  That may suit the Minister for Finance, in view of excess profits or something else, but it did not suit the unfortunate farmer who was paying the piper for the whole thing.  Certainly, in my opinion, there should have been no interference with the price of malting barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the price of oats is fair enough.  As compared with other things I think the price of oats is reasonable.  Whatever amount of oats is grown in the country this year, and whatever barley is not taken up by the brewers, will have to be bought by the farming community; they have no other feeding stuffs.  Between now and 15th August, when the harvest will be in, the Minister should publish the price of barley meal, the price of oats, and the price of oatmeal to the consumer&mdash;the difference between the price at which the farmers' stuff will go in to those people and the price at which it will come out to the farmer. That should be published.  We are <Col N="2332" /> entitled to get that at any rate.  In addition to that, the price of seed wheat should be published before the farmer sells his harvest this year, so that if the farmer considers the price exorbitant he can hold his own oats for seed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, a lot of them cannot do it.  Deputy Hughes stated that there should be further inducement to the farmers to grow wheat next year.  In my opinion, at any rate, and I stated it here before, the point at issue is not so much a matter of price; it is the absolute impossibility of getting sufficient credit to buy the seed, and the one thing that this House should definitely insist on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy, I take all I can get.  I do not think that £2 a barrel for wheat this year is as good as the price we got for it last year or the year before, taking into consideration the fleecing that the agricultural community got from a gang of profiteering merchants during last year.  No step was taken to stop them from charging 70/- a barrel for seed wheat which they bought for 35/-.  There is no mystery about it.  I gave the whole facts of that profiteering here in this House.  There are, undoubtedly, two definite things that we shall have to watch this year: No. 1, the prices that we sell at, and, No. 2, the prices that we buy at.  I say that on the day we are selling we should know the price we are going to buy at.  If we sell barley at 30/- a barrel, we should know the <Col N="2333" /> price of barley meal, and if we sell oats we should know the price of crushed oats and oaten meal.  Those things should be published before the harvest, so as not to have the farmers in the blind position of selling their stuff first and then being at the mercy of every twopenny ha'penny thief that comes along to rob them.  They robbed them last year, and they will rob them again this year if they are let.</P>
      <P>There is another point that I wish to emphasise to the Minister, and it is this.  We should endeavour, so far as we can, to prevent any vested interests from climbing up around the production of wheat by the farmer and the sale of that wheat to the miller.  If you do not prevent that, the farmers will find themselves, year by year, getting less while these middlemen are getting more.  This year the Minister is allowing 1/6 to the dealers.  I say this much here openly, that for any wheat that I shall sell to a miller this year he will have to pay me that 1/6, and if he does not pay it he will not get my wheat, and I intend advising farmers in my constituency along the same lines and organising them along the same lines.</P>

      <P>We saw enough of the &ldquo;co-ops&rdquo;.  Take this difference.  I am selling my wheat to-morrow.  In the ordinary course, I would bring that wheat the six or six-and-a-half miles into the millers in Cork City, but under the present arrangement it will pay me to go out into Donoughmore, get a dealer there and sell the wheat to him and let him sell it to the miller in Cork rather than that I should sell it to him. I will get 9d. a barrel more, at least, by doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have another day at that.  I do not want to delay with it at the moment, because I want to stick to the point I am at.  Those are facts and they have continued for <Col N="2334" /> a number of years.  There is gradually growing up a definite vested interest, stepping in between the producer of the food and the miller, between the producer of the wheat and the miller, and I say that any farmer who sells his wheat direct to a miller is entitled to that 1/6 at any rate, that he has the same right to that 1/6 as anybody in this country, and a better right to it than the dealer.  I think we should insist on that 1/6 being handed over, anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot control the rake-off.  I know where I stand in it, and I know where every farmer stands in it.  There is only one remedy, and that is to keep the power of that vested interest as low and as small as you can.  There are too many drones at the present day living on the farmers' sweat.  There are too many of these get-rich-quick gentlemen doing that, like the gentleman whose case I mentioned in the House some time ago, who wanted £66,000 profit.  There are too many of these people hanging around, living on the farmers' sweat. You have these vested interests, and you have the middleman who has to come between the farmer and the miller, and I say definitely that the farmer who delivers or sells his wheat direct to the miller is definitely entitled to that 1/6 and will have to get it.  In my opinion, the price of wheat should be definitely anchored to the price of barley meal.  The two of them should be on the one level.  If they are not, the people of this country, the ordinary community here, are going to lose as much larger proportion than they can afford to lose of the wheat which should go into bread, because there is no farmer who is going to sell his wheat at £16 and then go in and buy barley meal at £18 10s. 0d.</P>

I do not wish to delay the House because other Deputies are anxious to speak, and I should like to hear every farmer Deputy or every Deputy from a rural constituency speaking on this.  I am giving my own views and, in my opinion, they are the views of the people of my constituency also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to score any Party points against the Minister in regard to the prices he has fixed, but I intend to appeal to his good nature and his good sense.  I think that in fixing these prices he has made a very serious mistake, and a mistake which may have disastrous results for the entire economic future of the country.  Our entire existence as a nation depends upon the tillage side of farming being promoted and developed to the fullest extent, and it is, therefore, absolutely essential that the man engaged in tillage farming should be assured of a decent remuneration for his labour and his risk.  The farmer is compelled by law to pay a fixed minimum wage to his workers.  It is absolutely essential, therefore, that the price he secures for the produce of his own labour and of the labour of his employees should be sufficient to enable him to pay that wage and also to secure that wage for himself and the members of his family who are engaged in labour on the farm.  Now, I am satisfied that the prices of 18/8 per barrel for oats, of 28/- for feeding barley, of 30/- for malting barley, and of 40/- for wheat, are not sufficient to provide those engaged in the work of production with the fixed agricultural wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those who appealed to the Minister for Agriculture, again and <Col N="2336" /> again, to institute a system of recording costs of production in agriculture. When it was decided, during the last Great War, by the British Government, to institute a system of price fixation we had, at the same time, a system by which the costs of production were ascertained and recorded.  A number of farms were put under test, and the costs of production were carefully accounted and estimated.  That was done under the former Government, but when our own Government took office they dropped that system and, since then, it has been discontinued. It has been discontinued simply because any recording of costs of production during the past 20 years would have proved that agriculture was an uneconomic proposition, that the farmer was either paying his men slave wages or allowing his dependents and himself no wages, or else he was working his farm at a substantial loss.</P>
    <P>Now, a number of farmers in different counties were asked to go into the cost of producing wheat, barley and oats for the present year, and owing to the different systems of computing costs their figures were not exactly the same.  That is why I am suggesting that there should be an official system, under the Department of Agriculture, for recording costs. The average costs computed by a number of organised farmers in different counties have worked out at £12 10s. 0d. per statute acre for oats and barley, and £16 per statute acre for wheat.  These are average costs.  If you take the average production per acre of oats, barley and wheat as supplied by the Banking Commission for the three years ending 1936, which were exceptionally good grain-growing years, the average yield per acre in this country was 8½ barrels for wheat; 11 barrels for oats and 10 barrels for barley.  Now 11 barrels of oats at 18/8 per barrel would be £10 odd, thereby leaving the farmer with a net loss of over £1 per acre on the growing of oats.  Again, wheat at the average yield would leave a small profit and barley at 10 barrels per acre at 30/- per barrel would also leave a small profit.  That is why I entirely disagree with Deputy Corry when he <Col N="2337" /> says that he is satisfied with the price of oats.  I am satisfied that there is a definite loss on the growing of oats at less than £1 per barrel and I do not see any reason why those farmers who grow oats, that is farmers in the poorer counties, should be compelled to grow it at less.</P>
    <P>We may be told in regard to oats and barley that the product of the farmer's labour is required by farmers as feeding stuffs, but no farmer demands that his fellow farmers should provide him with feeding stuffs at a price less than the cost of production. If we are to engage in the production of grain, it is absolutely essential that all grain crops should be sold at such a price as will leave the producer some small margin of profit. So far as the price of wheat is concerned, a very important factor enters into consideration, and that is that in order to ensure that wheat is reserved for human consumption, the price of wheat must be substantially higher per cwt. than the price of oats or barley, as otherwise there would be an irresistible temptation to farmers to use wheat as a feeding stuff.</P>
    <P>All the Deputies who have spoken&mdash; Deputy Hughes, Deputy Bennett and Deputy Corry&mdash;have strongly urged that the price of wheat should be substantially increased, and I think there is an unanswerable case for the price demanded last spring of 50/- per barrel.  I am not satisfied that the prices suggested by Deputy Hughes for oats and barley are sufficient to meet the cost of production.  I think that at least 25/- is essential for oats and 32/- or 32/6 for barley.  Those prices would, having regard to the average yield in the Twenty-Six Counties, enable the farmer to meet his production costs without having to suffer a loss.  In this matter, even farmers themselves are inclined to differ.  Farmers on good land may labour under the impression that £1 per barrel for oats might be sufficient.  But we have to take the average yield over the Twenty-Six Counties.  It is essential, if the requirements of this country in regard to grain are to be met, that not only the good land should be cultivated, but also that the inferior land should be <Col N="2338" /> put under cultivation and that the entire area under tillage should be very substantially increased during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I was appealing to the Minister's good sense and good nature, and I think he has plenty of both.  I think he has still time to remedy the mistake he made with regard to the prices now fixed for oats and barley, and also the mistake he made earlier in the year in regard to the price of wheat.  The feeling of farmers throughout the country is that the price of oats and barley has been fixed this year, not to ensure that the farmers will get a decent price, but in order to prevent prices from going too high.  Last year farmers complained bitterly that the price was excessively low and, when they asked for some increase, they were told that any increase would increase the cost of feeding stuffs.  We know what happened afterwards. We know the price that feeders of poultry and pigs had to pay for feeding stuffs in the latter half of the year.  We know that the miserable prices which the growers got for their produce did not in any way help the feeders of poultry, pigs, and other live stock.  They only had the result of putting easy money into the pockets of middlemen and profiteers.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot escape from the accusation that he is fixing prices this year, not to help the farmers, not to help the growers, but in order to prevent them from getting good prices. For that reason, I ask the Minister to reconsider the prices fixed.  It is no answer to say that any increase will increase the cost of feeding stuffs.  You cannot maintain agricultural production in any branch when the cost of the finished article is less than the cost of production.  The whole policy in regard to agriculture in this country must be based on the fact that the agricultural labourer is getting a minimum wage of 30/- per week, which is not a very high wage by any means, and it is essential that the farmers must be in a position to get that wage also for his dependents and for himself, and have some little margin of profit on his business.  For that reason and in order to enable such a small <Col N="2339" /> profit to be made, it is essential that those prices should be revised.</P>

      <P>It is only natural that I, as a farmer, should be anxious, if it were possible, to see those prices increased far more than they are at present; but I realise that we have to face facts and that those who are confronted with the fixing of the price of cereals had to take all the relevant facts into consideration.  I was rather surprised to find Deputy Hughes abandoning the position he took up last February when this question of the price of wheat came before the House.  I do not see any reason for that change of attitude on the part of Deputy Hughes.</P>

      <P>I do not see any reason for changing that attitude, since the cost of labour, the cost of manures and all the other costs connected with the growing of wheat could have been visualised last February as clearly as we see them now.  Personally I should like it if I conscientiously could get a higher price for grain crops, but we cannot have it both ways.  I expect that this wheat, for which 40/- a barrel will be paid this season, will be milled into flour for sale to the Irish public, and from what I can gather that will mean a substantial increase in the price of the loaf to all and sundry, including those who can pretty well afford to pay for it and those who can but ill afford to pay for it.  The farmers of the country, from what I know of them, would not try to hold the country to ransom in respect of the price of wheat or flour, and particularly they would not wish to hold the poorer members of the community to ransom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of play was made by some of the speakers in regard to the increased price for barley and oats.  I want to speak my mind candidly, and, as a grower of the three cereals mentioned, my opinion is that the price of barley, taking all the circumstances into consideration, is fixed at a somewhat high figure.  After all, to whom do the farmers think oats and barley will be sold?  They will be sold, of course, to other farmers, to the industrious farmers, and particularly to the smaller type of farmer living on the hillside, who probably has not land of his own to grow these crops, and who will use them for feeding to live stock in order that he and his family may eke out the necessaries of life.  If the prices of these cereals were fixed at such a figure, coupled with the transport, storage, kiln-drying and milling expenses attached to them, as not to leave a margin of profit to the feeder, the feeder would naturally leave the crop on the grower's hands.  On the other hand, if a fair price is fixed for barley and oats, the growers will not <Col N="2341" /> discontinue the growing of these cereals for sale.  If you got four farmers, each representative of one of our provinces, I do not think you could get agreement on what the price of oats and barley should be.</P>
    <P>I am saying that as a farmer, but we may as well face the facts.  I am backed up in that view by the reverse opinions expressed by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan in this debate.  One suggested a certain price and the other a far bigger price.  In this connection, I think it would give rise to less confusion in the public mind if the prices were fixed on a standard weight, on cwts. because the barrel of wheat, as we know, is 20 stone, the barrel of barley, 16 stone, and the barrel of oats, 14 stone.</P>
    <P>The only thing that troubles me about this matter is that the price of barley, to my mind, is somewhat high.  I think it should be somewhere around 26/- per barrel, or 13/- per cwt., in order to bear the costs which are bound to fall on it between the producer and the consumer.  The bacon industry must depend on home-grown cereals now, and, if the pig feeders cannot get feeding stuffs at a price which would allow them a reasonable margin of profit, they will naturally go out of production, which would mean a serious loss not only to those engaged in the feeding industry, but also to the industrial side, the bacon curers, the transport services, etc.  I suggest to the Minister that the prices of feeding stuffs manufactured from home-grown cereals be fixed by order and, further, that the price of seed oats, barley and wheat, be fixed for the grower, and the retail price also fixed for next season. There is no use in trying to compare the prices fixed at present with the prices fixed last spring for the various seeds.  As farmers, we all know that the price prevailing last spring was too high, and we do not want a repetition of that.  It would undoubtedly not be wise to increase the price of wheat this season when the Government is trying to keep down inflation and to keep down prices. I think it would not be fair to ask those affected by the standstill order, as it is called, Order 83, to pay a very <Col N="2342" /> much increased price for their loaf for the coming year.  Taking all the circumstances into consideration, I believe, while I might not be in full agreement as to the price of barley, that at least an honest attempt was made to do justice between all concerned, from the grower to the consumer.</P>

      <P>I think I should place on record my intense gratitude to Deputy Corry for the great compliment he paid Deputy Bennett and myself.  I was not aware at any time that either Deputy Bennett or I had anything like the influence with the Minister for Agriculture that Deputy Corry supposes we have.  I am absolutely astounded.  If I had the faintest idea that my influence with the Minister was so great there are a thousand and one other things I would have loved to have told the Minister.  I did not think he would take very much notice of what I would say and I was satisfied until to-night that we were talking to a stone wall very often.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry says that the motion standing in Deputy Bennett's and my name early in the year was the cause of the Minister fixing the prices now and the cause of the prices he did fix.  What Deputy Corry hopes to make out of that, I do not know because, if he went to the trouble of reading the motion that was down on that occasion he would find it was not a motion asking for fixed <Col N="2343" /> prices at all.  It was a motion asking for guaranteed minimum prices in order to avoid the losses that occurred last year.  Deputy Corry seems to be concerned&mdash;I am sure more in sorrow than in anger&mdash;about the feelings that the farmers of the constituency I represent are going to have towards me after that.  He suggests that they will not be very satisfied with what I have done for them.  In other words, because I induced the Minister to make the order fixing these prices, they will not be quite satisfied.  Deputy Corry came in here and made a speech.  He wants to support this motion and he wants bigger prices but he could not say outright that he wants bigger prices.  He knows as well as I do that he wants bigger prices and he hinted that he wants bigger prices but he was not going to commit himself to saying so.  We had two different opinions from the Fianna Fáil Benches to-night. We had Deputy Corry, who wants bigger prices but who does not want to say so, and then Deputy Meaney who, honestly enough, admitted that he thought the price of barley was too high.  I think that Deputy Corry would be very well advised, when he is speaking to a motion like this, to tell us what he really means and not to worry about the influence that Deputy Bennett and myself may have on the Minister's judgment or what effect anything I may say in this House will have on the farmers of North Cork.  I am sure when that position comes to be threshed out, Deputy Meaney and myself will be quite capable of threshing it out without the intervention of Deputy Corry, who seems to suggest that the farmers had to sell in a losing market and that this year they hoped to sell in a rising market.  In the early part of the year, our motion was put down for the express purpose of preventing what happened last year, preventing the type of thing that Deputy Meaney was referring to, not alone as far as animal feeding stuffs were concerned but as far as human foodstuffs were concerned, to prevent the sort of thing that happened when unfortunate people sold their oats at 7/6 a cwt. and are now paying 5/6 a stone for oatmeal.  That is what we <Col N="2344" /> want to prevent.  If the Minister's order went some distance in preventing that sort of thing certainly the order was justified and the only thing I am sorry about is that the Minister did not make any order he was making on those lines early in the year or at the time of the sowing season.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the price he fixed for oats is high enough.  I am more interested in oats than anything else. I am not going to ask the Minister for anything impossible but I think a reasonable price for oats&mdash;and I am giving the opinion of many people who have spoken to me on the subject&mdash; would be 21/- a barrel, or 14/- a cwt. 1/6 a stone was their idea of a fair price for oats.  I think that is a reasonable price for oats.  As Deputy Meaney knows, there is quite a number of people in the constituency I represent who, owing to their financial and economic position, find it necessary to cash their crop immediately after the harvest and, of course, those are the people whom the Minister has to cater for, the people who cannot afford to hold their crop.  There are others who have not enough accommodation even if their financial resources would permit them to hold their crop.  Those are the people that, early in the year, I was particularly anxious to cater for and for whom I am still anxious to cater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the extraordinary reference from Deputy Corry, again, when he spoke about this gentleman who was going to get £66,000.  I would hesitate lest I should wrong Deputy Corry but I understood&mdash;possibly I was wrong&mdash; at that time that a certain gentleman in the country had bought a lot of oats from the farmers, undoubtedly at a very low price, and that at some time later he proposed to sell it to the millers at a figure which would allow him a profit of £66,000.  Whether I am wronging Deputy Corry or not I do not know, but I understand that he was throwing up his hands in holy horror at the idea of anyone in this country being clever enough to get away with buying cereals, holding them for some time and then holding the millers up to ransom and making a profit.  What happened?  No matter who bought from <Col N="2345" /> the farmers at that time the farmers were not going to get any more.  Anybody could have bought at this low price.  But what hurt Deputy Corry's feelings was that this man was clever enough to get in before the millers and then when the price went up he sold it to the millers at the price ruling at the moment, making a profit of £66,000.  It was a business transaction and I am quite sure if that man had not acted at all and if the millers went to the farmers at the time that man bought from the farmers the millers would have paid the farmers the very same price.  I have never yet heard that they are so magnanimous as to pay more than they need.</P>
    <P>I resent anybody like Deputy Corry attempting to make a case of this nature.  This motion was not put down for the fun of it.  Neither was the motion that was down early in the year put down for the fun of it.  If that motion did induce the Minister to fix the prices now, I am not responsible, and neither is any other Deputy in the House unless he was consulted by the Minister about it.  As to the prices fixed by the Minister, if I were satisfied with the prices fixed, I would say so. If I am not satisfied, I am entitled to say I am not satisfied.  I do not claim to be an expert like Deputy Meaney in the growing of the three crops.  I am talking about the crop I know most about&mdash;oats&mdash;and I am quite satisfied that a fair price for oats is 21/- a barrel.  Would the Minister say if I am correct in saying that on one occasion, in consultation with the millers, it was suggested to his Department that a price of about 12/6 a cwt. would have been a fair price for oats early in the year?  I do not know if that is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember.  I wonder if Deputy Meaney was quite accurate when he said that labour costs and everything else could have been visualised quite clearly last February.  I very much doubt if, in the present state of the world, there is anybody long-sighted enough to be able to visualise anything over a period such as from February to July.  I hope that Deputy Meaney can do it, as, if he is <Col N="2346" /> able to visualise things that will happen, he will become very much richer.</P>

      <P>I do not believe there is any good in talking, when there is a question of increased prices, about farmers holding up the country to ransom.  There is no farmer who wants to prevent anybody from getting bread at reasonable prices.  However, I put up a case that this is a question of farmers in general not being satisfied that they can produce wheat at the price.  That is the first of Deputy Meaney's evils.  They will find it hard to produce, as they cannot get a profitable price.  If there is an increase, on the other hand, you have the second of his evils, that it will make the loaf dearer.  Somewhere between these two points you must find an alternative, if you want to get a price that will keep people in production, and want to get the oats milled and turned into bread at a price that will prevent any great increase in the price of bread.  Surely there will have to be some measure dealing with that matter and, if necessary, to subsidise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister's prices are such that there would be any grave reason to attack the Minister over what he has done, whether he was influenced by anybody or not. I really think that the Minister should have gone a little bit further.  If I ask him to get something done, I do not believe in putting up a bidding figure, in the hope that he will go half way.  I am particularly concerned about oats and believe that, if he advanced the price to 21/- a barrel, he would be doing satisfactory work.  In addition, he will not have the terrible rise in the price of foodstuffs, because &mdash;as some Fianna Fáil Deputies have said&mdash;quite a lot of the oats is used by the farmers themselves.  The unfortunate man who has to sell before the threshing should be given more money this year, and not be mulcted as he was last year.  There is every reason for hoping that the Minister would advance a little bit.  Even though the Minister thinks the price <Col N="2347" /> of barley is sufficiently high, I am certain that, if he takes Deputy Corry around the corner and asks him what price he ought to give for oats, wheat and barley, the Minister would get the surprise of his life.</P>

      <P>I will take only as little time as possible, as there are other speakers who may wish to say a few words on this motion.  Many complaints were made by Deputy Hughes. In fact, if any person had not been taking an interest in the order I had made and had listened to Deputy Hughes speaking, he would find it very hard to think that there was anything good whatever in the order.  It was very hard to find any note of agreement at all between Deputy Hughes and myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to find too much fault with the Deputy at all. Some of them are points of detail and others are already covered, as far as I am concerned, although perhaps some of them have not been published. It may be that, when we go through these various points, we may find there are not as many points of difference as we had starting off.  The farmers of this country have carried out a colossal job in the way of tillage.  I do not think anybody realises it, as the figures have not been published in full yet, but that will be done in the course of a day or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give two facts.  We have only records for acreage under production as far back as 1847.  The wheat crop this year&mdash;assuming an average yield for the last ten years&mdash;will be the biggest crop since 1847.  That is, one must go back 100 years to beat it.  The total production of all food this year&mdash; wheat and grain crops&mdash;is the biggest on record&mdash;if we assume an average yield.  That is what I have to say about the farmers and the way they have responded to the appeal made to <Col N="2348" /> them in the beginning of this year.  I must say also that many Deputies were present at meetings held last January and February, where appeals were made to farmers to increase production. At every meeting I went to&mdash; and I think the same applies to every meeting to which the officials went, where I was not able to go myself&mdash;the farmers entered this tillage campaign as a duty and did not go into small details about prices or anything else. They regarded it as a duty and said they would take up this tillage campaign, and I must say they did so magnificently.  I am not going to say now that I wish to take advantage of the farmers because they did a patriotic duty.  When they threw in their lot in this general effort to meet the situation, we cannot expect them to go on doing that unless they feel they are properly remunerated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes thinks these prices are too low&mdash;generally speaking, anyway&mdash;and he makes the case, along with other Deputies, that the costs are very much higher now than they were in pre-war times.  Wheat is the crop that we have been discussing more than the others.  After all, there is an increase in the price of wheat by 33? per cent. over the pre-war figure.  I know that it is extremely difficult to agree on costings, but I do not think that a case could be made that the costings in growing an acre of wheat are higher by 33? per cent. than they were pre-war&mdash;labour, rent and rates, manures, seed and so on, all taken into account.  If it is approached in a reasonable way, I think it will not be found that the costings are so high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister a set of costings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have not.  As I have often said in this House, I think it would be extremely difficult, if I were to give costings, to come to agreement on them.  If we were to set up a tribunal and get them to draw up the costings it might be a good thing, but a lot would depend on the personnel of the tribunal as to whether we would accept them or not.  In making up costings, you have to allow so much <Col N="2349" /> for rent, labour, seeds, and so on.  Any Deputy who compared the 1938 figure with that now will, I think, find that it will not be more than 33? per cent. up.  Various Deputies have suggested prices that might have been paid and that would be reasonable.  For instance, Deputy Hughes suggests 50/- for wheat, 30/- for barley and 20/- for oats.  Other Deputies have suggested other prices.  I think wheat is in a different category from the other two, as wheat is grown for human consumption. If the farmers get more for wheat, it is a net gain to them, except what they have to pay for flour and bread afterwards.  It is a net gain to them on the whole and, especially in the case of those farmers who grow wheat for their own use.</P>
      <P>Deputies who have advocated these higher prices for wheat at the same time argued that we should have announced guaranteed prices at the beginning of every year.  We did do that in the case of wheat.  We announced a guaranteed price early in the cereal year of 37/6, and we came along in December and made that 40/-; so that some farmers had sown wheat under the impression that they would get 37/6, and a number of others sowed their wheat after December under the impression that they would get 40/- this harvest.  If guaranteed prices are to mean anything at all, we must be satisfied to stick to them, and that those announced at the beginning of the year, before the farmer sows his crop, will be paid when the crop is reaped. I think, therefore, there is not very much case to be made.  A case cannot be made with any great force for increasing the price of wheat.  There are other arguments put up, not so much on the justice of the case.  There is the argument that, if we do not give more for wheat, the farmers may feed it to stock.  That is a different matter, that will arise later on the price of barley. There is also the case made by Deputy Hughes about which I want to make this very clear in regard to the farmer who thought he was going to get 40/- in his haggard for his wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is a misunderstanding about that, and I should like to make <Col N="2350" /> it perfectly clear.  The order made every year since 1933 was a minimum price order.  The announcement always stated that the price was for wheat delivered to the nearest store or railway station.  The position is the same this year.  There has been no change whatever in the announcement, and that order still holds.</P>

      <P>There is.  The Deputy must remember that since the Prices Commission came into operation they have fixed the price of flour on the minimum price of wheat.  That will remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that make the price of wheat a maximum price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  When we were considering, in the Department, the margin to the wheat dealer, it was argued that he was getting too much. After hearing all the arguments I came to the conclusion that we could give the dealer the same margin that he had for the past three or four years so that he could not put up the argument that his margin had been cut and that he would have to get the farmers to deliver the wheat.  He is getting sufficient margin to take delivery of the wheat in the haggard at the minimum price.  There may be a difficulty this year which we had not in the past, regarding petrol, but if the dealer finds that he cannot send his lorry into the grower's haggard to take away his wheat, he has sufficient margin to compensate <Col N="2351" /> the farmer for delivering the wheat to him if the farmer has to send it in in his own cart.  He can split the margin of 1/6 for delivery if he likes. If any farmer delivers direct to the miller, the miller is entitled to give to the farmer as much as he likes of the 1/6 margin.  There is nothing to prevent his doing that in the order.  It is for the farmer to negotiate with the miller and dealer on that point and get the best he can out of it.</P>
      <P>Another point made by a number of Deputies was that if we take the price of barley meal at 18/6&mdash;that will probably be the price of barley meal by the time it goes through the hands of the merchant, the maize miller, the retailer and back to the farmer&mdash;there is a great danger that the farmer who has wheat at 16/- a cwt. will keep the wheat and not buy barley meal.  It is very unfair to take barley which has been put through all the stages&mdash;which has passed through the hands of the merchant, been railed to the maize miller, been milled by the maize miller and been passed by the retailer back to the farmer&mdash;and compare that with wheat which has gone through none of these processes.  If the farmer wants to use his wheat, will he not have to put it through all these processes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  If he has barley on his premises at 1/9 a stone and wheat at 2/-, surely, if he himself is in a position to mill, he will have cheaper barley meal than wheat meal for animal feeding.  If he is not himself in a position to mill, he will have to send the wheat to a miller to be ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2353" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The people outside do not think that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The law represents the combined sense of the Dáil.  Another argument advanced was that, by fixing the price of malting barley, we conferred some benefit on the brewers.  I do not know whether it is true or not that Messrs.  Guinness had agreed to anchor the price of barley for malting purposes to the price of wheat. Possibly they had followed that rule up to a certain stage.  If there is anything in that point, I do not want to be the cause of preventing farmers from getting more from the brewers if they are able to get it.  There is not much in the point and I think they will not get very much more whether we make that a minimum or fixed price or not.  I shall, however, inquire into it to make sure.</P>
      <P>The next point made by Deputy Hughes was that we only fixed a price for one quality.  That matter got very full consideration.  If we did the other thing, it could be criticised too.  It is very difficult to administer orders of that kind.  Suppose we were to pay a higher price for oats bushelling 42, another price for oats bushelling between 38 and 42, and a third price for oats bushelling less than 38, how are we going to follow these prices through?  It is impossible to follow these prices through.  If we did that we would have to come along and fix the price of these various classes to the miller and the price ex mill.  Are we going to fix three prices for crushed oats, ground oats, etc., and say that the top price is for oats bushelling 42, the next price for oats bushelling between 38 and 42 and the lowest price for oats bushelling under 38?  A Deputy who has any sense will see it is absolutely impossible to do that.  You may be very well sure that the maize miller would charge the top price for all oats going out of the mill and he would try to persuade us that it was all high grade oats he bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty is that if there is a demand for oats the merchants will take oats down to a fairly low standard. <Col N="2354" /> If there is no great demand for oats, they will take oats only of a fairly high standard.  They will say if they are asked to take oats of a lower standard: &ldquo;We do not want it&rdquo; and you cannot compel them to buy&mdash;at least we have not gone so far yet.  All we can do is to fix a price for oats of good merchantable quality.  We can only hope that the farmer will keep oats which is not of good merchantable quality and use it on his own farm.</P>
    <P>Another point on which the Dáil did not seem to be very clear was whether every farmer had to sell to a dealer or not.  Every farmer must sell to a dealer for resale.  That is as far as I can go at the moment.  This is a matter which will require a good deal of consideration because all sorts of cases will arise.  I see no difficulty in allowing one farmer to sell to another if the farmer to whom the grain is sold is going to keep it for seed or for feeding. That would be outside the order. Then we have the case of, say, an owner of a training stable who wants to buy oats.  I see no objection to his buying direct from the farmer, and I think such transactions should be allowed.  Then we come to the case of a small retailer who sells oats in quantities of a stone weight or thereabouts to poultry keepers and people such as these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or for seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case of seed will be dealt with all right.  I am dealing with the question whether a farmer should be permitted to sell direct to a small retailer who sells oats by the stone to a poultry keeper or to the owner of a horse in a town.  I see that a difficulty will arise there.  We must draw the line somewhere and I am not sure at the moment where it can be drawn.  The Deputy may take it that there will not be any objection to one farmer selling to another.  The idea of compelling merchants to get a licence is that these merchants are buying for resale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole idea is to fix the price right through.  How can you fix the price if we do not know who is buying the oats and who is selling it again?  If it is not bought for resale they do not want a licence.  I do not see what difference it makes to the farmer.  The farmer has been selling to the merchants up to this, and we say now that the merchant must get a licence.</P>

That is a view I welcome.  I had been optimistic enough myself to make that statement very often in the Dáil but I did not always get agreement from Deputy Bennett and others.

      <P>I think that is best.  I think it is right that the farmer should know before he disposes of his grain what he will have to pay for his crushed oats, ground barley, etc. Deputy Cogan says that no farmer should be asked to sell grain below the cost of production.  The cost of production is a question upon which it is very hard to agree.  We have to have some regard for what the farmers think at the other end.  If the farmer is tied to a price of so much per pig, so much for eggs and poultry and fat cattle, he knows what he can pay for feeding stuffs and, if we ask him to pay more, the inevitable result will be a reduction of stock.  We have had that reduction in the number of pigs for some time, because the cost of feeding stuffs is too high.  That is not going to do the grower of grain very much good.  It will kill the market he has and there is no use doing away with that market.</P>

I do not want to say that Deputies were not perfectly sincere in what they said, but I think that Deputies are inclined, no matter what I might say, to look upon the price as not quite an adequate price.  I start off with 18/8 for oats, Deputy Hughes says it should be 20/-, Deputy Bennett asks for 21/-, Deputy Cogan for 25/-, and Deputy Belton has yet to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one-sixth of the oat crop is sold in this country.  It is not a very big matter for oat growers.  I do not think there will be any more sold in the coming year; in fact, very probably there will be less than one-sixth. I think that those who have crops, whatever they may be, whether oats, barley or potatoes, will be inclined to keep what they want for themselves and they will not be inclined to sell their grain and buy it back later on, as they have done in past years.  Deputy Belton made the allegation, by way of interruption, that we were fixing these prices in order to prevent the farmers getting a good price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, and I think if that price were not fixed for oats there would be a slump in the price of oats during the autumn.  In order to provide against that slump, which may come even in spite of the fixed price, we are trying to get some sort of reserve buyer who will come into the market and take up the surplus oats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And would he not have to fix a price?  I am inclined to think that such an agency will be required. I hope not, but I would be surprised if it is not.  We have, as Deputies are <Col N="2359" /> aware, a very big crop of oats, about 100,000 acres more than last year.  It looks as if it will be a very good crop and, if Providence is good to us, we may have very much more oats thrown on the market, especially early in the year, because the crop was grown where there was no great amount of tillage before and where the farmers are not accustomed or inclined to store or stack their oats for a later part of the year.  There is a danger that a lot of oats will be thrown on the market and we may not be able to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Remember that the idea that we have in mind is to fix right through. That means that we must have a fixed price, not a minimum.  It means we must have registered dealers.  It means we must have one price for oats or barley of merchantable quality.  Having started off with licensed buyers, we must have a fair and equitable distribution of the grain between the maize millers, the oat millers, the maltsters, a class that I would put in as the forage people, the feeding stuff manufacturers, and there may be others.  I am setting up a committee to deal with that matter, and I am putting on that committee the various people I have named, maize millers, oat millers, forage people, maltsters, feeding stuff manufacturers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a pity that we have not the census relating to agricultural <Col N="2360" /> production this year while we are debating this matter.

      <P>It would be important to have a debate on this matter with all the facts before us.  As a large grower of corn&mdash;I have over 200 acres this year&mdash;I am dead against any fixing of prices.  Look at the machinery we have set up.  Once you start going away from the law of supply and demand, you will require an inspector at every cross-roads, probably a committee inspecting him, and even an inspector inspecting the inspectors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a free trader. I am a national free trader, if you like, but I do not want to be subsidising inefficiency.  The price of wheat that the Minister finds is not adequate for his requirements shows that it is fixed on an inequitable basis.  The Minister knows it is the elementary rule of agricultural economics that the most profitable way to dispose of a farm crop is when you can dispose of it directly as human food.  Therefore, normally, you should dispose of wheat as a human food at an equitable price.  That would be the most profitable way&mdash;to dispose of it at the ruling price.  But he finds that it pays people better to feed wheat or wheat meal to pigs rather than sell it for human food.  He admits that by having to make an order that it is an offence to use wheat for any purpose except for human food. I think this whole matter has been debated in an unreal atmosphere, an atmosphere that is not proper to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should approach this subject not <Col N="2361" /> from the point of view of price but from that of the quantity of food that we are producing this year for man and beast.  Have the prices that were offered induced enough production to meet our food requirements for man and beast this year?  If they have, then the Taoiseach has been misleading the country by his statements. Personally, I do not think they have had that result.  The Minister, after throwing bouquets at the farmers, told the House how they had responded to the appeals made, and said that we have 100,000 acres more under oats this year than last year.  Does the Minister think that this increase will be adequate to meet our requirements, bearing in mind that pre-war we imported half our concentrated foods for livestock and consequently have to carry on without these 200,000 tons of feeding stuffs?  We know there will be a wheat shortage.  Even with no extraction from the wheat, we are told that there will not be enough flour to make all the bread we need so that it is going to be necessary to pump oats and barley into the flour.  I do not think that the increased acreage under oats that the Minister spoke of, plus the increase, if any, in barley, will go any way near meeting our requirements. The Taoiseach when speaking at Tullamore a few weeks ago had, I suppose, a rough idea of the acreage under production this year, and, with that knowledge, he warned the farmers that in the case of a shortage of food livestock might have to be killed off in order to conserve whatever food we had for human consumption.  I regard that as a very alarming statement from the head of the State, and because of it I do not think we should be debating here whether or not we should pay a few shillings more or less for this crop.</P>
    <P>If production is not going to be adequate to meet our needs, the question we should ask ourselves is, why not?  Have we offered a sufficient inducement to the farmers to give us the production we need?  In a debate that took place here last February it was said that 40/- per barrel would be a fair price for wheat.  It would if you were only growing a couple of hundred thousand of acres of it on choice land, <Col N="2362" /> but to meet the whole of your requirements we will need at least 700,000 acres, a lot of which will have to be grown on very inferior land of low production.  Production under such conditions is going to cost the farmer more, and in view of the fact that a good part of the land will be of inferior quality, he has to run the risk of failure.  To say that 40/- a barrel for wheat, compared with pre-war, is a fair price, is in my opinion a wrong basis to go on.  The first thing to be borne in mind is that we want about 700,000 acres of wheat to meet our requirements in seed and flour.  In order to get that we will have to go in on land on which wheat has not been grown for perhaps 100 years. Experienced farmers know that there is hardly a 10-acre field in the country, which has been under grass for 30, 40 or 50 years, from the whole of which you are likely to get a crop of wheat. It may look all right in grass, but when it is ploughed up one will notice the piebald appearance of it on a dry March day.  Growing wheat on land of that sort will mean that on patches of it you will get no yield at all.  The same thing is to be observed in connection with the growing of winter wheat.  Is not that the story from Donegal to Cork and from Dublin to Galway, where old pasture land has been broken up for wheat growing?  A great part of the land of the country is very dirty for tillage purposes since it has not been used for tillage to a great extent over a long period.  The farmer, in tilling land of that sort, has to face the loss of seed and labour and other losses.  If we want to produce a sufficient quantity of wheat, then I say we must offer the better price to the farmer.  Figures with regard to the acreage under crops this year are not yet available.  The increase of 100,000 acres under oats, to which the Minister referred, is, I believe, going to prove entirely inadequate to meet our requirements.  Any cattle man will tell you that there will be no stall-feeding of cattle next winter because we will not have the imported feeding stuffs.</P>

      <P>It will take in or about 100,000 acres of that to give us seed, so that we will have, in round figures, 400,000 acres of that wheat for flour. But that wheat, milled whole, without any extraction, will not give us enough bread to meet the requirements of our people.  The result is that we will have to mix with the wheat either barley or oats, or both.  Will we have enough barley and oats to make up for the deficiency of half our requirements in feeding stuffs, pre-war, which we used to import&mdash;the 200,000 tons of bran and pollard that we will be eating in the bread instead of having it in feeding stuffs?  Will we be able to make up all that in our production this year, and if not why not?  That, I submit, is the point to which this debate should be directed.  Are we going to have enough food for man and beast, and have we offered a sufficient inducement to the farmer to give us that production? The Minister indicated that in the course of the next few days we will be furnished with particulars about our agricultural production this year.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be a very good thing if he were to bring forward a token vote for £10 so that we could have a debate on agriculture. As regards the fixing of prices, I am against that altogether. When the Government appealed to the agricultural population to increase production, I submit there was an obligation on them to put up granaries in which to store the food.  When the corn is put into the granaries advances should be made to the producers.  Let us then leave the market free, let us put our stuff on the market in time, or let us take the risk of keeping it until the end of the season.  The Government <Col N="2364" /> have mishandled the situation. The Minister is throwing up his hands and saying that he cannot do anything.  He is afraid that there will be a glut on the market and that later there will be a scarcity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point about having a free market for oats: if the price is fixed too low, that drags down the market; if it is fixed too high, what good is that to a man who has fifty barrels of oats to sell?  Is it not better for him to be able to sell it at a reasonable price, instead of having a fixed price that is above the market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reply that Deputy Corry and Deputy Meaney could make to my reasonable and modest demands was that I did not support Deputy Belton's motion last year.  On Deputy Belton's motion last year I suggested a compromise.  The Minister referred to Deputies in this House who helped him and supported him in his tillage campaign down the country.  I happened to be one of those Deputies in Carlow.  I think the Minister remembers that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2365" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt at that time that there was a danger in holding a pistol to the heads of the Government to demand a high price, or what was considered a high price, because in doing that we might prevent people from going into extensive cultivation.  I was not prepared to take that responsibility at the time.  But the land is under cultivation now, and is producing wheat, and the situation is different, so I am availing of this opportunity to put it up to the Government that they ought to mend their hand in this respect.  The Minister took some advantage of the position, too, and suggested that the price was fixed before the farmers sowed, and, because it was fixed before the farmers sowed, the farmers were satisfied.  The Minister must remember that the farmer was compelled to sow by the Compulsory Tillage Order; the Minister paid the farmer the compliment of asking him to do his part in this emergency.  If the Minister wants to show real appreciation of the farmer's efforts in that respect, he should do what we suggest.  As I said before, the demands are modest and reasonable. The Minister said that this was the collective responsibility of the Dáil; that it was the Dáil decided this matter and not the Minister.  Surely, if the Minister wants unanimity in the House on this matter, he ought to be able to meet us.  There is not very much in it. We are asking 1/4 a barrel increase in the price of oats, and the Minister says there is only one-sixth of the amount of oats produced in this country marketable; in fact, in his opinion, there will be less than one-sixth marketed this year.  If that is the position, surely an increase of 1/4 is a very modest demand.  For feeding barley, we are asking an increase of 2/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer has to pay that difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been pointed out to the Minister that, unfortunately, the man who is going to suffer is the man who is growing this on the poor land and is forced to sell.  A great many will not be forced to sell, and the Minister approves of that policy, <Col N="2366" /> and so do we, but what about the man who is forced to cash his crop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Remember it is a question between farmer and farmer all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but I think the Minister will agree that this has to be operated within the price fixed for our livestock by the British Government, and I think that within the price fixed for our livestock products next year it will be possible to operate this slight increase which I suggest. It is not in any spirit of criticism that we raise this matter at all. It is to get the unanimous decision of this House.  I do not want any credit for this at all.  I want the Minister to agree and let us all agree that a reasonable case has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of barley and oats, it is just a matter of opinion; it is between farmer and farmer. Wheat is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, and the reason this is brought in is to protect the man who has to sell during the glut period, so that he will not be fleeced as he was last year.  There is a possibility that during a glut period that may happen, although there will be no great glut this year.  On the other hand, the Minister feels it may soar too high.  There is a difference of 10/- a barrel.  That may seem high, but I do not think it is so very high.  We cannot overlook this aspect of the matter, that there is no analogy between the price of wheat and the demand made by wheat on the fertility of the land, as against oats and barley.  There is no doubt about the fact that, where wheat has been grown intensively in recent years under the Government wheat scheme, there is a tendency towards soil exhaustion in some districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot overlook that fact, and the farmer is entitled to be paid for that loss, because it is a capital loss to him.  In growing wheat intensively he is mortgaging the future fertility of the soil, and the people who come after him will have to suffer as a result of it.  In order to give the soil <Col N="2367" /> the compensation it demands for supplying food, the farmer needs money for artificial manures.  Coupled with that consideration, from the point of view of securing that wheat will not be used for animal feeding but for the purpose for which it is intended, namely human consumption, it is necessary in my opinion to increase the price.  It is not fair or just to ask the farmers at the present time to grow wheat at £2 a barrel.  What has been happening here in recent months during this crisis is that the Government did not act in time.  In a great many cases it made up its mind too <Col N="2368" /> late.  Too late, it realised that the position was very critical.  The Government should look well into the future and weigh the position accurately, instead of regretting its inactivity when it is too late.  Now is the time to face the facts, and to realise that there is a necessity for this increase if you want to expand production.  Now is the time to hold out that incentive, that inducement to expand production next year.  If the Minister decides to meet our modest demands, he will secure that co-operation which is so essential at the present time.</P>
