      <P>(Junior) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, in view of the extreme poverty amongst certain sections of the community brought about by continuous unemployment, he will consider the desirability of introducing legislation granting a special rent voucher for the payment or part payment of rent in necessitous cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is in the negative.  Persons in necessitous circumstances receive public assistance through the recognised channels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the Government will so recognise the channels of assistance as to prevent people who are unemployed from being evicted from their homes because of their inability to pay rent? Will the Government assist in that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It follows from the question which I put down.  The Government was asked to take certain action. The Minister says that that is a matter for another authority.  I ask them to assist that other authority.  There is considerable unemployment in the city, particularly in Kimmage, Crumlin and Cabra areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he has received an application for a supplementary petrol supply from Richard Mellotte, of The Neale, Ballinrobe, County Mayo (vehicle No. IZ.4547); whether he is aware that Mr. Mellotte is the only egg exporter in that area and cannot collect and export eggs in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Agriculture owing to the insufficiency of his petrol ration; and whether in the circumstances the Minister is prepared to increase his petrol allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that mangold seeds and swede turnip seeds are being offered for sale by newspaper advertisement at 5/- per lb.; whether he regards the price as excessive, and, if so, what steps he has taken in regard to such overcharging; whether he has received complaints to the effect that in certain parts of the country it is impossible to buy mangold seeds or turnip seeds, and whether he will state what action he has taken or intends taking to make available in such districts adequate supplies of the seeds in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been directed to an advertisement in the Press offering mangold and swede seeds at 5/- per lb. postage paid, but I am aware that these seeds are also offered for sale at much lower prices; and my information is to the effect that the principal seedsmen in this country have been selling these seeds to farmers at prices which cannot be regarded as unreasonable, taking into account the cost of the seeds to the seedsmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints have been received by my Department from individual farmers as to difficulty experienced by them in obtaining supplies of agricultural seeds locally.  Any such difficulties are probably due to import restrictions arising from existing emergency conditions over which my Department has no control.  If such farmers apply to some of the principal seedsmen in Dublin or other centres, they may be able to obtain supplies which, with economy in seeding, should meet their requirements; but in present <Col N="1937" /> circumstances they will have to be content with varieties different from those usually used by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the accommodation offered voluntarily in the reception area has proved totally inadequate, being only 25 per cent. of that required.  Compulsory billeting will now have to be resorted to, and the task of allotting groups from particular districts in the evacuation area to particular districts in the reception area will have to be examined afresh on that basis.  Any explanatory statement setting out evacuation plans in detail must await the result of this examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the acquisition and division of the Browne holding at Rahins was considered by the Land Commission, and as the lands <Col N="1939" /> were unsuitable for their purposes they decided to take no action.  The holding was, subsequently, offered for sale by public auction for recovery of arrears of land purchase annuity.  As the sale by public auction proved unsuccessful, the holding was offered for sale by private treaty.  The highest offer was received from a purchaser in Rahins, Castlebar.  The sale of the holding to him has been completed, and he is now entitled to possession of the lands.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £5,542,328 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1942, chun an Airm agus Cúltaca an Airm (maraon le Deontaisí áirithe i gCabhair) fé sna hAchtanna Fórsaí Cosanta (Forálacha Sealadacha), agus chun Costaisí áirithe riaracháin ina dtaobh san; chun Costaisí Oifig an Aire Cóimhriartha Cosantais; chun Costaisí i dtaobh daoine áirithe do thriail agus do choinneáil (Uimh. 28 de 1939, Uimh. 1 de 1940, agus Uimh. 16 de 1940); chun Costaisí áirithe fé sna hAchtanna um Chiontaí in aghaidh an Stáit, 1939, agus 1940 (Uimh. 13 de 1939 agus Uimh. 2 de 1940) agus fén Acht um Réamhchúram in aghaidh Aer-Ruathar, 1939 (Uimh. 21 <Col N="1943" /> de 1939); chun Cúl-Soláthairtí Leighis d'Ospidéil Síbhialta; agus chun costaisí áirithe de chuid an Fhórsa Chosanta Aitiúil (ar a n-áirmhítear Deontaisí-i-gCabhair) (Uimh. 28 de 1939).</P>
    <P>That a sum, not exceeding £5,542,328, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures; for Expenses in connection with the trial and detention of certain persons (No. 28 of 1939, No. 1 of 1940 and No. 16 of 1940); for certain Expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-Raid Precautions Act, 1939 (No. 21 of 1939); for Reserve Medical Supplies for Civilian Hospitals; and for certain Expenses of the Local Defence Force (including Grants-in-Aid) (No. 28 of 1939).</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Army Vote for the financial year 1941/42 is put forward in an unusual form, in that the total amount required is not distributed among the usual sub-heads, and no information is given regarding the manifold items which make up the total amount, £8,383,556 required.  This is the first time that the Army Estimate has been presented in this form.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is being put forward in this unusual form, not because the Department is not in a position to calculate the estimated cost of the various services covered by the Vote, but because the Government decided that on grounds of military expediency the usual detailed information available should not be published.  That is the only reason why this form of Vote has been adopted.  It would, therefore, be <Col N="1944" /> wrong to assume that the total amount required is simply guess work or an unreliable estimate, because, in point of fact, the Department has presented its Estimates in the usual form to the Department of Finance, and the detailed Estimate showing the cost of the many services covered by the Army Vote has been in the hands of the members of the Defence Conference for the past two weeks, by whom it has been carefully examined.  It is the public interest alone which has dictated the form of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Strictly and legally the effect of this form of Vote would be twofold.  In the first place, the Department would not be bound to account for its expenditure under the normal sub-heads of the Vote, but under the two sub-heads shown in the present Estimate, and in point of law the Appropriation Account will have to be rendered in the new form in strict accordance with the Estimate.  This would mean strictly that the Dáil would not have information as to the expenditure on the various sub-heads of the Vote.  It has been decided, however, that the Department will keep its accounts in the normal form of the sub-heads of the Army Vote, so that although the Appropriation Account will follow the form of the present Estimate the Department will have at all times available the usual information regarding expenditure under the normal sub-heads of the Army Vote.</P>
    <P>The second effect of the present form of Estimate would be that the Department of Defence could, without having recourse to the Department of Finance, apply any excesses on some Army services to meet any deficits on others, within, of course, the ambit of the Vote and the total sum voted. Here again, however, it has been decided that the Department will work within the totals of the various sub-heads agreed to by the Department of Finance, and that the total of any sub-head will not be exceeded without the specific concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be seen that under this form of Vote the Army will not <Col N="1945" /> be given a blank cheque, and will not be left to its own devices in spending the money voted.  There is no such intention.  Every penny expended must, as in normal circumstances, be covered either by regulation or by the special authority of the Minister for Finance, and both Departments will be bound by the ambit of the Dáil's Vote. There will, consequently, be no authority without coming back to this House to embark on any schemes which are not covered fairly by the ambit of the Vote.</P>
    <P>Finally, there will be no relaxation of financial control either as regards the disbursement of money or the accounting for stores.  All the normal accounting and audit checks will remain strictly in force, and every effort will be made to enforce economy and to prevent waste of any description. Any tendency to disregard regulations dealing either with the expenditure of money or with the expense of stores will, as far as possible, be immediately stopped, and every effort will be made to see that the money voted and the stores purchased will be spent and utilised for the purposes stated in the resolution of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Within the last few months the Local Defence Force has been transferred from the Gárda Síochána to the Army, and no hitch whatsoever has occurred in its transfer.  This magnificent body of Volunteers is now undergoing intensive and progressive training, and shows every sign of becoming a most useful addition to the Army if the occasion to utilise its services should arise.</P>
    <P>As regards the Army itself, the officers of the forces have handled the large influx of recruits during the past year with extraordinary zeal and efficiency, and the new officers temporarily commissioned are standing up to their new duties magnificently.</P>
    <P>The health of the troops has been surprisingly good.  The incidence of disease has been lower than usual, and there has been no marked epidemic of any form of disease during the past winter.  There have, of course, been <Col N="1946" /> discharges on grounds of medical unfitness, but taking things all round, the standard of physical fitness may now be said to be high.  Discipline, too, has been satisfactory, the percentage of military crime being very low, and indeed it may be said that the morale of the whole Army is excellent.</P>
    <P>In asking the House for the approval of the Army Estimate in the form as published, and under the conditions just briefly outlined, I desire to ask the House to approve of establishments for Regular, Reserve and Local Defence Forces which will not, during the year, exceed an aggregate of 250,000 all ranks.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £434,434 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923. No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937 and No. 2 of 1941).  Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934 and No. 33 of 1938), Pensions.  Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936), and for <Col N="1947" /> sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Army Pensions Vote for the financial year 1941/42 shows a net increase of £68,044, and the Estimate, as printed and circulated to the House, shows that the increase is mainly due to increasing liability under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, and under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes, 1937 and 1940&mdash;an increase which is partly offset by diminishing liabilities under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of wound and disease pensions.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the amount required under sub-head G for wound and disability pensions is mainly attributable to the fact that applications for pensions under the 1932 Act proper have been disposed of so that there now only remain applications under the Acts of 1937 and 1941.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the amount asked for under sub-head H for dependents' allowances is principally due to the fact that applications for special dependents' allowances under Part VII of the 1937 Act proper have been dealt with, so that now we have only to deal with those under the Act of 1941.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head K for military service pensions is entirely due to the increased number of applicants who have qualified and are likely to qualify for pensions under the Act of 1934.  On March 31st, 1940, the number who had qualified was 7,346, but on March 31st, 1941, that number had increased to 7,905.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar position exists regarding pensions payable under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes, 1937 and 1941.  During the year there has been an increase of 17 pensions, and during the coming year provision has been made for a further increase of about 16 pensions.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputies inquired regarding the work done by the three statutory boards which have been set up to administer the Military Service and Army Pensions Acts.  Here, briefly, is <Col N="1948" /> the position for the past financial year:&mdash;The Military Service Registration Board completed its work under the 1932 and 1937 Acts about the end of December, 1940, and thereafter was placed on a part-time basis to deal with appeals.  It will now have to deal with applicants under the 1941 Act.</P>
    <P>The Army Pensions Board during the year completed its work under the 1932 Act proper, and boarded practically all claims under the 1932 Act, as amended by the 1937 Act.  It also concluded its investigations into applications for special dependents' allowances under Part VII of the 1937 Act.  It dealt with all applications under Section 26 of the 1937 Act which <i>prima facie</i> appeared likely to succeed, and for some time past it has concentrated attention on claims for aggravation under Sections 28 and 29 of the 1937 Act.  Claims under Section 41 of the same Act for special gratuities have also been finished.  The position indeed of the board's work may be said broadly to be that they are dealing with claims in respect of aggravation and are completing their examinations and findings under the different sections and different forms of claims under the 1937 Act.  They should, therefore, be in a position within a reasonable period to deal with applications under the new Army Pensions Act, 1941.</P>
    <P>The work done by the Referee with the Advisory Committee and interviewing officers throughout the year may be best gauged by comparing statistically under a few headings the work covered during the past financial year. The number of applications received under the Act by the Referee on April 1st, 1941, was 59,594.  On April 1st, 1940, 19,534 applicants had been interviewed, but 12 months later the figure was 27,160, an increase over the period of 7,626.  At the beginning of the period, the Referee had made 7,346 favourable reports, and at the end 7,905, an increase of 559.  During the same period the number of unfavourable reports made was 28,639 and 43,015 respectively, an increase of 14,376 over the period.  From these figures it will be seen that substantial <Col N="1949" /> progress has been made during the year, and that there are now only 8,674 in which reports remain to be made. If the same rate of progress can be maintained we should be able to record next year that reports have been made covering all applications under the Act.</P>

      <P>I wonder if this is the proper place to raise a particular point with regard to the questions which have been raised in the last few months regarding soldiers' allowances and so on.  We have learned of the Minister's sincere sympathy in cases where soldiers have lost their lives through accidents, and where questions were raised about an increase in marriage allowances.  May I ask the Minister if it is possible that between this and the introduction of the next Army Estimate new legislation will be introduced or found necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, will the Minister give consideration to the point of providing compensation or pensions for dependents of soldiers who lose their lives through accidents?  I have in mind the Corporal Cooney case.  I am perfectly aware that the Minister is most anxious to do everything possible to see that the dependents of soldiers do not suffer any great hardship; but the Army is very large now and the greater the number the greater the risk of accident to our men.  It will be appalling if, through lack of measures here, their dependents are deprived of pensions or compensation. As I have said, I have in mind at the moment the Corporal Cooney case&mdash; that of a very brave man who lost his life at Portobello Harbour in an attempt to save others, during the Christmas season.  I am perfectly aware of the Minister's sympathy and anxiety to help in cases such as this. I may mention&mdash;though perhaps I should have raised it on a previous Estimate&mdash;that the Minister also has promised that consideration would be <Col N="1950" /> given to the question of an increase in marriage allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like almost every other Deputy in the House I suppose I have made repeated representations to the Minister's Department concerning the delay in the case of the Pensions Board or the Referee or whoever is responsible, and regarding the failure to dispose within a reasonable time of claims for pensions which were before the board as far back as 1936, 1937 and 1938.  I have scarcely ever been given any good reason, from a Departmental point of view or in writing, as to why cases of claims heard by the board in those years should still be awaiting a decision, whether favourable or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Here in the House some time ago, I asked the Minister to give the number of cases which had been deferred over the years mentioned.  If he would turn up his reply he would agree that the number of such cases is unreasonably high.  Now that the Vote is before the House, I would like to ask him to say what steps have been or will be taken in the immediate future to clear the decks of all these claims.  If the fault is due mainly to the failure of the brigade representatives in the different areas to answer questions addressed to them by or on behalf of the Service Pensions Board, the machinery for getting the required information should be tightened up.  Why not bring those brigade officers together on a particular day to deal with questions which have been referred to them and which cannot be decided until they give some answers to the innumerable questions addressed to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a brigade officer in any particular area fails or refuses to give to the Military Service Pensions Board the required information, surely either the Minister or the members of the board or the members in the brigade area should take steps to terminate the services of such an individual and find someone who will carry out the work in accordance with the requirements of the Department.  The very fact that <Col N="1951" /> some of those claims are still held up is, in my opinion, holding up the claims of other persons who have been before the board after them or who have not yet been called before the board.  That in itself is a very good reason why the Minister should concentrate on a clearance of these outstanding claims.  I do not know at the moment how many there are but, probably, the Minister has the figures at his elbow and I would be very interested to know what progress, if any, has been made during the last three months in clearing up outstanding claims.</P>
    <P>I would now appeal to the Minister to make a very definite request to the Board or the Referee or whatever Departmental officials are concerned, to concentrate for as long as is necessary on this clearance work.  If he does that it will give general satisfaction, even to those who may not get a favourable decision.  It is unfair to men who have been before the board in 1936, 1937 and 1938 that their claims should still be waiting for a decision and that they should be hoping&mdash;and hoping, perhaps, vainly&mdash;for a favourable decision.  I have come across cases of applicants for pensions who believe that their own claims cannot be dealt with satisfactorily until the deferred cases have been cleared off. I hope it will not be necessary for me or for any other Deputy to raise again this aspect of the Military Service Pensions Act of 1934.  I join with the Minister in hoping that all those cases which have been under consideration and concerning which so many promises have been made will be disposed of in their entirety by the time that we are asked to pass another Estimate of this kind in the House in 12 months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Year after year when this Estimate is being considered in the Dáil, numerous complaints are made by different Deputies.  In the statement which he has delivered just now, the Minister seems to think that these claims are being disposed of with great efficiency.  Does he seriously think that a genuine effort is being made by the Pensions Board to clear off the cases of applicants who have <Col N="1952" /> been waiting for a decision for the past six or seven years?  If he does, certainly the people in the country who have made the applications do not.  I have in mind cases of people who made applications for pensions under the 1934 Pensions Act.  It is obvious to everybody in their particular district that they are eligible for the pensions laid down in that Act.  However, notwithstanding the fact that their claims have been before the Pensions Board for the past five or six years, they have not received any intimation as to when their claims will be disposed of, or whether they ever will be disposed of.  I agree with Deputy Davin when he says that some intimation should be sent to these people as to when it is proposed to deal with their claim or, if their claim has been dealt with and has been turned down, surely the proper thing would be to let these people know.  Everybody knows that in a town in my constituency, the town of Enniscorthy, there was a definite rising during Easter Week, 1916, and many people who took part in that rising are still waiting for some word from the Minister as to when their claims will be disposed of.  I have in mind not alone male members of the Volunteers or the Republican Army of that time, but I know female members who were active members of Cumann na mBan in 1916 who have made applications for pensions.  Not alone have they not been dealt with, but they have not received any intimation as to whether their claims were received or not.  I suggest to the Minister that is not the way to treat people who have served this country well as far back as 1916.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has referred to the question of accidents occurring in the Army.  He referred to one particular case which has been receiving a good deal of prominence recently in the newspapers.  But, apart from that case, there have been accidents in the Army in which young men have lost their lives and there appears to be no machinery to enable the Minister to deal with cases of that kind.  I do not know that it is necessary to have special legislation introduced in order to enable the Minister to dispose of <Col N="1953" /> cases of that kind, but I do suggest that cases of that kind should be dealt with.  After all, if a person is working for an ordinary employer and he meets with an accident in the course of his employment compensation is paid.  I suggest that the Army should be a model employer in that respect and that when an accident occurs whereby a young man loses his life some compensation should be forthcoming to his relatives.  There have been such cases recently.  One particular case I know of happened in my county and definite hardship could be proved because of the fact that this young man lost his life through an accident in the Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin has also referred to the question of certain Old I.R.A. officers in certain districts who have been asked to supply information and in a great many cases they have not supplied the information for various reasons, some of them very obvious to the Minister and to everybody in this country.  But I do not think the Minister ought to let it rest there.  It appears to me that when a brigade officer of the Old I.R.A. is asked to supply information, if he does not supply it at the particular time the Minister wants it, the Minister is content to leave the matter at that.  Surely there should be other means of getting information which will enable the Minister to arrive at a decision in connection with any particular case.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like the Minister to give his attention and to make representations to the other Departments.  I refer to the case of men who are in receipt of small pensions and, because of that fact, they do not get their turn when relief work is being done in certain areas.  I suggest that these men are in the same degree of need, if not a greater degree of need, as many of the people who are drawing a larger sum from the labour exchanges. This is not specifically a matter for the Minister; it is a matter for another Department, but I think the Minister ought to make representations in connection with it and try to secure that in the case of a man who has served his country and who may have a pension, that pension is not to stand between him and his right <Col N="1954" /> to work to obtain a living for himself and his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker with regard to the delay in dealing with pension claims.  I know a number of claimants to pensions whose cases have been held up from year to year since 1934.  I do not know why.  They seem to be as far off now as they were when they first made their application.  Not only that, but the reply they get from the Department is most unsatisfactory.  The Department gives no satisfaction to anybody.  They send out a stereotyped reply stating that the claimants were not on active service during certain critical periods. Most of these applicants claim they were on active service, that they were always ready and available and that they actively took part.  I have a good many cases in mind.  I wrote to the Department to get a definition as to what they meant by &ldquo;active&rdquo; military service, pointing out these people and what they did and were prepared to do; that they were always ready and available and did take part.  No satisfactory reply was ever given to them and there is real suspicion down the country that the whole thing is shady and that the Department are not administering the Act fairly, as it was intended to be administered, I think the Minister should meet these cases fairly.  When Deputies apply for an explanation they are entitled to get an explanation as to what is meant by these statements that are sent out to applicants.  I hope the Minister will clean up these arrears of claims in the shortest possible time and, in any case, give satisfaction one way or the other by showing why they are not entitled to have their claims allowed.</P>

      <P>Previous speakers referred to the delay in operating the Military Service Pensions Act.  If these speakers were conversant with the magnitude of the task that confronted the Referee and his board, and the task which confronted the various brigade officers through the country, they would then realise that this delay was unavoidable.  I had a very small experience myself in connection with the board.  Owing to the fact that brigade officers were asked to compile a record <Col N="1955" /> of events that took place close on 20 years previously, there was naturally great delay in preparing anything like an accurate record.  I dare say that probably in some brigade areas these records may not yet be finished.  I can also sympathise with the Referee's board in this matter.  In order to help men who qualified for pensions, they had to try to regularise an irregular army, which is quite a different matter from giving pensions to ex-members of regular armies.  The only adverse criticism I have to make is not directed so much towards the Referee or his board, as at all times I found the board and the Referee willing and helpful to meet any case fairly, within the regulations laid down by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression which I got, in dealing with the board as a verifying officer, and from subsequent results, is that there is one little point which strikes one as not being equitable, and that is that in order to prove active service an applicant must have been in a major engagement in the pre-Truce period, and, in addition, as far as I know, it seems that not alone must he have been in a major engagement, but he must have exchanged shots with the enemy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that, really, is a hardship. I know of some cases myself where men took part in major engagements and, just because of the simple fact that certain of these men, taking part in these engagements, had not had occasion to fire a shot and did not want to waste ammunition, they are not getting the benefits of the Act.  I think that is very unfair, and I want to bring such cases to the attention of the Minister. I know of cases where men were in position in a certain yard and went into action, while other men were kept in reserve with only a wall of a few inches separating them from the men who were in action outside.  Now, the men who did fire some shots&mdash;without <Col N="1956" /> any effect, to be quite candid&mdash;are evidently entitled to some reward while the men who were only a few inches away, and only separated by a wall, are not entitled to pension rights for that particular engagement.  I do not think that is fair, and I suggest that the Minister should go into that whole question again with a view to administering the Act so as to deal out justice as far as it is possible to do so.  I know that it is very hard to give equal justice in all cases, but I suggest that the Minister should do his best to see that justice is administered, so far as is humanly possible, to all men who have taken part, at least, in major engagements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like the House to understand is that there were 59,594 pension applications received and that, of these&mdash;almost 60,000 applications&mdash;practically all have been dealt with, and only 8,674 remain to be reported upon.  Now, it stands to reason that some numbers in that 60,000 must be first and that some must be last: that they cannot all be dealt with as if you were to drop them into a machine, press a button, and have the whole thing finished.  Every one of these cases, in the first instance, has to be carefully scrutinised.  Those cases, in which the scrutineers deem that service has been proved, are notified to attend for interview, and, in the course of the interview, the applicant is allowed to make his case as thoroughly as he possibly can; in fact, he is encouraged to do so, and I know, from my own personal experience, that he is generally helped to make his case.  It is true, as Deputy Meaney and other Deputies have said, and have referred to from time to time, that the interpretation of the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo; rules out a number of men who appear to have given excellent service in the Volunteer movement; but there, again, we must have someone who is to be the sole judge.  We cannot have a whole group of people intervening and saying that this, in their opinion, constitutes &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, as against the decision of the Referee, who should be the final authority on the question.  I do not see that I can interfere.  My predecessor <Col N="1957" /> did not interfere, either, because, to have done so, possibly, would have led to charges of intimidation or of using influence, or something else, on the Referee.  The Referee is, solely, the judge as to whether a man was or was not on active service, and if, in the opinion of the Referee, the service which the individual has given cannot be termed by him &ldquo;active service,&rdquo; then that decision must be accepted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter Deputy Byrne raised, I feel that there is a definite hardship there.  Representations have been made from time to time with a view to changing the situation, but it was found very difficult, and we find it much more difficult to change it now than heretofore.  I might mention that married soldiers, in every case where they meet with accidents on military service, come within the Army Pensions Act and, accordingly, are compensated in respect of the injuries received.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I think that the House will agree, in view of the figures which I have mentioned here, to the effect that 8,674 cases remain to be reported upon, that considerable progress&mdash;in fact, very excellent progress&mdash;has been made since we were discussing this Estimate last year.  I remember that, at the conclusion of the debate on that occasion, I mentioned that I hoped that when we were discussing the Estimate in the following year a considerable hole would have been made in the number of cases to be dealt with.  I think I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that that has been so and that considerable progress has been made, and if that rate of progress is continued I feel almost certain that every case will have been completely dealt with next year, either from the point of view of deciding whether an individual is entitled to a pension, or going back to the cases where individuals will appeal.  Of course, that is one of the things we shall have to face. There will be a considerable number of applicants, whose cases have been dealt with, who will appeal against the decision, and these cases will have to <Col N="1958" /> be heard.  The Referee has stated to me that in every case where an appeal is made, and a man desires to appear before the board, he will give him every facility to appear before him and make his case on his own behalf, and if the Referee is satisfied that his former decision was wrong, he informs me that he will only be too pleased to right it.  In respect of Deputy Corish's complaint about the 1916 cases, I know that some years ago precedence was given in the case of 1916 applicants.</P>

      <P>Well, I happen to know this, personally, because I conveyed the information to the board when I was acting as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, away back in 1936, and it was done, as a matter of fact, at the express request of the Taoiseach who was anxious that these particular men should not be thrown into a list, so to speak, and come out, perhaps, last. He was anxious that their cases should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  Now, what has happened in a considerable number of cases is this: that the later service of these men has become entangled in some kind of dispute as to whether they had or had not the later service they claimed, and as a result, the final decision cannot be arrived at, either in respect of their 1916 service or of the later period for which they claimed service.  In practically every case, however, where these men have made claims for service, and where their claim for 1916 service has not been disputed, they have had forwarded to them the medal which was recently presented for 1916 service.  So that, although the decision on a claim for some other service, about which there was a doubt, was delayed, we did not allow that to prevent us from presenting the medal which was a recognition of the 1916 service of these men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difficulty in these cases is the matter of verification. <Col N="1959" /> I think it was Deputy Davin who mentioned the question of verification from brigade units.  There is no doubt whatever that the greatest amount of delay which we have been experiencing has been due to the fact that brigade committees are not functioning in the way they should. We have had that experience in a large number of cases.  In some cases where the verifying officers were not giving that sort of attention to cases that the board felt they should give, we had them replaced, but the great difficulty about replacing these persons is that they are regarded locally as being the only persons who can give personal and intimate evidence on behalf of the applicants.  From that point of view, we often find it difficult to depose or replace them, but there is a system in operation, if it is found that brigade committees are delaying in dealing with cases, whereby they are written to periodically and the necessity for having evidence brought forward at the earliest possible moment is impressed upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would account for all the delay in the cases to which I referred, because the Secretary of the Old I.R.A. is a man who was an officer in 1916.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We experience the highest possible form of efficiency in some districts but in other districts our experience is the reverse.  Even in the very efficient districts delay is sometimes inevitable because it may happen that where the verifying officer comes along and informs the board that the applicant has the service which he claims, arising out of evidence given in some other applicant's form, the board has evidence that that is not so.  When that happens, naturally delay follows, because the board, dealing as they are with public money, must be certain that the money will reach the people who are entitled to it.  In conclusion, I can assure the House that, as far as I am concerned, I have done everything that I have found it reasonably possible to do with the board to expedite decisions.  I have found the board <Col N="1960" /> itself to be exceedingly reasonable. The members of it are most anxious to meet the representatives of these brigade councils and to interview them so as to arrive at the best possible means of dealing expeditiously with difficult cases where there are difficult cases.  The board has on several occasions at my own request, and at the request of Deputies, met deputations from the brigades who were putting forward some of the claims that have been mentioned in the House.  They have heard them with a great amount of sympathy and have in every case given consideration to the representations made.  I think I can assure the House that by this time next year all cases, other than those which will have to be dealt with on appeal, will have been dealt with Of course, I have no idea at the moment as to what the percentage of unfavourable reports is likely to be.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give an assurance that within a given time, say three months, or even six months, all these deferred cases between 1936 and 1940 will be disposed of?  I think he is empowered as a matter of administration to give a direction to his administrative officers, or to request the board to have these cases dealt with speedily.  It is most unreasonable to have cases in which the evidence was heard in 1936, 1937 and 1938 still awaiting a decision.  No matter who is responsible they should be brought to finality.  The Minister should issue an order to have them decided one way or another within a reasonable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, unfortunately, one of those Deputies with an insufficient knowledge of our native language to enable me to intervene in a debate in that language and so I missed much of what the Minister said in his opening statement.  Possibly, I am in a minority in that respect, though I am not so sure about that. In any case, it might have been desirable if the Minister had committed himself to a few words in the foreign language which all Deputies understand. The fact that he did not do so limits our capacity to contribute to the <Col N="1962" /> debate on this Vote.  There are just one or two matters to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, matters which have often been referred to in debates here before.  The Minister is, perhaps, aware that considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed for some years past at the prices paid to owners whose land has been compulsorily acquired or resumed.  I doubt if, in any case, the promise made by the Minister in charge of one of the recent Land Acts, to pay the full market value for land so acquired, has been fulfilled.  Indeed, I am personally aware, and I think every Deputy has much the same experience, that lands have been compulsorily resumed at prices certainly 50 per cent. below the market value.  I have no doubt this arises from the desire of the Land Commission to put allottees in possession of the land at a fair price without encroaching too much on the resources of the State.  We all desire that people who are given parcels of land should not be asked to pay an exorbitant price in the way of rent, but I think nearly every Deputy in the House would desire that the person from whom land is compulsorily acquired should get a fair price for it, and that whatever difference there is should be made up from some source other than asking the private individual to bear the whole amount.</P>
      <P>As I have often said in this House, I think that land division is, perhaps, one of the best ways by which we can provide for a certain section of the people, put them in decent occupation, and make them valuable citizens, but, like all other social reforms, it ought to be done more at the expense of the State than of the individual.  To my mind, it is totally unjust that individual owners of land should be asked to bear all the expense of putting people on the land.  I do not know how far that has gone in many counties, but recently I have noticed that land has been compulsorily purchased for somewhere about £3 an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take all the activities of the Land Commission during a number of years, we will find that the average price has been very much larger than that, but when we come to the point <Col N="1963" /> where land is acquired compulsorily for about £3 an acre, there is naturally created in our minds the suspicion either that there is something like complete confiscation of the land, or that the land is of such a nature that it should not be resumed; that it is land which is unfit to be acquired and distributed, and on which it is unreasonable to expect unfortunate incoming tenants to live.  I have in mind an estate in my own county which was purchased at somewhere around £3 an acre, and I saw a reference made to similar happenings in another county.  Limerick is not regarded as one of the counties where there is tremendously bad land.  There are bogs in Limerick&mdash;I do not suppose even the Government proposes to settle unfortunate tenants on bogs&mdash;but certainly what remains of the land in Limerick, outside of bogs and useless mountains, is land for which more than £3 per acre should be paid to the unfortunate owners.  I say again that the suspicion is ripe in my mind either that those individuals are being paid a price which amounts to confiscation, or else that the land is of such a nature that it is unfair to ask this House to approve of expenditure of large sums of Government money, in addition to the purchase price, on the acquisition and eventual division of that land.  That is as much as I have to say on the point. I am as desirous as any other Deputy to see landless men and uneconomic holders settled on the land.  It is a good policy.  There is any amount of land available in the country for such a purpose.  There are several owners of land in this country desirous of getting out of their land if only they could see some way of getting a fair value for it. I have often said in this House, and I say again, that any amount of land can be acquired in this country, even without resorting to the compulsory provisions of any Act, provided the Land Commission are prepared to give something like a decent price for it.  I believe that a decent price should be paid for the land, and that, taking into account the subsequent sums which must be spent in order to provide houses, fences, and so on, for the incoming tenants, whatever difference <Col N="1964" /> there is should be paid by the State. It would be a wise policy for the Government, and would put an end to much of the dissatisfaction which exists with regard to land acquisition generally.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I want to refer, because, as I said in my opening remarks, I am not quite aware of what the Minister himself alluded to when he was moving the Vote.  In regard to the acquisition of land, certain sums are held for the maintenance of drains, and it has been brought to my notice that that money has not been spent to the best advantage. I do not know how much foundation there is for that, but I have had so many letters from various tenants in regard to it that I thought it right to raise the matter.  I have had complaints from the tenants of at least five or six different estates that the money held by the Land Commission for drainage improvement and maintenance has not been wisely spent, if spent at all.  I am merely drawing the Minister's attention to that matter, and asking that he will look into it.  I do not think there is anything else to which I want to refer on this Vote, but I would impress on the Minister that in future some attempt should be made to pay a fair price to the unfortunate owners from whom land is compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the fact that the activities of the Minister's Department in the acquisition and distribution of land during the emergency period has been seriously curtailed owing to the policy of his Department and of the Government at the present time, there is not very much to be said on that matter.  There are only a few points to which I want to refer.  The first, and the most important of all to my mind, is the question of the collection of annuities. I would point out to the Minister that this is a particularly difficult period for our farmers.  Owing to the spread of foot and mouth disease all over the country, many farmers have been placed in the unfortunate position that they are not able to dispose of their live stock.  The Minister, I am sure, appreciates the fact that it is from <Col N="1965" /> live stock that agriculture is mainly financed in this country.  If the farmer is not in a position to cash his live stock, particularly during this period, the store cattle trade period, he has no money, and many farmers find it exceedingly difficult even to meet their household requirements at the present time.</P>
      <P>I think any activity on the part of the collection branch of the Minister's Department at the present time would be disastrous for agriculture.  Owing to the strain and difficulty that are imposed on agriculture, not only from the point of view of the spread of that unfortunate scourge, foot-and-mouth disease, but also on account of the further financial burdens which are imposed on our farmers owing to their activity in increasing food production in the country, this is not the time to imposed any unjust or severe demands on them.  I have been informed that quite a number of sale notes have been issued by the Minister's Department in recent weeks.  I must say that that has not been brought to my notice in my own constituency&mdash;it may have occurred, but I am not aware of it&mdash; but I do know that it happened in other counties.  I look with alarm on such a situation.  To say the very least of it, it does not show wisdom.  It is anything but a wise course for the Minister and his Department to adopt at the present time.  I think that in order to enable the people to tide over this very difficult period, the collection branch ought to relax their efforts to some extent.  They ought not to exercise undue pressure on the people at the present time.  Certainly, the pressure that is usually exercised through the sheriff ought not to be resorted to at such a time as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important matter was raised by Deputy Bennett with regard to the policy adopted in resuming land for distribution among uneconomic holders and landless men.  While many will agree that land that is not being properly utilised in the national interest ought to be resumed and given to uneconomic holders and landless men, I do not think it fair or just&mdash; indeed, I think it is immoral&mdash;to ask an individual who has legitimate rights and is the owner of property more or <Col N="1966" /> less to finance this scheme of land distribution. If it is the national policy, and if the land has to be obtained at a price that is not economic from the point of view of division, then the State ought to subsidise the land division scheme, instead of acquiring the land, as Deputy Bennett has pointed out, at a price that sometimes amounts almost to confiscation.  In the past the acquisition of land was such that it almost amounted to confiscation. Possibly within the last few years there has been an improvement and conditions are not quite so bad, but there have been cases where the occupants of the land have not got a fair market price.</P>
    <P>The policy of putting a certain value on the land and deducting from that the cost of redemption does not, in my opinion, leave a fair market price. There is a certain amount of injustice created for the man who owns property. If the Land Commission decide that it is in the national interest to acquire a man's property for division among uneconomic holders, it is only proper that they should give that man fair compensation.  If the amount is over and above the economic value of the land from the point of view of its division, then the State ought to grant a subsidy.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the methods that are adopted with reference to inquiries into the suitability or otherwise of applicants for holdings on estates about to be divided.  The method of sending down an inspector to carry out what appears to me to be detective work, visiting one man and inquiring what sort of a tenant his neighbour would make if he were given a piece of land, is an appalling one.  It encourages the very worst in our people and has the effect of making neighbours fall out, one neighbour telling lies about another because he fears his own chances might be endangered if he told the truth&mdash;that his neighbour was a decent fellow, a hard-working man who would make good.  He feels that if he does so he may weaken his own chances.  That policy is a wrong one. The proper method to adopt would be to hold a public inquiry to investigate the qualifications and the suitability <Col N="1967" /> of those who are anxious to get land. It is appalling to think that a Land Commission inspector is sent down to do work of that sort.  It is on all fours with detective work.  That is not the manner in which that work ought to be carried out.  There should be a public inquiry and everything should be done above-board so that the public can hear any statements made by an individual; in those circumstances the statements will be honest and true. Otherwise you will be giving an opportunity to people to tell lies about their neighbours and to misrepresent them. Very often that is what happens.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if the Land Commission have complied with the Tillage Order on all lands that have not yet been divided. If land has been let on a conacre basis, perhaps he will inform us about the price obtained?  Where land has been set, will he let us know whether it was set by auction or let in conacre by private treaty?  Can he give us any idea as to the average price obtained? Again, at what time of the year was this land let?  Was it let in time to enable people to sow a wheat crop?</P>
    <P>I have received a resolution from the Kilcock Parish Council and I am sure other Deputies in the constituency have also received copies of it.  With the permission of the House I should like to read it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we, the Kilcock Parish Council, learn with regret that the lands of the Gannon estate in Laragh, and the Thorpe estate in Baltracy, both of which border the town of Kilcock, are about to be divided amongst people from other counties, while we have so many deserving applicants in our own district. We, therefore, call on the Minister for Lands to reconsider his decision with regard to these lands, or at least to consider, first, the just claims of local applicants when dividing any of the remaining estates in the district.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We also ask that the recommendations of parish councils be considered with regard to applicants for land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> This matter has been referred to already.  I suppose it is a rather sore point among Deputies, this policy of migration.  While I think that we in the eastern counties cannot object, when there is land available for division, to people coming from the congested districts of the west, we do take exception to the manner in which local claims are ignored.  No matter how just a local claim may be, even in the case of an evicted tenant, who can prove conclusively that he has a just claim in respect of lands that are going to be divided, the policy is to ignore such a claim in favour of a person who is migrated from another county</P>
    <P>Those who occupied such land in former years have been looking over these broad acres with longing eyes, wondering if they would be restored to what was lawfully their property, but when an opportunity was given them to put in an application their claim was ignored.  I do not think that is fair.  Applications in such cases should be thoroughly examined, and where established should be entitled to consideration.</P>
    <P>I consider that local men are entitled to first consideration, and then, if there is any land available, migrants could be brought in.  It is unfair to suggest that migrants should have a prior right in all cases.  I agree that migrants have a right to be brought to the eastern counties.  I do not object to that, but I disagree when they receive prior rights over local applicants.  I do not know if the Minister has received a resolution that was passed at a meeting in Kilcock, as it affects part of Meath and North Kildare, where this question was discussed, pointing out that the claims of poor men there had been ignored.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister some time ago, and he promised to have the matter inquired into, affecting payments under the war clause to contractors building houses on estates under the control of the Department. I understand it was a question of determining procedure, between the Minister's Department and the Department of Finance.  I believe the matter has been determined now, but contractors are still suffering from financial difficulties, <Col N="1969" /> as a considerable amount of money has been held back from them. Some of them are poor men and are not in a position to have a large sum of money outstanding.  It hampers their work as they are not able to get credit from merchants, and accordingly find it exceedingly difficult to finish their contracts.  They are awaiting a definite decision on the matter and I wish the Minister would have it expedited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the middle of last year a circular letter was sent to members of the Oireachtas by the Secretary of the Land Commission stating that a considerable number of the staff hitherto employed in the Land Commission had been transferred to other Government Departments, presumably to the Department of Agriculture.  On looking through the staff summary, on page 240 of the Estimates, I find, however, that there has been an increase of one in the total staff provided this year compared with last year's figures. If there are large numbers of the Land Commission staff transferred to the Department of Agriculture or to any other Departments, to do important Government work, I should like to hear why the cost of those transferred is still being charged to the Land Commission. I think the cost, if any, of such transfers should be charged to Departments in which the officials concerned are working during the current financial year, as by that means Deputies would have a correct picture of the actual cost of administering the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken part in many previous discussions of this kind during the period of office of the many Ministers who were responsible for carrying on the work of the Land Commission since the Oireachtas was established.  I consider that the work of the Minister for Agriculture, in getting people to put more land under tillage at this critical period, would have been much less difficult if the Land Commission had moved a little more quickly about the acquisition and division of large estates.  I have a number of complaints concerning my constituency.  In some cases, I regret to say that proceedings for the acquisition of large estates have been going on for a long period. <Col N="1970" /> I am not going to go into details now, but I say that it is regrettable to find in the present critical period large numbers of smallholders, suitable land-loss men, and cottage tenants living in the immediate vicinity of towns and villages, without land or plots when, by a little more expedition on the part of the Land Commission, these estates could have been acquired and divided, and a greater acreage put under tillage. There is no use in crying about that now, but I urge the Minister to do everything he can, even with the reduced number of officials at his disposal, to speed up the acquisition and division of large estates near towns and villages during this critical year. I know that colleagues of mine representing other Parties in the constituency have been pressing the Department of Lands regarding some cases I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear a little more from the Minister as to the activities that the Department proposes to carry on in the current year concerning the acquisition of bogs.  In his brief statement the Minister referred to the acquisition of bogs.  While my opinion is not the last word on the question, I think that all the powers required to encourage the production of more turf are now in the possession of local authorities.  Is it to be understood that the Land Commission will continue its activities regarding the acquisition of bogs at the same time as local authorities who have been given extraordinary powers under the Emergency Powers Act to do similar work, or will the activities of the Land Commission during the current year be suspended as far as the acquisition and division of bogs go?  I am very glad the Government decided to make use of the extraordinary powers conferred on them under the Emergency Powers Act to give every facility possible to local authorities and others to produce more native fuel.  If I had anything to do with Governmental administration or any influence with those responsible for it, I would say that if the Land Commission officials could be of any service&mdash;and I know they can&mdash;to the Government during the present emergency, they could certainly give very valuable advice and assistance to <Col N="1971" /> those responsible for the production of more turf.  Land Commission inspectors are generally very well acquainted with conditions where bogs are situate, and it would be inadvisable to bring into the administrative circle controlling the production of more peat civil servants who have no experience of the working of land or the division of bogs, especially when such very experienced officials as Land Commission inspectors are available.  If he agrees with that point of view I hope the Minister will put it before those responsible for helping local authorities, parish councils and others in the drive for more turf.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether the amount provided during the present financial year for the improvement of estates is a carefully thought out figure, based upon the expenditure of the sum mentioned in the Estimate.  Is there a detailed plan in respect of the erection of houses and the improvement of estates which will absorb the money provided under the sub-head?  There is a reduction of £102,000, a very big sum, on that sub-head for the present year compared with last year.  I should like to know if the Minister could say whether all the money provided for the improvement of estates in 1940-41 was used up, or whether any large sum was returned to the Exchequer at the end of the financial year.  With regard to the improvement of estates, I have written to the Land Commission on several occasions as to the delay&mdash;in some cases of two or three years&mdash;on the part of contractors in completing the erection of houses for tenants who have been given portions of land on different estates.  The Minister knows perfectly well, from his intimate knowledge of the rural areas, particularly in the midlands, that many of these tenants, very often, live far away from the land they have been given, and if these people are to be expected to make the best possible use of their farms, they must be put in possession of their houses within a reasonable period. They must be allowed to live on the land provided by the Land Commission in the houses to be erected, or the loss <Col N="1972" /> of very valuable time will be involved by their having to go from their own old homes to these farms.</P>
    <P>Am I to understand that the delay in completing these houses&mdash;I have about six cases in mind, in some of which the delay extends over two or three years&mdash;is due to the unsatisfactory type of contractor selected?  Can I take it that there is a penalty clause which can be put into operation against a contractor who, in the opinion of the Land Commission and the Minister, is not doing his job within the time limit laid down?  In ordinary building contracts with local authorities, there is a penalty clause which can be operated to the disadvantage of a contractor who does not do his work within a reasonable time, and, if such a clause is included in Land Commission contracts for the erection of houses, can I have an assurance from the Minister that, in cases of unreasonable delay in the completion of such houses, the clause will be put into operation in future, if it has not been put into operation in the past?  I am not sure whether it has been put into operation in the past in any cases in which it could be used.</P>
    <P>On almost every occasion on which this Estimate has come before us, I have urged the different Ministers in charge of the Land Commission to endeavour, with the assistance of their colleagues and of the Department of Finance in particular, to provide cheap loans for tenants who get portions of land.  I have come across numbers of cases of men in my own area who were exceptionally good ploughmen, herds and workers for the landlords whose estates were taken over, but who, when they got farms themselves, were unable to make a living for themselves and their families because they had no capital to purchase the necessary implements or to buy the stock necessary to work the land to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that until some such system of cheap loans for smallholders and landless men who get land from the Land Commission is devised, the land will be allowed to become semi-derelict and will not be worked to the best possible advantage; and if the <Col N="1973" /> present Minister is in sympathy with that point of view, as I should like to think he is, I hope he will use his influence to encourage the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or some other State Department, to provide capital for good types of tenants whenever land is to be given to them in future. I am personally aware of land lying in a derelict condition and of land let by such people because of lack of capital to work it, and I am sure that every Deputy representing a rural constituency knows of similar cases.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes in his desire that the Land Commission should proceed very cautiously in relation to the collection of annuities this year and, in particular, should be very careful about the number of visits the sheriff will be encouraged to pay to farmers who are living under the most trying conditions in those areas in which foot-and-mouth disease has been prevalent for so long.  The Minister's constituency has been affected in recent times, but he has a fairly good knowledge of the conditions in the Leinster counties, where, generally speaking, the farmers, small and large, have been tilling and working their land to the best of their ability.  The farmers in many of the areas affected since the middle of January last have been practically unable to attend the local fairs.  They are allowed to sell what they have only in a limited way, and the circulation of money in these areas is very small, smaller than ever I remember it, even during the economic war or any other period.  I therefore urge the Minister to advise State solicitors and other Government officials to be very slow in instructing the sheriff and his officers to collect money from farmers in present circumstances, because these farmers have not got the money to pay.  At the same time, I want to admit, as I have admitted on many occasions in the past, that the collection section of the Land Commission have always been very reasonable in their dealings with farmers or annuitants who put forward reasonable cases for an extension of time.  The trouble is that a good many of the farmers do not take the trouble to write, asking the Land Commission for an extension of time and making <Col N="1974" /> the best case they can for their application, and, in many of the cases in which the sheriff pays an unexpected visit, no case whatever for an extension has been made.  I have come across such cases.</P>
    <P>I very definitely disagree with Deputy Hughes when he makes the unique suggestion that there should be a public sworn inquiry held locally in connection with applications for the division of land.  If there were to be any such inquiry for the purpose of examining the cases of those making application for division of land, such an inquiry would not end before Deputy Hughes had gone to whatever cemetery he will go to when he passes from this world.  Life is not long enough for any of us here to see the end of any such inquiry.  I hope it is not necessary for me to have to dissuade the Minister from proceeding along any such lines.</P>

      <P>With regard to the underhand methods, I leave it to the Deputy to pursue the matter further, if he wishes, on this or some other more suitable occasion.  The Land Commission inspector generally goes down on notice given beforehand and everybody who thinks he is entitled to land&mdash;and that means nearly everybody in the district in which the estate is to be divided&mdash;turns up, and the only trouble I see&mdash;and in this respect I have sympathy with the inspector&mdash;is that the limited time at his disposal is not sufficient for him to get the necessary preliminary information which could be supplied to him on such an occasion.  I do not want to see the Land Commission influenced by local people in matters of this kind.  I dare say that in each of the 1,080 parishes of this country you will find a person who is prejudiced against his next-door neighbour, and when you have so many people looking for land and when it is only possible for so few of them to obtain it, you are bound to have all sorts of stories circulated by persons who think they are more entitled to the land than those who are to get it.  I should like to see the Land Commission <Col N="1975" /> official relying more on his own judgment and on the result of his own inquiries than on the opinion of any local celebrity who may think he is lord of the locality.  We have had cases of that kind.  I would encourage Land Commission inspectors to spend more time making inquiries and I would agree to their going to whatever person they chose in the locality, for the purpose of getting confirmation of the statements made by individual applicants, but, from my knowledge and experience of my own constituency, under no circumstances would I agree to the suggestion that there should be a sworn inquiry at the public expense for the purpose of choosing from hundreds of applicants the small number most suitable for the working of the limited amount of land available.</P>

      <P>For the last year and a half I have found that, when approaching the Land Commission, one learned that a big number of the staff had been transferred to other offices. Probably, the work in those other Departments is more essential than that in which they were engaged. During the emergency, it is difficult for the Land Commission to take up the division of land.  But I am not satisfied, judging by the figures in the Vote, regarding this transfer of officials.  I find that, under the heading of Salaries, Wages and Allowances, a sum of £335,000 is provided as against £328,000 previously.  That does not convince me that a considerable number of the staff of the Land Commission have gone to other Departments.  I myself was led to believe that their work in other Departments was more necessary than the work they would be called upon to do in the Land Commission.  I should like to have some explanation from the Minister as to the number of officials taken from the Land Commission and allocated to other Departments, such as the Department of Supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputies of this House grouse&mdash;even members of my own Party&mdash;about the migrants who have been supplied with land.  I heard these migrants being abused, and, time and <Col N="1976" /> again, I have heard of the bad conduct of the migrants from Galway, Mayo, Donegal and Kerry when they reach the midlands.  That is a matter which should be cleared up, and there is only one man who can clear it up: the Minister.  It is up to the Minister to say whether such is the case or not.  If the Minister says that the conduct of these migrants from the counties I have mentioned is such as has been described here, I will be forced to concede it, but I do not believe it, and I should like a full inquiry into the subject. Deputies have asked why migrants should get land up in the midlands. Why should the small people living on the rocks of Connemara, with a valuation of from 3/- to 7/-, be allowed to live at all, according to these critics? I say that these migrants are deserving of a living just as much as the men in the midlands&mdash;the men who have fine homes.  These migrants have been long enough living under these miserable conditions.  At one time the cry was: &ldquo;To hell or Connacht.&rdquo;  Now we are trying to take them out of that hell and give them a fair living.  I know the Government are doing their best, and I know very well that these migrants are not wanted in these localities.</P>
    <P>On every occasion that offers, I shall support that policy as long as I see that the people taken from these areas in the west, north and south can make a living.  It is all right to talk of the people on the rich lands who have got their living pretty softly.  We heard&mdash;I am speaking as much against some members of my own Party as against some members of the Government Party&mdash;of people who got their living softly with the assistance of a herd, a dog, and a ranch of cattle.  They think that the people on the western coast, or along other parts of the seaboard, with valuations of 3/-, are not entitled to the same living that they have.  I say they are, and I shall support the Government in that policy as long as the Government say that it is successful. From what I know of the character of the Mayo and Galway migrants, I think they will make good.  There may be another policy which some people think would be more suitable, but I do not know whether it would or not.  The bigger people in these areas might be <Col N="1977" /> removed, and the poorer people on the western seaboard moved into their holdings.  I do not know whether that would be more successful than the present system or not.  In these counties the land is barely sufficient to support the population which it carries.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Davin brought up the question of the improvement of estates.  The cost of improving estates has been much reduced.  I do not like to see that, particularly in the congested areas, because a good deal of employment can be given in the improvement of estates there.  Drainage, the clearing of the land, and similar works, provide a good deal of employment. That is one way in which you can relieve the large amount of unemployment which exists in the poorer districts, and, at the same time, help the country.  The material required is inconsiderable.  It is all a question of man-power.</P>
    <P>For years we have been told by the Government when sewerage schemes were being put up to them that so much money would go in material and very little labour would be employed.  The improvement of estates in all these areas, congested or otherwise, would be of great benefit in that way because the unemployed could be used for the work.  It is work that can be done at any season of the year.</P>
    <P>Recently the question of arable lands being planted has been brought to my notice.  For instance, the Bellew estate in Mountbellew was acquired by the Land Commission and a big portion of that land has been disposed of to the Forestry Department.  Some time ago the Minister for Agriculture told us that no arable land would be planted.  I am as keen as anyone on having land planted, but I believe that there is plenty of waste land in the country which could be used for planting instead of planting land that had been in tillage five years ago.  Forty acres of demesne land on this property, which was under tillage five years ago, is being planted at present.  Over 100 acres of that property, including the 40 acres now being planted, were growing crops during the last war.  Close <Col N="1978" /> to that particular property there are 26 holdings with very small valuations. That should be good land for tillage and the owners of these 26 small holdings have to pay a big price for conacre in other areas.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to take matters like that into consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister in connection with dwelling-houses on estates which have been divided. The Minister met Deputies Beegan, Killilea and myself recently in connection with one such property which was about to be disposed of, but I should like to draw his attention again to the matter.  Where lands have been divided and there is a big dwellinghouse on the estate that property should not be sold to people who are out to make money quickly.  If these dwellinghouses have to be dismantled, the Land Commission should retain the materials.  As to the point mentioned by Deputy Davin, I think the real cause is the shortage of materials.  I have seen the Land Commission getting timber cut in a wood, sending it to the sawmills and then using it a few days afterwards in the construction of houses for people who had been given divided land. These houses cannot stand up to the weather.  On the other hand, there are fine dwellinghouses and out-offices in the hands of the Land Commission which they are selling for a few hundred pounds.  The best Bangor slates are on those houses, the best of timber in the roofs, and yet they are being sold for little or nothing.</P>
    <P>I know of one case where the Land Commission sold a place and, without the main building, the out-offices and timber realised £400 and the main building £1,300.  I should like the Minister to take a note of that.  I know that these buildings will not be of much use in the future.  What should be done is that the Land Commission should use the timber and the slates of these houses for the houses they are building for those people who get divided land and in that way the houses built will be satisfactory and a credit to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider that matter and see that in the future <Col N="1979" /> such properties are not given to people for a few hundred pounds, so that they can make £400 out of them while leaving the main building standing for which they afterwards realise £1,300.  The material in these houses should be utilised.  There is plenty of lead in them as well as the finest of slates, the finest timber and the finest stone work, if it is needed.  These materials should be used for the benefit of the people put on the land by the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem strange for a city member to intervene in this debate, but last Thursday, just before this House adjourned, two elderly, nerve-stricken ladies called on me to tell me that the Land Commission was about to take over their property, to settle with the bank by paying off the mortgage and to leave them in the position that they would have to apply to the Dublin Board of Assistance for relief.  I refer to the case known as the Grace case somewhere outside Cashel.  These ladies gave me permission to say that they were applying to the Distressed Ladies' Fund for temporary relief to tide them over a bad period.  If the land of the Misses Grace is to be taken from them to satisfy somebody else, probably very deserving people who may do much more with the land than these elderly ladies, I do say that the Government should not do an injustice to these ladies whose people owned the land for the last 100 years.  These ladies live in Dartmouth Square, Dublin.  They have given me full permission to mention their names so that anybody can inquire as to their condition.  In taking over these lands to distribute amongst other people and proposing to give the bank their full pound of flesh by paying off the £3,000 mortgage and the accumulated interest, the Land Commission should do something for these ladies and see that neither the bank nor anybody wanting the land should leave them in the position that they have to apply for charity in the City of Dublin.  It is a very hard thing to have to refer to the conditions of these two ladies, but I have their permission <Col N="1980" /> to do so.  A newspaper circulating in the Cashel area has already given full details of this case.  The local people have made an appeal to the Government and to the Minister to see that these ladies will not be treated in the way that I have mentioned.  They told me that they were to be evicted yesterday.</P>
      <P>While on this I may say that about 35 years ago I acted as secretary to an association composed of evicted tenants residing in Dublin.  Later, when I became one of the representatives for the City of Dublin in the Parliament at Westminster&mdash;about 25 years ago&mdash;I had the honour, strange as it may seem to some Deputies, of pleading the cause of the evicted tenants there.  I am in the position to-day of having to ask our own Government to see that, in conferring some favour on certain people, they should do so with the goodwill of other people concerned and should not become evictors or do an injustice.</P>
      <P>It would not be right to do a favour to two or three people, and at the same time an injustice to these ladies. Granted that those who want this land are deserving of it, my submission to the House is that they should get it with the goodwill of the owners.  The latter are in a panic-stricken, nervous condition.  They should not be thrown upon the charity of the people of Dublin.  I understand that the area of land in question is about 350 acres. These ladies have asked that they should be left with 100 acres of it.  The agent assures them that the income from this would enable them to end their days in comfort.  I heard yesterday that the Minister had stayed his hand, and that the eviction did not take place.  I hope he will use his influence in this case and get some of his representatives to go to the bank with a view to coming to an arrangement with these ladies in regard to the original debt, the interest and the accumulated interest due thereon, so that they may be left with something to live on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know very much about the clamour that there is for land.  I do know it has gone up in price.  In that <Col N="1981" /> situation it is deplorable that these ladies should be thrown on the scrap heap by a Government of their own. I would ask the Minister to take an interest in this case and see that, if it be the intention to confer a favour on some people, no injustice will be done to these ladies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Estimate was opened, Deputy Linehan raised a very important point in connection with the halving of the land annuities.  Apparently the annuities were halved by the 1933 Land Act, but this apparent halving has never obtained legal confirmation.  The position at the present time would appear to be that, while our farmers have been led to believe, and do believe, that the annuities have been halved, they are still legally liable for payment of the full amount of the purchase price of their holdings.  The Minister should look into this and see that whatever danger there may be of the farmer's just rights in this connection being thrust aside at a later date, he will take steps to overcome it now.  The halving of the annuities was, as the Minister knows, an important issue in at least two general elections.  The people were left under the belief that the annuities were halved, but any farmer who obtains a certificate of the ownership of his holding will find that he is being held liable for its full purchase price. The Minister and the Government should see that the promises made to the agricultural community are honoured, having regard to the high cost and sacrifices which farmers were called upon to bear for this apparent relief.  If the legal position be as I have stated, and that farmers will have to continue paying their annuities over a prolonged period, then undoubtedly a very grave and serious injustice is being inflicted on the farming community. They have been deceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and other members of the House have put before the Minister the serious difficulties which farmers are faced with at the moment in regard to the payment of their annuities. The present position is altogether unique, inasmuch as fairs and markets are practically at a standstill, with the result that farmers are unable to dispose <Col N="1982" /> of their stock and thereby get the wherewithal to enable them to pay the annuities.  Everyone hopes that the position is a temporary one.  The Minister and the Land Commission should treat the farmers generously during this difficult time.  If they do, they will reap the reward later when the people will be able to pay their annuities more promptly than they have ever done in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind that, while it is almost impossible for farmers to sell live stock to-day, heavy demands are at the same time being made upon their capital resources to enable them to do their share in the drive for increased tillage.  Increased tillage means increased expenditure. The farmer's resources are limited. Even when it is possible for him to market his cattle, he finds it extremely difficult to finance increased tillage and at the same time meet the demands of the Land Commission.  I am certain that if a lenient view is taken of the farmer's position he will do his utmost to meet the demands of the Land Commission when he has harvested his crops.  Everyone hopes that our farmers will this year be rewarded with a bountiful harvest.  That would have the effect of relieving not only the burdens and the worries of the farmers but the worries of the Land Commission as well.  I notice that there is a slight reduction in the amount of arrears of land annuities outstanding.  The Minister will realise that much of the arrears outstanding at the moment has been hanging over since the period of acute depression from 1932 to 1935.  The arrears which accrued during those years are creating a difficulty for the Land Commission and are causing a considerable amount of additional work to the officials.  I have frequently suggested that these annuities should be dealt with under a special scheme.  They should be funded over a long period&mdash;perhaps for the remainder of the purchase period.  That would be a reasonable and efficient method of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and his predecessors have endeavoured to meet this claim on behalf of farmers by giving the officials of the collection <Col N="1983" /> department a certain amount of discretionary power so that they can make individual agreements with farmers and spread their annuities over a few years.  The Minister and every official of the Department will realise that the making of individual agreements with each farmer entails a considerable amount of work and difficulty in keeping separate accounts.  It would have been far better for the Minister to have adopted a uniform scheme of funding all arrears and to have started afresh as in 1932.  In 1935 the arrears again started to accumulate, but the years following 1932 were abnormal and I hope they will never recur in this country.  If the arrears were funded over a long period, all difficulties in collection of land annuities would disappear.</P>
    <P>It was not any farmers' organisation or farmers' representative that brought this question of land annuities into the arena of political dispute: it was the Minister's own Party.  It would be a grateful, a wise and a prudent act on the part of the Minister and his Government&mdash;before they go out of office&mdash; to have this question removed for all time from the arena of political discussion. They can do that by treating properly those who have been described as &ldquo;the wounded soldiers of the economic war&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>They will have no grievance whatever.  I am not suggesting that any part of the annuities should be remitted, as in 1933: I am suggesting that they be funded.  In that way they would be paid sooner or later and, therefore, the people in a more fortunate position will have no grievance against those who, by this act of the Government in funding arrears, have had their annuities raised.  Undoubtedly, if the arrears are funded, the tenants will have to pay a higher rate for the remaining time of payment.  I do not think those who have paid their annuities will have any grievance whatsoever.  So far as my own constituency of Wicklow is concerned, <Col N="1984" /> we have a very special grievance, inasmuch as the Minister or the Land Commission has established and put into operation in our county a special unit for the collection of land annuities.</P>

In view of that fact, I think that the Department of Lands must have some responsibility in the matter.  At least, they have connived in the collection of the land annuities by this process.

      <P>The desperate disease in Wicklow certainly found a desperate remedy, inasmuch as a criminal has been brought to justice.  The unfortunate farmers who were bled white in paying money to this particular individual have no redress.  I would ask the Minister to take care, so far as his Department is concerned wherever officials are appointed permanently or temporarily, and to ensure that they provide ample guarantees for solvency, integrity and character.  I believe that would avoid the disgrace of having this State involved in unsavoury actions of officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal very briefly with the acquisition of lands.  In all cases I have found that the Land Commission, while active enough in regard to the collection of annuities, have been painfully slow in the acquisition of lands and in all proceedings in regard to the acquisition of lands.  I have in mind <Col N="1986" /> one particular instance where the Land Commission were approached to acquire a holding which, if not altogether derelict, was at least unoccupied since 1930.  In 1933, I think, representations were made by the people of the district to the Land Commission to have those lands divided. The lands were later inspected and, up to the present, this holding has not been completely acquired.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary position in regard to this particular holding, which is in my own constituency; as a matter of fact it is in my native townland.  On this farm there were two separate holdings, one a desirable holding, convenient to the public road, easy of access and suitable for division; the other holding was distant from the public road, and a very inferior type of land.  In addition, I may mention that the house on the second holding had never been occupied except on one occasion for two or three nights by the late Charles Stewart Parnell and, both before that time and since, it has had the reputation of being haunted.  The Land Commission, in proceeding to acquire this farm consisting of the two holdings I have mentioned, acquired the holding which was inaccessible and on which was this uninhabited house.  Why, I may ask, did the Land Commission purchase the particular holding which could not be divided under any circumstances at the present moment, and have not yet acquired the more desirable holding which is part of the farm?  If any farmer were to set out to purchase that particular farm he would either have purchased the good farm first or, alternatively, he would have purchased both together.  He certainly would not have purchased the bad one first, because by so doing he would be adding to the value of the good one. That seems to be a very unbusinesslike and inefficient method of acquiring land, and I think it is typical of the methods employed by the Land Commission throughout the country.  It shows gross inefficiency because, even though the Land Commission have compulsory power to acquire the other holding, they must undoubtedly acquire it at a higher price now that it is being acquired by itself, because it <Col N="1987" /> is actually worth more, having been separated from the inferior holding. I do not think that is an efficient way of doing business.  It is typical, as I say, of the methods employed by the Land Commission in the acquisition of lands generally.</P>
    <P>Another matter in regard to which there has been criticism of the Land Commission is that where they hold turbary rights they have not taken any steps whatever to protect those rights or to maintain the turbary in a workable condition.  The position at the present time is that where the Land Commission hold turbary rights there is very little supervision.  People can come in and cut turf all over the bogs. There is no proper drainage.  Where the Land Commission hold turbary rights in trust for tenants they should see that the bogs are worked efficiently and that a certain amount of drainage is carried out or at any rate that water is not held up through improper working of the bogs.  That has also happened to my knowledge, and I think it should not have been allowed to occur.</P>
    <P>The question of deciding who are the most suitable applicants for divided lands has been very frequently under discussion in this House.  I do not agree with Deputy Hughes that a public inquiry would solve the problem. As other Deputies have pointed out, it would lead to loss of a considerable amount of time but, apart from that, I do not think it would enable the Department of Lands to give the land to the most suitable tenant.  In my opinion, in this matter the Land Commission should always be compelled to rely upon the efficiency of their inspector and his knowledge of the agricultural conditions generally. In general, an efficient and observant inspector can distinguish between an applicant who is suitable and one who is otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for an inspector visiting a small uneconomic holding or an agricultural labourer's cottage to decide by the facts as he sees them, not by anything which he may hear, whether an applicant is making an effort to live within the opportunities <Col N="1988" /> at his disposal and it would be very easy for a really efficient inspector who understands agricultural conditions to decide who is the most suitable applicant without, as I say, canvassing the opinions of the applicants' neighbours.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would suggest that it is not only right but absolutely necessary that wherever land is acquired it should be acquired at a fair price.  Farmers fought and agitated for years for the right of fixity of tenure. That right is jeopardised to a certain extent by the various Land Acts which give the Land Commission power to acquire land, but the worst features of that interference with the farmers' rights would be removed if we were assured that under all circumstances the price would be just and equitable. Not only should the farmer get the full market value for his holding, but he should get some compensation for disturbance.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that the number of officials in the Minister's Department has been reduced but that the amount allocated for salaries has not been reduced in this Estimate.  I would like the Minister to give some explanation in regard to that matter.  It appears to me that though these officials are on loan they are credited to this Department.  If that is so, it would explain the point which was raised by several Deputies. I should like the Minister to explain why, if certain officials have been transferred to other Departments, their salaries are still provided for out of this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the speech of Deputy Byrne and that of the Deputy who has just now spoken, I think I should be inclined to go much further in my appeal to the Minister. In my opinion, it would be well to have a moratorium and forego the collection of the arrears of annuities until the termination of the war.  In view of the increased amount of tillage now demanded, the incidence of the foot-and-mouth disease, and the fact that our markets are now practically closed all over, I think it would be absolutely impossible for the Land Commission to <Col N="1989" /> collect these arrears.  In reference to that, I shall just read an extract from an editorial which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on April 24th of this year.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... An answer by the Minister for Lands, to a question, showed that the arrears of land purchase annuities, on January 31, amounted to £1,092,418.  This is a large proportion of the total instalments of about £2,453,000, which accrued due within the financial year.  How far this accumulation of arrears is due to neglect or inability to pay is a question which would require investigation. The Exchequer and the Land Commission are in no way incommoded by unpunctual payment of the annuities, for sums required to meet arrears are deducted from the grants payable to the county councils in relief of rates.  On January 31 in each year the Land Commission notify to the Minister for Finance the amount in arrear, and a corresponding sum is then withdrawn from the Guarantee Fund to which the Grants-in-Aid of local taxation are hypothecated. This device often causes a serious derangement in local finances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, it does.  As was pointed out in that editorial, the Land Commission are not inconvenienced, since the sums required to meet the arrears are deducted from the grants payable to the county councils.  In view of the condition of affairs that exists I think that the best thing for the Minister and the House to do would be to forego the collection of arrears until after the war.  Almost the first item that we had on the Order Paper to-day was a Vote for about £8,000,000 for the Army, whereas the amount here involved is only about £2,000,000, and I think that that matter could well be left over until the termination of the war, and it would certainly do some good for the people.  We have this Vote of about £8,000,000 for the Army, and I do not see what good that would do for the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the acquisition of land, I certainly think that very little is being done in Mayo. <Col N="1990" /> I have brought this matter to the attention of the House on many occasions, and I am sorry to say that not very much progress has been made. I should like to ask the Minister why the Land Commission have not taken over the lands of Castlemacgarrett, in South Mayo, for the relief of the acute congestion existing in the areas of Caraun, Claremorris, Ballindine and Crossboyne.  There are about 2,000 acres in that estate and it contains valuable bog from which the owner ejected about ten tenants last year who had been cutting turf on that bog for 35 years.  We have been sending in applications to the Land Commission during the last ten years asking them to acquire that estate, but they have done nothing since.  The land is let in grazing and the bog was in the hands of the agent of Lord Oranmore and Browne for the last ten years.  Of course, after the owner ejected the tenants from that bog, something was done about afforestation, but the only planting that was accomplished was the planting of willows and laurel.</P>
    <P>You have the case of other estates also, such as Crossboyne, the Ward estate, Kilscoghagh, Aughamore and Crossard.  In 1923 or 1924 the Land Commission took over a large farm in that neighbourhood of about 450 acres, and retained that land for the relief of congestion.  They let it to a tenant down there for the time being. Since that, petitions and memorials have been sent to the Land Commission from the congests in that district, but nothing has been done.  These petitions have been sent up every year since that time, but nothing or at any rate very little, has been done by the Land Commission.  At one time the case was before the Judicial Commissioners, at another time the Land Commission, and the next time before some other commission, but the land has not been acquired yet.  Then, in a townland in that vicinity, there are 12 tenants whose poor law valuation is under £3, and yet this land has not been divided.  You have the same with regard to other parishes.  For instance, I think there are about 600 acres of untenanted lands in the parish of Kilmovee, near Ballaghaderreen.  The <Col N="1991" /> Land Commission, first of all, decided to acquire the lands of the late Misses Jordan there.  In the meantime, a gentleman came over from America and the lands were leased to him.  However, as a result of local agitation, and so forth, I think Mr. Gallagher had to give up the land, but you still have that condition of things, to which I have referred, obtaining.  The same conditions exist with regard to untenanted lands in the parish of Knock, the parish of Bekan, where there are several small estates, and at Westport&mdash;the Sligo demesne, where there are about 700 acres of arable land practically going to waste.  A question was asked here to-day by a Deputy from Mayo in connection with the acute congestion that exists amongst the uneconomic land holders at Rahins, Castlebar, County Mayo, and also asking whether the Land Commission propose selling the Browne estate at Rahins to a certain person.  I know that certain memorials were sent in to the Land Commission in that regard, but they did nothing. The land was put up for sale a short time ago, and nobody could be got to buy it in the open, but evidently somebody went and bought the land by the backstairs method.  Does the Minister or the Government think that the people of Mayo will tolerate that kind of them?  If they do, then they are mistaken.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  I think we are not getting real value from the Land Commission, and I should like to suggest to the Minister that something should be done to economise.  We all know the conditions that exist in the country at present.  I think that we should look at the various Departments here with a view to seeing where economies could be effected.  For instance, I do not see why the bonus should be paid to these people after 25 years.  It is about 20 years since the close of the last war, and I do not see why that bonus system should be continued. Take the figures in connection with this Department which we are discussing now, the Land Commission. The bonus in connection with the commissioners and secretariat is £12,566; the accountant's branch, £7,082; the <Col N="1992" /> collection branch, £18,346; the purchase branch, £10,301; the acquisition and resales division, £21,120; the subdivision branch, £1,501; the registrar's branch, £2,738; the examiner's branch, £1,822; the records branch, £1,983; the inspectorate staff, £11,594; the survey and mapping branch, £4,765.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister and the Government should take steps to have this system of bonus discontinued. Now, some Deputies on this side of the House have mentioned the matter of the prices paid by the Land Commission for lands they acquire, but I do not agree with them.  I think the Land Commission are paying far too much for the lands they acquire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the House proof in that connection.  On the 28th February I asked the Minister if he was aware that the holding of a tenant in Lissitava, Hollymount, County Mayo, Congested Districts Board, Sligo estate, comprising an area of 7 acres and 20 perches, was sold by public auction for £185 in June, 1938; that the Land Commission refused to sanction sale and on November 4th, 1938, published a notice of intention to apply to the Appeals Tribunal for leave to resume the holding unless a petition against resumption was duly presented by the tenant; that no petition was presented by Miss Larkin; and, if he would now state the cause of delay in paying the tenant for her holding which had been derelict since 1938 and also the amount the Land Commission had decided to pay for the holding.  The answer of the present Minister for Lands to that question was that the process of resumption was taking its normal course in this case; that negotiations with the tenant as to the amount of the compensation to be paid for the holding had just been completed and that a consent had been obtained to have the amount of such compensation fixed at the sum of £185, subject to the approval of the Appeals Tribunal.  The case, he added, would be concluded as soon as possible.  That holding for which the Land Commission is paying £185 has a valuation of only £1.  Surely <Col N="1993" /> to goodness, Deputies on this side of the House cannot say that that is not a sufficient price&mdash;185 years' purchase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven acres and the Poor Law Valuation is only £1.  My complaint in that connection is that the Land Commission should have let the sale go through in the first instance and should not have interfered with it. It is wilful waste of public money to interfere with it in this way.  How do the Land Commission expect the present tenant to whom they have let that land to pay for it?  How much have the Land Commission got for the land for the last three years since they bought it?  The money has been paid for the land.  I have seen the cheque, otherwise I would not have brought the case before the House.</P>
      <P>The next complaint I have to make has reference to the failure of the Land Commission to make roads through bogs.  A particular case that comes to my mind is that of Mossbrook Bog, on the De Clifford estate, in the parish of Mayo.  Twenty-six tenants in that area are unable to remove turf from the bog owing to the condition in which the road is at present.  The strange thing is that the Land Commission expended £1,500 to make a road as far as the bog, but when they reached the bog, they refused to complete the road.  There is another road within about 600 yards of this road, and the ground between these two roads had been lock-splitted by the Land Commission.  Then they suddenly withdrew the men who had been working upon the road and have not done anything further since.  The 26 tenants are obliged to carry the turf from the bog on their backs out to the road which cost £1,500.  That road was made for no other purpose than to facilitate these people in getting their turf from the bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also roads running through the Carramore, Knock, Kilvine, Bekan and Murneen bogs, which are in a very bad condition, and which should have immediate attention from the Land Commission.  The difficulty is that these roads cannot be constructed by <Col N="1994" /> the Board of Works owing to the fact that the number on the unemployment register in the electoral division would not justify their undertaking the work. There would not be more than 20 on the unemployment register in that area.  If the work is not carried out by the Land Commission, it cannot be done by the Commissioners of Public Works for the reason I have stated.  I put this matter before the Land Commission and also before the Commissioners for Public Works, who referred me to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission will send down an inspector and we shall have a report, I suppose. Then after six months they will probably send down another inspector. That is generally the procedure, but I hope that in this case some definite action will be taken to repair these roads as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of migration, the complaint I have is that the Land Commission are not proceeding sufficiently rapidly with migration. The policy of migration has been in operation for the last 10 or 12 years, but up to the present I think only about 90 families have been transferred from the Gaeltacht, of the Counties of Mayo and Galway, which, between them, send nine members to this House. The Minister should make every effort to expedite the migration of tenants from the congested districts to areas where there is plenty of land available. Everybody knows that it is impossible for these poor people to eke out a livelihood on holdings with a valuation of, perhaps, only 5/- or 10/-.  Some time ago I addressed a question to the Minister as to the condition of 15 tenants in a townland called Ranahard, Coilmore, Claremorris, whose Poor Law valuations were each under £3.</P>
    <P>I also drew the attention of the Minister to the case of ten tenants on the Ward estate in the townland of Kilscoghagh, Crossboyne, whose valuations were each under £5 and asked what steps were being taken to provide them with economic holdings.  The land is there surrounding them; they have been waiting for it for the last nine or ten years, but they have not got it yet.  If the Government desires the people to carry out more tillage <Col N="1995" /> and to produce more food, the best way to achieve that end is to take land from the ranchers and the graziers and give it over to the small tenants as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the appeal of Deputy Byrne to the Minister to stay his hand in connection with the eviction which is to take place on the Grace estate, Cashel.  If I understood Deputy Byrne rightly, the eviction was to take place yesterday, but it had not been carried out.  I have not been approached by anybody in connection with this case and I know nothing about it except what I read in the public Press.  I think perhaps the Minister has not been acquainted with the contents of the letter from these ladies which appeared in the local Press.  I am sorry that Deputy Byrne is not now in the House because I think if he approached the bank he might be able to bring about a more amicable arrangement than has been possible so far.  So far as I know, the Land Commission has given £3,000 for this very extensive holding&mdash;I think Deputy Byrne said it was over 300 acres.  The lady gave the figures in the Press, and it appears she owes that much or a little more to the bank.  I think that there should be some arrangement made by which she will get something out of this particular holding.  I would appeal to the Minister to stay his hand in connection with the proposed division&mdash;I understand it has not yet been carried out, and I hope it will not&mdash;until some better arrangement can be arrived at. Would it not be possible for him to leave her some part of the holding from which she could get a living?  I know it is not the Minister's business nor is it the business of the Land Commission to approach the bank in connection with a settlement, but from my experience of those matters I thought that, in some cases anyway, the banks were approachable.  It does seem to me a great hardship in the case of a good farm&mdash;I do not know it very particularly, but I have an idea of where it is&mdash;where those people are <Col N="1996" /> getting £3,000 odd from the Land Commission, that it should just pass over to the bank, and that they should go without a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; and be a charge on the rates or on some institution in the future.  There should be some better arrangement than that, and I hope that the Minister, in his goodness, will delay eviction to see if some better arrangement could be arrived at.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said here in regard to the collection of annuities. I think everybody realises that the present position of the farming community in this country is very bad. During the last six months the farmers have been practically unable to dispose of any live stock in any part of the country.  That is a terrible position.  I do not want to be taken as saying that the Land Commission had been too harsh.  So far as I know, when they were approached in the proper spirit, the local court officers and others concerned have taken a reasonable attitude in regard to the collection of those debts.  I hope that policy will continue, and perhaps the Land Commission and the court officers will be more generous in the future than they have been in the past.  The Minister and everybody else are well aware of the position.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Nally in regard to the price paid for land.  He has quoted a case; I suppose it is a very exceptional one. I take this view, and I make no apology for it, that if land is to be taken up it ought to be paid for at the market value.  I do not at all subscribe to the idea that the Land Commission have been generous purchasers of land in the past.  They decidedly have not. I heard Deputy Hickey a while ago saying &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to the statement of Deputy Nally that too much had been paid for the land.</P>

I call it confiscation, and I make no apology to anyone <Col N="1997" /> for saying so.  Farmers who have bought land or have had it in their families for generations should get a decent price from the Land Commission if it is taken from them.  They should get the market value.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about an exorbitant price.  I think they should get the market value.  It is very unfair to take land from farmers at the prices which have been operating in this country.  My last word on this Estimate will be in connection with fuel.  The Land Commission are in possession of estates in this country. A good deal has been said in this House and all through the country about the shortage of fuel which is likely to exist, and the shortage which exists at present.  I will be a little more explicit.  I will take, for instance, the Bessborough estate. There is no doubt about the fact that there is a lot of timber on the Bessborough estate which is good for nothing else but firewood, and I would appeal to the Minister and the Land Commission to find some way in which it can be utilised for firewood in the coming winter.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say that they should cut down timber which would be useful for other purposes.  I am referring to scrub timber, which is no use for building purposes or for anything except firewood, and there is plenty of it on some of those estates.  So far as the Bessborough estate is concerned, there is plenty of scrub timber there which will never be any use except for firewood, and I think the present would be an appropriate time to do something which would put that timber at the disposal of people who might want some firewood for the coming winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present moment there is a lull in the activities of the Land Commission, and I think during this lull would be a very good time to have a general review of the whole position of land division in this country.  I do believe that a review is needed.  We have now had land division for 15 or 20 years and, to my <Col N="1998" /> mind and the minds of a large number of people, there is a good deal wrong with that land division.  In the county I come from, where intensive land division has gone on for the last ten or 15 years, we who come from the practical farming type realise that the old cycle will take place again in that county, that is, that the land will go back to the ranches again unless the Land Commission realise that the lands they are giving out are not economic.  A holding of 22 or 27 statute acres of land given to a man with no money is almost worse than useless. That land is going to be set by that man to some local rancher.  That is what is happening in perhaps 80 per cent. of the cases in my county.  The man who has got that land is perhaps a workman for this big rancher.  He gets his constant employment, and sets his land for some small rent to this rancher, who has more or less a bit of power over him.  The ditches, which cost a good deal of money to put there, are allowed to fall down, and the gates and piers are neglected, with the result that in a good many cases the small farms have gaps broken into them from the big man's farm.  It is really the same old ranching system all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is really wrong, not so much in the last few years as in the first five or six years, say, from 1932 to 1937, is that the wrong type of applicants were selected&mdash;men who never had an outlook on land, and who had not a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; in their pockets.  They were given farms.  How they got the land, no one knows.  As I said here last year, men who should not have been given a cottage garden have got farms, and they have hardly ever seen them since the day they got them.  Those are the types of farms which I hold will go back to the ranching system. Those men had neither an economic nor a national outlook.  They want to get all they can, to live as easily as they can, and put all the expense they can on the State.  That is why I say there should be a general review of the position.  In my own county and a few neighbouring counties I see the same thing happening.  The land is being wilfully neglected.  A man comes along and tears up the land with the <Col N="1999" /> plough, takes wheat off it for three or four years, and in the end will not even sow grass seed there, but leave it to go back into a wild state.  I believe the Land Commission should exercise more supervision in that connection; it is not fair to the State, or to thrifty farmers, to allow that sort of thing to go on.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the practice of giving five or seven acres to a cottier who lives in the vicinity of a large estate.  I fully agree with the idea of giving a labouring man, living in a cottage, five or six acres to enable him to give grass to his cow or donkey, but I think that when the Land Commission give that land to the cottier they should take over the cottage and have it vested.  I am a member of the Meath Board of Health and we have had cases brought to our notice where the Land Commission gave five or six acres to the occupant of a cottage.  In at least one instance the man died and the board transferred the cottage, but the five acres did not go to the new cottier.  What happened was that some relative of the original occupant, living some 20 miles away, got the land.  He hardly knew where it was.  I suggest that when land is given to the occupant of a cottage it is the duty of the Land Commission to combine that cottage with the holding and vest it, instead of having, as at present, the rent of the cottage paid to the board of health and the rent of the land paid to the Land Commission.  Such a system is causing endless confusion.  It would not be very difficult for the Land Commission to take over the cottage.  It is wrong to have the ratepayers carrying the burden of those cottages when it is really the duty of the Land Commission to take them over and vest them in the tenants who get the five or seven acre holdings.  The annuity on the combined holding could then be paid to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I suggest that more care should be taken in the matter of selecting applicants for land.  Unless a man has a few hundred pounds in his possession, it is almost useless to give him land. Giving land to a man who has no money is, I might say, worse than useless. <Col N="2000" /> It merely means putting a burden on himself and the State and eventually the land will revert to a large landholder.  I am aware that fully 90 per cent. of the holdings on one estate have gone back to one man.  To the credit of that man let me say that at one time he was a herd on the estate. He was a thrifty and a hard-working man and he bought one little farm after another, with the result that to-day he is the largest landholder in the area.  At the same time, there must be something wrong with land division when many of the men who get small farms fall out and most of these farms revert to the large landholders.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should see to it, when they are giving a man a holding, that it should be of sufficient size to maintain that man and his family. I think the Minister will agree that in the Midlands, at any rate, no holding could be considered adequate unless it contains from 30 to 40 Irish acres.  Any man who has a 30 or 40 acre holding can be said to be as solid as a rock. Such landholders meet with bad times and with good times, but they are never knocked out.</P>
    <P>It is not so with the unfortunate individuals who have only ten or 20 acres.  Such holdings are definitely uneconomic and no man is able to live on them.  When they are dividing the lands in Meath, Westmeath and Kildare I suggest that the Land Commission should make sure that the holdings are economic.  If you divide the lands of Meath into uneconomic patches, such as I have seen in certain places, you will tend to destroy the whole economy of the country.</P>
    <P>The best of the cattle trade of this country passes through Meath, Westmeath and Kildare.  That is the main gateway to the British and the Dublin markets.  Every beast worth while in the west and the south is lorried or transported in some other way to the lands of Meath, Westmeath and Kildare.  That cannot take place in the future if you continue to divide the lands in those counties into small uneconomic patches.  The fairly large holdings in Meath and Westmeath have <Col N="2001" /> been responsible for our good cattle trade up to the present.  You cannot finish a beast on a 20-acre holding.  Let us assume that a man needs a horse or pony, two cows and a little patch of meadow to provide the animals with fodder in the winter.  What has he left to fatten cattle on, or to rear any type of live stock?</P>
    <P>These things have been overlooked year after year, with the result that the system of land division, which should be of some use to the country, is quite the reverse.  It will eventually mean completing the old cycle and you will have the ranching system all over again.  I want to stop that ranching system and, if the Government want to put an end to it, they will see that every man who is entitled to land will get an economic parcel.  If he does, he will be able to give employment.  A man with 40 acres can give employment the whole year round to one man and he may be able to employ one or two men casually, whereas the 20-acre farm is too uneconomic to maintain the occupant and his family, not to mind giving employment.  The whole system of land division on such uneconomic lines is nonsensical and I might even describe it as unnatural for any Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with the manner in which houses are being erected for successful local land applicants.  In my own locality there are three or four houses that were started some years ago, and the roof of at least one has been left without slates or tiles for the last three years. What with the wet weather in the winters and the drought in the summers, that roof is in a perfectly disgraceful condition.  I hope the Land Commission will put on a new roof, because it would be unfair to the future tenant of that house to leave the existing roof there.  I cannot understand why so much attention is devoted to the migrants from other counties and so little to the local people.  The Land Commission devote all their time and energy to the provision of houses, sheds, yards and everything else for the colonists, while right beside them the local men, who are lucky to get land are left without houses for a very considerable time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> In some cases nothing is done for them inside three or four years.  I know some of those migrants who are very honest, hard-working men, and they are living in comfortable houses, while local men who got land at the same time are not yet supplied with a residence.  In some cases even the foundations have not been laid.  That is unfair and it is the cause of many grievances.  It would seem that the Land Commission do not care a damn for the local people so long as they can deal satisfactorily with migrants from the West of Ireland.  I should like the Land Commission to deal equally with the West of Ireland people and the Meath people, and there should be no discrimination in regard to the erection of houses.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission are building sheds in the future, I suggest that they should make provision for a loft in each shed.  A large store would be of great advantage to farmers for the storing of crops.  No provision is now made for a loft in connection with these houses.  It would be of immense benefit to a small farmer if the roof on the shed that is provided could be raised about one yard, because then there would be room for storage on a loft.  The cost of changing the plans would not amount to more than £5.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied at the way pumps are being sunk on different farms.  I visited several places in County Meath at the request of tenants, and found that when the Land Commission sank pumps water was found at 15 or 18 feet, because the country was at the time flooded, while in August or September these pumps were dry.  Some of the pumps that have been erected are not giving any supply of water.  That is a shame and a disgrace.  The Land Commission should see to it that there is a water supply available all the year round.  Some people have to go miles for a barrel of water.  The present system of dealing with these pumps results only in a waste of public money. That is unfair to the tenants and to the taxpayers.  One of the great grievances of tenants in County Meath concerns a constant supply of water.</P>
    <P>I asked a question in the House recently about the vesting of holdings.  I <Col N="2003" /> am not satisfied that the Land Commission is making an effort to vest land in thrifty people who were put into possession 10 or 20 years ago.  I know several holdings that have been divided for years, on which the tenants have paid their rents punctually, but they have not yet been vested.  These people want to be in the position of being able to say that they own their farms, so that they can walk into the banks and ask for a loan of £100 or £200 to buy stock.  They cannot do that now.  If they go to the banks for a loan of money now they are told that it cannot be given.  If they could get loans when they require them, it would give them a chance of improving their position, especially when it is known that they are paying their way and are credit-worthy.</P>
    <P>I was misunderstood when I spoke here on previous occasions about the Gaeltacht colonies.  What I intended to do was to speak strongly against a class of people who should never have got land or grants.  I was referring to some of the worst types, to men who never worked their holdings.  All they wanted was money to drink.  I was not criticising the colonists, but people who had drunk themselves out of holdings they had previously.  I am satisfied that migrants from Mayo, Kerry, and other counties have proved themselves to be a fine manly body of men.  I have given employment to some of them, and I have nothing to say against them.  I am glad to say that an improvement has taken place in the conduct of those that I criticised, and that they are mingling in a friendly way with the local people.  There is not as much brawling now as there was in the past. Some of the conduct that took place in some of these colonies was a disgrace. The conduct that occurred in Athboy at one period was a perfect disgrace. There were drunken brawls and incidents that were never known to occur in Meath previously.  I am not condemning all the people.  Some of those who have come to Meath are a fine class of people.  With the administration of the law, these people will probably settle down and become useful members of the community.  The section that I criticised may be a small <Col N="2004" /> section, but certainly conduct that took place did a great deal of harm to the policy of migration.  If it was allowed to continue, what other attitude could be expected from the local people?  I am glad to say that the newcomers are mingling with the local people now.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Land Commission are dealing satisfactorily with the claims of large numbers of farmers sons in the county, when estates are being divided.  A farmer's son with £200 or £300 in his pocket should not be passed over in the division of land. The only way to make these colonies a success is to get the migrants to mix with the people in the district.  The tendency at present is to erect 15 or 20 houses in an isolated district.  I consider that that is only causing friction and doing harm.  If Meath or Westmeath people were put into holdings side by side with colonists, goodwill would be created.  The present policy is resulting in one class looking down on the other, when one is as good as the other.  I ask the Land Commission to try to bring about goodwill by putting the Meath people and the western people on an equal basis.  It should be remembered that about 98 per cent. of the local people applied for holdings that were given to these colonists, and were turned down.  Consequently, there is bound to be some dissatisfaction. The Land Commission should try to mix the holdings.</P>
    <P>I am not against the policy of bringing people from the West of Ireland. It would be unnational to oppose that policy.  Those who have visited the West of Ireland realise that the people there had to try to live on three or four acres of what was perhaps mountain land.  Most of the migrants speak the Irish language but, in my opinion, the language will be killed if there is not a link between the people in Meath and the people in the west.  If there were fair-sized colonies, so as to form a chain of holdings from the west to the midland colonies, the Irish language would be preserved by the people.  Those who have come up from the west speak the Irish language now but I believe that in five or six years' time they will lose their knowledge of the language.  Many of them are ashamed to speak Irish at the present <Col N="2005" /> time because they are amongst people who do not know Irish.  Those of us who believe in fostering the Irish language doubt if it is a good thing to isolate small numbers of people in a strange place.  It would be a better policy to bring migrants up slowly and to have colonies consisting of 200 or 300 people every 15 or 20 miles from Mayo to Meath.  If the large ranches that I heard Deputy Nally referring to, some of which contain from 500 to 2,000 acres, were divided, it would relieve congestion in the west, and the owners of these estates could be given not 300 acres, but 80 acres of land, on which they could make good in County Meath.  They will make good on that land; they will give employment; and they will buy cattle from the West of of Ireland, but if you divide the county into the small scraggy patches into which you are dividing it at present, you will live to regret it because you will kill the cattle export trade if you tear up County Meath as you are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking without experience of this matter.  I have full experience and I mix with the people who export cattle.  To-day they are shaking their heads and saying that if the present process goes on the cattle trade will be finished within 20 years, and all we shall be able to export will be poor scraggy stores.  While we are in the position that we are able to hold any market to which we send our fat cattle, we ought to try to hold it and not to kill it.  It is grand to have land in the country capable of finishing a beast early in June without any artificial feeding whatever, and is it not worth while nursing and conserving that land?  I do not want that land divided into 1,000 acre ranches, but into economic patches on which a man can finish his cattle.  I suggest that the Land Commission should pay more attention to these matters and less to the whispering in different counties that so-and-so should get land, and when they get the land you find that they have not got a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; to work it.</P>
    <P>I know also that things are &ldquo;slipped across&rdquo; the Land Commission in my county.  I know certain types of men <Col N="2006" /> who, when asked by the Land Commission inspector: &ldquo;Can you show me your money?&rdquo; are able to take £100 or £150 out of their pockets, with the result that the inspector thinks that these are men who are going to make good.  But where does such a man get that money?  He gets it from the big farmer beside him who gave it to him for the day the inspector was to call, and, the day after, the money is handed back and the small farm this man gets is secured by the big farmer beside him on the 11-months' system.  I urge the Land Commission, if they are going to divide any more land, not to listen to stories from these warriors but to go to the local clergyman, who knows every man in the parish, of whatever denomination, and who will tell you honestly and straightforwardly: &ldquo;Give So-and-so land because he will work it, but do not give it to So-and-so because he is no good.&rdquo;  In that way, you will get proper land division and you will not allow these fellows to &ldquo;slip it across&rdquo; you.</P>
    <P>When large estates in County Meath are divided there is always the problem of the disposal of the big mansion.  There are many of these mansions, built of the best of granite, with stabling and lofts that any man would envy, but, unfortunately, under the blind policy of the Land Commission for a number of years, men have come with axes and crowbars, have torn them down and made roads from the material, while people in the country are crying out for granaries for the storage of grain.  It is the duty of the Land Commission to see that buildings of that type, which are roofed with the best slates and timber, are not allowed to fall into a condition of complete neglect, and it is their duty to leave an adequate supply of land with these places so that the community, whether religious or otherwise, may take it over and make a success of it.  It is terrible that we who regard as a difficult problem the provision of labourers' cottages should tear down these great monuments.  They may be monuments of inequity in the past, built on the sweat of slaves, but they are there at present, and they are Irish property, and the Land Commission <Col N="2007" /> should think twice before tearing down even one of them.  I ask the Land Commission to realise that they are more valuable than as material for making yards and roads.  Let them be utilised for something.  There are men in this country and in America longing to pay good money for these mansions so that they may live in decent surroundings and give employment, and I urge the Land Commission not to destroy them in future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year the case of Mrs. Connolly, a widow, of Flathouse, Dunboyne, and, in that regard, the Minister's predecessor more or less promised that he would have her case investigated and, if possible, provide her nephew with a holding.  In that case, about 200 acres were taken for which this widow did not get even a five-pound note.  She has a nephew with a young family who applied for land, but was turned down, and I ask the Minister, as a matter of justice, to see that this young man gets a farm, because that woman was robbed bare-facedly by the Irish Land Commission at the call of a local club.  I am not afraid to say that.  The agitation was started solely by people who got land, half of whom will never work it, and, to gain their own ends, that woman was robbed.  Why is not justice done in this matter?  Is this woman not deserving of justice when she was robbed of her holding?  No credit would be due to the Government for giving a holding to the nephew and rectifying some of the bad work done.</P>
    <P>In County Meath, there is a large number of estates with hundreds of acres of timber and the Land Commission are in a quandary as to what they should do with it.  They have told me that the areas are not large enough for forestry purposes, and, as there is very little bogland and no hope of fuel for the coming year in those districts&mdash; the timber has been lying there for 20 years, having been knocked down by storms, but no man is allowed to go in and carry any of it out on his back&mdash; I ask the Land Commission to open these timber areas to the poor during the present emergency and give this timber out as firewood&mdash;I do not care <Col N="2008" /> at what price&mdash;because these are areas in which it is not possible to get a sod of turf.  Let this timber be utilised and let the old woods be replanted, because it is a pity to see them as they are.  If they are left as they are, they are going to constitute an eyesore.</P>
    <P>Now that there is a lull in land division, I urge the Land Commission to exercise great care, as I and others have suggested before, to ensure that the old vicious system of ranchers does not return.  The ranchers will come back in spite of you, if you do not give economic farms to men who are fit, able and willing to work, and if you give land to men who are able to &ldquo;slip it across&rdquo; you by showing £200 which does not belong to them at all.  Let them ask the proper people who should and should not get land.  If they do so, they will have very little trouble.  There is no use in poking around and asking one man about his neighbour, because the old tradition in this country is: &ldquo;If I can get it, to hell with the rest.&rdquo; Every man wants it for himself, and if he thinks his neighbour is about to get a farm, he says: &ldquo;He is a terrible character.  Down that fellow.  If you only knew what his father did before him.&rdquo;  Every man wants a farm, but there are only a few to be given out in the different areas, and I ask the Land Commission to waken up because they are being fooled morning, noon and night by &ldquo;quick&rdquo; fellows.  I called them certain names last year, and I may be sorry for doing so, but everything I said was perfectly true, and I defy contradiction of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister the reason for the Land Commission's decision not to resume any lands during the emergency, because I think the land question goes to the root of most of our problems.  It goes to the root of our unemployment problem.  It is one of the greatest problems the people of this country have had to face for a long number of years and I cannot see why the Land Commission should make up their minds not to do anything about land division for the duration of this emergency.  An emergency is a time in which the Land Commission would be better able to judge the farms that <Col N="2009" /> should be taken over and the land that should be resumed.  At a time like this, when the nation is faced with a food shortage, the Land Commission would be better able to judge what farms could be made more productive and what farmers are not making the best use of their land.  The present condition of affairs would give a good indication to the Land Commission as to what land should be resumed in areas like Meath and the midlands so as to relieve congestion in constituencies such as that which I represent.</P>
      <P>We have in the courts, day after day, prosecutions against farmers who own large tracts of arable land.  So far as I can see, absolutely no excuse is advanced on behalf of those people as to their failure to comply with the law in this regard.  So far as I understood it, the policy of the Department was that farms like those should be resumed and that people who would not make proper use of the land held by them should be made to realise their responsibilities.  If they did not use their land for the good of the community, I understood that it was to be taken over.  We have had cases like those cropping up day after day during this emergency, and I think that now is the time for the Land Commission to make a catalogue of these people and to enforce its policy in respect of those who will not contribute to the support of the community, particularly in a time of emergency.  If these people will not use their land for the good of the community as a whole, they should not be allowed to hold it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a matter has cropped up&mdash; it is a matter of administration in the Minister's Department&mdash;to which attention should be paid.  Numbers of tenants apply for the consent of the Land Commission to the sales of their tenancies.  There have been long delays&mdash;sometimes from three to six weeks&mdash;in complying with the applications of solicitors for the consent of the Land Commission to the sales.  In addition, when these people apply for certificates of the redemption value of their annuities, the Land Commission hold them up for from four to eight weeks.  When a father, for example, transfers his holding to his son, the <Col N="2010" /> deed must be stamped within 14 days of execution.  The deed is generally drawn when application is made to the Land Commission for a certificate of redemption value of the annuity. From five to eight weeks may elapse before that certificate is sent down, with the result that the deed has to be stamped under penalty and the resulting fine has to be borne by that small farmer.  That represents from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. of the ordinary stamp duty on his deed.  I can see no reason why the Land Commission should not issue these certificates in time.  When applied to for a certificate of redemption value, they should be able to forward the certificate within two or three days of the receipt of the letter.  The present position creates great hardship and involves quite a good deal of money to the people concerned. It is a matter that could be adjusted with very little trouble.  I have had a number of complaints about this matter and I have had experience of it myself.  I ask the Minister to look into this question and see that the Land Commission send out these certificates of redemption value immediately on application being made.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I cannot see why the Land Commission refuse to go through with resumption of holdings during the emergency.  I am prepared to grant the Minister the present Vote, or even an increased Vote, if I am satisfied that the people are getting value for the money expended.  According to the 1926 census, in Mayo 59,962 people were employed, or supposed to be employed, in agricultural occupations.  By 1936, this number appears to have been reduced to 53,321&mdash;a decrease of 6,641 in the number of persons engaged in agriculture in Mayo during that period. The expenditure of the Land Commission in 1926 was £693,600.  In 1936, it had increased to £1,578,379&mdash;an increase of £884,779.</P>
    <P>The officials of the Land Commission in 1926 numbered about 800.  In 1936, they had increased to 955&mdash;an increase of 155.  The total number of people engaged in agricultural production in the State in 1926 was 204,914.  In 1936, the number was 191,429&mdash;a reduction of 13,485.  While in Mayo, the number of <Col N="2011" /> people engaged in agricultural production during that period appears to have been reduced by 6,641, the reduction in the whole State was 13,485, so that the reduction in Mayo represented about 50 per cent. of that of the whole State.  If the Land Commission policy had been successful over this period, we should expect to find more people engaged in agriculture and more employment in agriculture.  In my own county, where we have a very acute congestion problem, we appear to be accountable for about 50 per cent. of the decrease in the number of people engaged in agriculture during those years.  The total number of people occupied wholly or mainly in agricultural production appears to have been reduced by 13,000 during those years while, at the same time, we appear to have increased our expenditure on the Land Commission by several thousands of pounds and also to have increased the number of officials employed by the Land Commission by well over 100. We have an increase in the expenditure of the Land Commission, an increase in the number of people employed by the Land Commission and a reduction in agricultural employment. It does not appear, therefore, that the policy of the Land Commission, as practised over a number of years, has been a success.  So far as my own constituency in Mayo is concerned, the reduction in the number of people engaged in agriculture is mainly due to migration.  I do not mean the number of people who have been migrated by the Land Commission to holdings in Meath and elsewhere.  I mean the number of people who have migrated from the land as a result of economic pressure.  In my opinion, coming, as I do, from a congested county, there is really no such thing as a flight from the land.  The people leave the land, in my opinion, solely owing to economic pressure.  If these people had land to work, you would not have a flight from the land and you would not have this migration.  It is absolutely impossible to expect a family of nine or ten people who are on a farm of £5 valuation to remain there all their lives.  They must go <Col N="2012" /> somewhere as only one member of the family can inherit the holding.  That member may stay, the other nine members must migrate somewhere.</P>
    <P>I agree that the problem is a very large and very difficult one, but, if we are to attack it, I am afraid we will have to go outside the system that has been taking up the time of the Land Commission and that has ruled the Land Commission for a number of years.  I certainly fail to understand the Land Commission's reasoning in connection with the acquisition of lands and in refusing to resume various estates.  I have knowledge of a case in my own constituency where the Land Commission resumed a farm of 15 acres of cut-away bog outside the town of Louisburgh.</P>
    <P>That was a very good thing, as congestion is very severe about that area. But when the Land Commission were asked to resume a farm of land outside Castlebar, consisting of over 200 acres, they refused, and I cannot understand their reasoning.  If the owners of holdings in that area under £5 valuation put up reasons for acquisition to the Land Commission, whether the land is good or bad, I cannot understand why the Land Commission turned down those people whose land is adjoining that farm where there are 200 acres available, and why the Land Commission will allow a resident of another State to purchase that farm and settle down there.  I cannot understand the reasoning of the Land Commission in giving their consent to the sale of yearly tenancies.  It is necessary in the case of a yearly tenancy to apply to the Land Commission for consent to the sale.  I think that in such a case, particularly in a congested area, the Land Commission should refer the matter to the local officer, have a full investigation made of it, and find out whether there were local tenants who required that land, or whether the particular farm which was to be sold was situated in an area that was very congested.</P>
    <P>I have a case in mind in which a gentleman, resident in England at the moment and for a number of years, <Col N="2013" /> who is not a national of this country, has purchased a farm in the County Mayo.  It has been purchased in trust for him by a solicitor for a sum of nearly £2,000.  Surrounding that farm there are, roughly, 30 tenants whose valuations are under £5.  This gentleman is in charge of an ammunition works in England at a salary of over £2,500 a year.  Because he is possibly afraid of his position, and because he wants a good investment for his money in this country, he can get his agent here to purchase a farm in a congested district and the Land Commission will consent to that sale.  The tenants in that particular area are prepared to pay the owner the price offered by this gentleman.  The Land Commission are not prepared to withhold their consent to the sale to this gentleman and have these lands given to the tenants round the place.  In a congested area the Land Commission should be extremely careful in giving their consent to any sale, and they certainly should not allow people from any other State, who want to invest money here, to come in here and get a sound investment for their money, notwithstanding the demands of the people in the local area. I think it is a scandal that such a thing should be allowed by the Land Commission or anybody else in this country.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that this is not the time for the Land Commission to sit back and wait till the emergency is over.  I suggest that this is the time when the Minister and the Land Commission should examine places in this country which should be resumed, and the time when the Land Commission should be busy resuming places that are not being made use of during the emergency; and, in particular, that the Land Commission should not allow a resident of any other State to invest his money in land here while the people of the country are badly in need of that land, and are living in a state of congestion.</P>
    <P>There are numbers of farms throughout the country in the hands of the Land Commission.  Some of these farms have been in the hands of the Land Commission for a number of years and no effort seems to have been made by the Land Commission to divide these <Col N="2014" /> farms.  In some cases they have been taken for grazing and in other cases the Land Commission are letting them out in conacre.  The invariable excuse given by the Land Commission is that they cannot divide those farms or do anything about them as the lands would not be sufficient to meet the congestion in those areas.  I suggest to the Minister that, particularly during the emergency, all those lands should be allotted out on some system, whether it is right or wrong.  If the Land Commission have lands on their hands, I suggest that they should get shut of them, and, whether there is trouble locally or not, let those lands out to the tenants who will make some use of them during the emergency. They will have a chance of tilling them and of relieving the congestion in those areas.  I suggest to the Minister that the Land Commission should not have stock managers taking in stock on those various farms throughout the country; that the Land Commission should let the farms to the various tenants applying for them, and that more use will be made of those farms and more benefit derived by the people in the surrounding district whether the local problem of congestion is solved or not.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  In connection with the warrants for the recovery of the arrears of annuities there are certain sheriffs' fees charged, and in counties like Mayo the amount of the sheriffs' fees depends on where the sheriff resides.  The sheriff may have messengers in different towns and areas of the county 30, 40 or 50 miles away.</P>

      <P>If you so rule, Sir, I hope you will not rule against me when I bring up the matter on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  I should also like to bring to the attention of the Minister the difficulties that appear to arise between the Dublin office and the local offices of his Department.  I suggest to the Minister that in order to solve various difficulties that arise throughout the various areas it is necessary that he should take compulsory powers of distribution. In other words, if a tenant is not satisfied with the allotment that has been given to him by the Land Commission, the officials of the Department should have the power to compel him to take it.  I know several cases in which the resettling of a whole area has been held up because one tenant refused to take the division given to him.  That can happen because one single tenant may be a crank.  There may be nothing at all in his objection, but, for some reason of his own, he refuses to accept his allotment, thereby holding up the resettlement of a whole area.  The Minister, if he has not the power to deal with cases of that sort, should ask the House for it, so that one tenant would not be able to hold up the work of the Land Commission in a particular area.  If the Land Commission are not prepared to examine the cases put by various tenants in the congested areas, and if the Minister and the Land Commission are not prepared to take further steps to go part of the way towards solving this question of congestion, then I fear that <Col N="2016" /> we will not see, in our lifetime, any positive results from the policy of the Land Commission over a number of years.  Migration is the only policy, in my view, for congested areas like Mayo.  I was glad to observe that a Deputy on the Opposition Benches has changed his mind about that policy since we discussed this Estimate last year.  It must be quite obvious to anybody that congestion, in a county like Mayo, cannot be relieved with the amount of land that is available there. If the Minister hopes to make any headway in relieving the congestion that prevails, the only way to do that is to get those people out of the congested areas and put them in those counties where there is land available for distribution.  There is no land available to give them economic holdings in their native counties.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement made by a Deputy opposite, that the Mayo men and the Galway men have been welcomed in areas like County Meath. I have not seen that any of them have had to be prosecuted for failure to till their land or to carry on their farming operations in accordance with the best traditions and methods of husbandry. Unless the Minister and his Department want the code of the Irish Land Acts to go down in history as the greatest tribute that can be paid to incompetency in this country, I would ask him to consider seriously the question of the purchase of farms in a county like Mayo by foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That kind of thing is allowed to go on while you have people there actually starving on holdings with a £2 valuation whose claims for some land have been turned down.  That sort of thing could create very serious trouble. Serious agrarian trouble would have arisen in some of those areas but for the fact that the people in them took the advice of local men and acted with restraint.  I would ask the Minister personally to investigate those cases and not be satisfied with what his officials tell him&mdash;I for one have completely lost all faith in Land Commission officials&mdash;and to disregard their reports.  If he does then, with the cooperation of the people, he will, I hope, in the present emergency make a <Col N="2017" /> success of the policy of the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to utter a few words of warning to the Minister, especially in regard to the concluding part of Deputy Moran's speech.  The Deputy raised there a very serious issue.  If the Minister were to adopt the policy advocated by him&mdash;not to sanction the sale of farms&mdash;then I say he is going to destroy the value of land here.  People would be unable to borrow any money on their land, and if it were put up for sale they would get nothing for it.  I would ask Deputy Moran to consider that aspect of the question.  The Deputy should remember that under the Land Acts the Land Commission have full power to take any land they want.  To say that when a farm is put up for sale the Land Commission should step in and declare that they were going to take it over is, I suggest to Deputy Moran, a very dangerous policy to advocate.  If it were to meet with general acceptance it would mean that the land of Ireland would be worth nothing.  Deputy Moran who is, I think, a solicitor should not advocate a policy of that kind.  He must know the kind of atmosphere he is going to create by so doing.  If a man from England, America, or any other country wants to buy a farm here, why should he not be allowed to do so?  If he fails to work it in a proper manner, the Land Commission have the power to take it from him.</P>

      <P>If anybody advocates and gets support for his policy, that when an Englishman, an American or anybody else buys a farm here the Land Commission should not sanction the sale of it, then land in this country will be worth nothing.  We should use our commonsense in discussing a question like this.  I am not against the dividing of land, but I am against a policy of confiscation.  I was surprised to hear a member of my own Party, Deputy Nally, say that the Land Commission were giving too much for land.  I know some owners of land&mdash; old ladies and others&mdash;who are in such poor circumstances that they have been obliged to look for home assistance. The Land Commission took their land and everything they had. Some of them are now in the county home.  I am glad to say that the Land Commission changed their policy in that respect during the last year or so. When the Land Commission take land from people they should pay fair compensation for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the division of land, and the policy of the present Government that a single man cannot get a portion of such land, great hardship has been created in several cases that have been brought to my notice, in this way.  A big estate is divided, and almost beside it you have a man and his family living on, say, 20 acres.  He may have four sons.  Because they are unmarried they cannot get a portion of that estate.  A feeling of resentment is thereby aroused locally when it is seen that people from Mayo and other counties are brought there by the Land Commission and given portions of that estate.  It may very well be that some of the ancestors of that family were evicted from that estate. I think the Land Commission should change their policy in that matter and allow their inspectors, when dividing these big estates, to give holdings on them to the unmarried sons of local men with small farms.  At the present time, under the policy of the Land Commission, no single man can get a bit of land, even when an estate is divided up against his door.  Maybe his great-grandfather was evicted out of that estate.  It is a very wrong policy, and I would ask the Minister <Col N="2019" /> to look into cases where there are deserving applicants around an estate which is being divided.  It may be that there are three or four sons in a small holding and at least one of those sons should get a farm of land on that estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And they would make a success of it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point about migration.  It is all right to bring people from Connemara to better land, but there is a good deal of congestion in Meath and Westmeath, where there are a lot of small-holders.  They should be seen to first.  There are certain nests in Westmeath where there may be 200 or 300 small-holders with four or five acres of land apiece.  Four or five of those holdings should be made into one, and the others moved about the county before outsiders are brought in.</P>
      <P>I know that the Land Commission inspectors are doing very good work, but there is a lot of turbary in the hands of the Land Commission for years and years: now is the time for the land commissioners to set in and divide these bogs.  There are numbers I know of which should be given out to the people.  Let them cut turf and let them start drainage.  This is an opportunity to provide useful employment, and now is the right time of the year to drain them.  There are two or three bogs not far from me with hundreds of acres belonging to the Land Commission, which could be divided up in the slack period. It would not cost a lot of money to the Land Commission, and would give employment at useful work in a time of emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which should be dealt with is that of returning receivable orders to tenants.  I have numerous complaints about tenants not getting their receivable orders back.  Some have not got them for years.  They get a slip marked &ldquo;paid&rdquo;.  When the farmer goes to the Land Commission, they seem to think the receivable orders have been returned.  Some of the tenants may be in arrears, but, if the receivable orders were sent back, it would be clear to them where they stand.  In my county, at the time the <Col N="2020" /> sheriff was going about, there were a number of cases where people had to pay an annuity of £5 or £6.  Maybe they paid £2 or £3, but they do not know where they stand.  It would mean a lot to them to get the receivable orders back promptly.</P>
    <P>As regards the collection of land annuities, I would ask the Land Commission to ease off.  I have some experience as regards annuities in my county, and need not say that the Land Commission have dealt with me very fairly every time I went in.  However, I would ask them to ease off in their demands, as I am weary going in to them every week for the last year.  The farmers really have not the money to pay.  I have some experience of the farmers of Westmeath for the last 22 years.  I know they are honestly willing to pay them, but they have been unfortunate enough to get into arrears.  I have made bargains for hundreds of them, and they are paying three and four half-years every year like men to get out of the difficulty.  I do not want to have my word broken, but I would ask the Land Commission at the same time to hold on for a little while and they will get the money&mdash;except in certain cases where it cannot be got, and in those cases there should be some attempt to try to fund the annuities. I know they cannot go on paying at the present rate.  An attempt should be made to have them funded for a year or two, and, if they cannot pay them, that could be taken off again. There are only 100 or so, but that big load is against them.</P>
    <P>I know that the farmers at the present time have not the wherewithal to buy everything.  I have had an experience recently which I will never forget. Yesterday there was a small farmer at my door with a civil bill from the Agricultural Credit Corporation for £20. He was at his wits' end.  He said that if he had paid £3 six months ago the credit corporation were willing to wait for the balance but he could not go to them then unless he brought them some money and he had not got it.  I asked him to bring £3 10s. and told him to come back on Tuesday morning. He came back yesterday with £2. He had had to run round his neighbours <Col N="2021" /> and sell suckling pigs to get the £2 and could not get the rest: he even took 15/- a head for the suckling pigs.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Land Commission at present are reducing their staff, but there is a branch where the staff should not be reduced&mdash;the sub-division branch.  There is a good deal of sub-division to be done.  People are selling bits of their land when in trouble and want to get out of it, and I hope the Land Commission will keep that branch fully staffed.  It is an important thing, where a man is in trouble with a big farm and sells a bit of it to get out of the trouble.  The sub-division should go through quickly, as there may be a bargain about it and, therefore, the sub-division branch should be kept going.</P>
    <P>I would like to put a query to the Minister regarding the payment for land taken over for division.  I believe the law is that they must give the market value but I would like a definition of the way in which they arrive at the market value.  It is a very hard question, but I would like the Minister to think it over and say how the market value is arrived at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty is to pay a tribute to the manner in which the Land Commission, in Cork County at any rate, dealt with wheat and tillage. There is no doubt they did their part well, with the result that, of the lands held by the Land Commission in the county, I would say 50 per cent. are tilled to-day.  I would like to pay that tribute here and now.  I would also like to support Deputy Moran's claim in regard to the resumption of estates. I cannot understand the policy under which the resumption of estates has been stopped, nor can I understand the idea behind it.  There was some allegation here last year that it would interfere with tillage.  I have been here something like ten or 12 years, every year with a litany of estates that have been taken over by the Land Commission. For instance, there is the Rostellan estate, which is still in their hands and quite recently some kind of scrap merchant was allowed into Rostellan and began to pull down the house there, and sold by public <Col N="2022" /> auction the doors and window frames which would have been very useful to the Land Commission if they intended to build houses on the estate, but it was pulled down.</P>
      <P>We have a worse picture still.  We have unfortunate people up on the hillsides with 15 and 20 acres of land trying to eke out a miserable existence and, in addition to paying the annuities and rates on their own holding, they have to pay the arrears of rates and annuities for Mr. Somebody whose only address is the United Services Club in London.  There is at present due to the Cork County Council by that estate £2,000 arrears of rates.  This is the fifth year in succession I have brought this up.  I am tired bringing it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of it.  We got a notification the other day that there were, I think, 14 or 15 or 20 sheep there dead with mange.  That came before the board of assistance of which Deputy Hickey is a member.  That is number one.  There is the Smith estate, number two, owing £750 in rates to the Cork County Council.  That has been mentioned here year after year.  There is the Foley-Turpin estate, number three, owing £850 in rates to the Cork County Council and anybody who will go down to the Foley-Turpin estate to-day&mdash;and this is the last day of April&mdash;will see the county council officials in there with tractors ploughing <Col N="2023" /> the land that the owner should plough.  That estate of 450 to 500 acres is lying there for the past 12 or 14 years in that condition and the Land Commission will still talk about not having enough land to go around.  Then you have the scandal perpetrated by the Land Commission on the Flower estate.</P>
      <P>Two commissioners some time ago held some kind of court to decide whether they would take it over or not. They took 40 acres of it over out of 400 odd acres.  No notification was given to the smallholders of the district that there was going to be any sitting of the Land Commission Court. I think in cases like that, where the Land Commission Court come down to go into the arguments for and against resumption of an estate, some notification should be given to the people of the district.  Instead of that, two land commissioners and the solicitor for the owner of the estate sat down happily together and decided to take 40 acres out of 400 odd acres.  Forty acres were immediately set by the Land Commission at £4 10s. an acre for tillage, and the following week we had the lovely picture in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of an auction by the same auctioneer of 389 acres of the fertile lands of Cloyne for 11 months grazing.  I do not know what arguments were used with the commissioners to prevent their taking it over, but I know that that land has been set for 11 months' grazing for the last 15 years, every year, and that if any notification was given that the commissioners were sitting on the case there certainly would have been evidence given of that.  The lady resides in England, and she is able to come along and set 389 acres of land for grazing on the 11 months' system, and able to do that year after year, whilst up on the hillsides there are families of nine and ten trying to eke out a miserable existence on 25 to 30 acres of land, men who in the past came out and did their part for their country when the Flowers were supporting the enemy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another estate&mdash;the Creagh-Barry estate&mdash;in the same position&mdash;large amounts of arrears of rates <Col N="2024" /> due on it&mdash;and no effort made by the Land Commission to take it over. There is something close on 3,000 acres of land there in the parish of Cloyne, between the Clarke estate, the Rostellan estate, the Smith estate, the Flower and the Foley-Turpin estates&mdash;roughly between 2,000 and 3,000 acres of land, all in that condition, lying there as a burden on the unfortunate farmers, who are trying to live and trying to pay their way.  The Department of State will sit down and smile and do nothing.  We are sick of it, and I can guarantee to the Minister and to the Department that it is the last time I will speak in this House of it.  If we cannot get things done by asking the Department we will get other means of doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <P>I did not switch so many Parties as Deputy McMenamin did in his time.  He gave a few switches around and turned his coat on a few occasions here already.  I suppose he will give a few more shifts before he is found out and thrown out.  But that is the position, and it is time it ended. I cannot see for the life of me what the Land Commission are doing. Surely, when land commissioners come down to an area to investigate cases with regard to resumption, some public notification should be given instead of having the scandal of two commissioners coming down there and sitting with the solicitor for the owner of the land, and deciding they are going to take 40 acres out of 400, thinking they have done their duty to give 40 acres to the natives, leaving 380 for the English grabbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the division of land, in my opinion, at any rate, sufficient land is not being given.  I went down and inspected Gibbstown and saw what had happened there when the migrants were brought in.  I do not believe that any migrant that has been brought in there can earn a livelihood on the amount of land he got.  The argument again may be that there is not enough land to go around.  Where is the use of creating a second problem?  Where <Col N="2025" /> is the use of creating a second congested area?  That is what they are doing.  There is no man, I do not care how thrifty or how careful he may be, who can rear a family to-day on 22 statute acres of land.  He cannot do it. There is no use in pretending he can. The result is that those lands will gradually go back and be taken over by the local ranchers again.  There is no use in blinding ourselves.  In County Mayo, where these £5 valuation holdings are, there might be some means of earning a livelihood, but I do not believe they are earning their livelihood out of the £5 valuation holding or out of the £10 valuation holding there.  I do not believe they are.  They must have other means of livelihood. They must earn money on fishing or working on the roads or something else.  The Department came and took a group of people and transferred them into a different county or a different area and what you actually have is the same problem right over again.  I do not know on what basis the Land Commission judge what is an economic holding to-day.  My own honest opinion, however, is that anything under 40 statute acres is an uneconomic holding, and no man and no family can make a livelihood out of it.  If you have a holding under that acreage it will only mean that people will have to travel out of it in order to get part-time employment to help them to pay the rates on their holdings.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the collection of annuities, my experience of the Land Commission is that they have always been decent and that, when they were asked for time in which to pay, they gave it, but I would certainly urge on the Minister and the Government that they should not press for payment at the present time.  Our farmers have gone through a very tough time this winter.  They had to buy seeds and manures at robber prices in order to sow, and they had to pay down cash for anything they bought.  They had to pay to the local merchants money that, in the ordinary course of events, would have gone to the Land Commission, and the result is that they have no money with which to pay their annuities. There is no use in pretending <Col N="2026" /> that they have; the fact is that they have not got the money.  I have spent practically the last three months rushing around between the county council and everywhere else, endeavouring to get seeds for the unfortunate farmers so as to enable them to grow wheat and the other stuff that they need, but I must say that those estates I mentioned are a very bad example, in any area, or any county, or any district, to the ordinary working farmer.</P>
    <P>When you go to a farmer who has 40 or 50 acres and who has his one-fifth, or even more, tilled, and say to him: &ldquo;We must ask you to plough three or four acres more so that the people of this country will not go hungry,&rdquo; can you blame him when he points across the ditch and says: &ldquo;It is bad enough for me to be doing all I can, paying my rates on my own land and my annuities, and having to carry on for other people when, across the ditch, you can see all that land untilled?&rdquo; Naturally, the farmer wants to know why that land is not being ploughed, and now, towards the end of April, you have old fields being brought under the plough that have not been tilled for 100 or 150 years, and you are hoping that you will get a crop out of it, but there cannot be a crop got out of it, this year at any rate.</P>
    <P>You have these estates, to which I have referred, remaining there idle. You have some of this land now being let for grazing, and unless something is done, the Land Commission will have to get out.  Let them go to work or get out.  In God's name, let them do one thing or the other.  I, at least, am sick of this matter.  I can go back to 1927&mdash;the first year in which I came here to this Dáil&mdash;and I can produce the Dáil Debates for the Land Commission Department for every year since that time, and any Deputy, reading those debates, will realise how little has been done ever since.  We are getting tired of it, and the people are getting tired of it.  The people are getting tired of waiting there with the burden on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>What justification is there for the Land Commission to come along and <Col N="2027" /> do what they have done in a case such as that of the Rostellan estate.  I understand that there is a dispute there between the Forestry branch and the Land Commission branch of the Department, and that has been going on for the past ten years.  I believe that the dispute is concerned with how much each of them will take, but while that argument is going on the gentleman in London is quietly drawing his rents upon that land and there are £2,000 of rates to be paid by the people there, in addition to his own. There is no justification for that.  I should like the Minister to deal with these matters when he is replying this evening and let us know why these estates are not being taken over.  Let him tell us why the Foley-Turpin estate is not taken over, and why you have the county council surveyor and his officials down there with three tractors trying to plough the land and get a crop from it because the old lady concerned will not pay her own rates or till the land.  She is monarch of all she surveys and, apparently, the Land Commission are willing to cloak the matter.  I should also like the Minister to tell us the position in regard to the Flower estate.  Will he tell us why his commissioners went down there and, without notification given to anybody, except the solicitors for the owner, held some kind of court there, with the result that they took 40 acres out of about 400 acres?  No notification was given to the smallholders of the district there, and the result is that 389 acres of that fertile land are being at present set for grazing on the eleven-months' system, as it has been set for the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister does not think that the people of this country are blind?  The people see these things happen.  That auction was held, and you had 389 acres set for grazing on the eleven months system, and 40 acres set by the Land Commission at £4 10s. an acre, for tillage.  The people down there, who were looking for tillage, had paid £4 10s. an acre for 40 acres in order to till it, but there you had 389 acres let for the use of the bullock.</P>

If that land had been let out for tillage it would have meant that this nation would have had 400 acres more of wheat, which would mean a lot in our present circumstances. There is no use in going to Jack or Harry and asking him to grow an extra acre of wheat when he can point across the ditch and show these hundreds of acres going untilled, particularly when he feels that these things are being winked at by Government Departments.  I shall be told that one-fifth of the land was tilled. Yes, one-fifth was let out for tillage, but the other 389 acres were let for grazing.</P>

The Minister may wake up some morning to find that the Minister for Justice is rushing down Civic Guards and troops to prevent people from ploughing for themselves lands that the Land Commission will not take over, and if the Land Commission will not take these lands over and plough them, we will take them over and plough them. They can be definite about that.  I think that is all I have to say, but I should like the Minister to go into this matter finally, because I am tired of bringing it up year after year.</P>

      <P>I intend to challenge a vote on this Estimate for two main reasons: the first, on account of the attempt that has been made here to-day, by certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party, to evade the responsibility for the results that have arisen from that Party's policy and to shift it on to the shoulders of the officials of the Land Commission; and, secondly, on the ground that the policy of that Party has brought about the general conditions that have been presented <Col N="2029" /> to the House here this evening. Two main questions have been discussed here to-day.  One was the question of the acquisition and division of land, and the second was in regard to the present position of agriculture and its power to pay land annuities. Deputies who have been in this House for a number of years will recall the struggle I have been making to draw their attention to, and recall their sense of duty in connection with the circumstances accumulating in this Department which, ultimately, would lead to disaster.</P>
      <P>Now, when the emergency comes on us, the whole show comes tumbling down.  These gentlemen, who brought about the conditions disclosed this evening, turn to push the baby, not on themselves, but on the officials of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Last week I got two answers from the Minister's Department which show the general mentality of the Party.  In one question, I asked the amount of arrears of annuities outstanding on the 31st January, 1941, and the answer I received was £192,418.  In a second question, I asked the Minister the number of <i>nulla bona</i> returns held by the Land Commission on the same date and the answer was 3,108.  I want Deputies to keep these two figures before them, particularly the second. I did not see it myself, but it appears that the <i>Independent</i>, that villainous newspaper, wrote some editorial paragraph commenting on the amount of the arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, instead of taking a sheet of notepaper in the offices of the Land Commission to write to the <i>Independent</i>, then went across from the Land Commission offices to Government Buildings to see whoever was there in charge of the Government Information Bureau, and to get him to tell the <i>Irish Independent</i> that it was inaccurate in its comments. Observe that the Minister goes across from the Land Commission offices to the Government Information Bureau. There is somebody there, whoever he is, in charge of that Department&mdash;a prevaricating machine, I would call it. My question did not deal with the financial year.  The question asked was what was the total amount of <Col N="2030" /> arrears of annuities outstanding on the 31st January this year.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has visited Limerick, Castlebar, and Tullamore on three successive week-ends to tell the farmers of the country of the dangers that are going to follow if they do not till the land and sow crops, and that, in the last analysis, the land may be taken from them.  I wonder had he these figures before him?  Had he a consultation with the Minister for Lands, or did he know that there were 3,108 farms in this State of 26 counties on which there was not a four-footed beast that a sheriff could seize?  To get this matter into its proper perspective, I want the House to appreciate that these are arrears that have accrued since this House halved the land annuities and passed an Act in 1933, which was to emancipate the farmers of Ireland.  What was the position before that date?  This Government came into office about January, 1932.  Of course, the farming community was in a shocking condition as a result of the misgovernment of its predecessors.  Remember that under the previous Government the farmers were paying a 100 per cent. annuity, calculated on the basis of what a particular holding could pay, allowing for all rents and rates and the maintenance of a family.</P>

According to these reports, there was outstanding on the 31st March, 1931, a sum of £416,126, of the total full annuities, and on the last day of the accounting year&mdash;the accounting year of the Land Commission closes in July&mdash;the amount outstanding on the full annuities, that is, 100 per cent. more than the amount payable to-day, was only £299,446.

I wonder would the Minister take that bulletin now and reissue it to the farmers of this country?  There was no use in telling the Minister or that Party even in 1933, when they were halving the land annuities, that they should not take the collection away from the hands of the State Solicitor. They were, of course, a pack of legal crooks.  They could not be trusted with the collection of the land annuities.</P>

      <P>What I certainly disliked about this debate to-night was the attempt made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party to throw their own responsibility for the results of their policy on to the officials of the Land Commission.  Let them have the moral courage to accept their responsibility.  There are two main things with regard to the policy of this Department; one is the division of land and how it was done.  Was the policy pursued&mdash;the policy of giving approximately 20 acres of land&mdash;a wise one or a foolish one?  Year after year I have spoken about that.  I should say that the immediate future will put that to the acid test.  I was interested to hear Deputy Corry condemning farms of that size.  I should have been much more pleased if, in the ranks of his Party and at his Party meetings, he had pointed that out, and pointed it out every year in the Dáil.</P>

What is one to say, in face of that, about the speeches by the Taoiseach which we have heard for the last three weeks?  There is not a word from the Taoiseach as to the solution of this problem of putting those farms into production.  Year after year I pointed out what was going to be the result of that; I have pointed out that the increasing burden will push more men out year after year, and the margin will grow less.  Now we have the result of it.  Men are being prosecuted, and they have no means. When the Taoiseach goes down the country, why does he not say: &ldquo;Yes, there are 3,108 farms in this country derelict because we cannot collect the Land Commission annuities, but I am going to put them into production. Here is machinery whereby I am going to put them under the plough.&rdquo;  There is not a word about those 3,108 farms. Is the House to assume that this year each one of those farms is lying derelict, and that the plough has not been put on them?  I should like to have an explanation from the Minister as to that, because if the Taoiseach goes around the country insisting on other people doing their duty this House should insist that the Government itself should do its duty.</P>

      <P>I thought perhaps crops were grown elsewhere than on land.  This whole Department is in a sorry mess.  Deputies have got up here <Col N="2035" /> and told us about the position that farmers are in as a result of the foot-and-mouth disease, and Deputy Corry has referred to other cases of men who had to pay cash for seeds.  It is not to-day that this House should wail about that.  There is an old Irish saying: &ldquo;Ní hé lá na gaoithe, lá na scolb&rdquo;, the windy day is not the day for the thatcher.  Assuming that the position in the Department is going to be as suggested by Deputies here to-night, where is it going to lead? Deputies who think they are discharging their duties to this country have come in and told us about the position in their particular constituencies, and have suggested that the Land Commission should not operate (1) as to the division of land, and (2) as to the collection of land annuities.  Do they realise what they are saying?  Do they not know that that sum of money will be taken by the Land Commission from the Guarantee Fund, and will be collected in the form of rates from persons who have paid their land annuities and paid the rates and land annuities on those 3,108 farms?  That is what I have been trying to tell this House for the last three or four years since I saw this thing developing.  You are placing this whole burden on the solvent farmers and on the farmers bordering on insolvency.  Those people have been cut down each year, until ultimately you place the whole burden on a restricted number and pull them all down.  What is this House going to do about it?  Have they any sense of responsibility towards the country, or any realisation of the trust undertaken by them?  I suppose they will wash their hands of responsibility and exonerate themselves by saying: &ldquo;Oh, but the war came.&rdquo;  Does not everybody know that the economic position of the State, just like that of a family, should be watched and nursed on the fair and sunny day to make provision for the rainy day?  Had we done that, this position would not exist.  The House has got to remember that the farmers who are paying their own annuities and rates have to pay this additional sum in rates on top of that. Can they be asked to do it?  Then, as well as all that, comes the calamity <Col N="2036" /> of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, leaving them without a fair or market, and unable to drive a cow across the road.  I must say that the Government and the Party behind them have a lot to answer for.  Of course, they are a small thing; they are merely the clouds that pass in the night.  The people who remain are the victims, and I pity them.  It is useless to waste my breath by way of argument, and I will challenge a division on this Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the position that exists in relation to the allocation and division of turbary.  As the Minister is aware, under previous land purchase agreements turbary was allocated to tenants, but the boundaries were never defined and, whilst we all appreciate the action the Land Commission have taken in co-operation with parish councils and other local authorities with regard to the allocation of this turbary, I suggest that the Land Commission should put a special staff on the work.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could see his way to appoint a man in the principal turf-producing counties and leave him specially on that work?  He could point out to the tenants whose interests are involved, their particular plots and then they could immediately go into turf production and avail of the good weather.  They would be in a position to produce their quota in the great turf development drive that is in progress.  It is not very much to the credit of the Land Commission that they have left these turbary areas for years without properly distributing them.  I have on several occasions drawn the attention of the Land Commission to the matter.  I appreciate all they have done in trying to get turbary areas allocated, but there are several estates in South Kerry on which there are large tracts of turbary still undivided.  Something should be done quickly in connection with these turbary areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people I represent in South Kerry are sorely disappointed with the allocation of moneys from Land Commission <Col N="2037" /> funds, moneys voted by this House.  I have taken certain figures from official estimates, going back over the years from 1934-35 to 1938-39. I was especially interested in the amounts allocated to the Counties Kerry, Mayo and Galway.  I mention those three counties because they are somewhat analogous in so far as valuation and population are concerned. The total amount allocated to County Mayo for estate improvement work&mdash; which is the type of work that would apply particularly to Kerry&mdash;during the period from 1934-35 to 1938-39 was £519,775.  During the same period the amount allocated to Galway was £337,657.  The amount allocated to Kerry in the same period and for the same work was £59,908.  That is certainly drastic treatment, unfair treatment, for the areas that I represent. I have mentioned the matter to the Land Commission, and I have been informed that there was no land to be divided in Kerry and, hence, the small amount allocated.  Here I am selecting a particular type of work, the improvement of estates, that applies equally to the three counties.  I have in mind the division of bogs, the repairing of embankments and rearrangement work generally.  I suggest that in Kerry we have got a very raw deal from the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, and I am trying to relate those figures to the present Estimate, because the same thing applies all the time.  There is no improvement work of any consequence being carried out in Kerry.  We are prepared to give every credit to Land Commission officials.  They have assisted us and been reasonable in regard to the collection of annuities. They have tried to co-operate with us. The whole trouble is that the people here in Dublin have not adjusted their policy to fit in with the requirements of areas such as South Kerry.  We are making a very reasonable claim.  We have estates there that need to be improved, and it seems that in that respect <Col N="2038" /> we are forgotten.  I should like the Minister to give particular attention to that matter, and also to the desirability of appointing a special staff for the purpose of allocating turbary areas to tenants who were informed years ago that they have the turbary, and who now want their divisions defined so that they can enter into immediate production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion of this Estimate is, and I suppose from the nature of things, must be, one of the most unsatisfying discussions that could take place on any Estimate because, as I pointed out on previous occasions, the main work done by the Land Commission is work for which the Minister is not personally responsible.  Questions about land to be taken up, and about allottees are ones upon which the Minister has got no say, while on the policy on which the Land Commission is to work the Minister again has no say.  The result is that Land Commission decisions on cases before them have no reference at all to the policy which is laid down by the Minister in this House.  There may be a very considerable difference of opinion, especially on the question of land acquisition.  It is quite easy for opinions to differ.  The Minister has put forward the view that the Land Commission should not take up land which has been properly farmed by the owner.  That has been the theme of his speeches.  He was very strong on that last year: that land being properly farmed is not being taken up. But land being properly dealt with is being taken up by the Land Commission every day.  It may be that there are different views on that.  It may be that the policy which the Land Commission is putting into force is the sounder policy, at any rate from the point of view of my constituency.  I think the policy the Land Commission is putting into force is the sounder policy, but it is very unpleasant, and very bad for the respect in which this House should be held, that the Minister should lay down a policy here which is quite divergent from the policy which the persons who have control of the administration of the Act are carrying out.  It would be <Col N="2039" /> much fairer to the House and to the country if the Minister asked the Land Commissioners what their policy was, so that he could tell the House what the policy was, rather than going off on a little expedition of his own, saying what the policy ought to be, and leaving the public to consider that that policy was being put into force when, as a matter of fact, no attention was being paid at all in the administration of the Act to speeches made by the Minister in this House, whether in introducing or in administering Land Acts.  For that reason I have certainly come to the conclusion that this is a very unsatisfying Estimate to discuss here.</P>
      <P>There are things, of course, which come within the Minister's personal purview.  One of them was the matter to which Deputy Flynn referred.  I can come to the Minister's assistance there if he wishes, because it appeared to me that Deputy Flynn did not know what he was talking about.  He was misled by a term which is of a rather technical character.  The Deputy stated that during one period Mayo had received between £400,000 and £500,000 for estate improvements, while Kerry had received only £59,000.  The Deputy did not seem to know what comes under the term &ldquo;estate improvements&rdquo;. He said it was no answer to him to say that more land was broken up in Mayo than in Kerry, if estate improvements meant making drains and dividing bogs.  As a matter of fact when farms are taken over new roads have to be made, fences have to be erected, large fields have to be divided, and then comes the building of new houses.  It would appear to me that money spent on estate improvements must vary with the amount of land acquired in any particular county in a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was very interesting to hear Deputy Corry, whose speeches lately are becoming rather humorous.  They are full of sound and fury, but, of course, signify nothing.  It would appear as if Deputy Corry is no longer going to be a good, law-abiding citizen. There was a threat that the Deputy was tired of the Land Commission and <Col N="2040" /> tired of the law, and that if the Department of Justice sent down police and military to his neighbourhood the farmers there would teach them something.  That is very fine and it sounds beautiful, but it will be interesting to see if the Deputy takes up the challenge thrown out by Deputy McMenamin.  It will be interesting to see how Deputy Corry will vote.  One would imagine that it would be much more becoming for a Deputy, instead of daring the law, to go into the Division Lobby against the Minister and a Department which he thinks is faulty.  But it is much easier to make a speech than to vote.  It requires no courage to make a speech which will be reported, but it requires moral courage to give a vote against a Party of which the Deputy is a member, because he thinks its policy is bad. But it is his duty to do so if he thinks the Department is as bad as he said it was.  I wonder very much if Deputy Corry will not show the white feather and be one of those persons who generally meekly do not require any military or police to propel their steps into the Government Lobby.  I venture to think that the Deputy will do that.</P>
    <P>Unless one deals with particular cases the policy of the Department has not varied from year to year, and unless the cases happen to be daring ones I have come to the conclusion that it would be wasting public time to bring up particular cases.  They are better dealt with by communication with the Department.  As in previous years I should like to endeavour to get the Land Commission to deal quickly and expeditiously with correspondence. It is very trying when somebody comes along and you write a letter about some question to get an acknowledgment and to hear no more about it. That, I think, is the experience of every Deputy.  If a letter is written to the Department of Local Government, while some time may elapse, about which I do not complain, a reply is always received.  After the end of the tenth letter possibly some reply may be received from the Land Commission, but it very often happens that there is no answer at all.  I wish that something could be done to remedy that state of affairs.  Even if one official of <Col N="2041" /> the Land Commission had to deal entirely with correspondence letters could be answered.  It is not every letter requires a correct ruling.  Sometimes a letter is received saying that the Land Commission have considered a certain matter and made a ruling. That might be sent to the persons who correspond with the Land Commission, but the Land Commission and the Department of Education both seem to have souls above answering letters.  I must say that it is only <i>ex-relatione</i> that I can speak about the Department of Education, but it is not quite the same with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter which the Minister and the Land Commission might consider.  There is, in a great number of country towns at present, a tremendous shortage of fairly good-class houses, and there are a great number of Land Commission officials who cannot get reasonably good living accommodation in the towns in which they are stationed, and I think it is very hard to expect a man to do his work thoroughly unless he has a reasonably comfortable home to which he can go.  It would be by no means a bad expenditure of Government money if the Land Commission approached the Board of Works, and got them to build houses for Land Commission officials in such areas as those in which the Land Commission officials cannot get houses.  Rents would be paid for these houses, and there must be from 20 to 30 per cent. profit made, in the part of the country I know best, at any rate, on the money spent on building.  A house costing £1,000 would, I think, very nearly rent at £100 a year in some country towns, such is the terrible shortage of reasonably good accommodation.  I do not expect an immediate answer, but the Land Commission might consider it, and approach the Board of Works with a view to seeing that not only would their officials be properly housed, but also that the Government would make quite a good financial bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Giles, about a fortnight ago had a number of questions on the Order Paper with reference to divided estates, in which he drew the attention of the <Col N="2042" /> Minister to the fact that a number of people sold back to the original owners of the land, and, side by side with that series of questions, he had another set asking when certain estates would be vested in the people who got the land. The practice of the last 20 years, not in every case, but in a good many cases, has been that, immediately vesting takes place, the new owner sells back the farm to the person who originally owned it, or to someone else.  Last year, I was down in Connemara, and I talked to some of the people whose relatives were migrated to Meath. They said that they expected them back after seven years, when the land would be vested in them, and when they would have power to sell and cash in.  For a long time, I have advocated the postponement of the vesting of land in the new occupier for 20 years. I realised that, in respect of cottagers. 50 years in cottages, it was like waving a red flag to offer them the right to own the cottages.  Here you are giving a substantial piece of the soil of the country, and building houses, with out-offices, into which some of them never go, and handing £1,000 or £1,200 worth of property at the very least to a person to cash in after seven years.  Since this State was founded, nearly 20 years ago, that has occurred all over the midlands, and, I am sure, in other counties, and the policy of breaking up the land into peasant proprietorship negatived. I ask the Minister seriously to consider the postponement of vesting for a period of 20 years, so that his policy may bear fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accede to that request. May I suggest to Deputy Kennedy that if the state of affairs is as he states, the cure is not to penalise all the other farmers by withholding vesting for 20 or 30 years.  It seems to be quite obvious, if the statement made by Deputy Kennedy is true, that no discrimination whatever was used in the selection of the people to whom the land was given. That seems to be the obvious answer. If, when those estates the Deputy has in mind were being divided, the land was given to the proper people, they would not be the type to sell the farms back immediately they were vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> I do not know what the conditions in the midlands are, but I should not like the House or the Minister to understand that the picture which Deputy Kennedy has painted represents the state of affairs over the rest of the country.  Speaking for my own county, I know that it is a rare thing, so rare that I do not know that I have ever heard of even one case of a man waiting only for the vesting order immediately to sell back to the person who originally owned the land, or, for that matter, to anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, the fact that we have individual cases, a small minority, I should think, of the total number of those who received allotments from the Land Commission which have been unsatisfactory should not be used as an argument for postponing vesting.  Unfortunately, although vesting is a process to which the tenant purchaser is legally entitled, and I think the Land Commission is bound to make every possible effort to vest a holding in a tenant at the earliest opportunity, the process has been a very slow one indeed, and in view of the circumstances which have arisen owing to the war, it is one of those branches of the work of the Land Commission in which we must expect even greater delay.  The question arises as to whether even though tenants are being deprived of a legal title to their holding, if you wish, they are going to be in any worse position than they have been in for some time past, and whether, if we were to maintain staff on that particular work of vesting, we should be doing it to the disadvantage of other important work which the Government thinks as bound to receive their most urgent and anxious consideration in the present emergency.  I should like, therefore, to call again the attention of Deputies to the fact that the staff of the Land Commission has been considerably reduced as a result of transfers to other Departments on emergency work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moran asks why the Land Commission have decided not to resume any land during the emergency. Deputy Corry asks why we are not proceeding with the taking over and <Col N="2044" /> division of a certain number of estates in his constituency, and I am sure that every Deputy who represents a rural constituency could, if he had so wished, have made the kind of speech we were accustomed to in normal times, asking that the Land Commission should give special attention to urgent cases of land division and other matters coming within the province of the Department of Lands in his constituency.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that most of the Deputies have had a realisation of the fact that, in the present emergency situation, we cannot expect these things, and I am thankful to them for not having asked us to do them&mdash;with the couple of exceptions I have mentioned. My reply to Deputy Moran and Deputy Corry is that, weighing up one need against another in this matter of staff, some needs being of compelling urgency, the Government have come to the decision that available staff and available funds must be applied, as far as possible, to the emergency services on which the safety and, perhaps, the very existence of the State may depend.  I explained, soon after I took charge of the Department of Lands at the beginning of the war, that the Government had then made a decision not to start any new proceedings but to confine ourselves to commitments already entered upon and, as far as possible, to confine our work to cases of urgency where severe congestion was in question, or where there was turbary, or the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes.  Since that time, it is true we have been given somewhat more discretion in dealing with new cases because we do not want to arrive at a position at which we would reach a complete full stop.</P>
    <P>When the war commenced, we had very heavy commitments in regard to improvements of estates and, as Deputies will see from the relevant subhead in the Estimate, very ample provision is being made this year in that regard.  Even if the total amount of money is expended, it will not exhaust all our commitments.  Unfortunately, there are difficulties in the way.  There are difficulties in procuring housing materials and our inspectors have difficulty in getting around the country. <Col N="2045" /> They are given only a very limited quantity of petrol&mdash;not sufficient to enable them to cover anything like the normal duties we should expect them to fulfil.  We have, then, the difficulty of staff.  The position at the moment is that 252 members of the Land Commission staff are on loan for emergency service to other Departments.  Taking account of those with the Army, absent on sick leave and vacancies left unfilled&mdash;because vacancies are not being filled, as a rule, during the emergency period&mdash;the staff shortage to-day represents 312.  A great many of these officers come from branches in which Deputies are keenly interested&mdash;the branch dealing with acquisition and resale and the purchase section, where the vesting of land in the tenants is carried on.</P>
    <P>These are two sections of the Land Commission which have lost staff, and I am still being pressed by the Government to provide additional staff because, as Deputies know, the war is entering a very critical phase at the present time and there are emergency services to which we feel far more attention will have to be given than has been given up to the present, and for which large staffs will have to be provided. The Land Commission, as one of the largest Departments from the point of view of personnel, is regarded as a reservoir.  We cannot have it both ways.  If the Land Commission is to be asked to give up a very substantial part of its staff, the great majority of the members being drawn from branches of the Land Commission in which the Dáil is specially interested, naturally, we cannot have the work done that Deputies would like to have done.  I think that Deputies understand that position.  Even if the Government were inclined to the view that everything not absolutely essential should be closed down, owing to the condition of emergency, certain branches, such as that dealing with accountancy and the collection of the purchase annuities, would have to be kept in operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the House that, in future, the Land Commission, even at best, will not be able to do more than a bare minimum of the more <Col N="2046" /> important classes of work, though every effort will be made to maintain the more essential operations.  It is hoped to continue, on a reduced scale, the acquisition and division of untenanted land urgently needed for turbary requirements and for the relief of acute congestion, and to deal with matters that cannot be put aside, such as the sub-division of holdings, supplementary advances for housing, regulations for the use of turbary, objections to the standard purchase annuities, maintenance of embankments and such matters incidental to the upkeep of tenanted land vested in the Land Commission, but operations such as the vesting of holdings in tenants and parcels of untenanted land in allottees, which would normally proceed towards the completion of land purchase must be largely suspended and fresh commitments curtailed.  It is quite possible, as I have indicated, that we may have to reduce further those operations which we ourselves consider to be essential.  Deputies and the public can help materially in reducing the strain on the attenuated staff of the Land Commission by confining their correspondence with this Department to matters of urgent necessity, and refraining from appeals to investigate fresh cases and applications to undertake fresh commitments.</P>

      <P>In cases where the tenant purchasers are not suffering by having the matter deferred until the end of the emergency period, I would ask Deputies not to press their claims. <Col N="2047" /> Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney speaks as if correspondence with the Land Commission were on a par with correspondence with other Departments.  I should like to point out that it is quite easy, if one writes to the Local Government Department about an old age pension case, to get an answer.  Either the applicant is entitled, or he is not entitled, to an old age pension.  Similarly, in the case of unemployment assistance.  But an inquiry with regard to Land Commission affairs very often involves some legal question.  If it does not involve a legal question, it demands an amount of consideration which, at least, involves a visit by an inspector to the place.  For example, in the cases of sub-division which we are very anxious should still be attended to, a report from the inspector is asked for in every case.  The same is true of a number of other matters.  I would ask Deputies not to press cases, or even write in about them, unless they consider they are really essential.  What I mean by that is that they are of such a type that, if they were not attended to, much greater loss to the State and the community would result.  The only illustration I can give at the moment is that one of flooding.  Besides the Land Commission is trying to do the work which Deputies are mainly interested in, namely, dividing land and so on, and every time we take away our inspectors, particularly in the difficult circumstances they have to contend with at present, from their normal work to make a special report to us on queries sent in by Deputies, it means a loss.  I hope Deputies will realise that, even if they get full information in regard to the queries, it is at the cost of taking important, highly-paid and highly-skilled officers away from their normal work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the question of the collection of annuities.  I agree with him that this is a very hard time for farmers who cannot cash their store cattle and there has been no undue activity on our part.  We realise that it would be very serious indeed if we were to proceed to take stringent action for the collection of annuities in <Col N="2048" /> the present very difficult circumstances with which the farming community are faced.  We are giving very sympathetic consideration to cases that come under our notice, and no undue pressure of any kind, I can assure the House, is being used.  If notices for sale have been issued, I suggest to Deputies&mdash;and no Deputy has mentioned a specific case, I think, which came under his personal observation&mdash; it is only in chronic cases where the annuitant has been in default for a period of years.  I hope that the relaxation of the restrictions and an improvement in the situation in the near future will enable farmers to carry on their very important work on a normal basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin raised again the question of the arrears of annuities.  I do not know whether he was trying to make the point that we were worse off. As a matter of fact, comparing the figure which I gave him of the arrears on 31st January, 1941, £1,092,418 being the total amount outstanding on that date, with the figure at 31st January, 1937, £1,318,404, it indicates roughly an improvement of £226,000 since 31st January, 1937.  The very latest figures I have indicate that the total amount of land purchase annuities collectible for 15 gales from 1st November, 1933, to 1st December, 1940, inclusive, was £17,400,464, of which the approximate amount collected to 31st March, 1941, was £16,503,370, leaving a deficit of £897,094, which represents a reduction in the deficit since 31st March last year of £54,224.  As I think I explained in a recent statement, the total amount of arrears outstanding is less than 6 per cent. of the amount collectible.  The Deputy mentioned that there are a number of <i>nulla bona</i> returns amounting to 3,108.  As compared with the figures for the same date in 1940, there is a reduction of 1,862 in the number of <i>nulla bona</i> returns, representing a very substantial reduction, I would say considerably more than one-third, possibly nearer to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan raised a point which has been raised by Deputy Linehan, who seemed to have some difficulty in regard to what was done in the 1933 <Col N="2049" /> Land Act by way of revising the annuities payable out of purchased land.  I have read the <i>verbatim</i> report of his remarks on the day I moved this Vote.  I must confess that although I read it several times I still cannot quite see where his trouble arises.  He seems to accept the interpretation of the law which I gave him in a personal letter last year, but he says that the Land Commission in practice are working on a different interpretation from that which I gave; at least that is what I gathered from his remarks which are not as clear as one would expect from a lawyer.</P>
    <P>What I said in my letter to him after the Estimates debate last year was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have had under enquiry the points of law mentioned by you in Dáil Eireann on the 16th ult. in the course of the debate on the Vote for the Department of Lands.  The normal period of repayment of an advance made to a tenant purchaser under the Land Purchase Acts has not been extended by the Land Act, 1933, or subsequent Acts.  Section 12 of the Land Act, 1933, simply provides for the reduction in the instalment of the annuity and makes no change in any of the conditions attached to the annuity prior to the passing of that Act.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 27, Land Act, 1933, makes the matter quite clear; it authorises payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to meet deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the revision of annuities.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to your enquiry as to whether there is in law a reduction in the amount of the outstanding advance corresponding to the reduction in the amount of the half-yearly instalment, I would refer you to Section 22 of the Land Act, 1933.  I understand that the form of certificate issued by the Land Commission for revenue purposes shows that the capital liability at any particular date has been calculated by reference to the provisions of this Section 22.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You are correct in stating that the Land Act, 1933, made no provision <Col N="2050" /> for altering the amount of the original advance appearing on the Land Certificate.  Section 20 of the Act, however, provides for the issue of a certificate of the revised annuity to the Registrar of Titles for the purpose of making an appropriate entry in the Land Registry folio.  The chain of evidence thus appears to be complete, as ordinarily the land certificate should be read in conjunction with the entries in the folio.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thought that that letter would have resolved his doubts, but this year he returns to the charge and, so far as I can make out, the points which he raised are two in number: (1) That since the settlement of the &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; annuities which were payable under the Acts prior to 1933 are payable by the tenant purchasers concerned only to the extent of the fraction represented by £10,000,000 as compared with the total amount of the advances outstanding at the date of settlement; (2) That he is not yet satisfied that the debt due by tenant purchasers to the Land Commission, or to the State, has been really halved by the Land Act of 1933.  He admits that the legal provisions of that Act in this regard were fully explained in my letter to him last year, but seems to doubt that the letter correctly interprets the statutes, or, if it does, that the attitude of the official Land Commission is the same as the interpretation which I placed upon it.</P>
    <P>In support of this second doubt of his he mentions the figure of the redemption value of the outstanding advance in a particular case as at a date prior to the passing of the Land Act, 1933, and the figure given to him by the Land Commission in the same case eight years later.  The latter figure is much larger, and, therefore, he says, the Land Commission are not in practice working to the formula in the Minister's letter.</P>
    <P>Now, as to the first point, this was settled by the Oireachtas in the Land Act of 1933, Section 12 (3), of which says that, as regards annuities payable under the Acts prior to 1923:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the amount payable by the purchaser in respect of any instalment <Col N="2051" /> accruing after the first gale day in the year 1933 of any purchase annuity to which the section applies shall be 50 per cent. and no more of the full amount of such instalment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And sub-section (5) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section applies to every purchase annuity subsisting at the passing of this Act....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy may have his own views as to what ought to be the position of tenant purchasers as the result of the settlement of the economic war, but the matter is already the subject of express legislation and we cannot, I feel, pursue it further on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>With regard to his second point, there is no foundation whatever for Deputy Linehan's doubts as regards the halving of the liabilities of tenant purchasers, the principle of which can be readily reconciled with the particular case given by him.  He need only study Section 22 of the Land Act of 1933 which provides, as I have already mentioned in my letter to him, that the manner and matter of redemption of a land purchase annuity shall be the same in all respects after the passing of the Act as it was before, save that the sum payable shall be reduced by 50 per cent. in the case of an annuity payable under the pre-1923 Acts.  Now, the Deputy appears to think that there is a catch somewhere in this, and that, though the instalments have been halved, the normal period of repayment will be extended, and that consequently the so-called halving is a myth.  By way of proof the Deputy mentioned that at the present day a tenant's folio in the land registry will show the amount of the advance made at the date of purchase, and that the figure has not been halved or varied in any way whatever.  The Deputy is correct so far, but he has failed to observe that there are two other items entered on the folio, viz., the original land purchase annuity, and the revised annuity which latter is shown as a charge on the lands.  The original advance is a historic figure which remains on the folio as a record of the sum which was actually <Col N="2052" /> advanced for the purchase of the holding. The Oireachtas did not say that this amount was to be crossed out and replaced by half that amount.  The Oireachtas reached the result that the Deputy desires by providing, in Section 20 (d) of the Act, that the halved annuity as certified by the Land Commission is to be recorded on the folio, and Section 22 of the 1933 Act says that the halved annuity can be made to disappear from the folio by the payment in cash by the tenant of half the redemption value calculated in the same manner as before.  The chain of evidence is thus complete.</P>
    <P>Then the Deputy took a particular case and stated that at a date immediately preceding the passing of the 1933 Act the redemption value of an outstanding advance of £131 was given as an advance of £113, while on a date eight years later&mdash;notwithstanding the sinking fund in the annuity payments and the halving of the annuities&mdash;the outstanding advance was certified by the Land Commission to be the figure of £62, a much larger sum than the half of £113.</P>
    <P>Such a case is quite possible and can be explained, even leaving out of consideration any question of a funding annuity or later arrears being included, by reason of the fact that the price of stock had increased as between the first and the latter dates.  If the price of stock had fallen it would have taken a lesser amount to redeem the outstanding amount.  The Deputy and his tenant purchaser, therefore, cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brodrick referred to the expenditure on the improvement of estates.  The expenditure goes up or down mainly in accordance with the amount of land acquisition and division that has been done.  During the present emergency it is not possible for us to maintain the division output of recent years, but we shall continue to give all the employment possible on the lands which we may be able to acquire and divide.  I would like to explain that last year, while the Vote for improvements was £560,000, we spent £438,000.  We were held up by the difficulties that I have referred to.  We still have a very large amount of <Col N="2053" /> sanctions which the Land Commission will do its best to have carried into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked whether the Land Commission was complying with the Tillage Order.  I have got reports in all cases where we have arable lands in hands, and I find that we have got 37½ per cent. of these lands tilled.  Conacre lettings were made by auction in practically every case.  I am not able to give particulars of the average price paid further than to say that a common rent was something like 40/- or 45/- an Irish acre, and, where it was possible to do so, the lands were let in time to have wheat sown.</P>
    <P>With regard to turf development, the position so far as the Land Commission is concerned is that its responsibility in this respect is confined to the development of bogs which it has acquired, or is in process of acquiring for local division.  The process of bog development is tedious and expensive, involving, frequently, the making of approach roads, culverts and drains, and the apportionment of suitable turbary plots to allottees often involves special difficulties.  The Land Commission is doing its best with its present curtailed resources to develop and divide the bogs in its possession which are suitable for the early winning of turf, but I would like to say that any of its activities must only represent a small fraction of the effort now necessary to provide sufficient turf.</P>
    <P>The development works which would be necessary, by way of drainage, in order to prepare the bogs for the winning of turf would take a year, or perhaps two years.  As the House knows, the main task has been entrusted by the Government to the local authorities, whereby such bodies can arrange locally for the exploitation of turf banks.  The Land Commission is, however, ready and willing to facilitate these authorities in every possible manner, should they desire to exploit any bogs on Land Commission lands.  We have already sent lists of such bogs, which we consider suitable for exploitation, to the Turf Development Board.  Our inspectors and officials are being instructed to give all <Col N="2054" /> the assistance possible to the local authorities.  One of our senior inspectors has been given the duty of seeing that every co-operation possible is given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes raised the question of local persons not getting consideration in the matter of the division of estates.  I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension in the matter. Local persons, coming within the categories set down, get every consideration, if they are ex-employees, or uneconomic holders or evicted tenants or representatives of such.  With regard to single men, they are not altogether debarred from getting land, but there is not enough land available to enable congests from the congested districts to get a portion.  When a local estate is being divided, the men who come first are the employees.  In special cases suitable single men may be allotted a holding.  If so they must get married and live in their new houses within a reasonable period.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a Select Committee consisting of five Deputies to be nominated by the Committee of Selection and with power to send for persons, papers and documents, be appointed to investigate publicly and report to the Dáil on the wholesale and retail prices charged for coal in the County Lorough of Dublin, and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and to make recommendations:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House, in the name of Deputy Mulcahy, proposes to set up a Committee of the Dáil with power to send for persons, papers and documents to investigate publicly the prices charged for coal in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.  I have already informed the Dáil that I am willing to facilitate a <i>bona fide</i> investigation by members of the House into the prices charged for coal in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire, but the motion moved by Deputy Mulcahy will not suffice for that purpose.  There are objections to the motion, both on grounds of law and on grounds of public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that a committee of the kind proposed by Deputy Mulcahy could not function without a special Act of the Legislature.  The position is that the function of controlling the prices of commodities is allocated to me under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and it does not appear that I have any power to delegate that function.  I discharge that function under the provisions of the Emergency Powers Act, and Section 89 of the Emergency Powers Order imposes a prohibition on the disclosure of information.  The inquiry contemplated by Deputy Mulcahy's motion would apparently involve the production for public investigation of documents relating to the business of private traders and that would appear to be contrary to the provisions of the Emergency Powers Order.  In the absence <Col N="2057" /> of special powers, which could be conferred only by an Act of Parliament, the proposed committee would have no status and, even if the motion were passed and the committee were set up, it would have no right to carry out an investigation of the kind contemplated.</P>
    <P>Apart, however, from these legal difficulties, there are important considerations of public policy which would make it impossible for me to agree to a public inquiry by a Dáil Committee of the kind suggested, which would involve the disclosure in public of matters relating to the private affairs of individual traders and firms.  It is, I think, contrary to practice to submit for public investigation or to make available to the public information relating to the affairs of private firms which has been furnished to Government Departments. The information now in the possession of my Department, relating to the affairs of the firms and traders engaged in the importation of coal, was given by those firms to my Department on the understanding that it was confidential to the Department.  The publication of such information now, in breach of that understanding, might well lead, if not to an organised refusal on the part of traders generally to furnish similar information to my Department in the future, at least to that information being prepared for submission in a manner which would indicate that the traders had in view its possible publication subsequently. That information would be open to suspicion because of that doubt as to the <i>bona fides</i> of the Department in the matter of the disclosure of information. The accuracy of the submissions made by traders would also be open to suspicion because of the fear of publication and that would prejudice the system of price control now in operation.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Dáil already that I am anxious that the fullest possible investigation by a Dáil Committee be undertaken.  I am satisfied that such an investigation would not merely allay any public disquietude concerning the effect of traders' profits upon coal prices but would also establish confidence in the system of <Col N="2058" /> price control exercised by my Department. I feel sure that such an inquiry would be welcomed by the coal traders, although it might involve a considerable amount of extra work for a number of traders.  The manner in which they have co-operated with my Department in making effective the system of price control now in operation suggests to me that they would have no objection to facilitating a committee of the kind that might be established by the Dáil in carrying out the type of inquiry I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, to Deputy Mulcahy, who moved the motion, and to his Party, that this motion be withdrawn and that consideration be given &mdash;in consultation with the Party Whips &mdash;as to the form of motion which could be accepted, having regard to the limitation which I have mentioned on the powers of such a committee and to the need to keep confidential information relating to the affairs of private firms and the considerations of public policy to which I have referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to make it quite clear that any motion to which I will agree must involve an investigation only into existing circumstances and be designed to achieve some beneficial results in the present and in the future.  If Deputies desire to have an inquisition into the working of my Department in the past, they must wait until we have more time.  At the present time the staff of my Department are busily engaged upon urgent public duties.  The staff is insufficient to permit of the prompt discharge of these duties.  That staff has been enlarged as the functions of the Department are growing and I could not agree to release staff from these urgent duties, the proper fulfilment of which is essential in the public interest, for the purpose of carrying out any such inquisition into past activities. When there is more time, if the urgency of the situation should pass, if the war should end, Deputies can <Col N="2059" /> have all the inquisitions they like, but at the present time there is much more urgent and much more important work to be done.  In fact, I want to say that any investigation which a committee of this Dáil is going to carry out must be of such a nature that it will involve the least possible additions to the duties and the labours of the staff of my Department.  If Deputies are concerned not so much with proving a case against me or my Department as with the benefits which might be conferred on the coal consumers of Dublin by an investigation of this kind, then I am prepared to meet them; I am prepared to give them an investigation into the prices now existing; I am prepared to facilitate them in such an investigation but, if they want to go back into the past, I am sorry I cannot meet them, I cannot give time to it; I cannot give staff for that purpose.  And that is the sole reason why I am not prepared to facilitate such an investigation into past happenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, however, to deal with another point before leaving the question of this motion.  In case the motion now before the Dáil and the next motion on the list for consideration in Private Members' time, in the name of Deputy O'Higgins, proposing the establishment of a committee of the House to investigate the allocation of petrol supplies, might lead to other motions of a similar character, I must make it clear that the Government will resist any such tendency. The motions before the Dáil might be accepted, with modifications, but the acceptance of them must not be regarded as establishing a precedent. Circumstances could arise where the acceptance of motions in similar terms might not be in the public interest, even circumstances where it would not be in the public interest to state publicly the reasons for non-acceptance. Apart from that consideration, a serious development along such lines might lead in the course of time to the functions of Government being in practice discharged by committees of the Dáil.  That division of power from responsibility would be very undesirable, and I am sure that all Deputies who are interested in the preservation of <Col N="2060" /> the institutions of this State will agree on consideration that such a development would be undesirable.</P>
    <P>So much for the motion.  Before concluding my remarks, I want to take this opportunity of making a few general statements concerning our coal situation.  The quality of the coal at present being imported into this country is bad.  I do not want Deputies to tell me that.  I know it is bad.  There is, however, nothing which we can do about it.  We have to put up with that inferior coal for the present, at least.  I and the officers of my Department have been in constant touch with the Department of the British Government concerned with the issuing of licences for the export of coal to this country and, although they have recently been able to facilitate us in the matter of a few cargoes of gas coal for gas companies here, they have made it clear that there is little hope of improvement in the quality of the coal that we are receiving for the present and for some time to come in the future.  It is idle, therefore, for Deputies to protest against the quality of the coal.  They cannot possibly protest half as vigorously as I did, but mere protests are not going to result in an improvement.  The position must be understood by the public, because I know that members of the public have the impression that they are singled out by some process to receive bad coal while other members of the public are receiving better coal.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>The statements which are sometimes made by irresponsible people in the newspapers that a better class of coal is coming into this country and is in some way being segregated and sold only to better-off customers are entirely incorrect.  The arrangements which we have made for the supply of coal to the poorer consumers of Dublin, through the establishment of the central dumps from which the bellmen now receive their supplies, involve the allocation to these dumps of a percentage of every cargo of coal that comes into the port.  At least, I should say that the original intention was to ensure that only a limited percentage of every cargo would go to these dumps <Col N="2061" /> but, in practice, during this month the quantity of coal coming into Dublin has been so small that a very large part of it is going or has gone to these central dumps to supply the requirements of the poorer sections of the population. From the period between the 4th April and the 16th April no less than 75 per cent. of all the coal that came into the port of Dublin went to these central dumps, and from the 16th April to date 50 per cent. of all the coal that came to Dublin went into these dumps.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the figures which I have quoted that the quantity of coal which we are at present receiving is altogether inadequate for our needs. Not merely was there a period of almost a fortnight in which three-quarters of the total imports had to be allocated to supply one class of consumer, leaving other classes of household coal users with only a minor proportion of the total imports, but when the requirements of industrial users, of transport concerns, of public institutions and of gas companies are taken into account, it will be obvious that the quantities of coal which we received during the course of the past month were utterly inadequate to provide the minimum requirements of the city.</P>
    <P>There appears to be in the minds of some of the bellmen an impression that, so far as supplies are concerned, they must be kept in at least as favourable a position as they were before the war. I want them and those whom they supply with coal to understand that that may not be possible.  Unless the quantity of coal being imported should improve it will be impossible.  At the present time, however, as I stated here on the previous day on which I spoke on the subject, not merely are these bellmen receiving their normal supplies but the figures suggest that they are receiving more than their normal supplies.</P>
    <P>My information is that the normal trade done by bellmen in the City of Dublin amounted to 1,500 tons of coal per week.  The figures with regard to the quantity of coal withdrawn from these central dumps by the bellmen show a daily average of <Col N="2062" /> between 300 and 350 tons &mdash; on one date, the 21st of this month, no less than 685 tons were withdrawn by bellmen.  These figures show that the bellmen have received quantities at least equal to, if not in excess of, the quantities they received normally. It is necessary, however, to remember that if coal supplies should fall off more than they have up to the present, it may happen that supplies of coal for household purposes will cease. There is no danger of that happening in the immediate future, but there are indications that, if the conditions now prevailing should continue until next winter, there may be a danger of no household coal being available at all. It is not an easy matter to decide, when an essential commodity such as coal is scarce, to whom preference should be given in the matter of supplies. It is clear, however, that supplies to transport concerns, to public institutions such as hospitals, and to a number of essential industries, must be given priority.  The curtailment of coal supplies to such industries as these would mean complete dislocation, with consequent disemployment of the people engaged in these industries, and it is desirable that we should try to prevent, as far as possible, anything that would tend to increase unemployment. Consequently, if we have to make a decision between cutting off altogether supplies of coal for household purposes and the supplying of coal to industries so as to avoid the creation of widespread unemployment, I think we will decide in favour of maintaining employment so far as we can, because we hope that in the interval, between now and the date when such a contingency may arise, the production of turf will have taken place to such an extent that the provision of some class of fuel for household purposes will be possible.</P>
    <P>It is because we contemplated that diminution in coal imports, which may make it necessary to deprive householders of the use of coal altogether for a period, that we stressed and are still stressing the tremendous importance of expanding in every way the production of turf.  It is for the same reason that we are making arrangements to have cut and stored a substantial quantity <Col N="2063" /> of firewood.  It is, of course, necessary to consider the various problems that might arise in a city like Dublin if supplies of coal should not be available for household purposes.</P>
    <P>The utilisation of turf or firewood for cooking purposes might be a matter of considerable difficulty, if not an utter impossibility, in some of the tenement districts in Dublin.  In that connection, I understand that the Department of Local Government and Public Health are bringing to the attention of the Dublin Corporation the problems that might arise in such circumstances, with a view to having the corporation consider what action might be taken to relieve the hardship that might be caused.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the quantities of coal we are getting, and also of the quality of coal, and I have tried, in a brief space of time, to give the House and the country the position as it exists.  Now, I want to say a word or two about prices, and, in saying what I am about to say, I do not want to prejudice in any way any investigation which may take place, but there are facts which should be made known now, not merely to the House, from the point of view of clarifying the views of Deputies on the subject, but also from the point of view of the public.  In normal times&mdash;and, in fact, up to the last half of last year &mdash;coal was imported into this country from a wide variety of places in England, both from the west and the east coast, and from Scotland and Wales.  Not merely was it imported from a wide variety of places, but it was imported in a wide variety of qualities.  When we were negotiating with Britain as to the pit-head prices we were to pay for coal, both pre-war and post-war, the schedule of prices was as long as my arm.  With such a wide variety of pit-head prices to deal with, and with such a number of ports from which the coal was being imported, there was no practicable means of dealing with control here by means of fixed prices.  Fixed prices were not possible.  It was only practicable to control prices by regulating the margin of profit which the importer could take, <Col N="2064" /> and that, I can tell you, can never be made 100 per cent. effective, because only an expert could say that a particular coal has been mined in such-and-such a place in England, or shipped from such-and-such a port, or what quality the coal was.  No man could say what should be charged for the coal without knowing all the facts, and that also invalidates the calculation which Deputy Mulcahy endeavoured to sustain last week with regard to the average price of coal imported.  The average price of the coal imported into Ireland is influenced, of course, by the quantities and qualities of the coal imported into different ports here, such as Cork, or ports in the West of Ireland.  As Deputies from Cork know, there is a big difference in the cost of transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I invite anybody to read the report of the Dáil debate last week, and then decide whether I am misrepresenting the Deputy.  However, I shall not enter into that now. Following on the introduction by the British Government of the prohibition of exports to this country except under licence, a change took place in that method of trading.  We were no longer allowed to buy coal from different districts in Britain or to ship the coal from different ports, or even to get varieties of quality.  We were limited, and are limited, to buying coal in a few districts and we are confined to shipping it from a limited number <Col N="2065" /> of ports.  Furthermore, the grades of coal in respect of which export licences are being granted to us, have been narrowed.  There is now only a limited number of different grades and these are so close together in respect of quality that there is little difference in the price.  One coal importer said at a conference in my Department last week that we are now getting only one type of coal&mdash;the worst.  Whether that is a fair description of the position I do not know, but I do know that there is a very narrow margin between the price of the lowest grade coal and the price of the highest grade coal, whereas in the past there was a very wide margin.</P>
      <P>In consequence of that limitation in the number of varieties of coal which we can get and in the uniformity of price which is now beginning to operate, we are in a position to fix the retail selling price at least in Dublin. It is a different proposition when you come to fix the retail selling price in inland towns or at the various small ports.  There are a number of inland towns in which there is no coal at all available at the present time.  That position may continue.  When one has to determine what is a fair price for coal in some inland town, it is not merely necessary to ascertain the c.i.f. cost of coal at the point of importation and the handling charges but also the cost of transportation.  There is a wide variety of systems of transport in use, all of which may involve different costs and consequently affect what may be a fair retail price of coal to the consumer.  I mention these matters so that Deputies will not think that fixing on nation-wide basis of prices of coal which can be published in the Press and made known to consumers is an easy matter.  It is, in fact, an impossible thing to do.  One could fix a price from district to district but that price may change not merely frequently but may be entirely different in separate districts even though it may appear that the circumstances of these districts are otherwise the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, in justice to my Department, that the fixed prices for coal which are now prevailing allow no undue margin of profit whatever.  On <Col N="2066" /> the contrary, a number of coal importers have complained that the limitation of profits is so restrictive that it will be impossible for them to carry on having regard to the very substantial diminution in their total turnover.  Deputies are aware that we fixed a margin over and above the c.i.f. cost of coal which was based on the pre-war experience of these coal importers and with only very slight variations for additions to these costs which have arisen in consequence of the war.  We make no provision in respect of increased profits or increased wages.  Consequently, a diminution in the trade of an importer means also a definite diminution in the amount of money which he receives to meet overhead charges.  If that diminution in imports should continue, a number of these traders will find it impossible to carry on.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies also to understand the importance of these traders.  It may be a popular thing and an easy thing to attack merchants and traders and to accuse them of profiteering.  I have no brief for profiteers.  I am prepared to take the most rigorous action which the Dáil can suggest against convicted profiteers, but I dislike very much to see these wild, general charges thrown around, because they not merely disturb the public mind, but they are unfair to these traders who are not, in fact, taking any undue profits at all.  In the case of the coal importers of Dublin, who are working under prices fixed by me, I change these prices from time to time whenever necessary, and there can be no element of undue profits at all.  It is on these traders we depend to get coal. Deputies can assume that we have considered the possibility of setting up special organisations to import coal&mdash; central purchasing companies and other organisations of that kind&mdash;and that if we have decided against it, it is merely because we believe that the system of importation through a number of separate private traders is likely to get us more coal and better value at the present time than any central organisation could.  Circumstances may change.  The creation of a central selling organisation on the other side may compel us to modify our practice <Col N="2067" /> here, but, for the time being, I am satisfied that the importation of coal by individual traders who have their contacts on the other side, who can make individual representations to the colliery owners, and who can deal, as business men will, with the much greater difficulty of procuring ships to bring here the coal for which export licences are obtained, is the best system of working.  It is these merchants who do all that work, who contact colliery owners, who keep bombarding them with applications and requests until they get coal, who go after Government officials to get them to issue import licences for the coal, who ferret round to get ships to bring the coal in here, and who finance all these operations from the beginning to the end.  These merchants have been working under circumstances of great difficulty, and they should be at least immune from attack here until there is unquestionable evidence to justify such an attack.</P>
    <P>I want also to add that at the present time not merely are these traders permitted to charge only a fixed margin over the c.i.f cost to ordinary coal consumers, but they are also charging an amount fixed by me for the purpose of subsidising the coal which goes to the central dumps for sale by bellmen to the poorer consumers.  That coal is sold at the central dumps at a price which would not be possible but for that extra charge imposed on other consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a percentage charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a fixed sum per ton of coal sold otherwise than through the central dumps.  If there is any question raised here by any Deputy as to the justice of imposing that charge upon other consumers in order to subsidise the coal sold through bellmen, I am prepared to justify it.  Such a question has not yet been raised.  That is all I want to say on that matter.  If Deputies desire a <i>bona fide</i> impartial investigation into the price of coal in the light of the facts I have given, I am prepared to facilitate them.  If, however, they are concerned only with Party manoeuvring, <Col N="2068" /> with creating mischief or with finding stones to throw at my Department, I shall not facilitate them.  If they are concerned in this matter as responsible representatives of the public merely to see that the truth is ascertained&mdash;and my opinion is that that truth appears to dispose of the case made here recently&mdash;then I shall help them, but not otherwise.</P>

The Minister said if the House and if Deputies were concerned with the sole purpose of getting at the truth he was prepared to facilitate them.  That is exactly why the motion is before the House.  The Minister, of course, does not believe that.  On the last occasion he challenged in the most aggressive and, if I might say so, in the most offensive way possible, Deputy Mulcahy's good faith in this matter.  He ascribed to Deputy Mulcahy every conceivably unworthy motive he could think of.  He was not prepared to concede even for a moment that Deputy Mulcahy and those who were supporting the motion were anxious to get at the truth.  The Minister spoke on this motion for about an hour and ten minutes altogether, but he did not take up any single set of figures which Deputy Mulcahy put before the House, or challenge him on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing the Minister was quite definite upon was this, that whatever form of committee was set up, whatever sort of motion was to be agreed to by this House&mdash;it did not matter what the wording of it was; it did not matter how it was framed; it did not matter, to use his own words, whether it was an illegal committee or not&mdash; the one thing he was not going to allow them to do was to find out what the price of coal was yesterday; it must start from to-morrow.  That is the man who tells us that if the sole purpose is to get at the truth he is prepared to facilitate the Dáil.  Why did not the Minister tell this House why he would <Col N="2069" /> not allow an inquiry into the price of coal on the basis of 1st January of this year?</P>

The Minister's own Department, if they were to avail of them all, would keep this House sitting for 365 days in the year.  But the Minister went further when he was on that line; he referred to the next motion which is on the paper, and told us that motions of that type would be resisted by the Government, and that the Dáil would not be allowed to discuss them.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  That is the only way it can come to a decision &mdash;by majority vote.  I am glad to get that much clear, because it seems to me that the Minister was going a great deal further than he should go.  We want to have it made perfectly clear that, so long as this House is here, the House has certainly the right to put down any motion it likes, and to carry that motion if it sees fit to do so. What would the Minister say if he were in opposition, and another Minister for Supplies sitting over there told him that he was not going to allow or would not stand for any inquiry&mdash;or, as he called it, &ldquo;any inquisition&rdquo;&mdash; into the working of his Department? It is not an inquisition into the working of his Department, but surely this House has the right to know if the Department was entitled to sanction the price for coal which it did sanction over the last 12 months.  If the House decides that the only way it can do it is by a committee appointed by the Committee of Selection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But let me put this to the Minister, that, while the majority has certain rights in this House, and of course is in a position to avail of them to the full, the minority also has rights which are not going to be trampled on, least of all in times like these.  When a reasonable request is made in the form of a motion here, put in a very orderly way, when the House is not satisfied that the Department were justified in sanctioning the price they did sanction for coal over the last four months&mdash;I will not go any further back, although the Minister himself went back as far as July last&mdash;the Minister says he will resist that; he calls it an inquisition into his Department, and anybody who wants that can go to Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>The Minister may think he is answering for his Department, but he is not.  The Minister may think he is being helpful to his Government, but he is not.  He may think that, by coming in and adopting the attitude which he adopted on the last occasion, he is being helpful even to the country.  Far from it.  The Minister comes in here as if he were infallible, and as if his Department were infallible and had never made any mistakes.  He becomes incensed with anybody in this House who chooses to exercise his Constitutional right&mdash;it is not only a Constitutional right but a Constitutional duty&mdash;to challenge any mistakes that are made, and in that way to see that they are not repeated.  He resents that.  He flies off the handle immediately, and accuses us of trying to make petty political capital and of looking for headlines in the newspapers. Deputy Mulcahy has gone to perhaps more pains and greater lengths than Deputies in this House usually do to get the facts of this case, to get all the details, to get at the truth, and to put the truth as he got it before the House.  The Minister talked about Deputy Mulcahy trying to relate certain averages, and said that Deputy Mulcahy talked a great deal of nonsense. Apparently, the Minister talked more nonsense that even he himself believed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>There were two sets of figures which Deputy Mulcahy put before the House, by speech, by question, and supplementary question, during the last three months.  It is rather significant that the Minister never once referred to them.  Deputy Mulcahy, in question after question, put this to the Minister: the average c.i.f. price of all coal at the port of Dublin in January last was 44/8.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us why he did not refer to those figures at all, in view of the fact that those are figures which were repeatedly put before this House in the last three months?  I suggest to the Minister that if he could have used them to his advantage he is the very man who would have done it.  The Minister talks a whole lot of generalities, and then goes begging the question and talking about people attacking the merchants. People are not attacking the merchants, but members of this House are entitled to know, particularly in times like these, why certain increases are allowed, and particularly when those increases are sanctioned and stamped by a Government Department. They are supposed to get from the Minister the reasons why that sanction has been given.  They have not got it.  The Minister talked to-night about subsidising&mdash;that all the other consumers of coal were paying an extra price in order to subsidise the sale of coal to bellmen.  Does he mean all the other consumers in the City of Dublin, in the City and County of Dublin, or in the whole country?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It is a great pity that the Minister did not explain the figures to the House more fully.  That would have been much more interesting and valuable than a lot of the matters he spoke about, and it would have been far more helpful and informative than the mere abuse of a Deputy who submits an important motion for consideration. The Minister cannot play the same old tune that he has been play-on the fiddle for the last 15 years&mdash;that everybody else is dishonest and has some ulterior motive; that everybody but himself is seeking to make Party capital out of this, playing the political game.  The Minister cannot play that and get the people to believe it, especially at a time like this.  I should like to remind the Minister that if Deputies on this side of the House wished to play for Party advantage, there would be no difficulty in doing so and there is no shortage of material.  But there is no necessity for Deputies on this side to try to injure the Government Party, because the Government Party are themselves doing it far more effectively than a combined Labour and Fine Gael Party could do it.</P>

      <P>The Minister spent 40 minutes talking to us to-night without addressing himself in a really relevant way either to the motion or to certain facts that I put before the House on the last occasion when this matter was under discussion.  The Minister suggests that the motion in its present form is such that if it were <Col N="2074" /> passed it could not legally be put into operation.  One of the clearest and most emphatic statements made from the Government Benches in connection with the economic position here during the emergency was that they were not going to allow increases of wages.  Such a policy being pursued, nothing was more essential than that, whatever machinery was set up to control prices, it would be efficiently and alertly operated.  That had particular reference to those things that bear most on home comfort and home life, from the point of view of the necessaries for ordinary maintenance, particularly as affecting the working classes.</P>
      <P>We are asked here to-night to take it that the Emergency Powers Act, which was passed for the purpose of getting our people safely through this emergency, should be used in order to cloak down a systematic examination into prices affecting one of the most important commodities used by our people, particularly in the city.  I do not accept that, and I do not accept either that passing this motion as it stands is in any way going to prejudice the carrying on of business, or the submission by any party in the country of information necessary to bring our people safely through this emergency.  I considered in the special case of coal that the facts staring us in the face from official documents were so patent that it was not necessary to get any information of a confidential kind&mdash;not that I admit that the motion would necessitate going into detailed figures with reference to any particular firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister, with all restrictions off, with all commitments left aside, that a group of members of the House be formed into a committee for the purpose of inquiring whether the prices charged for coal in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire were reasonable as from 1st January last.  The House will remember that this question first arose on 12th March.  For some weeks before that it was being disclosed that there was a rapidly increasing divergence between the price charged for bellmen's coal in Dublin and the c.i.f. import price of coal in the country.  I explained on the last day that the <Col N="2075" /> reason there was so much talk during the discussion on coal of the price charged to bellmen was that that was a definite price, and you could infer that prices charged to other people in the city had some ratio relation with that particular price.  By the 12th March it was disclosed that very excessive prices were being charged over those charged in the last six months of last year, or normally before that, and the Minister was asked to explain the matter.  The Minister's immediate answer was that we were simply trying to arouse discontent in the country; that we were stirring up revolution and raising the red flag.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach intervened on the 13th March, and he said he would deal with the question of bellmen's coal. On the night he spoke there were just three minutes to spare and the Taoiseach said he would use those three minutes to deal with the question of the bellmen's coal.  I suggested to him that he could not, with any credit to himself, hope to deal adequately with the question in such a short space of time.  I deliberately let him sit down without dealing with the question because I did not think that he could hope to deal with the position in such a brief period with any credit to himself. The Minister told us everything he had to tell us, with all the authority of his office behind him.  I did not want to see the Taoiseach, and the authority and prestige of his office, being reduced to the position to which the Minister for Supplies has reduced the prestige of his office by attempting to deal with this coal question without an opportunity of hearing the facts that persons investigating the position from outside, and with access to official records, could put before the House.</P>
    <P>I told the Taoiseach that I would give him an opportunity of dealing with the matter systematically and thoroughly, and on the 21st March I put down this motion.  I made my case the last day, and the Minister had some reflections to make both then and to-day.  One of the things the Minister complains of is that in relating the <Col N="2076" /> price charged to bellmen over the period from July, 1940, to date, with the c.i.f. price of all coal imported, I am doing something that is senseless and that has no meaning.  In the Official Report, column 1927, he suggested:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Deputy is going to persist in his fallacy of comparing the average price of all coals imported into the whole country with the selling price of one class imported into Dublin, will he at least give the average price for the whole month for that one class?  Why does he compare the average import price for the month with the selling price on a particular date?  Why not compare it with the average selling price for a month?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He objects to my comparison of bellmen's coal with all coal imported, and also with coal imported through any place other than the port of Dublin. I pointed out that between 18th January and 7th April I estimated that £71,000 had been charged to coal purchasers in the City of Dublin more than should have been charged if there was the normal rate of profit that was made between July and November, 1940.  I stated that I was making that as a conservative estimate, that I was basing it on the sale of 30,000 tons weekly in Dublin, and that in giving these figures I was giving the Minister every possible advantage.  The Minister stated to-night that the price of coal imported to Dublin was cheaper than the price at which it was imported to any other part of the country because of freight charges.  Therefore, I took the marginal difference between the price of coal to bellmen and the price of coal imported to the whole country. I am taking a smaller difference than if I took the difference between bellmen's prices and the price of coal imported to Dublin, so that the Minister has no complaint there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, surely.  If the Deputy's argument is based on the margin that existed last July surely the higher he makes the average price, the smaller the margin and the more wrong he will be.</P>

      <P>I want to get the matter clear.  The Minister has dragged every possible question, from the politics of importers and the charges made against them, to the duplicity, evil actions and dishonesty of bellmen across the discussion.  This is a question of figures and prices.  On the last occasion, I put before the House the c.i.f. price of all coal brought in from July up to the present date.  I pointed out that I took the period July to November, inclusive, because the price charged to bellmen then in the City of Dublin was 50/- per ton, while the average price of all coal imported during that period was 39/5, so that there was a margin of difference between the average price of coal imported and the price charged to bellmen of 10/7 a ton.</P>

I showed that by the increase of 6/2 the Minister approved in the month of January, and by the additional charge he approved in February, instead of there being a marginal difference between the price I was taking and the price to bellmen, from 18th January to February 1st, there was an additional price charged to bellmen of 2/9; from February 1st to February 17th, an additional 1/6; from 15th to 28th February, an additional 6/6.</P>

After the motion was put down, the price of coal to bellmen dropped from 7th April by 6/8.  I say that before the Minister dropped the price by that 6/8 to bellmen there had been taken from all other consumers in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire a sum of £71,000 more than should have been taken if the importers of coal were satisfied with the same amount of profit that they were getting from July to November.</P>

      <P>The reason I took the price of all coal was that the difference between the c.i.f. price of all coal and the c.i.f. price of household coal was narrowing very much in the latter months of last year and the early months of this year as compared with the beginning of last year, and the quality of coal the people were getting was becoming more like an all-coal quality than anything else.  This is a question of figures that run in sequence, and can be graphed, and if Deputies take the figures for all coal and the prices of bellmen's coal which I gave in the debate last Thursday, and graph them, they will see the swollen overcharge from 18th January to 7th April, but if they wish to compare the c.i.f. prices of household as distinct from all coal charged to bellmen, I can give the figures.</P>
      <P>The c.i.f. price of household coal in July, 1940, was 41/5; in August, 40/10; in September, 40/4; in October, 39/9; in November, 41/-; in December, 42/1; in January, 45/2; in February, 46/5; and in March, 47/11.  Over the period July to November, when the charge to bellmen was 50/-, the average c.i.f. price of household coal was 40/6.  There was, therefore, between the average c.i.f. price of household coal imported into the country during that period and the price charged to bellmen a difference of 9/6 per ton.</P>

So far from the taking of household coal, and relating prices to those of household coal underlining the figure I have given as the overcharge, it actually increases it to £73,860, or by 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey agreed with me that coal imported into ports other than Dublin is dearer than that imported at Dublin.  Therefore, the average price of coal for the whole of Ireland must be higher than the average price of coal imported into Dublin.  Is that not so?  Therefore, the difference between the average price for the whole country and the price charged to bellmen in Dublin must be less than the difference between the average price of coal imported into Dublin and the price charged to bellmen.&mdash;Q.E.D.</P>

He is assuming that a fair difference is the difference between the price to bellmen in Dublin and the average price for the whole country.  The average for the whole country was higher than the average for Dublin and, therefore, the difference between bellmen's prices and the average for the whole country cannot be a fair margin, and it was not recognised as a fair margin in July.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the schoolboy mentality, but rather the mentality of the footpad, who wants to bludgeon people and to make statements simply in order to fill the air, as it were.  Would the Minister take his statement and examine it, and if he really considers that the prestige of his Department demands public confidence in his actions and in the running of his Department, and in the manipulation of the coal business by the merchants at this time, he will see that the public has to be put straight on these questions, and that they can only be put straight by this House being given a full opportunity to examine them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, I am appealing to Deputies behind the Minister; I am appealing to Deputy Alderman Kelly, to Deputy Cooney, to Deputy Breathnach and to the other Dublin Deputies, to realise that they have a duty and responsibility to see that neither the poor of the city, nor the other coal consumers in the city, are mulcted in this way without an opportunity being <Col N="2083" /> given of sitting down and examining why these things happen.  The Minister challenges the <i>bona fides</i> of people who raise these questions, merely for the purpose of drawing red herrings across the discussion.  If the Minister were closely in touch with the conditions of working families and other families in this city, he would know that the situation is much too serious for anybody to bother about politics, or for anybody to bother about anything, except about seeing that whatever State machinery, which can be used to make things more equitable for the people, and to put them in a position in which they will be better able to sustain themselves and to live during their present difficulties, exists, will be used efficiently and for the purpose for which it is set up, and that blundering or blustering will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>In fairness to his Department&mdash;he speaks here as if his Department were challenged&mdash;in fairness to his own prestige in office and in fairness to the Government as a whole, this question should be thoroughly examined.  I do not want to get up and make charges simply for the purpose of making charges.  I take too serious a view of the present situation to think that I could be of any use in that particular way.  If I may say so, I have a greater sense of personal dignity, a greater sense of the dignity with which one would desire to live one's life, than to occupy my time in making charges in this way.  I raised the matter with a simple question on the 12th March, when the Minister dealt incidentally with coal.  I asked him if he would answer the question raised by Deputy McGilligan on the previous night as to why, between the 10th January and the 18th February, the price of coal to bellmen in the City of Dublin had been raised by 11/-.  That was a simple question.  By way of answer, the Minister &ldquo;flew off the handle&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You asked it by way of irrelevant interruption in another debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt, incidentally, with coal and told <Col N="2084" /> us how he was handling price control. I asked him to deal with the question raised the night before by Deputy McGilligan before he passed on from the question of coal.  At that time, he was about to leave coal and pass on to wheat.  The Minister's answer was as I have described.  I put the facts more clearly in the debate on the following day, and then I put down a motion.  I said I would give the Taoiseach an opportunity to get this matter systematically handled.  The House has heard the facts which I have put before them, and they have heard the reply of the Minister.  They are aware that I do not want any confidential information.  I stand on facts that are, in my opinion, patent and clear.  All I ask is that any group of Deputies selected by the Committee of Selection should, without prying into the affairs of any firm, take facts that can be ascertained in the city from people buying coal, then take facts which can be ascertained from the official statistics, compare these and say whether the deductions I am drawing from them are right or not.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, if the Deputies behind the Minister do not do that, they are running away from one of the most serious responsibilities they have at the present time.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that wages are not to be allowed to go up and, if that be so, exorbitant prices should not be charged for coal.  We have had the satisfaction of seeing that, as a result of opening up the question here and as a result of the putting down of this motion, the price of bellmen's coal has been reduced by 6/8.</P>

      <P>The Minister can expose my lies, my wrong deductions, my boastings or anything else he wishes to expose if he allows this matter to be inquired into, if he allows an inquiry into the circumstances which warranted a price-increase from 52/- on 10th January to 58/- on the 18th January and to 63/- on the 18th February.  On the 7th April, the price was reduced to 56/4.  We have to bear in mind that the Minister told us, when coal had gone up from 52/- to 63/-, on the 18th February, that that price of 63/- was a subsidised price.</P>

      <P>The people of the city are paying a higher price than they ought to pay and the foundation of the whole thing is the manipulation that has gone on from the 18th January. Deputies who do not insist on seeing this matter examined are simply runing away from their responsibilities. They will be responsible for the plight to which the poorer class of people will be reduced by the exorbitant price charged for coal.  If an exorbitant price can be charged for coal, a similar price can be charged for other things. That will be the responsibility of Deputies opposite.  Nobody is standing between a full examination of these things and an exposure of whether what we have asserted here is right or wrong but the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that Mr. J. Lynch has learned a trade in order to qualify himself for a certain job in Great Britain or that when he applied for an entry visa to Great Britain he was referred to my Department. It is not the function of my Department to issue visas for Great Britain.  It is the British authorities who decide whether or not an entry visa to Great Britain shall be granted and my Department is not in any way responsible for any delay which may have occurred in issuing a visa to Mr. Lynch.</P>
