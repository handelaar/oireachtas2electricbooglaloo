      <P>It is proposed to take the motions on the Order Paper, No. 2 and No. 1, in that order.  This is probably the best time to move to sit late; I move the usual motion, that the Dáil sit later than 2 p.m. to-day, and that the motion for the adjournment be taken not later than 12 midnight.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister or the Taoiseach whether it is proposed to summon the Dáil next week to consider Motion No. 7.  The Taoiseach, I am sure, is aware that the principal problem confronting this country is how to get bread, and in order to get bread the wheat crop must be put in immediately.  On Motion No. 7 we propose to put before the Dáil the ways and means of getting a sufficient crop, backed up by an undertaking from the farmers of the country.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach if he will convene the Dáil next week to consider that motion, as it is now getting late for the sowing of wheat.  Some propagandists are saying that we have time enough for six weeks yet to sow winter wheat. Well, of course you can sow winter wheat in May, but you will reap not. I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he proposes summoning the Dáil next week.</P>

      <P>Does the Government not recognise that that is a golden fortnight, and that, if steps are not taken within that fortnight, the responsibility will be the Government's if we run short of bread or if we have black bread?  I appeal to the Taoiseach to reconsider that decision.  The whole country is anxious that the Dáil should meet and whatever effort is to be made in the matter of wheat production, we should make it at once.  I wish to protest against what I understand to be the order of the Government to confine the debate on motion No. 1 to three hours.</P>

      <P>Everybody will admit, I am sure, that this is an unprecedented occasion.  We are up against something that not only the Dáil but the country has never been up against before.  In order to have a debate on this important subject, and recognising the delays that might ensue, we put down motion No. 6 on the Order Paper.  As that motion stands on the Order Paper, neither the proposer nor the seconder supports it, but it was the only way to get at a discussion on the tillage order.  We put down a similar motion on another occasion; it was discussed in December last, and there was a similar motion in the previous year.  We will withdraw that motion if we get the concession of unlimited time.  Unlimited time might not mean five minutes longer than the period of three hours; it might not even mean <Col N="1469" /> the three hours; but there is a principle involved and I appeal to the Taoiseach to grant unlimited time.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government should define the probable future situation in regard to essential supplies and indicate what steps are contemplated for their equitable distribution in the event of acute shortage developing.&mdash;(Deputy Cosgrave).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke last night, I reminded the House that petrol users in this country had had the advantage of a reasonably satisfactory supply of petrol ever since the outbreak of the war and that it was only on Christmas Eve that any dislocation occurred in the arrangements which up to that date had been effective in providing that supply.  The dislocation was due, as I presume every reasonable person must be aware, to arrangements <Col N="1470" /> outside our control.  The Minister for Supplies, nor no other agency, could at that stage have done anything which would have obviated the consequences which followed from action taken outside our territory; and yet this one occurrence, this one interruption in the accustomed ways of life of the petrol users&mdash;not of the community as a whole &mdash;has been held up here as an example of ineptitude which could not be condoned. I suggest to the House and to the country that this is not the spirit in which our present problems ought to be approached because, so far as petrol is concerned, I think there is no foundation for that charge and that no reasonable person would for a moment consider that the Minister for Supplies had been inept and ineffective in dealing with this question of petrol supplies.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, while the war was raging around us, when the high seas were thick with the crews of shipwrecked vessels, when people elsewhere were looking enviously at our position, we had a supply of petrol, day in and day out, to meet the reasonable needs of our people, not merely for their business enterprises but even for their amenities, their enjoyments and their pleasures.  I think there is no other community in Europe in regard to whom that could have been said. Accordingly, when this temporary curtailment in our petrol ration did occur, I should have thought that responsible people in this State should have come forward and, instead of painting the picture in gloomier terms than were justified, instead of criticising the Government and the policy which has been responsible for the maintenance of our supplies here in the unmeasured terms in which they were referred to by Deputy Costello and Deputy Dillon, they would have said: &ldquo;Look here, we think this breakdown is due to such-and-such an arrangement and we suggest that in order to avoid a breakdown of this sort in the future you ought to consider this other way of dealing with the problem.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In present circumstances they ought to come forward&mdash;and I think that will be the view of the country as a whole <Col N="1471" />&mdash;with more helpful, constructive suggestions.  We could then have approached this debate in the spirit in which, I should like to say, it was opened by the Leader of the Opposition, and in the spirit in which, I think, it would have been conducted by Deputies who wished to be helpful at this juncture and anxious to assist us to deal with the problems of the country as a whole.  Unfortunately, we have not got any such suggestions.</P>
    <P>There was, in the course of the debate, a reference made to the question of storage.  Deputy Dillon suggested that proposals had been submitted to the Government, by some interests whom he did not name, for the erection of storage which would have enabled us to hold reserve stocks in this country and so prevent this temporary dislocation.  So far as I personally am aware&mdash;and I say it without qualification&mdash;no proposals of that sort have been submitted to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No proposals of that sort were submitted to me and the Minister for Supplies said yesterday that no proposals of that sort were submitted to him.  One would have thought, in these circumstances, that Deputy Dillon, instead of persisting in the statement which was denied then by the Minister for Supplies and which has since been denied by me, would have at least gone back and asked those who gave him the information to allow him to submit to the House and the country such corroboration as they might have in their possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to go a little further.  We have at the moment storage accommodation in this country, storage accommodation which has not been, at least for some time, fully availed of by those who are supplying our petrol.  If we had this additional storage, to which Deputy Dillon refers, we have no reason to believe that it would have been any more fully availed of than the existing storage because, after all, what is the use of storage if you cannot be certain of getting your supplies from anywhere? Surely Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon are not unaware of the fact that we are dependent for our overseas supplies of petrol upon companies over whom we have no control? Do these Deputies suggest that, even if this storage were available, we would be in a position to compel these companies to bring to our shores petrol which would fill that storage?  Is not the root of the whole problem that not merely are individual users rationed in regard to petrol but that we ourselves, the community as a whole, are rationed in regard to our supplies and that if, for reasons outside our control, arrangements which other people make to deliver our ration of petrol break down, we have no remedy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could you not buy petrol and store it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is unaware of the fact that one of the principles upon which the ration is based is that even if you had the wherewithal to buy your full demands, your usual suppliers may not give you your full demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the situation since the war started.  That is the reason why it was necessary to introduce a rationing system at all. Yet the Government is held up to odium, told it is inept and ineffective, <Col N="1473" /> because the arrangements made by our suppliers of petrol to deliver the ration of petrol to the country have broken down.</P>
      <P>Let us get a little further back in regard to this question of storage.  I should like to know what interests put up this proposal.  What are the interests who have approached Deputy Dillon in regard to this matter?  We do know that in 1937-38, the Minister for Industry and Commerce of that time was making every effort to have an oil refinery erected in this country which would have put us, in my belief, in a somewhat better position in regard to our supplies of petrol.  I am not going to say that it would have wholly safeguarded us in that matter but, at any rate, it would have put us in a much better position.  We know how bitterly his efforts in that direction were opposed by certain interests in this country and how they were ridiculed here in the Dáil.  Unfortunately, for one reason or another, those who did not want an oil refinery here in this country have for the time being succeeded in their efforts to prevent it. I should like to know whether those people to whom Deputy Dillon refers and who, he says, were prepared to put up oil storage in this country, were the people who succeeded in preventing the Minister for Industry and Commerce erecting an oil refinery in this country, who opposed the erection of that refinery in order that they might keep control of the petrol situation?  I should like to know whether it is upon the basis of a statement emanating from that quarter that Deputy Dillon virtually accused the Minister for Supplies of misleading the Dáil and the country?  If these statements have emanated from the quarters which, as I have said before, prevented us from erecting an oil refinery, what guarantee have we that even if this proposition was ever put before the Government, and even if it had been accepted, that storage would have been erected and that even if it were erected, it would be any fuller than the existing storage is at the North Wall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the debate has taken this strain.  I should have much preferred that it had been pursued in another <Col N="1474" /> way, but these utterances of which I complain are some of the statements that were made yesterday.  The debate has been shaped by two or three speeches made yesterday and, unfortunately, since these allegations will no doubt be broadcast throughout the country we have the unpleasant responsibility&mdash;because it is unpleasant in the present circumstances&mdash;to reply in the strain in which I am now talking and to show how hollow were the criticisms which were launched against the Government yesterday.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from this question of storage, the underlying complaint in the course of the debate was that the petrol ration had been curtailed without due notice.  It seems to me that responsible Deputies who talk in that way must be living, as I think Deputy Costello implied yesterday, in a fool's paradise.  What sort of notice do you think the Minister for Supplies gets when a tanker is going to be sunk? Does anybody think that before these ships are sent to the bottom of the sea somebody wirelesses the Department of Supplies: &ldquo;There is a ship going down carrying a cargo for your shores.  You had better make other arrangements in order to ensure that supplies of that commodity will not be curtailed for your people without notice&rdquo;?  Yet, that seems to be the implication running throughout the whole of this debate, that when there is an interruption in the organisation which is bringing commodities to our shores, we ought to know about that dislocation before it actually occurs and that, only when it is impending, we ought to give the people notice that a tanker is going to be sunk and that they had better cut down supplies of petrol.  Of course this is not the first tanker that was sunk, Deputy Costello will say.  There were other tankers sunk.  Are we to be told that we ought to have communicated to the people very much earlier, by curtailing supplies, that ships bringing commodities to these shores were being sunk and that it might be eventually necessary for us to curtail supplies even more drastically?</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to remind the House again that the <Col N="1475" /> burden of Deputy Costello's speech was this, that by reason of the fact that the supply of petrol had to be restricted men were now going to be thrown out of employment.  What I want to know from Deputy Costello is this: whether he suggests that, instead of waiting until it became absolutely necessary to curtail petrol supplies, with all the miserable consequences which he so strongly represented to the House, we ought to have started to curtail supplies much earlier and thrown men out of employment before it was absolutely essential to do so?  Because that seemed to be his suggestion&mdash;that instead of waiting until there was nothing else to do except curtail supplies, we ought to have curtailed them earlier.  If we had curtailed them earlier the same consequences would have followed.  There would have been increased unemployment in this country.  But then, as I said last night, I am certain we would have been told by the Opposition that we had cut down those supplies and thrown men out of employment before it was absolutely essential to do so. In the dilemma which confronted the Minister for Supplies I think the reasonable, the just, the humane thing to do was not to have curtailed supplies until it became absolutely essential to do so.  It has become essential to do so now.  We had better face up to that fact.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate consequences of this debate about petrol and of the speeches made in this House in regard to this matter of imported supplies particularly, is that those who made speeches like Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello are deceiving and misleading the people.  They are making them forget that in regard to this question of overseas supplies we are in fact living from hand to mouth and that no system of rationing or reserve of stocks which you have built up will obviate that in a greater or less degree. We had a very substantial reserve of wheat&mdash;a full six months' supply for this country.  Yet, in five or six months from the present date, we are looking forward to a period when, if <Col N="1476" /> we do not eke out those supplies and stretch them to their limit, it may be difficult for a number of people in this country to get a sufficient supply of bread.  But we have started in regard to wheat a good six months in advance. Yet, in regard to this question of the essential supplies of bread for the people we are living, within that margin of supplies available, from hand to mouth.  If the ships which are on the seas for us or the ships under charter to us reach us, the position will not be so bad.  If by any chance the same fate befalls them as befell the tanker which was carrying petrol, the situation will be much worse.  We can do nothing except to try to look forward in regard to this matter, make the best provision we can in relation to it, and endeavour in respect to these commodities which can be easily and equitably rationed to spread the inconvenience or the hardship over the greatest possible number of people and to minimise it for us all.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, it is unpleasant to have to make a speech of this sort in the present circumstances.  But surely the bitterest things which could be said would almost be justified by some of the suggestions made in regard to the petrol problem yesterday.  We were told, for instance, by Deputy Dillon that there was no need for having three services plying to Dalkey&mdash;the trams, the buses, and the railway.  It was pointed out to Deputy Dillon that if he had that view in regard to this matter he might have mentioned it to the Minister for Supplies privately.  It was also pointed out to Deputy Dillon that, even if you were to discontinue the buses running to Dalkey, you would not influence the question of the petrol supplies for the rest of the community one iota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>By endeavouring to curtail the service of petrol-using <Col N="1477" /> buses there.  I am confining myself to the question of the Dalkey buses. What benefit or advantage would it be to take off the Dalkey buses?  It would inconvenience a considerable number of people, because those buses do not run by the same routes as the trains and the trams.  Dalkey is no longer an isolated village.  There might have been something in Deputy Dillon's suggestion in the days when Dalkey was altogether cut off from the City of Dublin. But, there are people living along every yard of the roads that stretch from the centre of the city to Dalkey, and living on the bye-roads and link roads that open off those roads.  It is through these that the buses pass.  It is to accommodate the people who live on these roads, who earn their living in the city, and who are compelled to live outside because of the fact that they cannot get living accommodation within the area of the old City of Dublin that these services have to be get into town to earn their living and to help to keep the community going and the country as a whole going, because the efforts of every one of us are interlinked in regard to that matter, are going to be inconvenienced if they find it difficult to get to town and to pursue their ordinary productive activities.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from that, you are going to have the drivers and conductors of the buses unemployed.  You are going to have them thrown out of employment without any corresponding benefit or advantage being conferred on any other interest.  The fact that buses using fuel oil are going to be put off the road is not going to make it any easier for the employees of the garages and the chauffeurs of private persons, about whom Deputy Costello was very much concerned, as we are all bound to be very much concerned.  You are simply going to deprive one group of men of a livelihood without, as I said, giving others a chance to restore themselves to their old positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question mentioned in the course of the debate was the problem of our bread supply.  Deputy Costello <Col N="1478" /> was again very emphatic in regard to the matter.  I do not know why it should be necessary for Deputies to speak, as some of them did yesterday, in hair-raising terms about black bread.  I know that people elsewhere have to eat bread of a colour and of a texture which does not appeal to the great majority of the people here, but they have to eat that bread because of the fact that it was not possible for them&mdash;perhaps, to some extent because of inherited tastes and inherited prejudices&mdash;but I think mainly because it was not possible for them to get the sort of fine, attractive, snowy-white bread that we are accustomed to. They managed to live, however, and to build up their national strength on that bread, and they managed to subsist as a people, and, if it becomes necessary for us to mix some cereal with our wheat, it is not a patriotic thing for Deputies, responsible representatives of the people, to go out and try, by creating or stimulating a prejudice in the minds of our people, to make the problem of securing a bread supply for all our people a much more difficult one.  That is what was done yesterday.</P>
    <P>What is all this talk about black bread, coming from laymen like Deputy Costello or Deputy Dillon, worth?  The Minister for Supplies said that if we had to add anything to our wheat and grist, whatever other cereal we added would be that which would, first of all, best conduce to the maintenance of the proper health and strength of our people.  Whether that should be barley or oats I am not in a position to say, being a layman like Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello, but I do accept, and I am sure that every sensible person in this community will accept, the statement of the Minister for Supplies that whatever be added to the bread it will be that which will tend to improve its dietetic value rather than otherwise, and whether it be barley or oats, and whether it be black or grey or snowy-white, I think, does not matter a thraneen in present circumstances. What does matter is that every member in our community should have bread of one sort or another to eat and <Col N="1479" /> that we should all eat the same class of bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to leave Deputy Belton alone for the moment and get back to the question of the bread supply.  As I have said, we had an attack launched upon the Minister for Supplies and upon his proposals to deal with this problem of the bread supply, on the assumed basis that we were going to have to eat black bread. I think the people of this country will say that black bread is better than no bread at all, but we need not necessarily have black bread.  However, we do know this: As I have said, Deputy Costello dealt with this problem yesterday and his approach to it was one of extreme simplicity.  First of all, he did not want black bread.  Like Deputy Dillon, he would not have black bread at any cost.  Perhaps he would rather eat cake, but at any rate, seemingly, he was prepared to go without bread rather than eat black bread. Secondly, Deputy Costello wanted as much wheat either grown or imported as would give him and, of course, everyone else, his usual supply of bread.  Then, thirdly&mdash;and this pleased Deputy Belton immensely&mdash;he wanted Deputy Belton and his friends to get a fully satisfactory price for their wheat.  However, fourthly, although Deputy Belton's pockets were to bulge with cash in return for this wheat, nevertheless Deputy Costello wanted <Col N="1480" /> the price of bread not to be increased to the consumer.  Then, fifthly, although Deputy Costello got all the bread he wanted and Deputy Belton got all the cash he wanted and there was to be no increase in price, nevertheless there was to be no increase in taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So here we have this position.  First of all, Deputy Costello will not eat black bread.  Secondly, he wanted all the wheat either to be brought into this country or grown in this country which would give him, and presumably everyone else, his usual supply of bread.  Thirdly, he wanted Deputy Belton to get a fully satisfactory price for his wheat.  Fourthly, he wanted no increase in price to the consumer; and fifthly, even though Deputy Costello had his white bread, and Deputy Belton had his satisfactory price, and Deputy Costello had his usual supply of bread, and there was no increase in price, Deputy Costello wanted to have no increase in taxation either.  As I have said, his approach to this problem was perfectly simple. All Deputy Costello wanted was a miracle worker as Minister for Supplies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, that is not, in present circumstances, a fair and patriotic way to approach a problem of this sort.  If we are going to pay an exorbitant price for wheat, we have got to do one of two things: either to increase the price of bread, or to increase taxation.  Deputy Costello says he does not want either.  Accordingly, well, we have only got to get this wheat at a reasonable and fair price and, if we can, to ensure that bread will be available to our people at as reasonable a price as possible. We cannot have it every way, and it is not fair to the country to continue talking as Deputy Costello talked in regard to this very vital problem. <Col N="1481" /> The next aspect of this problem to which, perhaps, some attention might be directed is to the question of shipping.  In the course of his speech yesterday Deputy O'Higgins criticised and, in my view, very justly criticised the reference which had been made by Deputy Corry to another country.  But I am afraid that Deputy O'Higgins in the statement he made might create a wrong impression in this country, an impression which would perhaps intensify the difficulties with which the Minister for Supplies is contending.  It was suggested by Deputy O'Higgins that we were indebted to the British Government for extensive shipping service, that, in fact, virtually all our supplies were being brought in in ships flying the British flag.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not mention the British flag at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that we were getting in supplies in British ships on the same terms as the British were getting them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister thinks the point a serious one he ought to have the statement before him.  Do not be introducing the question of flags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy just wait a while?  When a ship sails, it sails under a flag, the flag of the country where it is registered, and to say that a ship sails under a particular flag is the usual manner of referring to the nationality of ships sailing on the high seas.  It was not because I wished in any way to detract from the value of such service as was rendered us from time to time by other people, that I made the reference, but I want it to be clearly understood, lest it might intensify difficulties with which the Minister for Supplies is contending, that by far the greater part of the bulk cargoes coming to this country from abroad have been brought in neutral ships chartered by Irish importing agencies.  At the same time, it is only right to say in regard to these matters that the British Departments, particularly in the early stages <Col N="1482" /> of the conflict, were very helpful, and that help has been acknowledged here in the House by the Minister for Supplies. On the other hand, the circumstances in which the British find themselves in regard to shipping have fundamentally changed, and henceforward we shall be compelled to rely almost entirely on our own resources. In my view that is the most serious development in the present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the most serious development in the present situation.  It is not a position which can be rectified by the purchase of ships.  It is not easy to get ships in the first place, particularly when bidding against the most powerful buyer in the market.  When you have got ships to the number you require, it is not easy to get crews for them, nor is it easy to build up the operating organisation for them, and lastly, when you have the ships you have no assurance whatsoever that they will be permitted to keep the seas.  We must not in this connection forget that this island is in the midst of a blockaded area, that accordingly we may suffer, as we have suffered serious shipping losses from time to time.  In the purchase of ships, therefore, we might be casting our bread upon the waters at some risk, the grave and serious risk that it might not return, and that risk will be a large one measured in millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I look at the opposition which we had to face, in increasing the area under wheat from about 20,000 acres in 1932 to 300,000 acres in 1939-40; when I recall the opposition which we had to overcome when we were building three additional sugar factories, which have made this country independent of imported sugar supplies; when <Col N="1483" /> I remember the criticism which used to attend every effort which the then Minister for Industry and Commerce was making to get the cement industry established; and when I recall how the proposal to establish an oil refinery was opposed virtually by every section in the House, except those on the Government Benches, I shudder at what might have been said if we had come here asking for the millions that would be necessary to make us independent of foreign shipping.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have to say that the operation of deep-sea ships was a highly specialised business, a highly venturesome business, a highly risky business, a business which, as far as I can ascertain from the most searching inquiry, very few people in this country had any practical experience of.  In these circumstances, I think we would very speedily have had Deputy Dillon adding ships to beet, wheat and peat, in the litany of his objurgations.  I do not know either that, if we had taken all these risks in face of opposition, we would have any more thanks in the end of it all than we have got when, by our efforts, the country has been made wholly secure in regard to sugar, much better off in regard to wheat and perhaps not so badly off in regard to fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry, as I have stated, that my speech had to take this tone.  After all, the speeches of those who have to answer criticism are conditioned by the nature of the criticism.  This Government, which has been accused of ineptitude, this Government which Deputy Dillon has told us tried to sell a gold brick made of the clay of deceit to the people, this Government which the Deputy told us dealt with the petrol position first in a spirit of panic and then in a spirit of fraud, has been responsible for increasing the wheat acreage from 20,000, in 1932, to 300,000, in 1939-40.  It has been responsible for making this country independent in <Col N="1484" /> sugar supplies, independent in respect of an essential building material, cement, and virtually independent in regard to textiles; and the only inconvenience that our people have suffered through the whole course of the war, thanks to the organisation which the Minister for Supplies has built up, and the service he has rendered to the country, was that at Christmas, by reason of action outside our control, it was necessary for us to curtail supplies of petrol.</P>
    <P>I think, in the light of these circumstances, it would have been much better, if, instead of Deputy Dillon getting up and putting the debate on that line, he had followed the example of his leader, and dealt with the terms of the motion on the Order Paper, which asks us to indicate to the Dáil the probable future situation in regard to essential supplies and to indicate what steps are contemplated for their equitable distribution in the event of acute shortage developing.  Of course, if they had approached that, I presume they would have put to the people and to us their views as to how these problems should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the major responsibility is theirs; the major and primary responsibility in this matter undoubtedly is the responsibility of the Government and the Administration of the day.  However, those who are members of this House, particularly those who have the concomitant responsibility of helping us out with their suggestions and of criticising us where we go astray, ought to come here and say: &ldquo;This is how we think the petrol situation ought to be dealt with; this is how we think the problem of bread supplies had best be dealt with in the interests of everybody; and, having heard the statement by the Minister for Supplies in regard to tea, this is how we think the difficulties, which we understand exist, should be dealt with and remedied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that connection they would have had to take, perhaps, the responsibility of suggesting the rationing of certain commodities, or of outlining a scheme for such rationing, but those things <Col N="1485" /> could have been dealt with and discussed with us in a spirit of mutual helpfulness.  The Minister for Supplies, who has examined this question, might have been able to show how a scheme for the rationing of tea might have broken down and proved inadequate. The Minister for Supplies might have shown how difficult it would be to devise a workable scheme for rationing bread if, as God forbid, it should become necessary to contemplate the introduction of such a scheme.  He might have pointed out how we might eke out our bread supplies by supplies of other foodstuffs, and all this would have been of great public benefit.</P>
    <P>If the debate had been conducted in that tone and developed in that spirit, it would have been of much benefit and advantage to the country as a whole; but, as it developed yesterday, I do not think it served any purpose except to enable members on both sides of the House to score off each other.  Because we all love our country, I regret that very much indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were times, I confess, when my heart bled on account of the violence which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was doing to himself in making the kind of speech he has just made. Again and again he complained that that was not the kind of speech he would have liked to make: he would have liked to make a constructive speech.  He condemned&mdash;quite rightly &mdash;in the closing sentences the speeches from his side of the House, though he imagined that he was condemning those from this side of the House. Though there were a number of things he apparently could have told us, if, as he put it, Deputy Dillon had not spoken, instead of giving us this information he preferred to do violence to his feelings, to make the speech he did not wish to make, to go away from the terms of the motion&mdash;a reasonable motion as he confessed, and a helpful motion.  Instead of addressing himself in his hour-and-a-half speech to the motion, what did he do?  He indulged <Col N="1486" /> in cheap debating points that might be all right in an assembly of school boys, that might be pardonable at another period even in this Assembly, but for which there was no excuse to-day.</P>
      <P>I listened yesterday to the Minister for Supplies; I listened to-day to the Minister for Industry and Commerce; I listened all the time in the hope that I would get some information about the existing situation.  I listened all the time hoping I would get some indication of any plans which the Government had for the future.  Cast your mind back, Sir, over the two speeches which were made from the Government Front Bench.  Having heard those two speeches, could any reasonable man in this House believe that the country is faced with a serious situation?  We were accused of painting things in colours darker and blacker than there was any justification for painting them in&mdash;of creating panic.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to make any Party points on this particular matter.  It is too serious for that, but I put it to the House that we should be in a position, after two days' debate, to know whether there is a serious situation or not.  I put it to you, Sir, that, listening to the Minister for Supplies yesterday, nobody could believe that there was a serious situation.  If we are accused of creating panic, we can say it is because panic was created in ourselves by the Minister for Supplies and by speeches made throughout the country on his behalf.  There is a report in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of January 16th of a speech at, I think, Clonmel, where Mr. O'Connell, Chief Inspector of the Department, said that the Minister had asked him to tell them that &ldquo;nothing short of a desperate position existed in the country at present in regard to food supplies and that it might conceivably be placed in a much more desperate position in a year hence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to take the letter of the Minister for Industry and Commerce seriously, not merely in what it said but in what it implied?  If we are then how explain the attitude of the two Ministers who have addressed this <Col N="1487" /> House?  Faced with a situation of that kind presented to us by Ministers and on behalf of Ministers&mdash;by the Minister himself and there were other speeches throughout the country as well&mdash;we determined to give an opportunity to the Government to state frankly and fully what the situation was and particularly what plans they had as regards the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Supplies spoke before the speeches that were referred to by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who praised the only speech made prior to the Minister's intervention. The Minister for Supplies had his full opportunity after Deputy Cosgrave's speech to tell us the situation.  There is no use in alleging now, which is not, of course, the fact, that what his colleague said and did not say to the House was due to the tone of speeches made subsequent to his own.  Those subsequent speeches&mdash; which in reality were made in a vain effort to get information&mdash;are no excuse for his failing to do his duty yesterday before those speeches were made.  Possibly he will say that he knew what was going to be said, and with that prophetic mind which he has in all things except his own business as Minister he allowed the subsequent speeches to influence his own speech. What was the excuse for his speech yesterday?  Did it contain a single bit of information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a desperate situation, therefore, and I put it to the Minister that instead of making debating points, instead of scoffing and instead of the complete lack of information that we had displayed yesterday, it would be well that he should turn his attention to meet that situation.  I thoroughly agree with one thing the Minister said yesterday, that we cannot prophesy what is going to happen.  That is perfectly true.  He cannot nor can anybody else. He is bound to take the worst possible view and to plan for that.  If this debate could help the Government to take the view of looking ahead and of planning for these things, no matter what their inefficiencies may be in this House, I think we should have advanced a step forward.  If the Minister will allow me to say so, I cannot see any evidence of that in the two speeches I have listened to from the Ministerial Benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister hopes that rationing will not be necessary.  We all fully share that hope, but he &ldquo;might be compelled to bring it in&rdquo;.  It would be &ldquo;very distasteful to him to do it&rdquo; as it would be to the whole country. If a step of that kind has to be taken, I put it to the Minister&mdash;he himself has spoken of the possibility of it&mdash;now is the time to build up machinery so that it can be put in.  Circumstances which he cannot control, circumstances I will admit which nobody in this country can control&mdash;circumstances <Col N="1492" /> which the bulk of the country to a certain extent cannot control&mdash;may work against him, and rationing may be necessary in the case of different commodities.  Is there any preparation being made now so that, when the crisis arises, rationing can be put in? Is there a register even being compiled? I put that as a very serious matter to the Government&mdash;if they contemplate that at some time in the future rationing or other measures of a similar kind may be necessary.  I take that seriously, as I took the letter that the Minister sent out to all the country Deputies seriously, as well as the statement of Inspector O'Connell and, therefore, I say to him, now is the time to make preparations and not when the crisis is on us.  That is what on this matter I am most interested in, and that is why I have referred to certain things that have occurred in the immediate past.  I am afraid I see no evidence in the two speeches I listened to from the Government Front Benches, one yesterday and one to-day, to assuage my fears in any way. The Government are simply putting these necessary preparations on the long finger.  I should have thought that when the Minister stood up yesterday, after Deputy Cosgrave had moved and spoken to his motion, he would have seized the opportunity of giving a fully detailed statement on the whole situation, of what he feared, and still more that he would have told the House and the country the steps that he was going to take.  If the Minister were to read over his own speech he would see that there was not a single indication in it that measures of that kind were being taken.  He was going to propose rationing if it was necessary.</P>

      <P>For various food stuffs.  The Minister mentioned the rationing possibility himself and, from the point of view of the country, the appalling thing is the unwillingness of the Government to take the country fully into their confidence in matters of this kind and unwillingness to say whether they have any plans to meet the situation which they say may confront us.  I came in here yesterday with the very strong hope that the opportunity which was presented, and which by our motion was meant to be presented, to the Government to make a full statement and to elaborate, in fact, what the Minister himself had put in his letter would be seized avidly by the Minister, but the Minister made a speech yesterday which, I seriously put it to the House, did not contribute one iota to a clarification of the situation and which did not contribute anything in the way of information as to how the situation which may confront us in the future is to be met.  Deputy Maguire opened his speech yesterday with a very wise remark.  He suggested that the Opposition could not put up a Minister who could tell when a <Col N="1494" /> tanker could be sunk.  Of course, they could not, and nobody could, but as regards the petrol situation the Minister behaved as if he knew the tanker was going to come in.  He assumed that in this abnormal situation in the world, a certain normalcy, as the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would call it, had been established, that is, that there was a certain rule that you could go on, that nothing had happened in an abnormal situation along certain lines up to the present and that you could build for the future on the same assumption.</P>

We do not want &ldquo;miracle workers&rdquo;, as was suggested by his colleague, but we want workers, Ministers who can at least foresee certain contingencies and who need not wait until the month of November to fear what would occur, and then when, in the month of November, the seriousness of the situation dawned on the Minister he waits, with that serious problem of wheat-growing before him, until January to send out that letter.  It is quite typical.  Now the Minister complains&mdash;I gather that he did so yesterday and to-day his colleague does so&mdash; that there is storage for more petrol in the country and that it was not used, but the contingency of a sudden sinking could have been foreseen.</P>

I do not want any further displays of his spirit from the Minister.  I wanted to address myself seriously to this business as it confronts the country.  I did not want to swap crosstalk with the Minister, and I refuse to do it.  He waited until supplies were practically exhausted and then he suddenly comes down and dislocates the whole business of the country.

      <P>It is hard to be patient with the Minister.  If we were not convinced that he was equally inefficient as head of the Department of Supplies; if we were not convinced that he devotes as much attention to the work of that Department as he does to the business of this House, as indicated by his contribution yesterday; if we were not convinced that these things could be put on a level, we might be easier in our minds; but <Col N="1496" /> we are profoundly uneasy in our minds because there is no evidence of any real effort to grip the desperate position that is confronting us.  I see no plan, but I see only expressions of hope.</P>
      <P>I hope that, so far as the effort the Department is making to induce the country to grow more wheat, more foodstuffs, the country will respond to that effort.  I hope they will take the situation more seriously than Ministers are taking it.  I hope that, in the national interest, no effort will be spared to grow as much in this country as we possibly can in this crisis.  I hope that on the part of the people there will be that full co-operation, but I put it to the House that, in return, there ought to be certain co-operation with the country on the part of the Government.  We had no evidence of that, and I hope it is not too late to appeal to the Government to take this situation seriously, to set themselves down, and not wait until it is too late, to devise plans and machinery.  I do not want paper plans.  I want the actual machinery that will be ready to work when the crisis arises, as we have been told by the Minister that it may arise.  We have been told that a desperate situation confronts us and that a more desperate situation may confront us, and I appeal to the Government not to let things slip from week to week, and month to month, until the more desperate situation is upon us, but to set about the drawing up of plans and the getting ready of machinery now.</P>
      <P>I do not want, as I said, a paper plan.  A very respected friend of mine, coming from a particular part of the country, told me with regard to another matter:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have a splendid plan in this particular area.  Everything is worked out to the last detail, but, unfortunately, there is not a single man who knows exactly what he is going to do.  The plan, however, is perfect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want that.  That may be necessary as a preliminary, but I do want an effort now to get the machinery worked out and to get it as <Col N="1497" /> ready as possible to meet this contingency which is pointed out to us by the Government and by authorised spokesmen of the Government through the country.  I think it would be fair to the Government themselves and to the country if they took that matter seriously and if they ask the country to co-operate, if they ask farmers and others to make sacrifices in certain directions, which I hope the farmers will make, the Government, on their side, should make their contribution to that effort.  I was hoping that, as a result of the opportunity given to the Government by this motion, the country would be convinced of the necessity of making an effort, but I was also hoping that the country would get evidence from the Government that they were making a similar effort.  That has to do, to a certain extent, with the past. Let us turn to the future.</P>
    <P>Will the Government now try to do their part&mdash;every Department of Government?  If they are asking the country to do all these things, the example should come from the heads of the different Departments.  Leave aside the unfortunate speech we listened to to-day.  Leave aside the speech of the Minister which we listened to yesterday, and let the Government really make an effort.  No matter what lack of foresight they were guilty of in the past, they should not be incapable of making, at least, an effort to do something in the situation in which the country finds itself.  We have helped the Government in every way on the question of national defence. We have not discussed in the House the money required for defence, although we could have discussed it. We deliberately refrained from doing so.  We were fully alive to our responsibilities, but we think that the Government, on their side, should be alive to their responsibilities.  That is why I was so profoundly disappointed when listening to the Minister for Supplies yesterday.  I must say that the speech of his colleague to-day simply shocked me.  I admit that, at times, a person could not help being rather amused at it until one remembered that this is not a time to be amused <Col N="1498" /> at anything concerned with the essentials of the life of the people.</P>
    <P>I hope more foodstuffs will be forthcoming. It is quite true that in a situation such as that with which we are faced, it does not depend on the Government or on the people of this country whether or not ships come in here. The Government are now trying to get ships.  Leave aside the question as to whether this is the proper time to try to get ships and the lack of foresight which is involved in that.  Even if the Government got the ships, they could not guarantee that supplies would come in here.  No matter what flag the ships sail under, they come in under protection which we cannot give and which Great Britain gives.  Even with that protection, there is no guarantee that they can come in. Therefore, the country must make an effort.  When we look at what has happened in the last couple of months&mdash; that means what was not being done in the previous months&mdash;we are uneasy and we should like some spokesman from the Government side to indicate to the country and to the House some reason for hope.  I do not want the Government to paint a glowing picture. I want them to put before the country things as they are.  I cannot say that the Ministers who spoke to-day and yesterday did that.  I should like to have some indication from the Government that they were taking the situation seriously, and I hope it is not too late for some Minister to intervene in the debate and take up that particular line.  It is with that appeal for a proper facing of the situation that I conclude my remarks.  I put it to the House that the situation is much too serious&mdash;I may quote the words of a man speaking on behalf of the Minister and say: &ldquo;Too desperate&rdquo;&mdash;for the speeches we listened to yesterday from those responsible for the government of the country and for the maintenance of the normal life of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, which was expected to be of great service in disseminating information that the country needed, has not, in my opinion, come up to expectations, so far as the debate has proceeded.  There is no <Col N="1499" /> doubt that, from whatever cause, the bombshell of a shortage of petrol around Christmas has subsequently alarmed the country.  The matter has not been cleared up in this debate so far as it has gone.  Commodities so essential to the economic life of the country as petrol and kindred products should be provided for, since we cannot produce them at home, by storing ample supplies to carry us over some fixed period.  I accept the Government's statement that they cannot order or dictate the petrol position. But they should have made some provision by way of storage.  If they could not do that, the country should have known the position before what happened at Christmas took place.  What happened then was inevitable, judging by the small amount of information given here by Ministers.  The Minister did not tell us what storage accommodation there is.  He did not tell us whether, if that accommodation be inadequate, he is going to make it adequate for the future.  To-day, it has come out that the petrol companies dictated the petrol position to our Government and that the storage we had was not filled to capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the true position, it goes a long way to exonerating the Government. But the country should have known that before.  In one respect the Government cannot be exonerated.  It should have regulated its supply to consumers so that even if the worst happened, some reasonable notice could be given to petrol users so that they would not be left on the road as petrol users were left on this occasion. I think it is inexcusable that the sinking of a tanker should have such immediate effect.  I quite see that the Government could not prevent the sinking of the tanker.  It is a contingency of war which nobody can prevent. They cannot foresee, but they must regulate their office so as to allow for such a contingency.  That evidently was not done, and we have no assurance whatever for the future that petrol supplies will be any more certain than they have been.  We are not told what the storage accommodation here is.  We are not told why it <Col N="1500" /> has not been filled to capacity, if that is the true position.  Is it because we had not adequate credits in the petrol-producing countries to pay for it, or is it that we had to pay through Britain and that Britain had enough to do to look after her own supplies? I think, even now, the true position should be stated.  If that is not done what good is a guarantee now that essential services will get supplies of petrol, paraffin, kerosene, vaporising oils and lubricating oils?  How can we rely on that?  If steps are taken to produce all our foodstuffs for man and beast for the coming year, what guarantee have we that we can harvest them if we are depending on kerosene, paraffin and petrol to harvest them for us?  The situation is very serious. I think it should be taken with more seriousness than has been shown in the political debate that has gone on here yesterday and to-day.</P>
    <P>The other essential commodity is foodstuffs.  In view of the motion that is to follow I do not intend to go into the details in regard to foodstuffs now. We are equally concerned with providing foodstuffs for both man and beast. If we are unable to keep up our exports of live stock and live-stock products we will not have the money to buy petrol or the other things that must be imported.  Therefore, we have to produce the food for that live stock in order to keep up production.  We are told that no ships are available. The Minister for Supplies admitted yesterday a shortage of credits.  It has not been made clear whether it is the impossibility of getting ships or the shortage of credits to pay for those ships that is the real snag in the business. For the purposes of this discussion it does not matter which of them is the real cause.  I accept the statement from a responsible Minister that we must regulate our economy now and for the immediate, and perhaps the distant future, on the assumption that we will get no ships to bring foodstuffs to this country.  Therefore, we must ourselves produce them.  We have to produce food for both man and beast in order to keep up our exports.  It has not occurred, apparently, to the eloquent Minister for Industry and <Col N="1501" /> Commerce that in taking some of the offals and mixing it with the flour, he is reducing the supply of a very necessary and useful animal food.  If we are increasing human food we are doing so at the expense of animal food.  For those who perhaps are not so closely connected with the matter, this 70 per cent. extraction that has been spoken of means that out of roughly 100 tons of wheat 70 per cent. of flour was extracted prior to this crisis and, allowing for no waste&mdash;of course there is always a little waste&mdash;the remaining 30 per cent. came out in the form of bran and pollard that were not used for human food but were used for animal food.  That was the 70 per cent. extraction. Now I think we are on the 80 or 85 per cent. extraction which means that out of 100 tons of wheat, 80 or 85 per cent. of flour, neglecting waste, will be extracted and only 20 or 15 per cent. will be in the form of offals.  Therefore, we lose 20 or 15 per cent. of animal foodstuffs which, as I pointed out earlier, are absolutely necessary in order that we may keep up our exports.  Having no ships to import that food, we have to rely entirely on producing it here.  We are thrown back on our own resources. This debate should have concerned itself with how to utilise those resources in producing the food for man and beast which is necessary to enable us to live as a nation while we are so confined and besieged.  It should not have been used as an occasion for making political debating points.</P>
    <P>I frankly admit that the Government has done good national service by giving us a good jumping-off ground for increasing our wheat production to 100 per cent. of our requirements.  It is a good thing that we are in a position to start from the point where we are producing 50 per cent. of our requirements. It is a good start, but it seems to me that the Ministers who have spoken are confusing the issue.  They are afraid to face up to the real position. They are asking for a 100 per cent. production.  Do they mean it?  I do not think they do, because if they really want 100 per cent. production they can get it on terms.  Those terms <Col N="1502" /> are not dictated by selfish interest but by the immutable laws of economy.  If they face up to that position they will get it.  The Government want not only to throw back the pollard and bran into the bread that we eat, but they want to tell us that it is better bread than we have been eating.  A lunatic would not believe that.  If it is better than what we have been eating, why have we not got the better bread when it could be got more cheaply than the 70 per cent. extraction?</P>

      <P>The people of the country must be very foolish or the Government must not have looked after the interests of the poor if they have permitted a dear loaf to be handed out for the poor to consume instead of the cheap loaf which would contain more nourishment.  There is something wrong somewhere.  Those who can afford white bread buy it and use it everywhere, so there must be something to recommend it, and I take it that there is, notwithstanding what we are told by all those scientists who must have been hibernating up to now. They now come along and tell us: &ldquo;Better have black bread than this white bread.&rdquo;  I do not believe them, and the country does not believe them. I hope that the Minister for Agriculture or some Minister&mdash;it is more a matter for the Minister for Supplies&mdash; in fixing the amount of wheat that is <Col N="1503" /> required to be grown here, will say whether that is based upon the white loaf, the black loaf or the brown loaf. Different quantities will be required. Different areas will require to be put under cultivation.  Which is it?  We were told by the Minister for Supplies that we have plenty of sugar, and we have cement.  Why have we not timber so that we can work the cement?  Why have we not a store of petrol so that we can carry gravel to the building land that could be developed, as was foreshadowed in the Unemployment Act passed here before Christmas?  Now we have cement, a surplus of it.  Of course we have, because we have not the other commodities to use up the cement.  What will it cost to bring gravel now to the point of using up that cement?  The Government ought to know that the petrol position has thrown what we call the gravel men out of work, so that a surplus of cement really means that you have a surplus of that commodity because you have not enough of other commodities to use up the cement. That is really what it means.  I should be glad to hear Deputy Dockrell on this matter, as I do not think many of those who have spoken about it up to the present are in close, actual, practical touch with the economic life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the two Ministers who are here&mdash;they are farmers&mdash;what they would think if they were farming in a big way, and were in a hurry to get through with their work, but in the morning they heard no noise from their lorries or their tractors, and the men they were paying came up to them and said: &ldquo;Here, sir, we have no petrol. We have no paraffin?&rdquo;  What would they say?  Would they not say: &ldquo;Why are not the tanks full?&rdquo;  When the men replied: &ldquo;There is none in the tanks, and we have got none to put in them,&rdquo; would they not sack them? Is not that the position in which the nation found itself in relation to petrol?  When they expected to find the lorries ready, and everything buzzing, they found they had no petrol; the Minister for Supplies had shut it off.  Why was there not some margin <Col N="1504" /> of security in storage, so that we would have a week's supply or a fortnight's supply on hand?  The principle that applies to the simple workman&mdash;if he does not do his duty he is fired&mdash; should also apply to the Government if it does not do its duty.  The Government is here on trial now to explain that.  I have a perfectly open mind on this matter, but I would put it in that business way to the Minister.  As I said a moment ago, the statement made by the Minister&mdash;when the Minister makes a statement I accept it, as I have no means of contradicting it&mdash; that the petrol companies would not fill all the storage that was here, has gone a long way towards explaining the position to me.  If that is true, why did not the Minister tell the country that so that we would know the position?</P>
    <P>We have plenty of cottons and woollens.  I hope we have plenty of raw materials to keep the operatives going.  We have glass bottles, aluminium goods and tyres.  Yes; the position with regard to tyres has improved and is satisfactory, as I know from experience. Was it not frightfully bad business&mdash;I did not hear anybody touch on this&mdash;that around Christmas, when we were considering the retaxing of our cars for a year or six months or three months, this matter of a shortage of petrol should have arisen? Look at what it must cost the Government. After all, though wheat is an important matter and petrol is an important matter, I think to the Government that revenue is a still more important matter.  Look at the loss of revenue that will be occasioned through people who will say: &ldquo;Well, on account of this shortage of petrol I will not tax my car at all.&rdquo;  That reduces the petrol consumption.  Look at the loss of revenue on petrol tax, and, when we add to that the loss that must be occasioned on import duties, does it not create a very serious financial problem for the Government, and show the country that it is in a very serious situation?  I think that the question of the increased amount of wheat required to be raised in the coming year, and in future years while this situation lasts, was quibbled about to a <Col N="1505" /> great extent.  In the year just past we had about 300,000 acres of wheat.  Experience has shown that about a ton to the acre is the average yield.  From that, about 200,000 tons were delivered to the millers.  In order to put us in a position of safety for the coming year, the Minister for Agriculture, I think, has put the amount required at 700,000 acres, that is, an increase of 400,000 acres, and I think generally it is accepted that we want 500,000 tons of wheat for milling.  We will want 70,000 tons for seed to provide all the crop we want.  In the case of ordinary wheat, growing it indiscriminately, it might not be too much to say that you would utilise nearly 100,000 tons in order to clean it down to 70,000 tons of seed.  We can take it that we need to produce about 60 per cent. of our requirements in the coming year if we are to maintain the 70 or 75 per cent. extraction of flour.  The task for the coming year is to increase the area under wheat by 300,000 to 400,000 acres, or a yield of about 300,000 tons.</P>
    <P>There is no purpose served by Deputies getting up here or outside and making cheap points to the effect that the loaf must be no dearer or no cheaper.  It will be a question of getting it at a certain cost or going without it.  A Deputy here last night, speaking for a city constituency, said that the price of the loaf must not go up.  Let him tell his constituents that then they must eat black bread.  Let us have a clean, clear-cut issue on this. Are they going to accept barley meal or pollard or bran in their bread&mdash; sawdust, if you like?  If they want a good loaf in the altered circumstances they will have to pay for it.  We have started the year.  There is a little breathing space left.  Let us produce the loaf that the people require and that the people will pay for.  We cannot blow hot and cold.  We must make our plans.  The finger must not be turned against anybody and no person must say: &ldquo;There is the man who wanted to increase the cost of our loaf.&rdquo;  All that sort of thing is cheap tripe and it is not good enough for such a serious situation.  I do not want to go into the matter in greater detail because of the motion that is to follow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> A certain suggestion was made by a Deputy who will not face up to the situation.  After being told that no ships are available, he said that the way to meet the situation was to go to England or elsewhere and say: &ldquo;We want ten shiploads of wheat; will you bring it in for us?&rdquo;  When we know there are no ships available, there is only one way to fill up the wheat gap and that is to take off our coats, put the ploughs working and produce the wheat.  The man who produces wheat has to be paid for it.  We should settle the standard of the loaf that is required by the consuming public and a standard price should be put on it.  The public must be told: &ldquo;If that is what you want, it can be got, but there is a fixed price and will you pay it?&rdquo;  Let us make the bargain now.</P>
    <P>When Deputies demand that the amenities of certain constituencies with which they are not associated should be curtailed, they should first be asked if they have consulted those constituencies or even consulted the Deputies representing them or colleagues in their Party from those constituencies. I should like to know if Deputy Dillon consulted Deputy Dockrell when he suggested that buses plying to Dalkey should be curtailed.  I, as a Deputy living in that area, must protest against the ignorant intrusion of Deputy Dillon.  Dalkey is part of a borough which is the second city in Eire.  Dun Laoghaire Borough is larger than the City of Cork; it is not just one street like Drumcollogher, with the buses, trams and trains running up it. As was explained by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Dalkey is a big area and those buses go in and out through various streets.  This morning I came in by bus from that area.  One bus, which was filled, passed me.  I had to walk about a mile before I got another bus.  I thought of Deputy Dillon and prayed for him.</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting and useful if a full report of the oil refinery business at the North Wall was placed before the House, giving us information why it was heralded with such a sound of trumpets, how much money was spent on it, why it was dropped and why there is such hush-hush over <Col N="1507" /> it.  I have some information on the matter that I would not know if I did not happen to be a member of a certain board.  I am not going to give that information here because it is the Government's job to put it before the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, playing his usual role and giving his usual apologia, said in effect that anybody who raised any question about the present emergency was making the problem harder for the Government.  The Government must remember that there are people in the country who are equally concerned with its welfare as they are; there are people who have intelligence as well as they have, and those people should be consulted.</P>
    <P>It was the wish of many of us in the days from our boyhood up to manhood to bring to reality the old cry which we can still hear ringing in our ears&mdash; having our own Parliament in College Green.  We have not a Parliament in College Green but we have one at Leinster House, a Parliament that is scarcely ever summoned.  Why is it not summoned?  Why is it not in session every week in this emergency? Do the Ministers think they have a monopoly of the intelligence of the country?  I am glad to see the Minister for Agriculture addressing Committees of Agriculture.  I hope he is getting useful information there.  He gave an interesting address at a meeting of a Committee of Agriculture of which I am a member.  He was welcomed there and treated with the courtesy due to him and his office. Many people would like to know why this House is not in session every week in this emergency.  What were salaries all round increased for?  Is it because we were going to get longer holidays and we wanted more money to spend?</P>
    <P>Look at the position revealed by the Minister for Supplies.  He said that on the morning of Christmas Eve, if anybody had asked him what was the petrol position, he would have said &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;  That would have been his answer then, but if, on the evening of <Col N="1508" /> Christmas Eve, he were asked, the answer would be that it was all wrong. It is only the superior brains of Ministers that must know these things.  We, who are out working the country, are not to know that until we ring the bell at a petrol station and we are told there is none available.  Why does this House not meet more often?  To me it is inexplicable that it does not.  I am afraid that democracies, if this is called a democracy, are becoming more dictatorial than the dictatorships.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that to mention those matters is making the problem harder for the Government.  I think our best course is to mention those problems while there is yet time so that we can perhaps ward off their greatest impact. When black bread was first threatened, the Government organ said in a leader: &ldquo;Not at all; the Government have taken precautions and have plenty of supplies in.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce here to-day went a bit further and boasted that they had a six months' supply.  Of course, no man who really understands the position, would make such an empty boast because wheat cannot be produced in six months.  It is a ten, 11 or perhaps, a 12 months' crop so that, even banking 100 per cent. on the next harvest, we should have at least sufficient storage to carry us over a 12 months' period.  Even as a matter of business, why was not there more storage?  Twelve months ago, we could buy good milling wheat in the world's market at 12/- or 13/- per barrel.  That would hold good for milling for two years or perhaps longer.  I am not an expert in this but I know that it would hold good long enough for our purposes. Will similar wheat, if it is obtainable at all to-day, not cost anything up to £2 per barrel?  It cannot be got, however, because we have no shipping to bring it in.  Where was the foresight in storing supplies shown there?  Even as animal food, if you had wheat dumped all over the country, see what it would have been worth.  The Minister who boasted about six months' supply, in the case of wheat, only reveals his own ignorance and incompetence.  When I <Col N="1509" /> say that, it must not be taken as personal. Surely Ministers cannot laugh at that?  Can the Minister for Agriculture produce wheat in six months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is the 1st April he is talking about.  The 1st April occurs more than once a year for the Minister.  Surely the wheat combines were not operating as the petrol companies were operating and refusing to give us supplies?  Was not the position that all the wheat for which money could have been found, could have been bought 12 months ago for 12/- or 13/- per barrel?  Yet, there is not even a six months' supply now. We have to put barley into the flour we have, barley which is now worth 30/- a barrel, in order to carry us over until next harvest.  We have no margin of security at all, if there is anything like a failure in the harvest.  Suppose our supply of vaporising oils fails.  We are relying on our big farms for a wheat supply next year.  It must be tractor-produced and tractor-harvested. If the motor power for these tractors is not available, if kerosene or paraffin cannot be found, what provision is being made for the harvesting of this year's crop?  A new factory which made binder twine was started in Newbridge a few years ago but it was burned down.  Has it been replaced?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is more glad than I that it has been replaced.  Will the Minister for Supplies, when he has done talking&mdash;I shall wait for him&mdash; guarantee us all the parts for agricultural implements and all the spare parts for tractors?  I am not making a debating point; I am talking very seriously now even though some people may think it is a matter for fun.  Will <Col N="1510" /> the Minister be in a position to guarantee spare parts for all farm implements? If not, I would suggest that he should schedule the tractors for which he is able to provide parts so that we will be sure that when the harvest is ripe, we shall be able to utilise machinery to reap it.  Further, I understand labour battalions have been formed in the Army.  Suppose the worst happens; suppose we have a wet harvest, that the corn lies down, that we are not able to cut it with tractors or even mowing-machines, and that we have to use scythes and sickles.  Will the Minister give a guarantee that there will be sufficient scythes and sickles in the country?  Will he in consultation with the Minister for Defence see that this labour battalion in the Army will be trained to harvest the corn and that if necessary they will go out and harvest it?  The harvest must be saved and if it is a wet year, it will be very difficult to save it. Deputy O'Reilly raised a somewhat similar question in regard to Meath, whether the Minister would guarantee labour to save the harvest in Meath in districts that are very thinly populated. That is the point that worries certain farmers in isolated districts. It will affect the whole country if we have not sufficient skilled labour and primitive implements, such as scythes and sickles, to harvest our crops in the case of a bad harvest.</P>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister for Justice been consulted about taking special measures to protect the crops when growing?  After all, a field of wheat is of more importance to the defence of this country than, say, the &ldquo;Muirchú,&rdquo; the five-motor or torpedo boats, or even the Army.  Special protection should be afforded to all lands producing food during the coming year.  Trespass is treated very lightly by many district justices, and there should be a tightening up in regard to that.  Wheat lands especially should be protected.  It has been said here that we have artificial manures.  There are no artificial manures worth putting out available. There is no potash, for instance.  We might as well face up to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder have we all the seeds that are necessary?  What steps is the Minister <Col N="1511" /> for Agriculture taking to propagate agricultural and horticultural seeds?  He must be aware that there is a shortage of horticultural seeds&mdash;some cannot be got.  We have to a large extent to depend on our seed merchants for these.  Is the Minister for Supplies not aware that many of our seed merchants are left without seeds while big British houses are carrying on what you might call a retail trade here? There are a few pounds being paid in customs duty for packages coming in. Are the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Supplies not aware that many horticultural seeds were bought by the half-cwt. and are now selling in packets?  There is not sufficient of them to sell them by the ounce.  We do not raise these seeds here.  We have been talking about what we have been doing in regard to agriculture and horticulture, but is not this the position: that if we do not get in any of these seeds from England we cannot grow anything?  We have nothing to sow only what we get in from abroad after all the millions that have been spent on our Department of Agriculture.  Is not that the position? I defy contradiction of that statement.</P>
    <P>Even at this late hour I think the Albert College should be put to work at propagating seeds.  Is there not a definite danger of a shortage in the mangold crop this year owing to that? Is not the turnip crop in danger also? Some seeds are coming from America. They are not here and cannot be got in Europe.  I would be glad to be contradicted authoritatively by the Minister as to that, but I would want proof with that contradiction because I have been in the closest touch with seed merchants and I am very intimately interested in getting these seeds.  That matter is very relevant to this motion.  There is hardly anything more essential than seeds for food production. It is very important to know what provision has been made for our seeds.  There is no use in trying to fix a price for a product for which there is insufficient seed.  The price of onions went up to £60 and £70 a ton because a year ago you could not buy onion seed.  I wanted 1 cwt. of seed but I could not get an ounce.  I could not <Col N="1512" /> get carrot or parsnip seed to buy.  By accident I picked up some from a friend.  But I could not get it from any merchant in the City of Dublin. The position with regard to seeds is alarming.  Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that in an agricultural country like this we do not raise agricultural seeds?  I think I am right in saying that all the sugar factories will be idle if we do not get imported beet seed.  Is not that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel about the whole discussion is that it lacked sincerity and that there has been a good deal of unreality about it.  I was rather surprised at Deputy Belton making the statement that we were going to have no beet seed for next year instead of making inquiries before he made such a statement.  Such statements are not very helpful.  I listened to the Minister for Supplies yesterday and I was very dissatisfied with the complacent and happy way in which he seemed to take the position as it is to-day in this country.  The only thing Deputy Dillon put up after a speech of an hour and ten minutes was that we should ask the British Government to give us ten cargoes of wheat to help us out in this <Col N="1513" /> crisis.  I also listened to Deputy Costello last night and his worry was about the income-tax payers.  Having some knowledge of the position in Cork City and County, I am afraid it has not been dealt with as it deserves to be either by the Minister for Supplies or the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking for just over an hour, and all he was trying to do was to score political points over the Opposition, just as they were trying to score political points for the time they were speaking.  Now, while the Minister for Agriculture is here in the House, I want to deal, first of all, with the question of plots to be given to the unemployed throughout the country, and I would appeal to him to try to remove all the barriers that are standing in the way at the moment of getting plots for the unemployed and those who are anxious to till and produce food.  We have cases of people demanding over £6 an acre for plots, and in the City of Cork a number of men have been looking for plots and cannot get them under 21/- a plot.  During the past week or the past fortnight I have had widows coming to me asking that plots be allotted to them.  They have made application for them and my information, on Tuesday last, was that they were refused because they were not qualified.  These widows have boys of 15, 16 and 17 years of age who are unemployed and who are dependent children.  Many of these widows to whom I am referring know a good deal about gardening and farming themselves; they have these dependent children, and they think that they should be able to get plots if they want them.  I think that the Minister should make a real effort to make things easy for people like these, who are anxious to help and to produce food.</P>
      <P>I have also in mind, in this connection, country towns and villages where there is no local authority, and I think that the unemployed in these villages and towns should also be given land quite adjacent to where they live in these country towns and villages so as to enable them to produce food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> One of the things that I regret Deputy Cosgrave, who is responsible for this motion, did not touch upon is the question of shipping.  The Minister for Supplies passed it over very lightly yesterday, saying that we were negotiating for ships.  I want to say to the Minister for Supplies that I would expect more sincerity and more honesty about the question of shipping here than merely to say to us, in 1941, that you are negotiating for the purchase of ships.  I should be rather interested to hear the Minister telling this House what genuine efforts were made in 1939 or 1940, or even what genuine efforts are being made now to get ships.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said a while ago that even if we were able to buy ships it would not rectify the position.  First, he said that we could get no crews.  That was a rather interesting thing to hear, when in the whole of the County Cork and the City of Cork&mdash;West Cork and so on&mdash;there are hundreds and hundreds of men going across to England and joining ships to bring cargoes across the seas of the world.  Secondly, the Minister said that even if we bought the ships we had no assurance that they would be kept afloat on the seas.  Have any of our ships that have been flying the flag of Eire been attacked or sunk by any of the belligerents so far?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

I think it is wrong to say that any belligerent country would attack our ships.</P>

I also have information that ships were coming to this country, one flying the Irish flag and another flying the flag of another country, and that the ship with the Irish flag was let pass and not attacked, while the other ship was attacked.  I have information that there were two trawlers involved in a bombing raid and that the Irish trawler was not bombed.  Furthermore, I should like to know from the Minister for Supplies whether or not he is aware that, as early as 1939, members of this Party approached the Taoiseach with a view to getting at least a dozen ships or more, having some realisation or vision that ships were of such vital importance to this country?  Anybody who takes a natural interest in the shipping world at all&mdash; and perhaps, from my contact with shipping for the last 22 years, I am more interested in what has happened and what is happening&mdash;must know what is the actual case.  The Minister, and those who went before him, must know that several attempts have been made during the last 17 years to establish an Irish mercantile marine in this country to make contact with the Continent and with America, and that every attempt was crushed by vested interests.  He knows that, in May of last year, America had some ships for sale, but what attempt did the Minister or his Government make to buy any of these ships from America?  Having regard to our great influence there, what effort was made to secure six or eight of these ships for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the position of Cork. Yesterday we were told that we should <Col N="1516" /> be grateful that the position is not worse than it is.  I am going to say to the Minister that he has made no genuine, honest effort to get shipping, and no encouragement for the people who are interested in getting shipping into this country, or inclined or anxious to have a mercantile marine established for this country.  I am suggesting to the Minister, and to those who are responsible for the Government, that they were more inclined to take dictation from the vested interests of shipping rather than from the people of this country who would be willing and anxious to establish shipping here. In May of 1940, the British bought up to 200 ships and trawlers from America, and anybody who wants to interest himself in shipping affairs can find that they bought about 19 ships there at an average cost of £43,000 per ship.  For Cork, I can say that, over nine months of last year, from January to September, we paid £923,000 for foreign ships to bring grain into the port of Cork; yet 19 ships could be bought in America at £43,000 per ship, a total of about £960,000 for the whole lot; and yet this country, with a Minister for Supplies and a Minister for Industry, has done nothing since.  The Minister knows, as well as I know, that on the 11th of this month there were other ships for sale in America. I want to know&mdash;and I hope the Minister will tell us&mdash;who are the people he has been consulting and who are the people he is relying upon to start a mercantile marine for this country?  It was said yesterday that we were trying to get ships if we could raise the wind, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us to-day that the risk would mean millions.  It would be interesting to know how many millions were lost to this country during the financial crisis of 1931.  We have heard nothing about that.  How many millions are being blasted into the air at the moment that will be never heard about?  That is happening during the present crisis and nobody mentions it.  Yet we are afraid to risk £1,000,000 or even £2,000,000 in order to get ships, not so much for the present crisis, but, as Deputy Maguire <Col N="1517" /> said yesterday, in order to enable us to plan for our future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton remarked a while ago: What about timber?  As regards the building trade in the City of Cork we are practically standing idle at the moment because we have not supplies for building.  There are 10,000 standards of timber at a certain port waiting to be brought here but shipping cannot be got.  I know also where there are another 10,000 tons awaiting shipment to Ireland from a neutral country, and when a ship was got to bring it here certain shipping interests on the other side came along and said: &ldquo;No, you cannot get that ship.  We will take control of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say that the speech that impressed me in the debate yesterday was that made by Deputy Maguire, in which he asked for information as to what we were doing to plan for the future and what would be the position here after the war.  Does the Minister seriously suggest that 1941 is the time to talk about getting ships for this country?  I saw an announcement that a Departmental Committee was to be set up to deal with the question. Would the Minister tell the House who was responsible for that committee and who are the members of it?  Have they any financial interest in shipping that is controlled outside Ireland?  Does he suggest that managers of shipping companies with head offices outside Ireland are going to advise him that this country should have ships of its own?  I discussed this matter with people such as the Minister has in mind.  It is not a financial proposition.  While we can broadcast to America and broadcast to our own people the fact is that we are helpless because we cannot get ships.  Deputy Keyes pointed out yesterday that there were two ships in the Shannon for the past seven or eight months with cargoes of phosphates.  I understand that there are seven ships in the Port of Dublin.  Is it suggested that something could not be done by a neutral country such as this to negotiate the buying of eight or ten ships?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister in all seriousness that if a Departmental <Col N="1518" /> Committee is to be set up he should be able to assure the House that the people on that committee are anxious to procure ships that will serve this country independent of outside influence. I am not satisfied that that has been done up to the present.  I know that men who have gone into the shipping business and established direct services between France, Belgium and other places after some months were pushed out by big financial interests. I know people who established direct trading relations with Spain and France who were eventually bought over.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the position in Norway and Greece.  Here with all our patriotism and pioneering we have not been able to buy a dozen ships for our trade.  I suggest to the Government that if the shipping question was tackled our position regarding supplies would not be so serious.  Even if we lost some ships, is it not better to go down fighting than to be in the present powerless position?  I know of a schooner that was to bring a small cargo to Cork and it was commandeered by the British Ministry of Shipping. They said that they wanted it for their own use.</P>
    <P>I am aware that large numbers of people at present are worried because raw material for industries cannot be got.  I suggest to the Minister that a serious attempt has not been made to get ships to bring raw materials to keep our industries going, especially in view of the people he has around him and from whom he accepts advice.  I saw in the newspapers recently that a certain organisation had sent a memorandum to the Government and had appointed two gentlemen to supplement it, one of these being manager of a shipping company that trades with the Continent and elsewhere.  Does the Minister seriously suggest that that gentleman would advocate the purchase of a dozen ships to bring cargoes from elsewhere?  Is there any reason why the Government should not send some responsible man to America to negotiate the sale of six or 12 ships to bring requirements to this country?</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why there should <Col N="1519" /> not be negotiations with Spain from which ships at one time regularly traded with Cork, bringing phosphates and other things?  I have noticed that a couple of companies are still anxious to have direct shipping with Ireland if there was any kind of co-operation on the part of the Government.  The Minister and his colleagues know that there are interests in this country anxious to establish such services, and if he is going to set up any committee he should have on it men who are interested in the shipping trade here.</P>
    <P>Coming to Deputy Cosgrave's motion I notice that one of the things mentioned in it is the equitable distribution of supplies.  I was wondering if we were going to have some reality in this debate about supplies. In order to bring some reality into the discussion I should like to point to a typical case concerning the food supplies of thousands of people at the present time.  I am referring now to the weekly supply of food for a man, his wife, and five children, whose ages are 12, nine, seven, five and two years, the maximum income being 23/- a week from unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There are many families who have not the same resources.  As it is necessary to come down to facts in face of the emergency that faces us this is the position.  On the 2nd January this man's wife bought 1½ pairs of bread at 1/4½d.; 2 lbs. of sugar, 9½d.; ¼ lb. tea, 7d.; 1 pint milk, 2½d.: 3lbs. potatoes, 3d.; meat, 6d.; onions, 1d.; ¼-lb. margarine, 4d.; making 4/1½d. for the day.  On January 3rd, the family had 1½ pairs of bread at 1/4½d.; a pint of milk, 2½d.; 3 lbs. potatoes, 3d. On January 4th they had 3 pairs of bread, 2/9d.; ½-lb. of margarine, 8d.; 6 lbs. potatoes, 6d.; 1 pint of milk, 2½.; meat, 6d.; onions, 1d.; 2lbs. sugar, 9½d.; ¼-lb. tea, 7d.  On the 5th January she bought 1 pint of milk, 2½d. On 6th January she bought 1½ pairs of bread, 1/4½d.; ¼-lb. margarine, 4d.; 1 pint milk, 2½d.  On January 7th she bought 1½ pairs of bread, 1/4½d.; 1 pint milk, 2½d.; 3 lbs. potatoes, 3d.; onions, 1d.; 1 lb. sugar, 4½d.; 2 ozs. tea, 4d.  On 8th January she purchased <Col N="1520" /> 1½ pairs of bread, 1/4½d.; 1 pint milk, 2½.; 3 pecks coal, 2/9d.; parafin oil, 10d.; soap, 3d.  The rent for one divided room was 4/-.  The total spent on food for the week for seven persons was 18/4½d. or 2/7½d. per person or 1½d. per meal.  That makes a total of 26/2½d. to take to a shop alongside, where they already had gone into a debit of £4.  That man and his wife and five children were paying 1/2d. insurance and it has lapsed.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Supplies and the Government as a whole and every member of this House to try to come down to our real position about food supplies.  In that figure there is no talk about clothes or boots; no bacon and eggs, no school books, no recreation, no penny for Church or anything else.  All he could pay for the seven persons for the week in food was 18/4½d.  Those are the things to which this House should address itself.  As someone said the other day, we want to see parliamentary institutions functioning. I want to see parliamentary institutions such as this functioning and the people in this country showing to the world that we are prepared to function, and I say that while there are thousands living in this way here we do not deserve to function.  I say it is foolish and it is not safe and I deprecate the statements which have been made by Deputies, scoring points across the House, while that position remains, while we have thousands starving.  These are the things to which we should address ourselves and I say to the Minister that the best thing for him and for the Government to do is to take the people into their confidence at a time like the present, when I know that there are people dying of hunger in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hickey has said that he wants to see parliamentary institutions functioning in this country.  If they are to function successfully we need not only a sensible Government but a sensible Opposition.  Now, a sensible Opposition must have more than hindsight: we can all be very wise after the event. We need a little bit of foresight.  Whoever <Col N="1521" /> is responsible for it&mdash;whether it is the Government or the Opposition or the people as a whole&mdash;we are in a difficult situation at the moment and our object should be to try to get our people out of this situation safely and have, if possible, a better standard of life and a higher culture at the end of that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, but I say that that object will not be achieved by having a lot of people with perfect hindsight, that we need to face the situation and see how best we are going to get out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If I wished to go into the past and into the merits of the various oppositions, that would be another story, and I do not wish to do it at the moment.  We are in a situation where we find that there is a shortage of some of what are called essential supplies in order that we may have the normal standard of life and fair comfort. God has given us certain resources and given us brains to use them.  Deputy Belton talked about wheat and bread and Deputy Hickey talked about ships, and Deputy Belton did not know that we were producing within the country the best seed that is necessary for next year's crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Only this year we have it.  I always advocated it in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>For quite a number of years we have produced it in certain quantities.  Let us take beet as an example.  To begin with, a certain amount of beet seed was produced last year and the year before.  There are two or three ways of sowing beet.  We can sow it in the flaitheamhlach way by laying a thread of it along and then later on destroying eleven-twelfths of that in the thinning, or we can take a lb. of seed and dibble it into the holes and do 12 acres for the one in the normal way of sowing.  If it is necessary <Col N="1522" /> to utilise our resources in that way, that is how we can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same with a lot of other things.  In this situation we may have to change our gait.  We may have to put more human energy and brains into conserving the resources we have and build up other resources. We have within the country at the moment, I understand, sufficient beet seed to sow our normal acreage for our full requirements in the normal way.  If we happen to be short of turnip or mangold seed we can sow practically the whole of the acreage with beet if we conserve it properly.  The Opposition, the Government and the people should try to find out what our resources are and put our brains to deciding how to use those resources in this situation rather than to saying what should have been done in the past.</P>
      <P>On the question of bread, Deputy Belton has used a phrase&mdash;and I understand that other Deputies have used it, too&mdash;which is designed to condemn the Government before the eyes of the people: &ldquo;black bread&rdquo;.  It is well known, it is a proved fact, that wholemeal brown bread is much better for the health of the people than the kind of bread we have been eating for a number of years.  White bread is a diluted bread&mdash;it is bad bread.</P>

I will say this much: if the people of this country, in order to get over this situation, have to eat brown bread, we should, from the health point of view, be glad that that is so, and from the ordinary point of view of a sensible Government, with a sensible Opposition, we should not be trying to make that a point against the Government.

      <P>I might just say, then, on the question of price, that I am just as much in favour of the farmers getting a price that will pay them as anyone else, but I do not think anybody in the Opposition or in the Government should try to organise farmers into having a strike, against the nation's interests.  As a member of the Government, and as a member of the public, I am prepared to support the plea that the farmers of this country should get a fair price that will enable them to grow wheat at a fair profit.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy wait for a minute?  Ships in the present situation might be an ease to us, but we can get out of the situation without ships.  That is my opinion.  Deputy Hickey will have to realise, whether he likes it or not, that this is a blockaded area.  The Government has been officially informed, the people have been officially informed and the Dáil has been officially informed by the Government that such a communication has reached us, so that if we had all the ships in the world at our command we cannot guarantee that the wheat that is in neutral countries will arrive here.  Take this matter of ships. Supposing we had the 30, 40, 50 or 100 ships that would be necessary for us, we are not going to get them for nothing at the moment.</P>

I am prepared to go this far with Deputy Belton, that I would much prefer to give an extra price to our farmers to grow wheat for us or to produce the other things that we require rather than stick too much money into ships in order to ease the present situation.  That is not the proper policy to meet the present situation or to meet future situations, because if this country is to go ahead and survive, if we are to raise the standard of life amongst our people, then we should try to utilise all the country's resources and all its brains in order to produce here, where we can <Col N="1525" /> control them in all circumstances, the things that the people need.</P>

      <P>Why then grouse about this thing?  If there is a shortage of human food of a kind that the people have been accustomed to&mdash;like bread&mdash; the cutting-off of which would cause a great social disruption, why grumble about taking 15 or 20 per cent. extra from the wheat and using it for feeding the people directly, instead of putting it through animals in order to get another kind of human food for the people?</P>

It seemed to me that he was objecting to this question of not extracting <Col N="1526" /> enough bran and pollard from the wheat in order to feed animals.  I have not the exact figures before me, but I can say this that, on the average, it takes 6 cwt. of grain to make 1 cwt. of bacon or beef, so that if we happened to be short of food it would be the height of foolishness to put 6 cwt. of good life sustaining grain into a bullock or into a pig in order to get a hundred-weight of a life sustaining product in the form of beef or bacon.</P>

      <P>Might I explain?  I said that we should plan to grow sufficient wheat to give us flour of the old extraction, and that we were not saving by taking from the wheat food that we require for animals.  If, however, the choice is: are we to go short of bread rather than save pollard and bran for animal feeding?  then by all means put it into flour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely at one with Deputy Belton if he says that our policy should be to grow in the coming year all the cereals that are required in order to feed both man and beast&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with that, and I believe it can be done.  Nobody here says that it is impossible this year to double our wheat production.  We can point back to this, that every year during the last ten years the production of wheat was more than doubled. Deputy Belton said it was a good thing that we are in this lucky position that we are able to start off from a vantage point of 50 per cent. instead of the .001 position we were in some years ago. It is easy to double any effort, but it is a very difficult thing to increase any effort a hundredfold.  As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, we are in this situation now that we had almost 2,000,000 acres of tillage.  At the beginning of the war we wanted another 1,000,000 acres to keep man and beast. We increased our tillage by about 300,000 acres last year, and only another bit of effort is required to get <Col N="1527" /> the additional 700,000 acres this year. If that effort is made it will put us on top, and we will be able to feed both human beings and animals in the way that we have been accustomed to feed them in the past.  Even if we did arrive at that situation, I would still disagree with the policy of extracting the good things from the wheat in order to give the snowy-white loaf.  I know it is a hard thing to change the habits of the people.  It would be much easier to change a Government than to put the people off white bread.  I once tried to bring about the change in the Army.  I did my best to try to introduce brown bread.  The change was not very popular, and I had to give it up.  All the doctors in the world will tell you that if the people were sensible they would eat the wholemeal bread because it is the best bread.  Both the Government and the Opposition should see that a proper propaganda campaign was inaugurated for the more extensive use of brown bread.  I would like to see all Parties joining together in a propaganda for a sensible approach to life, and I would appeal to the Opposition for help and co-operation in this.  As anyone looking down on us from the skies can see, we are all Irish in this body, as we proved recently.</P>
      <P>Let us be practical in these things. Let us be Irish patriots in a practical way and co-operate in a proper campaign&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Independent&mdash;in order to get our farmers to produce every ounce of feeding stuff that we require for man and beast, and when we have the products, let us make the best use of them.  Personally, I have a bias in favour of brown bread because I want to see a healthy population in this country, and I am in the strong position that practically every doctor to whom I have spoken on the matter admits that it is the proper food and would proclaim it as such.  We should have no hesitation in saying to the people that if the present war situation forces us to have whole-meal bread for everybody, it is one of the advantages to be garnered from this appalling situation in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, we come to the question of petrol and I must say this, that if the <Col N="1528" /> people of this country got proper warning that petrol was going to be cut off, I personally would welcome such an announcement, because I believe that we can exchange our goods between ourselves, that we can take whatever goods we want from the ports and distribute them through the country, that we can bring to the ports whatever goods we can send out, that we can visit each other and do everything we want to do without one drop of petrol.  It is seven or eight years since I started a series of experiments in the Army for the substitution of producer gas for petrol. The experiment was in all respects successful. We took it one step further and instead of doing it on anthracite, we did it on turf charcoal and, for years, that Army lorry has been working on turf charcoal.  I am prepared to admit that, for the ordinary person, who wants to go clean from his house to his office or anywhere else, it is easier to pull up at a gas station and fill up with ordinary petrol, stick his foot on the starter and go off.  That is a very easy thing to do.  In order to work the producer gas, it is necessary to light a fire, but when your fire is lit, you can do it with a blower, or, if you have a drop of petrol, you can work, first, on petrol and then switch to producer gas in five minutes.  It can, however, be done without a drop of petrol, and the apparatus for it is something which any normal average man who has been driving a truck or motor car could learn to work inside a couple of hours.</P>
    <P>Let us realise this: that, for whatever reason, we are now facing a shortage of petrol, and if we want to keep our internal combustion transport on the road, we can do it if we are prepared to make the little sacrifice of getting these gazogenes made and put on our cars and lorries.  It will have this effect: that the person whose livelihood does not really depend upon automobile transport will put his car up and forget about it; but the man who wants to get around, who has a job to do at the end of the road, will not think it too much to take the trouble of lighting his gazogene.  The Minister for Supplies made his case in this matter, and I think his case is completely <Col N="1529" /> and absolutely water-tight.  We have no apologies to make with regard to the question of petrol, but if we want to use our foresight and our brains to get out of this situation in a better way than that in which we got into it, instead of grousing about a shortage of petrol, we should utilise our resources and use the substitute for petrol which is available and which has been proved to be available.  I hope that the firms which had the initiative to start off with the manufacture of these gazogenes will do well, and that others will go into the business.  If they did so, there would be more people&mdash;twice as many&mdash;employed in making these things, in making turf coke and digging out the coal necessary to keep these things going than were ever employed in the distribution of petrol in this country.  Another thing about it is that it is cheap.  We have proved in the Army that one stone of turf coke produced for threepence or fourpence will substitute for one gallon of petrol&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not; it is what this whole debate should be about&mdash;how we are going to get supplies and produce within the country, substitutes for supplies we ordinarily import.  I hope that, for the coming few months, we will co-operate here as a body of one mind, that is, to bring the people through this situation as best we can, and to raise their standard of life, and to co-operate, first, on getting the food produced within the country.  I believe that the farmers should be asked to do it and should get a profitable price, as I believe they are getting; but I would say this to Deputy Belton, that even if the Government were mean enough to deny farmers a proper price for their wheat, even if they offered them 25/-, the farmers of the country should be patriotic enough to utilise the land of <Col N="1530" /> the country in order to produce food for the people as a whole.</P>

      <P>I know they have not, and the fact is that last autumn they sowed from at least 250,000 to 300,000 acres of winter wheat on the basis of a very much lower price than that which they have been offered recently.  The price was increased after the wheat went into the ground.  The farmers of this country on all occasions have been prepared to do their patriotic duty and all I want to do is to ask the Opposition and other Deputies, members of the Government and members on the Government benches, to encourage the farmers to produce, now that they are offered a fair price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into it any further.  The Deputy can talk about it on his own motion.  I want to get my bar in as the Deputy got his in. I am convinced that if we approach our present difficulties in a constructive manner and do not have all this grousing about what could have happened in the past, it would be in the interests of the country.  Mind you, the people who would come best out of that would be the Government, but, at any rate, let us take a pledge that we will not continue on that line, but will face the situation constructively and see that we will produce here out of our own resources everything we can in order to give our people a fair standard of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other matter I want to refer to.  There is a lot of bunk talked about efficiency and about prices.  That has been so in the past and I am sure it will happen in the future, and I would warn anybody against saying in future that we must not produce such and such an article because it is going to cost 1 per cent., 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. more than the price at which we could get it from abroad.  We have to consider the total national efficiency.  We are in this situation, that we have 100,000 idle who cannot get work and we have, I reckon, <Col N="1531" /> another 500,000 people who are either semi-idle or mis-employed from a rational point of view.  In such circumstances, all this chat about saving a little bit of labour or saving a little bit of money on the production of articles is simply bunk.</P>
    <P>We should set ourselves to produce everything we can produce and, as long as our supply of labour and brains is there, we should not hesitate to undertake the production of anything, even though it were to cost, according to the ordinary accounting system, 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 100 per cent. or 200 per cent. more than the price at which we could get a similar product from abroad.  In the present situation, even if we could get Chinese bacon at 6d. per cwt., it would be of little use to us. We should, as long as our supply of labour holds out, go ahead with the building up of everything in the country and with the production of everything we want, so far as that is possible. After all, what are we here for?  The Lord did not intend that we should be put here to make boots a halfpenny a pair cheaper than they are made in China or anywhere else.  We have to pass through and, when we get clothes and boots and food and a fair education, that is all we want.  People in the future should not speak against the production of wheat here because it will cost a few shillings more than it would cost if brought in here from elsewhere.  Neither should they do that in regard to cement, glass-bottles or anything else.  The farmers should be organised to produce all they require and all that the people require and the people in the towns should be organised to produce all the industrial products which they and the farmers need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go back on that but, in the future, we should not be splitting hairs so far as the price here is concerned as compared with the price elsewhere.  We should not say that we are lowering the standard of anybody in the towns or in the country because they have to pay a little more for Irish-produced goods than they <Col N="1532" /> would have to pay if the goods were obtained from elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements and broadcasts of Ministers within the last few weeks, culminating in the now famous letter of the Minister for Supplies to Deputies, resulted in our Party putting down this motion and in Parliament being called together for the purpose of considering it.  This debate will have served a very useful purpose if it will make clear to the people what our position is, whether that position be good or bad, remove the confusion and allay the panic in the public mind as a result of the Government, deliberately or otherwise, refraining from giving full and honest information with regard to the existing and future supply of food and other essential commodities. I am glad that we have been called here for the purpose of reviewing the whole situation, and I join with other Deputies who have referred to the necessity for Parliament meeting much oftener than it does.  In the very serious times we are passing through, it is absolutely essential that the people should be consulted regarding whatever plans are being made by the Government for the future and that we should come here to discuss and criticise these plans and suggest anything that we think should be done in the national interest.  We talk about the preservation of democratic institutions and of democratic government, but the action of the Taoiseach and of the Government in recent months is bringing the Parliament of the people into disrepute.  We are aware that there is a feeling antagonistic to this institution at present.  If that is permitted to grow, it will be the responsibility of certain parliamentarians in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce waxed indignant at what he considered was a grossly unfair attack by the Opposition with regard to the petrol position.  I have no ambition to score any political victory over the Government or anybody else but I suggest that, if the manager of any business were responsible for the bungling done by the Department of Supplies in handling the petrol situation in the past few weeks, he would <Col N="1533" /> be immediately &ldquo;sacked&rdquo;.  If it happened in any other country in the world, the Minister would have to hand in his resignation.  In discussing a matter of this sort, we must always bear in mind that there is a vast amount of information at the disposal of the Minister.  As regards petrol, he has daily contact with the petrol and shipping companies and has continuous information from outside.  That puts the Government in a better position to lay plans regarding that essential commodity than the man in the street is in.  We are entitled to be very severe in our criticism because the Government are in a better position to foresee difficulties, dangers and shortages than the ordinary man who has not that information available to him. The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked if we wanted the Government to take precautions earlier and reduce the amount of petrol available to consumers rather than do what they did&mdash;let the petrol situation remain until a crisis had developed and a complete close-down was necessary.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of our case.  I presume that the Minister for Supplies gets, every few days, information from the petrol companies as to the exact supply in the country.  We have been asked to be constructive.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in a rather jocose way, tried to make a skit at the expense of this Party, asking if we expected the Government to get a wireless message that a ship was about to be put down and to make their arrangements accordingly.  We all know that no such notice is given, but so many ships are going under at present that we expect the Government to know that any ship at sea is liable to go down, and they should not be banking up to the last moment on a particular ship arriving.  In other words there ought to be a critical level as far as petrol supplies are concerned, and when we reached that level the value of the coupon should have been reduced. At the present time it is reduced, drastically reduced, to one-fourth of the original value.  We suggest that if that level was reached early in December the coupon should have <Col N="1534" /> been reduced to some extent.  At all events, the value of the over-stamping should have been removed first and the value of the coupon generally should have been reduced at least to one-half before the situation that did develop was allowed to develop.  What actually happened?  We were pursuing our normal life in this country as far as transport was concerned without any warning from the Minister or the Department, and quite suddenly there was a complete stoppage; a crisis developed in a few hours and the whole transport of the country was completely dislocated because petrol supplies were cut off.  People who were away from home were left stranded down the country without any warning.  Is it suggested that that was the proper course to pursue? If the supply was low a week or a fortnight earlier the value of the coupon should have been reduced to some extent.  I know for a positive fact that there was no anticipation by the Department of Supplies of a crisis occurring.  The Minister even admitted it here.  People were actually getting extra coupons a week before the crisis occurred.  There is no such thing as a critical level or any particular reserve earmarked so that when we reach that level of reserve we are going to reduce the ration.  It is absolutely essential that that level ought to be determined. What I call a &ldquo;critical line&rdquo; ought to be determined and, when we reach that, the reduction in the ration ought to take place immediately.  In face of the present situation the Minister came in here yesterday in his usual brazen style to try to bluff it out in this House. Deputies are inclined to resent very much the attitude of the Minister for Supplies.</P>
    <P>The question of storage has been raised.  It has been suggested, and I suggest again, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that provision should have been made to accommodate a reserve supply of petrol here.  Apart altogether from the fact which is denied by the Government that proposals were put up to provide extra storage here some time ago&mdash;leaving that aside altogether&mdash;it should have been the business and responsibility of the Government and particularly of the Minister for Supplies to arrange for <Col N="1535" /> that storage, to see what could be done as regards providing extra storage. What attempt did the Minister for Supplies make in that regard?  As far as I am aware, none whatever.  As a matter of fact, there was quite an amount of storage in the country that was not availed of at all at any time. There are many small garages down the country, that have two or three tanks, owned by men in a small way who are unable to finance heavy purchases of petrol, who never filled those extra tanks at any time.  They could only buy 200 gallons at a time. That went into one pump.  I know plenty of men who had three pumps, which meant that they had storage capacity for 1,000 gallons of petrol or even more.  They were never able to buy more than a couple of hundred gallons and the rest of their storage space was empty.  That was happening when part cargoes had to leave the port of Dublin because there was no accommodation at the docks, and we were not pumping that petrol back into the tanks in the country or never attempted to do it at any time.  The Minister cannot deny that part cargoes did leave the City of Dublin during the last year and a half since the war started.  Then the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes here to tell the House it is unfair criticism to suggest that the situation has been badly handled.  It has been badly handled.</P>
    <P>If the petrol position is as desperate as it would appear to be something should be done to economise and preserve essential services.  There is even still a good deal of wastage going on by way of parallel rail and bus services. One would not mind parallel services operated by different companies in competition with each other but it is an amazing situation to find parallel bus and rail services run by the same company, and starting at the very same hour.  That is an extraordinary situation.  Then there is overlapping of services down the country.  There are bread vans overlapping each other for 30 miles.  I think the Army is not beyond a certain amount of criticism in that respect because we are all passing Army lorries careering around the <Col N="1536" /> country with one or two men.  I do not see what purpose it serves except to burn up fuel that is so scarce.</P>
    <P>Again at the inception of the war a point was raised in this House about the lifting of the tram tracks and overhead wires when the electric cars were being taken off the streets of Dublin. A request was made to the Minister for Supplies at that time that if the electric cars were going off the streets the tracks and overhead wires should be left so that if we were forced at any time to go back to the electric cars there would be nothing to do but to drive them out.  We know that within the last couple of months these tracks and wires have been torn up all over the city.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that these overlapping services and parallel services that I spoke of should be drastically curtailed because we are all most anxious that a situation that would create further unemployment in this country should not be rushed into.  Far from it.  I do not want to be unfair in that regard.  It is essential that every effort should be made to keep men in employment as long as it is possible, but there are certain services that must be preserved.  For instance, Deputy Maguire said last night that petrol is a vital commodity, but not by any means the most vital commodity.  That is right to some extent but it is incidental at the present time to the production of the most vital commodity because I can assure you, Sir, that in the production of that vital commodity, especially in eastern counties to-day, if we have not petrol and vapourising oil for the tractors we will be actually at a standstill and we will have arrived at a most critical situation. I think I am not exaggerating the position if I put down 60 per cent. of tillage operations in the eastern counties as done by mechanical power to-day.  That vital industry&mdash;it has always been vital to this country&mdash;is more vital to-day than ever it was before in the production of food.  We cannot get seeds, artificial manures and feeding stuff for live stock on to the farm to-day except by lorry.  We have scrapped any other means of getting it in.  There are <Col N="1537" /> not sufficient horses to do it.  The extra horses that we had to take in the seeds, manures and other requirements for production on the farm, and to take out the food produced on the farm, are no longer there, so that at all costs we will have to keep a reserve of essential fuel to produce the food and take out the supply.  Remember, in talking about vapourising oil, that, if the petrol supply goes off, the supply of vapourising oil goes off as well, because it comes as part cargo with petrol.  You never get a complete cargo of vapourising oil, so that if petrol disappears as a cargo vapourising oil disappears as well.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the private car.  There is one important private car, and that is the farmer's car. It may appear to the city man that the farmer can get around freely without his car&mdash;that he can get into his pony and trap and drive around.  That is not the position at all.  As a matter of fact, the farmer who had a pony and trap a few years ago scrapped it when he got his car.  If we were all to come to the market to-day to replace our motor cars by buying a pony and trap, we would find that they could not be bought at any price.  They are not on the market.  If the farmer is going to produce food, if he is going to get around and speed up his business, and put more effort into his work, his car must be kept on the road.  He must be able to go into his market town, to attend fairs and pursue his normal avocations. It is absolutely essential that his car should be kept on the road, and that his tractor should be kept going as well.</P>
    <P>There is one point as regards the question of petrol which a garage proprietor has asked me to raise, and that is to direct the attention of the Minister for Supplies to the fact that at the present time, if a small garage owner wants to get a minimum supply of 200 gallons of petrol, he has got to have 800 coupons, because of the stepping-down of the value of the coupons.  It is practically impossible for him to have those 800 coupons, and it has presented a problem in many cases.  I should like the Minister to go into that matter.  I want to say a few words about vapourising <Col N="1538" /> oil, and this is a very important and very urgent matter.  An order has been made within the last few days that future deliveries of vapourising oil, and in fact deliveries for this present month of January, are to be based on the November deliveries.  It is inconceivable how the month of November was arrived at.  The matter was raised here yesterday by Deputy Dillon, but unfortunately he used the word kerosene instead of vapourising oil, and the Minister assured Deputy Dillon that the November deliveries are the peak deliveries for the year. Kerosene is ordinary paraffin oil burned in lamps, and we can all understand that the month of November, that is, the first winter month, one might say, is naturally the month during which the heaviest deliveries occur. But the oil on which the tractor runs is vapourising oil, and November is a particularly bad month to go on, because many tractors are laid up during the month of November.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister who is representing the Government here at the present moment will understand this point, and I will ask him to get the matter put right straight away.  There are many farmers all over the country who did not take any delivery in November, and because of the order to which I have referred they do not now qualify for any delivery.  I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture has returned to the House, because this is a very important matter which I want him to put right immediately, this evening or to-morrow if possible.  I spoke to the Secretary, Department of Agriculture, on the telephone some time ago, and he told me that he had made representations to the Department of Supplies on this matter, but they had not yet made a decision.  It is a matter which should be put right immediately.  In my own constituency there is a number of tractors standing idle at the present time because of the order that future deliveries of vapourising oil are to be based on the November deliveries, and that even the deliveries for this present month are to be on that basis.  The Minister for Agriculture will understand that November is a particularly bad month <Col N="1539" /> to pick on, because it is the month during which farmers in the beet growing areas are very busy lifting the beet crop, and the farmer with a plough and tractor may have his tractor laid up altogether for the month of November.  Apart altogether from that, a man may have got a delivery of vapourising oil during the last days of October, and may not want any more in the month of November.  There are many farmers to-day who, under the order, do not quality for a delivery of any vapourising oil.  On Tuesday last and on Wednesday before coming up here eight or ten farmers spoke to me and complained about the position. They were not able to secure any vapourising oil, and were very low in stocks.  There are other farmers who had been getting vapourising oil from companies like Munster, Simms &amp; Co., who had a depot at Baltinglass.  That depot closed down recently, and the farmers are in a difficulty about procuring future supplies.  The man who made the decision&mdash;the civil servant or the Minister, or whoever it was&mdash;that November should be the basic month, knew nothing about the position at all. Obviously, he thought that a man takes deliveries of oil for his tractor just the same as a man takes deliveries for a car, and that like a car consuming petrol one week with another the supply required for a tractor averages out more or less the same.  That is not the position at all.  While the tractor may be working full tilt in one month it may be laid up during the next month.  I want an assurance from the Minister here and now that he is going to put that matter right immediately. Am I getting that assurance?  Will the Minister have that matter attended to immediately?</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate the fact that the matter is very important, because there are tractors standing idle as the result of that order.  On the question of petrol to start tractors, that has been reduced to two gallons.  The Minister knows very well that, if you are to start a <Col N="1540" /> tractor every morning, two gallons will not cover the month at all.  Two gallons are not nearly sufficient.  They would probably do about a week, and no more.</P>
      <P>I will now get on to what is a very important matter, food production. First of all, with reference to arrears of land annuities, I should like to say that now is not the time for the Land Commission to be putting the screw on some unfortunate farmers who are not able at the moment to meet their arrears.  Now is the time to give them a chance to do something in the national interest.  If they are going to produce extra food and bring more land under cultivation, they want all the finance on which they can possibly put their fingers.  While they should try to meet their normal half-yearly instalments, I think some arrangement should be made whereby they can pay something off the arrears.  I suggest that rather than keep sheriffs' messengers travelling all over the country, piling up costs, some arrangement ought to be entered into by which the arrears will be spread over the next few years. I know the Land Commission are not unreasonable about that and I am aware that where representations are made the Land Commission are prepared to meet those cases.  But in all cases the unfortunate tenants have not that information.  They are not aware that reasonable arrangements can be made for them.  It might be well if the Minister would make it known that it is not the policy of the Government&mdash; it ought not to be at the present time &mdash;to put on severe pressure.  You could tell them you are prepared to make arrangements so that the arrears can be spread over a number of years.</P>

    <P>There is then the question of credit. In some tillage areas where you have big merchants, credit is not such a problem because those big merchants are prepared to advance credit and give seeds and manures to farmers where those farmers are credit-worthy. But there are some areas where the people have not those advantages, where they have not local merchants prepared to give them seeds and manures on credit.  In such circumstances an arrangement ought to be <Col N="1541" /> made so as to provide some sort of credit facilities by way of chattel mortgage or on some other basis.  The County Council scheme is not sufficient and it is not much good.  You will have to go much further if you want to produce 100 per cent. of our essential requirements in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Next comes the question of seed wheat.  If we are going to have this big wheat programme that we are contemplating we must make every effort to facilitate the producers.  I am aware that the Minister has authorised certain firms to assemble Irish seed wheat.  These are the only people who are licensed to import seed wheat.  I know that the policy behind the assembly of that wheat is to try to promote a scheme that will give us a better and surer type of wheat than we have had in the past.  They are acting more or less on the system that has been adopted in regard to the barley seed that is handled in this country by the barley people.  I think there is something to be said for that policy. There were many people prepared to assemble wheat in the wheat-growing areas, but they did not get a chance of doing so.  They are men who have always dealt in wheat, men who have supplied seed wheat to farmers in other years but they are out of it at present.  I think they have not been treated fairly.  They have all the necessary accommodation and finance to carry out the scheme.  Many of those people are merchants who deal in all the commodities a farmer wants and they could probably handle seed wheat&mdash;and they were prepared to do it&mdash;in a cheaper manner than a man engaged in the seed line solely.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the quantity of Irish-assembled seed that is available and the amount of imported seed wheat that has come in. Is there a sufficient quantity of assembled and imported wheat in the hands of the licensed people to give us a sufficient supply of seed?  If not, has the Minister made any attempt to draw samples from wheat in stores outside of the stores owned by the licensed people and have it tested for purity in germination?  If we have to draw for seed on wheat stocks outside of those under the control of persons <Col N="1542" /> licensed to assemble the seed, then we should sample that wheat in order to see if it will give us good germination. Now is the time to draw these samples and have them tested.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that is creating a certain amount of panic in the country, and that is the question of price.  Different areas present different problems in that respect.  I do not think that in my area there is very much cause to complain.  The seed wheat under the scheme was bought at 37/6, and the price charged by these people runs from 45/- to 48/-.  It is not too difficult to buy Irish-assembled wheat at 45/- and imported wheat at about 65/-.  I understand that is the price recognised by the Minister's Department. I want the Minister to insist that that wheat is disposed of to the farmer at that price, and that no profiteering will occur.  If a man is licensed to deal in seed wheat, and pays 37/6 for it, by all means he is entitled to handling charges and to a reasonable profit, but the Minister should see that it stops at that.  If there is any panic about seed in the next few weeks, no one should be permitted to go out and rob.  I do not think there is any likelihood of that in my area, but I have heard other Deputies quoting alarming figures.  I have heard them mention a figure of £4.  You cannot apply any other term to a charge of £4 for seed wheat than robbery&mdash;that is, if that price is being charged.</P>
    <P>As regards manures, at the moment we have 25 per cent. of the basic manure, phosphate, delivered to merchants all over the country.  They have no information as to future deliveries. Indeed, merchants are very slow to make any deliveries of the phosphate on hands until they know what is going to arrive.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture that the sooner the position is made known to the merchants and, through them, to the farmers, the better.  They should be informed of the total amount of manures that will be available in the coming year.  The farmer is in the position that he cannot plan with regard to his crops, and he cannot arrange the amount of manure that is going to be available for <Col N="1543" /> each individual crop until he knows the total delivery of manure that he is going to get.</P>
    <P>If I want to dress wheat to-day, and if I want to know how much manure I shall have to reserve for wheat, I should be in a position to know what the total deliveries are to be for the year.  The sooner I am supplied with that information, the better.  We have been informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we shall have a 50 per cent. supply.  He hoped to have a 75 per cent. supply.  However, on the last day we met here, he told us that that hope had receded to a great extent but that we are assured of 50 per cent. of last year's supply. We should be told exactly what we are getting.  We want to know that immediately so that we can decide what amount we can devote to wheat production and what amount we can reserve for the beet crop.  The farmer cannot plan wisely the distribution of the manure available if he does not know how much is coming to him for the year.</P>
    <P>The question of getting our full requirements of wheat for bread for the coming year is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.  Very many factors will govern the success or failure of his plan.  He must fix a price that will induce farmers to put in sufficient wheat to produce the quantity required to meet the present emergency.  The shortage of artificial manure is going to have a disastrous effect especially on poor land, as far as production of wheat is concerned.  We shall have a big reduction in the quantity of imported seed and the seed generally may be poor.  Another factor that must be taken into consideration is the very doubtful returns from old grass land with a big depth of turf which has been turned up late in the season.  That soil, ploughed up now, will be practically barren because it has not been aerated for many years&mdash;50, 60, or maybe 100 years in some cases.  It is a very doubtful proposition to expect any sort of decent return from land of that description when only a small quantity of artificial manures is available.  Farmers <Col N="1544" /> are no fools in that respect; they know what they are tackling.  In the non-tillage districts, where the land is more suitable for grass, farmers know that they are simply asked under the scheme to cash in on the fertility brought about by the good husbandry of many years.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also take into account the present price of barley, which is up to 34/- and the present price of oats, which is over 20/-.  I do not suggest for a moment that there are many farmers who want to blackmail the people at the present time.  I do not think it is a time for the farmers to put a pistol to the heads of the Government to try to force an exorbitant price for wheat produced for the coming year.  It would not be right or proper, or in the national interest, that that should be done, and I do not think there are many farmers inclined to do it.  For that reason I am not going to mention any specific price.  The responsibility is on the Minister to decide what price will induce the farmers to produce sufficient for our national requirements.  The various factors I have mentioned must be taken into account if you are going to assess that price accurately.  You must look to the big farmers for the increased production which you expect for the coming year.  The Minister himself has mentioned that fact down the country.  One thing which the people generally, and farmers particularly, resent very strongly is the arbitrary method adopted in fixing prices for agricultural products at the present time&mdash;without consultation with any representatives of agriculture and with a threat that if the farmer does not do the job, the land will be taken from him.  That attitude on the part of the Government compares very unfavourably with the attitude adopted towards industrialists in this country.  Industrialists are frequently invited to put their proposals before the Government, to state what price they can produce an article at and what terms they want in the way of protection, etc.  They generally get these terms without question. The people who are the real backbone of this country and whose work is vitally essential to the national welfare <Col N="1545" /> at present, are not consulted in any shape or form.  The terms are put down to them and threats are used to whip them into line.  I do not think that is the proper way to treat them; they deserve to be treated better.</P>
    <P>Appeals have been made for an extension of the allotment scheme.  I should like to join in that appeal.  I think it is hardly fair to confine the schemes to urban centres and to exclude the smaller towns and villages throughout the country in which it would not be a difficult matter to secure fields for allotment purposes and put the unemployed in these areas to work to produce food for themselves and the nation generally.  The scheme should be extended to any area where there is a demand for it, and that should be done immediately.</P>
    <P>In the non-tillage districts, if the Minister expects to get a decent return of crops, he should make available for the people experts who would instruct them in the handling of old tillage land.  Some of the people in these areas because they have not much experience of cultivation do not know very much about tillage.  As I have already pointed out, where you are turning up a depth of turf that has not been ploughed for many years, it is very difficult to handle the soil properly and the best returns can only be secured if the soil is cultivated under the direction of a person with knowledge of the work.  Such an expert would show the people how to deal with wire-worm and how to handle the soil correctly in the months of March and April when we have severe east winds and when the lack of contact between the top soil and sub-soil destroys the capillarity in the soil. These are all matters that the farmer who has no experience of cultivation should have expert advice upon, and that ought to be provided.  We have a large number of young fellows who have studied agriculture in our colleges and I am sure that a sufficient number is available to put them into those areas to help the farmers in this difficult period.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to refer to before I finish.  It has <Col N="1546" /> been stressed by some Deputies that some effort should be made to purchase ships.  The Minister for Supplies told us not so many hours ago that the position at the moment is that we are facing a situation when there will be no shipping available to carry any cereals to this country for the remainder of the year.  That is a very serious position.  I know very little about shipping.  I think no great effort has been made to purchase ships and I think ships could have been purchased. If we did purchase ships, I admit that the difficulty of getting them kept over water is another proposition. But, at all events, other nations are taking risks, and if we could have picked up at any sort of a reasonable price eight or ten or a dozen ships we should be prepared to take the risk as well.</P>
    <P>This shipping problem could also be dealt with in another way.  If we want vapourising oil and raw phosphate rock from North Africa, could we not say to the British that if our people are going to produce essential food for them, beef, bacon, eggs and butter, we want to exchange cargoes with them.  We have been told that any shipping we have procured up to the present has not been secured through British interests.  We have been told by the Minister to-day that it was absolutely on our own that we secured that shipping, generally from neutral countries. I admit that that is a position I was not aware of.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the bargaining weapon of food for our next-door neighbour, good food that we can produce, has not been used to the extent that it ought to have been used in securing other cargoes that we require, especially raw material for the production of that food.  I think if that had been put up to the British in a proper manner that some headway would have been made in securing those cargoes. The Minister made no reference to-day to any efforts being made in that respect, but it may not be too late to make that effort.</P>
    <P>The danger that I see in this drive for 100 per cent. production of our requirements in the coming year is that, it is carrying out the policy of the <Col N="1547" /> Government and the Fianna Fáil Party of self-sufficiency and complete and absolute isolation from the rest of the world.  If we develop that position, what will be our position in the post-war period?  In this drive for self-sufficiency and complete and absolute isolation, if our export trade goes, where are we going to be?  Is it not essential in the national interests that we should preserve as far as possible our export trade?  There are many very essential things that we cannot produce and we must make every effort to import them.  If we cannot import them at present, we expect to import them in the post-war period.  If we let our export trade go now and our livestock population falls off because we are so concerned with the fulfilment of the Fianna Fáil policy of self-sufficiency and isolation, then the position that may develop in the post-war period will be a major disaster for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, after the Minister's statement, that we in this small State should be in a position to congratulate ourselves when we find that the only complaint that can be levelled at the Government is about the regulation of petrol supplies.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have not a mercantile marine, and that our resources are very limited, the only inconvenience our people have been put to in the matter of supplies is due to the scarcity of petrol.  I was amazed to hear in this House that it came as a surprise to anybody that petrol was scarce or that the supplies of petrol to the consumer would be curtailed.  Surely Deputies remember the time when the petrol rationing system came into force here, when you had people in every country town running to the local garage with all kinds of containers, collecting as much petrol as they possibly could. Why were they doing that?  Because they realised that petrol was an article which it was quite likely we would not be able to obtain.  We can also recall that a feature of practically every district court in this country for several months was the number of prosecutions brought against people for having barrels of petrol in their backyards or <Col N="1548" /> stored in all kinds of containers.  The reason why these people were keeping petrol in that way was that they realised, as the community in general realised, that petrol would be scarce and that supplies were likely to be stopped at any moment.</P>
      <P>It would be very interesting if we had figures as to the number of motorists who have taxed their cars this month for one quarter only.  In my own county I would say that 60 per cent. of the motorists have taxed their cars for one quarter only.  By taxing their cars only for one quarter, it cost them about 12 per cent. more than if they taxed them for the whole of the year. Those people taxed their cars for one quarter because they knew that supplies of petrol are not normal and that we are likely any day to find ourselves in the position that there will be no petrol supplies available.  The fact that petrol is the one commodity that has been rationed here goes to show that nobody should have been taken by surprise when the scarcity occurred, as everybody was anticipating a scarcity. Motorists down the country to whom I have been speaking all believed that we would not be able to maintain our supplies of petrol, and I was very much surprised to hear that the scarcity came as such a terrible shock to the general public as Deputies would have us believe by their statements in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that petrol is of such importance to this community during this emergency as we have been led to believe.  It is certainly important as a commercial factor, and I agree that a number of people will be thrown out of employment as a result of the scarcity of petrol.  But we do not eat or drink petrol, and 20 or 25 years ago our community got on without any petrol.  I think it is much more important that we should direct our attention to what is really important during this particular crisis, and that is providing foodstuffs for our people; the production of foodstuffs in our country sufficient to keep our normal agricultural community, the amount of stock produced in a normal year by our agricultural community, <Col N="1549" /> and to keep the food provision as normal as possible.</P>
    <P>Now, it has been suggested that there may be three meanings to anything the Minister or the Taoiseach may say, by the other side, but there is one thing clear, and that is that there can be no three meanings or no two meanings to the statements of the Opposition in this House on the question of the production of wheat and beet in this country.  It has been clearly stated here and elsewhere on several occasions by responsible leaders of the Opposition, that wheat was a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and that beet was a &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We now come to a situation in which we realise that the only policy for our people in this country, if we are to survive this crisis, is to produce sufficient of those commodities to meet our own needs.  We might find ourselves in the morning in a position in which we will not be able to import anything that we may need in this line, and if we are not able to get shipping for petrol or to import sufficient to meet our normal needs, surely we may find ourselves, and probably will find ourselves, in the same position in connection with such vital supplies for our people as wheat, perhaps in a month's time.</P>
    <P>There is one complaint that I have to make in connection with this Compulsory Tillage Order, and that is in regard to the question of wheat.  My complaint is that the Minister has not differentiated between the different areas in this country and their capacity for wheat production.  The Minister cannot expect counties like Donegal, Mayo, Galway and similar counties in this country, to produce wheat, or at any rate to produce it in any large quantities, because, firstly, the populations of these counties are producing much more than is required from them under the Compulsory Tillage Order. Secondly, in these counties, the land, to a large extent, is absolutely unsuitable for and incapable of producing wheat.  In my own county, Mayo, various experiments have been carried out by the agricultural committee on the production of wheat, and it is rather interesting to note the yield that was produced in County Mayo on <Col N="1550" /> demonstration plots taken over by the county committee of agriculture.  In connection with winter wheat, certain experimental plots were taken over in 1939 by the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture, for the purpose of seeing how wheat would do there, and four experiments with spring wheats were carried out on the farms of Joe McHale, Faldfadda, Ballyvary; Michael MacHale, Carrownarlaur, Breaffy; Michael Clarke, Foxborough, Killala; and Anthony Walsh, Culleens, Ballina.  The varieties tested and the average yield of grain per statue acre are given in the following table:</P>

    <P>Now, that is a very low average, and that average was produced on land that was manured and manured well. These were plots that were picked in various parts of the county, and it is impossible to expect the people in areas like that to produce wheat in any large quantities.  There are places in this country that will produce wheat, and there are places that will give a large yield, and those are the areas upon which the Minister should concentrate. I would suggest that the figure of one-fifth, in areas such as Meath, Westmeath, parts of Limerick and Tipperary, is too low a figure for the farmers of these areas, and that such areas should be confined to growing wheat, while counties such as Mayo, Donegal, Galway, and similar counties, should be required to produce sufficient potatoes and oats for the community. In the Midlands they can produce and grow wheat without manure. They have the land there and they can do it.  In counties like Mayo and similar counties we cannot produce wheat in the same way as the Midland counties. The soil is different, and, if we were to produce wheat, we would have to manure the land intensively.  At the same time, the wheat will not ripen, or you will not have anything like the yield you would have in the Midland counties.  I have some figures here of <Col N="1551" /> the acreage under certain crops in County Mayo in 1938.  In 1938 we produced 28,722 statute acres of potatoes, 2,596 statute acres of wheat, 32,300 statute acres of oats 1,141 statute acres of barley.  In 1940, our people in Mayo increased that to 34,945 acres of potatoes, 41,491 acres of oats, 3,667 acres of wheat, 2,401 acres of beet, 1,389 acres of barley, 457 acres of rye, 3,449 acres of turnips, and 1,693 acres of mangolds. The total for 1938 was 64,759 statute acres, with those yields, and in 1940 the total was 89,492 acres, or an increase of 24,733 acres.</P>
    <P>Those figures show that, in County Mayo, with all the appeals we had for wheat-growing, and with our community being sincere in their endeavour to produce wheat, and realising that it was a most important article for them, the increase in potatoes and oats was very much more than the increase in wheat, and our total acreage under tillage shows that our farmers grow as much as, if not more than, any other group of farmers in this country, taking the size of the county into consideration. As a matter of fact, the position is this: that most of our people in Mayo&mdash;and I am sure the same goes for similar counties such as Donegal and Galway&mdash;till a much larger percentage than is tilled on the farms in the Midlands.  They have got to do it in order to live&mdash;in order to exist. According to the last census there were 21,300 of our population in Mayo existing on farms of from one to 50 acres. All those people till intensively, and if they do produce wheat in counties such as Mayo, they must produce it at the expense of some other crop.  If they produce more wheat, it means that they must produce less potatoes and less oats, and at the same time their land is unsuitable for the production of a wheat crop.</P>
    <P>We all realise that wheat is vital to this community and that it will take a very large effort on the part of the farming community to increase the production of wheat by, say, 300,000 acres; but if we are to achieve that figure&mdash;and we must do so&mdash;I would ask the Minister to take into account the wheat belts in this country and <Col N="1552" /> the wheat-growing areas here, and to leave counties such as Mayo and similar counties to produce the crops, such as oats and potatoes, which are suitable to them, and compel the people with the good land&mdash;the land that is capable of producing wheat&mdash;to grow wheat.  Balancing the position in that way I have no doubt the danger of being short of wheat will be averted.</P>
    <P>Another matter concerns the difficulty that some people have regarding supplies of manures.  I should like to see an order being made, so that the available supplies would go to areas in which they are required, and that areas that can do without manures would not get them.  There are large tracts of counties within reasonable distance of the sea that should not be allowed to reduce the stock of available manures, because seaweed can be had and, with very little trouble, could be used for the purpose of producing a crop.  If the Minister varies the order, and confines wheat growing to suitable areas where it can be produced, I am sure the scarcity of manures and fertilisers will not give the community any great trouble.  There is also the question of credit for farmers to which reference has been made.  In areas that I have in mind for wheat growing, I am not satisfied that the lack of credit was an effective cause for not producing wheat last year or in previous years.  I am speaking now of the Midlands, where there are farms averaging 100 acres and over.  If there is a genuine question of credit involved and if the Minister is satisfied that it is needed in order to ensure bread supplies and have a crop, I suggest that some system should be adopted by the Government, similar to that adopted by the beet factories, who give both seeds and manures to those who require them, but own the crop. Wheat could be sold in the same way as the beet crop is sold to the sugar company.  That would get over any difficulty about credit that is said to be responsible for not tilling more land.</P>
    <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention also to the question of conacre lettings.  If we are to increase <Col N="1553" /> production on the land, large numbers of people, particularly in the congested areas, have to rely on taking conacre to produce a crop each year.  That is the position in particular this year, when numbers of people are returning to congested areas from countries that are involved in the present war.  The sowing of the annual crop has consequently become more important than ever.  I suggest to the Minister that an order should be issued immediately controlling the price of conacre, and that people who are letting land that, in the ordinary course of events, they would not let, but are doing so in order to avoid prosecution under the Compulsory Tillage Order, should not be allowed to profiteer, and charge high prices to small farmers and agricultural labourers who are forced to pay any prices demanded for a piece of land on which to produce a crop.  I am sure the Minister will have the goodwill of the House in endeavouring to have as large a crop of wheat as is possible produced this year.  I am sure each Deputy will do his utmost in his constituency to get farmers to grow more wheat.  In my constituency I will do my best in that respect, and I am sure the people will do their best to sow even a small patch of wheat by endeavouring to have in each household a couple of bags of wholemeal flour to relieve the demand on shop flour and bread.  If we are to meet the huge demand that the State is making on farmers to provide 300,000 acres for the community, the Minister will have to insist on those who have land that is capable of producing wheat, doing so and leaving constituencies like the one from which I come to produce other crops such as potatoes, oats and barley.</P>

      <P>In this debate I do not wish to go over any ground which has already been trodden.  I wish to put forward certain views that I have upon the subject matter being debated.  There was one speech made yesterday to which I want to make special reference.  I think for the first time in my life I heard a speech made by Deputy Corry which I thought was one of the most valuable speeches contributed to this debate.  I <Col N="1554" /> am astonished to find myself in agreement with Deputy Corry.  We want to have more food produced.  We want a larger acreage put down, especially to wheat.  That is the Government policy. It is the Opposition policy.  It is the policy of the whole country.  But if there is one thing going to check increased acreage it is, when the wheat is grown, if it is going to be made a subject of profiteering by certain person in this country.  Deputy Corry started to read a very significant letter.</P>
      <P>It was given to the Deputy I understand by the owner of the letter.  A letter becomes the property of the person to whom it is written, but the Ceann Comhairle and you, Sir, ruled&mdash; and I am not challenging your ruling&mdash; that that letter could not be read in the House.  I am sorry it could not be read.  But we got from Deputy Corry the contents of the letter.  They were very remarkable, and that is why I want to draw the attention of the House to the letter.  Deputy Corry's figures, as I understood them&mdash;I am glad he is in the House, as he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;was that a gentleman wrote to a large firm of millers, I take it in Cork, that he had 20,000 tons of wheat which he was going to sell at 43/- a barrel, but which he had purchased at 35/-.  He went on to say that the firm of millers had better deal with him, because if they did not he had friends in the Government who would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is even stronger.  It is not £50,000, as on my <Col N="1556" /> calculation it would work out; it is between £60,000 and £70,000.  That is even worse, and that is being done by a gentleman with friends in the Ministry. He is able to make £60,000 profit at the expense of the growers of wheat.  These are the sort of things which are going to do injury to increased tillage.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Corry stated about wheat is true of the other grains as well.  I understand that it is true of barley.  Upon that I cannot speak definitely myself but I do know that exactly the same type of profiteering is going on in oats and I think that, when the farmers of this country are being asked to increase their tillage area and being appealed to to provide food for the people, there should be no war fortunes made with the help of the Government.  I think that the first duty of the Minister for Supplies would be to see that that profiteering stops, to set to work in his own office and to know something about it, and not to be ignorant of the wheat situation, as he showed himself to be plainly ignorant of it yesterday.  One of the first things to be done when he gets to work is to prevent profiteering in grain.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy know by how much the price of bread has gone up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of the utmost importance that we should make as much flour as possible, but it is equally important that we should have flour available at a price within the compass of the poorer members of this community.  If these gentlemen are going to make their £60,000 out of wheat, out of whose pocket is that going to come?  It will be out of the pockets of the consumers of bread, which is an essential food of the poorer members of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me pass away from that subject to deal with the question of food production generally.  An assumption has been made in this House which I hope will be justified, but can we guarantee that it will be justified?  We have had, for the last five or six years, a succession of extremely good harvests, and it must be the hope of everyone that we will have an equally good harvest <Col N="1557" /> this year; but we cannot count with certainty upon it nor with certainty that the added area of wheat, with the old area of wheat last year, would produce anything like the quantity of millable wheat upon which our present calculations are based.  Everybody hopes that it will, everybody hopes for an abundant harvest, but our hopes will not of necessity be fulfilled.  For that reason, I believe we should make preparations so that if the wheat harvest happens to be a bad one and if the amount of millable wheat falls entirely below our hopes, at the same time the country will not be left short of food.  It seems to me that that can be achieved if farmers and others are encouraged to grow more potatoes.</P>
    <P>Potatoes are in every way a complete substitute for wheat.  If you set up mills for the extraction of potato flour you will find, I understand, according to the agricultural chemists, that the flour made out of potatoes is as valuable a foodstuff as the flour made out of wheat.  The farina made from potatoes is as valuable as the flour made from wheat.  I do not know whether there is any such machinery or mill available in this country for the extraction of flour from potatoes, but I would urge the Minister for Agriculture to consider that matter and that while he is talking &ldquo;Wheat, wheat, wheat&rdquo;, he should also talk &ldquo;Wheat and potatoes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point.  In the non-wheat-growing areas&mdash;and the Minister can segregate them without much trouble&mdash;his Order to till one-fifth will not, in my opinion, prove a national advantage but a national disadvantage, and I will tell the Minister why I have come to that conclusion. As I have already stated, in my opinion, in the non-wheat-growing areas the crop which is of first importance is the potato crop.  If you increase the area under tillage, I believe you will decrease the area under potatoes.  That might seem at first a paradox, but to anybody who knows farming conditions it will appear as a self-evident proposition.  If a man has to do a tremendous amount more tillage he has got to get a certain number of horses and can employ a certain number <Col N="1558" /> of men, and the easy way of doing it is to put in grain.</P>
    <P>Grain requires practically no labour. You plough, harrow and seed, and then you go away.  You come back in the harvest for a couple of days and you cut the crop.  If you are a large farmer, with a reaper and binder, all the labour you want is simply to stook and stack, and finally to thresh.  The potato is quite a different crop.  You have not merely to plough and harrow, to open your drills, to spread your seed and to close your drills, but you have to come back and mould your potatoes, and to spray them two or three times during the year.  Finally, you have the long and tiresome job of digging.  If a person is going to put a large area under crops, the easy and only practical thing for him to do is to grow oats, but if he grows potatoes on a large scale, his job will be a difficult one.  Potatoes are also an unattractive crop as far as marketing goes.  I live nine statute miles from the nearest railway station.  If I want to send a ton of potatoes there, I must use a horse and car, and that will cost about 15/- for the day.  If the potatoes are going by rail to Dublin, the charge will be something like 30/-.  That makes £2 5s. 0d. out of the price of a ton of potatoes worth, say, about £4. For that reason I say potatoes are not an attractive crop to grow, except for persons situate near a market, or who have been in the habit of tilling on a very considerable scale.  Of course, many persons will grow potatoes for their own home use and for feeding stock.</P>
    <P>My suggestion to the Minister is that he should amend his Tillage Order so that in the non-wheat areas&mdash;if he likes he may apply it in the wheat areas as well&mdash;one acre of potatoes should count as two acres of tillage.  In my opinion it would be much better for the country to have one acre of potatoes grown than two acres of oats.  I strongly press that suggestion on the Minister.  For feeding the people of the country, and even for the production of food for animals, there is more feeding stuff in an acre of potatoes than in two acres of oats, and there is far more trouble in tilling one acre of potatoes than there is in tilling five <Col N="1559" /> acres of oats.  I hope the Minister will adopt my suggestion.  There will be no difficulty in putting it into operation. The non-wheat areas can very easily be segregated for inspection purposes, and what I suggest will cause no trouble to the inspector in making up his calculations. If there is a failure of the harvest next year, and if the country is driven to eat more and more potatoes out of necessity, it will be a very bad thing indeed if the potato crop is short as well as the wheat crop.  The Minister should have no difficulty in amending his Tillage Order in the way I have suggested.</P>
    <P>There is one thing about that Order which I cannot understand, and it is, why rape should be a forbidden crop. Under it you can grow almost any variety of crop except rape.  It would seem to me that, in the case of land which has been exhausted by having two or three crops of corn taken out of it, the very best way to restore the fertility of the soil would be to fodder sheep on rape, and why that should be prohibited at the present time I do not know.  However, that is a small matter.  What I want to impress on the Minister is that if his real aim is to produce food to feed the people of the country he will achieve that aim very much better if he makes a distinction in favour of potatoes as against the corn crop.  I do not know whether he will accept the suggestion or not.  It seems to me that if he does not he is simply following out blindly a rule of thumb.  It is always easy to make an Order requiring people to till one-fifth or one-eighth of their land&mdash;a universal order for the whole country&mdash;but it requires work to make different Orders suited to the needs of different parts of the country.  I hope that, because the suggestion I have made will entail a little more work on the Minister and his Department, he will not, for that reason, turn it down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the motion before the House has been very prolonged.  I think that perhaps too much time has been devoted to the question of petrol.  In my opinion the question of food supplies is infinitely <Col N="1560" /> more important.  With regard to petrol, my only complaint is that the Minister for Supplies did not take steps to restrict its consumption during the past year, and thus make provision in advance for the emergency caused by the sinking of tankers coming here. The Minister would have averted, to a great extent, the difficult position in which the country has been placed, due to the shortage of petrol and the consequent serious and sudden unemployment which has arisen, if, during the past year, he had taken steps to prevent the waste of petrol to the extent to which it was being used for pleasure and amusement purposes, as well as the substitution of trams in this city by buses, and by restricting bus competition with the railways, through the country, particularly on routes catered for by the railways.</P>
      <P>On the question of food supplies, I do not know that very many helpful suggestions have been made to the Minister, neither do I think that Ministers have given very useful information to the people in general as to what is needed from the country, and as to what is the exact position in regard to food.  They certainly have not given an indication of any carefully prepared plan for dealing with tillage products other than wheat.  I suppose it is correct to say that last year 75 per cent. of the tillage area of the country was devoted to crops such as oats, barley and potatoes.  In regard to oats and barley, we know that the position last year was very unsatisfactory, and there is no indication that, for the coming year, the position will be any more satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers have repeatedly urged farmers to increase not only the acreage under wheat but also the acreage under barley, oats and potatoes. Have they offered any real inducement or any security to the grower of barley, oats or potatoes?  In 1939, farmers sold their oats at a price of about 14/- or 15/- per barrel.  That oats was subsequently supplied to consumers and also to farmers themselves who required it for seed a couple of months later at 35/- per barrel.  One <Col N="1561" /> would think that having regard to that experience in 1939, some plan would have been worked out in regard to the oat crop for 1940, but when the position in 1940 was that farmers were compelled to pay 35/- and, in some cases, £2 for their seed oats, one would imagine that some provision would be made in regard to the marketing of the oats.  No provision was made and the result was that farmers had to sell their produce at 12/- and 13/- per barrel.  That produce sold at 12/- or 13/- two or three months ago is now worth more than £1 per barrel and the probability is that by the time the farmer requires to purchase his seed, it will be worth nearly £2 per barrel.  Here we have a state of affairs in which the unfortunate producer has been deliberately robbed of more than 50 per cent. of the value of his produce and no steps have been taken by the Minister for Agriculture or any other Minister to regulate that position. Therefore, when we ask farmers now to grow more oats during the coming year, we should at least take some steps to assure him that he will get a reasonable price for at least some of the oats he produces.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to oats and barley has, I think, never been properly tackled by our Government, Our Government does not seem to realise that oats and barley are commodities much the same in many respects as gold.  They are commodities which can be hoarded and stored, and which can be easily cornered by a few individuals for the purpose of making tremendous profits.  Because of that, it is the duty of the Government to take steps to regulate and control the entire marketing of grain. That will have to be done sooner or later, and the sooner it is done, the better.  We cannot allow a condition of affairs to continue in which a small group of active people can jump in and seize the entire profits of the farmers' hard labour.  Deputy Moran referred to the large acreage of oats grown in County Meath.  That oats was grown mainly by small farmers on poor land, and we can imagine how hard these farmers had to work in order to produce that grain.  We can imagine them working on poor land, with, in many cases, <Col N="1562" /> inferior implements and inadequate quantities of manure, and we find that, having produced that grain, a quantity of which they must market, they are robbed of half the value of the crop, or, in other words, other people who have nothing to do but sit in offices are able to make a profit of 100 per cent. out of that produce.  Deputy Corry also gave us some very useful information with regard to the ramp which is taking place in respect of wheat.</P>
    <P>When we farmers ask for a better price for wheat, we are sometimes told that we are trying to increase the price of the loaf, but I think that if these profiteering sharks were eliminated, it would be possible to pay the farmer a decent price not only for wheat but for other grain products, without increasing the price to the consumer.  Surely the price of oatmeal sold to the poor in our towns and cities is not the price which the farmer gets for his oats.  If it were, oatmeal could be supplied at a very cheap rate in our towns and cities, but because there are a group of individuals in the corn trade who are out to make big profits and who have always been out to make these big profits at the expense of the farmer, we have a state of affairs in which tillage farming has never been as profitable as it could have been.  If tillage farming is to be continued in this country, not only during this emergency but in the future, one co-operative organisation, let us say, of some kind must be formed to handle not only all the grain produced, but also any grain which it may be necessary at any time to import.  If that were done, we might be able to arrive at a position in which we could have a planned economy and a planned acreage of oats, barley and wheat and in which the acreages of these different crops could be related to each other.</P>
    <P>When the question of the price of oats is raised, we are often met with the answer that a good price for oats would militate against the growing of wheat.  The same would apply to barley.  If the handling of the oats crop were controlled, it would be possible to segregate certain areas in which wheat cannot be grown and to confine the growing of oats for sale to <Col N="1563" /> these particular areas.  One industry was established in this country in connection with agriculture which has been fairly well planned&mdash;the beet growing and sugar producing industry.  In that industry, the exact acreage of beet to be grown each year is determined before the crop is sown.  By so determining the acreage of beet, we have a position in which sufficient beet is grown to keep the factories in operation, and, at the same time, there is not left on the hands of the farmer a huge surplus of which he cannot dispose.</P>
    <P>There is now a certain market for a certain quantity of oats, apart from what the farmer may use on his own farm, and it would be possible for the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Supplies to calculate in advance the extent of that market.  It would be possible for the Minister for Agriculture in advance to have a certain specified, predetermined acreage of oats grown for sale to supply that market, and it would be possible also for the growers who grow the oats to be assured of a fixed guaranteed economic price.  If that were done, it would relieve to a great extent the position of the people in the poorer areas who cannot grow wheat, owing to the inferior nature of their land.  It would also eliminate the profiteering sharks who have made such enormous profits out of the oat crop.  Surely, if oats is worth £1 per barrel to-day, it should have been possible for the State to guarantee the grower of oats £1 per barrel when he was sowing the crop, instead of paying that £1 per barrel to the people who store and corner our grain crops.</P>
    <P>This is really the most important aspect of our food supply question.  My suggestion is that the Government should plan the exact acreage of oats, barley and wheat that should be grown, in consultation with the farmers; that is to say, they should plan the proportion of the land under tillage which should be set aside for the different crops, and in the areas which are not suited for wheat or barley, the farmer should be guaranteed <Col N="1564" /> a remunerative price for oats.  In other areas which are specially adapted for barley, a similar guarantee could be given.  We had a position last year in which the maltsters guaranteed the farmer an economic price for a certain limited quantity of barley, but the Government did not consider it their duty to guarantee the farmer a decent price for the remainder of his barley, with the result that half the barley growers of the country were compelled to sell their barley at a price ranging from 17/- to £1 per barrel.  Less than a month after the farmers had disposed of their barley, the price began to soar, until to-day barley is worth considerably more than the price which the maltsters guaranteed the farmers. Surely, any intelligent Administration could so arrange matters and so plan ahead as to assure the farmer for his barley at least the price it is worth now to the profiteering middleman.</P>
    <P>Again, also, the example of sugar beet may be quoted in regard to the management of other crops, such as oats, barley and wheat.  In the sugar beet industry, the grower is provided with seed on credit, with credit facilities for manures and with a small cash advance during the summer months which enables him to attend to his crop while waiting for his payment on delivery of his crop to the factory. It is possible, though not quite a simple matter, I admit, to make similar provision in regard to all the wheat grown in the country, and in regard to a limited acreage of oats and barley.  It is by such a planned system on a permanent basis that tillage farming is going to be made a success in this country.</P>
    <P>If we had, as I say, a central organisation, having control of all the grain produced, it would be possible for that organisation to regulate the acreage of such crops to be grown during each year.  If it happened, for example, during the coming year or during any particular year, that yields were so high that a surplus was created in one particular grain crop, the central organisation would then set about limiting the acreage of that cereal.  In that way, I say that the farmer would <Col N="1565" /> always be assured of a guaranteed economic price for such grain crops as he had to sell.  I am not suggesting that there should be a guaranteed price for an unlimited acreage of any crop.  It may be possible to guarantee a price for an unlimited acreage of wheat at the moment, because the wheat acreage is much below what is required, but it is not possible to guarantee a price for an unlimited acreage of oats or even barley.  With regard to those crops, it would be possible to guarantee a price only for a limited acreage in areas where wheat cannot be grown successfully.</P>
    <P>I think there have been some suggestions that farmers might be inclined to take advantage of the present situation to demand or to claim excessive prices.  There is no such intention on the part of farmers, and neither is there any intention on the part of any organised body of farmers to withhold their support and encouragement from the increasing of the acreage under tillage in order to force up the price of any particular grain crop.  The farmers, whether as individuals or as an organised body, will do everything possible to increase and extend the acreage ploughed during the coming year, and since they are not prepared to let the country down in respect of food supplies, it is their hope that the country will not let them down and that whatever price the consumer pays for his requirements, the farmer will get that price, without being robbed by the middlemen.</P>
    <P>There are just a few matters in regard to increasing the acreage under tillage to which the Government's attention should be directed.  We know that urgent appeals are being made to individual farmers throughout the country to increase the tillage area, but we should like to see an example in this direction set by the Government itself in respect of the land it holds.  I know from personal experience that the Land Commission hold a considerable amount of land in the country in respect of which the tillage order is not being fully complied with or, if it is being complied with, it is only barely complied with.  I do not think that the <Col N="1566" /> Government is doing its duty to the community if it only barely complies with the tillage order.  I think it is the duty of the Government to set a headline to the rest of the farmers by tilling the largest possible percentage of the land they hold.  The same applies, I think, to the banks and to the Credit Corporation.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is a semi-Government body and I think they should set a headline also in regard to farms which they hold throughout the country which are at present being set for grazing.  I think that is a matter to which the Minister for Agriculture should direct his attention.  I know that the banks hold a considerable number of farms throughout the country.  Those farms have been set for years for grazing.  In many cases they are farms which are suitable for tillage and I think the banks should be not only compelled to comply with the law but they should also be induced by some means to set a headline to the farming community. They have the finance, if anybody has it, which the farmers have not and they should be able to go &ldquo;all out&rdquo; to cultivate not 20 per cent. but at least 75 per cent. of those lands.  In this connection also I think it would be only reasonable to ask that while farmers might continue to pay the current annuities they should not be unduly pressed for arrears, at least not until the grain crops which are being set at the present time have been harvested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures that this country can carry on without any import or export trade of any extent.  I do not think the Minister has considered in this connection the importance of artificial manures and fertilisers.  If we are to get increased production from the land and to maintain an increased area <Col N="1567" /> under tillage, we require very large supplies of artificial manures.  I think there is general criticism of the Government that they have not laid in sufficient raw materials for the manufacture of artificial manures.  I do not think sufficient effort has been made to provide shipping to import our requirements. I have been told that in some neutral countries, such as Spain, there are large quantities of artificial manures or the raw material for artificial manures, which could have been imported but which have not been.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which some reference has been made already is the question of allotments.  First of all, arrangements should be made to provide allotments for all unemployed men and for all those who have not got any land.  In addition to that, a big drive should be made to have the largest possible number of vegetable plots cultivated, not only by the unemployed, but by every other section of the community. At the present time food is one of the most important matters under consideration, and it is an ideal time to direct the attention of the entire community to the need for providing from small plots, or from any other land which they can acquire, the  tmost amount of food.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey referred to the very sad plight of one particular unemployed family in Cork City who were living on 23/- per week.  There were many things wrong, both from a national and social point of view, in regard to that family; first of all the fact that they were living in one room; the fact that that man was unemployed, and also the fact that that unemployed man was buying each day a small quantity of potatoes instead of having a small allotment where he could grow not only sufficient potatoes for his family, but also other very necessary vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the attention of everybody is directed towards seeing that no unemployed man is without a plot or that no working man or citizen of any class fails or refuses to work at least one small plot of land for the provision of vegetables for his own family it would go a long way towards relieving some <Col N="1568" /> of our difficulties.  This is a time, as I say, for an intensive drive in that direction.  I think it would be useful to the farmers also inasmuch as it would give the people in our towns and cities some little practical knowledge of the difficulties encountered in the growing of crops.  They would find that it is not merely a matter of digging up a piece of ground and putting in the seeds and that in due course the produce becomes available.  They would find in a very short time that the growing of vegetables presents many very difficult problems and requires a great deal of attention. Having acquired that little knowledge they would have more sympathy with the people on the land, the people who are being called upon to-day to save this country from the possibility of want.</P>

      <P>I had thought that many of the matters raised in this debate by Deputy Belton and others might have been raised on the next motion.  I suppose they are equally relevant as far as the subject of this motion is concerned.  The first matter that has been raised here by a number of Deputies is the matter of black bread.  I thought that we were finished with black bread.  I remember ten or 12 years ago when the Fianna Fáil Party were in opposition they advocated the growing of our own wheat and the black bread was thrown back at us.  At that time we were told that if we made bread out of Irish wheat it would be black bread.  Now we have departed from that at least. The Deputies who spoke here, I think, were satisfied that if we could grow enough Irish wheat to have a 70 per cent. extraction of flour the bread would be all right.  We have learned that much.</P>

      <P>The farmers taught me practically everything I know, but the <Col N="1569" /> farmers have not taught Deputy Belton everything he should know.  The fact that we may have to take a little more extraction from the wheat does not mean black bread.  In fact, if we took 100 per cent. from the wheat&mdash;which is what many farmers of this country have for their own consumption&mdash;we would have nice brown bread but not black bread, and it is only raising a prejudice against what we may have to do to refer to it as black bread.  We should drop that altogether.  Deputy Belton in the course of his speech complained that now we are saying it will be more wholesome, and he wants to know where were those experts on public health up to now.  As long as I can remember, there were experts on public health talking about brown bread, and advocating brown bread for the people, but the people had not the good sense to adopt it, and as long as they are free I suppose they will never adopt it, but in the coming year or two they may be very glad to have brown bread rather than go hungry.  Perhaps they will then see the value of it and stick to it.  But it will not be black, it will be brown.</P>

Deputy Belton, I think it was, said that we seemed to be complacent about the situation.  Well, suppose we are not too complacent; suppose we say that the situation is serious, and that we have to do our very best to grow the food that is required in this country.  Now we are addressing the farmers.  I was reminded the other day that now we are saying the farmers are good fellows, and appealing to them to do their duty to their country.  We are, of course, but when you have soldiers going into battle they do not turn to their general and say: &ldquo;The pay I am getting per day is not enough,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;The bread I am getting is not good enough.&rdquo;</P>

That would be very bad if it were to occur, and therefore it is right to draw attention to it.  Other Deputies want to know whether we have enough seed.  That is all right. But to refer to the bread that is going to come as &ldquo;black bread&rdquo; is simply making mischief and nothing else.  With regard to certain other things which were said, it is better that we should pass over them, and go on to see how we stand.</P>

      <P>Well, we will have white bread if we can.  Perhaps we will succeed in having it.  Deputy Belton complained that we did not store enough wheat.  We had more wheat stored in this country when the war commenced than we had for many years, so we did store considerably.  The Minister for Supplies, in the course of his speech yesterday, quoted himself from the Official Reports as having said on the day we met here when war was declared that we had wheat in store and wheat in prospect from our own farmers sufficient to carry us comfortably on to the 1941 harvest.  That was not a bad thing to be able to say at that time, but he was able to say it.</P>

      <P>Not on the present extraction. Again, on the matter of storage, one of the difficulties which occurred after the 1940 harvest was that practically every available inch of storage was taken up with wheat.  The result was that a good many buyers who would have liked to buy oats and barley, seeing that it was certain to be wanted later on, could not buy it for want of storage space.  That shows that our storage is not unlimited.  In <Col N="1572" /> fact, if we grow 100 per cent. of our requirements of wheat&mdash;and I think we should&mdash;and if it is all put on the market, our storage will be very severely taxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many farmers can store their own wheat as they did in the past.  A point was raised by Deputy Corry, and I just want to refer to it because it was taken up by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  The point which was raised was that a certain dealer bought wheat at 35/- a barrel from the farmers, and now he wants to get a bigger price from the miller.  I think 43/3 was the figure mentioned. I do not know what the quantity is, but it does not matter what the quantity is; I am not concerned about it. The farmer got his 35/-.  If the miller complained to me I would say: &ldquo;Why did you not buy your wheat?  Why were you so slow about filling your quota?&rdquo;  On the other hand, there is no doubt that a dealer could, under our scheme, buy, say, 20,000 barrels of wheat and say: &ldquo;I will hold that until I get £2 10s. a barrel, because I know that somebody must take it in the end.&rdquo;  But that was provided for in the original Cereals Act, because it was foreseen as a thing that might be done.  In the original Cereals Act it is laid down that if such a position arises, and if it is reported to the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Agriculture may serve an order on that dealer to supply that wheat to such a miller at the price named by the Minister for Agriculture.  That will be done if necessary, but it does not affect the price of wheat to the farmer, nor does it affect the price of bread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was always the case. I am not saying they took much out of their own pockets, but I am saying that that was always the law.  With regard to seed wheat, I was asked about supplies.  That is a very fair and sensible question to raise here. We had a big supply of seed laid up. We imported a certain amount of winter seed.  I am dealing with winter wheat first.  We also, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, asked a number of millers and dealers to assemble wheat; that is, we asked them, when they were taking in wheat from the farmer, if they saw what they considered to be a very good sample of winter variety, to put it aside and not to kiln-dry it.  A fair amount was put aside in that way.  In addition to that, a number of farmers kept seed and sowed it themselves.  I cannot give a very accurate estimate, but I think I would not be far wrong in saying that if all the winter seed that we had provided for in that way were used, we should have about 300,000 acres sown. If Deputies are correct when they say that all the winter seed wheat is gone, then there are 300,000 acres of wheat sown.  I do not think that it is all gone. It is true that there is no big quantity to be found anywhere.  The big distributors have distributed most of the wheat to the small retailers, but the small retailers held a certain amount of wheat, and a number of farmers held it, and they are waiting for an opportunity to sow it.  During the last few weeks we asked millers and merchants if they had good winter wheat not yet kiln-dried to let us know, so that we could have it tested for seed.  In addition to that, we are inquiring whether we can import any more seed.  We did import all we possibly could this year. We could not get a lot, but we might get a little more in that way.  It will be seen that we have done a good deal in providing seed of the winter variety.  If there is no winter seed left in a fortnight's time, the acreage of winter wheat will be at least up to my <Col N="1574" /> expectations.  I do not think any Deputy would have expected that we would have exceeded 300,000 acres for winter wheat alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>If that is the position, that all the available winter seed in the country, if sown, will produce only 300,000 acres, where are we going to get seed for the other 300,000 acres which we are informed will be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the 300,000 acres as a minimum.  I think that with the seed we are now getting, and the seed that the farmers are holding and are prepared to sell to their neighbours, we will very much exceed the 300,000 acres before all the winter supplies are used up.</P>

      <P>I would not like to leave the House under the impression that I believe that all the seed is now gone. It is not.  There is a good lot of winter seed left.  It is not so much in the hands of the large distributors.  It is mostly gone out to the small retailers. I think the small retailers hold a considerable amount.  I am advised by the experts in my Department that all the winter varieties can be sown up to the end of February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplies of spring wheat will be considerable and I think we will have as much as will be required. I stated in my broadcast that the supply of spring wheat was not unlimited. I had in mind that if a big number of farmers postponed sowing the wheat until after February we would not have an unlimited quantity. But the calculation cannot be very <Col N="1575" /> exact and I think if we get over 300,000 acres of winter sown that we will have enough of spring seed wheat to do the other 300,000 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really hard to say. I am sure there are Deputies who have spring seed in their own lofts.  We do not know and we can only guess that. Deputies will remember that last year there was a big acreage sown, yet the seed merchants were left with practically all the seed on their hands. The farmers had their own seed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think there will be enough to give us an additional 300,000 acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  With regard to price, there were prices quoted from 45/- to 80/-.  All these prices may be legitimate.  The price of home-grown seed could be as low as 45/-.  I think the merchant who buys seed at 37/6, if he does any cleaning and stores it and then sends it out is giving very good value at 45/-.  But then you may have the local merchant who buys the seed and shifts it out without handling it or having to bear transport charges and in that way there should be some limit to the price of home-grown seed.  I would not like to place a limit on it now.  On the other hand, if a person sends to one of those very reputable growers in England or elsewhere for a barrel of pure line seed, it is possible that by the time he has it here it might reach £3 10s. or £4.  But that is a very small part of the seed used in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are watching the position very closely through our inspectors and also through the county staffs.  We are asking those men to let us know if the price of seed wheat goes up.  If it does, we intend to deal with the situation by some sort of price fixing order. <Col N="1576" /> I do not know whether we have the power to do it in that way, but if not, we may have to call on the Minister for Supplies and ask him to do it under his powers.  I can assure Deputies that my Department is watching the situation to see if the price of seed wheat should increase to any great extent.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke with regard to the credit necessary for the purchase of this seed.  The question of credit is a very big one.  Deputy Belton has one idea about credit and other Deputies have other ideas. Deputy Belton suggests that we might adopt some means of compelling the banks to be a bit more lax with the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not anticipate the debate on my motion; stick to the seed wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Other Deputies have mentioned merely that there is a want of credit, but we have not got any great suggestion.  What are the credit facilities?  First of all, the Department of Agriculture has a credit scheme for implements.  Any application from a farmer for the purchase of implements up to £40 will be considered by the Department of Agriculture. I think we dealt with about 3,000 such claims last year.  We granted the 3,000 and rejected very few.  Deputies will be pleased to know that we very seldom have a bad debt under that scheme.  Applications over £40 go to the Credit Corporation.  Some farmers might be anxious to purchase tractors or reapers and binders or other machinery of the heavier type, and these applications are referred to the Credit Corporation and are considered there in the same way as the smaller applications are considered in the Department of Agriculture.  There were very few applications of that kind last year.  The farmer has definite facilities for credit if he is looking for agricultural machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to seeds and manures, we have considered that question over and over again, not this year, but last year and in earlier years, and I have never been able to think of a better <Col N="1577" /> scheme than the one that is run by the county councils.  Suppose the Department of Agriculture were to run a scheme like that and say they were prepared to give a loan to a farmer to purchase his seed wheat and manures, every Deputy knows that the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture who has to pay up if anything goes wrong&mdash; it is not the Minister&mdash;must be careful how that scheme is administered.</P>
    <P>If an application comes in, he must have a report upon it and have it considered. It would be a slow scheme, no matter how we tried to get over the difficulties or to expedite matters, and, in the end, we would probably give out loans to a lot of people who did not deserve them while people who did deserve them might not receive any assistance.</P>
    <P>I think this is a scheme which is much better administered by the county councils because the councils are composed of men drawn from all over the county and if a farmer makes an application to the county council, there is generally some member who can say that he knows that farmer.  If he has the courage to say that he thinks the man should not get a loan, he will not get it.  I think, therefore, that the county council is the best medium through which a loan scheme like that could be administered but, leaving the county council aside, we have the old method which is always there.  I think probably the great majority of farmers have the same facility that other farmers have had in the past and that is that they go into the local seed merchant. The seed merchant knows the farmer to be an honest man, and even though he knows that the farmer has not a lot of money he feels confident that if he gives him a few barrels of wheat, that farmer, when he sells his wheat in the harvest, will pay for the seed.  That system is being operated all over the country now just as it was 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  It is good business for the merchant, too.  He does admittedly charge 1/- or so extra as a sort of insurance against bad debts but it is a scheme that has always worked. I have been making inquiries through the inspectors of my Department and I <Col N="1578" /> have learned that that practice is being carried on this year at least on as large a scale, if not on a larger scale, as it was in the last three or four years. There is no reason why it should not be carried on on a bigger scale because the merchant has now a better security in the increased price offered for wheat.  I think it is better that that practice should be continued and that we should not interfere.  I often read in the papers of statements by Deputies when they go down the country in which they speak of the Minister for Agriculture interfering with their business and refer to all the inspectors that are on the road.  They say that they can hardly go to bed at night without being inspected by somebody.  They are always complaining about inspectors. I think, therefore, that we should not resort to any new scheme involving the appointment of more inspectors, if it is not absolutely necessary, and I do not think it is necessary in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They have more inspectors than farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they say when they go down the country, but here they want more schemes and more inspectors.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney conveyed the impression that we were concentrating on wheat in all our statements, and on nothing else.  That is not the case.  I have never spoken on this issue of more production without mentioning all the other crops as well. In fact, in some places where I spoke, such as Galway, I certainly devoted more time to potatoes than to wheat, because I know that in a great part of County Galway people believed that they could not grow wheat, but that they could grow potatoes.  I suppose they were right as regards many districts, and at any rate they believed they were.  We stress all the time the necessity for growing more potatoes. As a matter of fact, in our series of broadcasts, the first speaker spoke on wheat, and the second speaker on potatoes, so that we have not overlooked the importance of potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be possible to agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's suggestion that we should count an acre of potatoes as two acres <Col N="1579" /> under the Tillage Order.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that we would probably object to that because we are going by rule of thumb and we do not want the trouble.  That is partly the objection, if you like.  There is no doubt that it would mean very much more inspection if an inspector had not only to calculate the total amount under tillage but also the quantity of land under potatoes.  I do not say that the inspector surveys the land in all cases, but he has to make a calculation at any rate.  An inspector may go on land at the present time and see a field being ploughed.  He is satisfied, for the present at any rate, that that field is going to be tilled for the year, and he signs a certificate showing that a proper percentage of the land is ready.  If Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's suggestion were adopted, he would have to ask the farmer how many acres of potatoes he was going to sow.  The farmer might exaggerate, and the inspector, suspecting that he was exaggerating, would have to go back again after the crops were sown to see if the farmer had given him a proper forecast. At any rate, if we were to grant that concession in respect of potatoes, it is quite possible that other people might come along and make a similar claim in respect of some other crop. Sugar beet or even wheat might be mentioned, and farmers might say that they were making a great effort to grow more wheat, and that they should get more credit than those who were growing oats and barley.  I think, on the whole, that such a claim could not be entertained.</P>
    <P>Certain speakers spoke of allotments. Personally, I am very keen, and I think the Government is very keen, on this question of allotments.  In the past I did not look upon it so much from the point of view of the nation's food supply as I did from the point of view of the benefit conferred on the individual concerned.  In the past I thought of it mainly from the point of view of the advantage it would be to an unemployed man who was becoming almost demoralised because he had nothing to do and who was very despondent probably because of the <Col N="1580" /> struggle to make ends meet on the small amount which he received.  I thought that such a scheme gave him an opportunity to improve himself physically and also to improve, by the production of vegetables of various kinds, the fare on which his family had to exist throughout the year.  Now, however, in addition to considering the benefit that is conferred on the individual himself, we can look upon the scheme as providing an addition to the general pool of foodstuffs in the country.  There is, therefore, an added argument in favour of allotments at present.  We are having the question examined at the moment, in fact, to see whether we can do anything to meet the requests put up by Deputies &mdash;firstly, to ascertain whether it is possible to operate the scheme outside urbanised areas and, secondly, to see if there cannot be some simpler procedure adopted in regard to the acquisition of land.  These two points are being examined, but I am not sure what the result will be.</P>

      <P>As regards the question raised by Deputy Hughes about tractors, I have been speaking to the Minister for Supplies and I find that there is no rigid control of the vapourised oil upon which these tractors are usually run.  These oils may have been somewhat scarce in the past, but I think that there will not be any great difficulty.  Special arrangements are being made for the supply of the fuel requirements of tractors.  Tractors will get first consideration, as far as that particular type of oil is concerned.  If any individual tractor owner has any trouble in getting a supply locally, the Department of Supplies would like to hear from him because we do not want to have our tillage campaign held up for the sake of vapourised oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next question raised was that of manures.  I quite agree with Deputy Hughes that it is only fair to farmers that we should make known the position as soon as possible because, as he said, farmers will be soon starting to sow certain crops&mdash; they may already have sown wheat&mdash; and they want to know what is the total quantity of manures they will be able to get for the various crops and divide it as best they can.  I think we should be able to tell the farmers what the total quantities are.  I think we are very unlikely to be able to get in any more than what was mentioned on the last day the Dáil met.  On that date the Minister for Supplies and I spoke on the question of manures.  We said that about one-half of the phosphates of a normal year and about one-third of the potash would be available. We were then a bit more optimistic about nitrogenous manures; but in that case we will also have about one-half at least.  If a farmer wants to make up his mind how he should use the manures available to him, I think <Col N="1584" /> he should go on that basis, that comparing his supply with last year's, say, he is going to get about one-half in the case of phosphates, one half in the case of nitrogenous manures, and one-third in the case of potash.  That will not be free, it will be in the form of a compound manure.</P>

      <P>That will be stated on the compound manure.  I spoke in some place lately about having those rationed.  What I had in mind was that they will be naturally rationed down the line.  The wholesalers will give the retailers half of what they gave last year and the retailers will presumably give the farmers half of what they got last year.  It is the only form of rationing that can be adopted in present circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If any farmer has that complaint to make he should let us know, because the retailer will be instructed by the wholesaler to distribute it on an equitable basis.  Deputy Hughes raised the question of raw materials for feeding stuffs for our animals.  He thought we might make it a bargaining point with the British Government, that if we are going to supply them with meat, butter, eggs, etc., they in turn should supply us with the raw materials for food for those animals, such as maize, etc.  We have not been lax in that respect.  We have certainly made that point with the British Government on many occasions. We have, however, been met with certain arguments which, from their point of view are, I suppose, convincing enough, although they did not convince us.  In the first place, if shipping is very scarce they argue that it is cheaper to bring a cargo of bacon from Canada than to bring four cargoes of maize from the Argentine to produce that amount of bacon here.  In the second place, if they have their own ships to bring maize or feeding stuffs from the Argentine or America, <Col N="1585" /> their own farmers want them and have as good a right to get them as our farmers, and as their own farmers are not getting them they do not see how we can get them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan talked about the question of compulsory tillage and said that the Government should set a good example.  Well, I have been in communication with the other Departments concerned, and I think you may take it that they will do what is necessary to be done in the tillage line.  The same will apply to farms held by banks and by other people of that kind.  The Order applies to land, no matter who may hold it&mdash;whether it is a receiver or a holder of a mortgage or any other person.  Deputy Cogan also suggested that there should be a moratorium on arrears of land annuities during this tillage compaign.  I think that is too big a question to be dealt with here, but other Deputies, in speaking on that question or speaking around it, said that they personally had found, in dealing with the Land Commission, that the Land Commission was always reasonable in dealing with an individual case, and I am quite sure that if the Land Commission are approached about an individual case and asked to allow a man some little time so as to enable him to sow his crop, such a case will be received sympathetically.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan feels that the Government did not make a sufficient effort to get in artificial manures or to get in their raw materials, and he says that he has been told that there are large quantities of these in some of the neutral countries, including Spain.  I do not think that is true, and if there were any opportunity of getting in more artificial manures to this country I can assure Deputy Cogan that, if we get any indication of where they are to be got, the necessary action will be taken immediately.</P>

      <P>The last question that was raised was the question of the marketing of oats and barley, and whether or not we should give the farmers some guarantee regarding other crops than wheat and beet.  I think that these crops are in a different position.  When we appeal to the farmer to increase tillage, we appeal to him to grow more food, in the first place, for the people of this country, and it is only right that, if the farmer is going to grow more food for the people of this country, the people should give him some guarantee, and the people, through the Dáil and the Government, have given him a guarantee with regard to the price for wheat, and not only have they guaranteed him a price, but they have also guaranteed to take from him at the end of the next harvest all the millable wheat he may grow, whether the war is on or not.  In my opinion, that could not be plainer, nor could it be better from the point of view of the farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so far as it goes.  The same applies to beet.  When we come, however, to crops grown for animal food, it is a different question.  What we do in that case is this: We say to the farmer: &ldquo;Grow all the wheat and all the beet that you can for human consumption, but when you have done that you must remember that you cannot depend on imported feeding stuffs for your animals, and if you want to maintain these animals after the harvest of 1941 you must grow your own feeding stuffs.&rdquo;  Accordingly, we are appealing to the farmer to grow more barley and more oats to feed his animals, and we feel fairly sure that <Col N="1587" /> the farmer will adopt that suggestion if he realises that he may not be able to import these feeding stuffs from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that line of reasoning, would the Minister consider guaranteeing a market for potatoes? Would he guarantee that there would be a market for any surplus of potatoes the farmers may produce?  After all, it is the most important feeding stuff of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the proportion of potatoes grown in this country and sold for human consumption in this country is a very small proportion of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>But it may have to be much greater, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The farmers of this country have always grown sufficient potatoes for the feeding of the population of our towns, but what they sold to the towns is a very small proportion of the total amount of potatoes grown.  In fact, it is negligible, as you will find, if you look at the figures.  The big appeal to farmers here is, not so much to produce for the towns, because that would be easily done, or even for themselves&mdash;except in the congested districts, where we appeal to them to produce for themselves&mdash;the really big appeal is to grow more potatoes for the feeding of their own animals because, as we have pointed out to them, they cannot depend to any extent on the import of feeding stuffs and therefore they must depend on the feeding stuffs they themselves produce.  We also had in mind what Deputy Belton says&mdash;that we are taking away from these feeding stuffs for animals by extracting a bigger percentage of flour from the wheat.  For instance, where we had 30 per cent. extraction from the wheat for feeding stuffs for animals before this, we will now have less than 20 per cent.  That is all taken into consideration and considered also when we are making this appeal to the farmers to grow more oats, barley and so on for the feeding of their own animals.  As <Col N="1588" /> I say, I think the position is very different there.</P>
      <P>Now, when you are talking about giving examples of the price that was given last year for oats, barley and so on, and what was paid by the farmer afterwards for seed, it is not a very convincing argument when you take the very lowest that was paid to a farmer for his oats and the highest that he had to pay back afterwards for seed.  For instance, I know that, this time next year, we will be told that they sold their oats for 11/- a barrel and their barley for 18/- a barrel, but at present the farmer is getting from 20/- to 24/- a barrel for oats and 34/- a barrel for barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is quite true.  At any rate, the price for barley is 34/- a barrel.  Now, when we are considering these questions it is well to consider them on the basis of the truth, as far as we can see it, and try to draw a picture of the position.  It is true that the farmers did sell oats for 11/- after the last harvest, and barley for 18/-. It is almost impossible, however, for any Government to get these things right, and the only example I can think of that would give a true indication of the solution for these problems is that, in areas where you had co-operation between the farmers themselves for buying and selling, these things did not occur.  Deputy Cogan is quite right in saying that co-operation is the only cure for this, and if the farmers would co-operate with one another in the matter of the buying and selling of these particular commodities, there would be no question of the selling of oats and barley at low prices and buying them back afterwards at high prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had three or four speeches from Ministers and, with the exception of the last speaker, we had not much information.  I must say that, as far as the Minister was able, I think he was informative and did not leave us in doubt, so far as his Department was concerned, as to what he was doing and as to the possibilities and probabilities of the future.  Now, I <Col N="1589" /> should like to say that, generally speaking, I was not impressed by the debate.  I was rather surprised last night to hear Deputy O'Reilly and, I think, Deputy Maguire saying that this debate had cleared the air and that it had removed doubts and rumours. Well, that was rather bewildering, because, as a matter of fact, when we heard the Minister for Supplies the situation appeared to be much worse than anyone thought.  While the information given by the Minister for Agriculture this evening was as full as he could give it, it amounts practically to the same thing.  We know where we are now.  If the farmers are going to be asked to produce&mdash;and they must produce&mdash;I am all with the Minister and with the Government in endeavouring to get production, but if they are to produce from one-fifth of their land, with only half of the manures that were available last year for one-eighth of their holdings, the outlook is very poor and bleak.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture referred to black bread and to complaints that were made regarding the mixture of barley or oats.  I am not concerned whether the bread is black or white. I should like to see white bread, but what I think is of importance is the production of bread of some sort.  If we go in for a campaign of growing more wheat, and yet more wheat, the manure position being that stated by the Minister for Agriculture, we are possibly going to land ourselves in a very bad jamb.  There is no use in advising people to grow wheat where possibly they will get a return of only one ton while they could get two tons of oatmeal or barley meal.  We will have to be careful that we do not bankrupt the soil of the country in our efforts to have white bread.  Wheat will only grow on good land and there will not be a decent return unless there is manure for it.  If manures are restricted, and we are assured they are from what the Minister stated, then the outlook for a bumper crop is very poor indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was rather bewildering to listen to the Minister for Supplies yesterday when he was telling us the position <Col N="1590" /> with regard to wheat, particularly when we remembered the statement about supplies he made in the House shortly after the war started in September, 1939.  Putting the ordinary interpretation on the statement made then it would appear that the suggestion was resented by the Minister for Supplies that he was misleading the House and the country.  I am afraid the statement the Minister made in September, 1939, bears that out.  It was made on the 27th September, 1939, and appears in the Dáil Debates, volume 77, column 333.  Speaking on the wheat position he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I can say with confidence that, so far as flour is concerned no matter what happens next year or next year's crop, there will be no difficulty in respect of the supply of flour for two years ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I distinctly remember that statement being made by the Minister for Supplies, and I remember feeling very assured about it.</P>

      <P>27th September, 1939, volume 77, column 333:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I can say with confidence that, so far as flour is concerned, no matter what happens next year or next year's crop...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... there will be no difficulty in respect of the supply of flour for two years ahead.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before that he stated that there was a bumper crop of wheat all over the world, and that there would be no difficulty in getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated previously:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have mentioned already that the position in respect of wheat appears to be very easy.  Already, as everybody knows, we have substantial stocks of wheat in the country, but apart altogether from these stocks, there has been in every country in the world a bumper crop of wheat in this year, and instead of <Col N="1591" /> the outbreak of war leading to a curtailment in the supply of wheat, there is, in fact, ample wheat on offer, and, consequently, no difficulty is to be anticipated in respect of the supply of flour.  That is the position as it is now, and as it is likely to be for a considerable period ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since the Minister made that statement we had a bumper harvest of wheat, and grew in this country half of our requirements.  It is when one comes up against a statement like that, and relates it to the present position, as disclosed in the statements made yesterday and to-day, that one ceases to wonder if the country feels stampeded. Is it any wonder that the petrol situation should have caused panic?  Is it any blame to the people if they feel that, although they are promised ample supplies of tea, it may be cut off altogether? If there is anything necessary at the present time it is confidence.  I do not want to undermine the confidence that is necessary.  I do not want to undermine what was referred to last night by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as the solidarity of the nation at the present time.</P>
    <P>But the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated then that he now thought this motion was put down, not for the purpose of eliciting information, not for the purpose of clearing the air, but for the purpose of showing there was a kick left in the old dog yet.  As a matter of fact I would like to remind the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is not a kick that is left in the dog but a bite, and if the old dog leaves the trace of his teeth in the thigh of the Minister for Supplies, it might be a very good job for the people.  If anybody thinks, because there is a war on, and because people in charge of the affairs of the country are muddling through somehow, that we ought to come in here and be a kind of mutual admiration society, and pretend to the country that everything is all right, that is not good policy. Instead of that we should be candid and open about our affairs.  If mistakes have been made let them be exposed and let that be a guide for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> The Minister for Supplies does not appear to think that there is any fault whatever with his Department with regard to this petrol situation.  That situation has been dealt with.  I do not want to follow in the track of other Deputies, but I feel that I ought to say this that when a Minister for Supplies was appointed he was appointed for reasons that everyone thought were good ones, to see that supplies were maintained as far as possible, and that if there was a break in supplies, there would be no abrupt dislocation of business.  I do not think the luxury of a Minister for Supplies with a huge staff would be justified in any other circumstances.  What happened? Could what happened have been avoided?  Was it not reasonable to suppose that the Minister for Supplies, knowing the risk that attached not alone to petrol supplies but to all sea-borne traffic, would make it his business to ensure that there would not be chaos or any abrupt dislocation of business, by curtailing the supply of petrol, say for a month before, when motor users can do now almost with one-fourth of the supply?</P>
    <P>Was it not reasonable for the Minister for Supplies to ensure that some kind of reserve would be built up so that that dislocation would not occur?</P>
    <P>The position of the Minister for Supplies reminded me very forcibly of something that happened in my own district quite recently. The local doctor went out on a sick call at night.  He did not usually drive his car himself but had a man to do it.  On this occasion his man was absent and he drove himself.  He was on a very difficult road but eventually found his patient's home.  Now, right in front of the door, at the side of the road, there was a big dyke or ditch and he found it would be very difficult for him to turn his car there.  He brought out the man of the house with a lantern. The man did not understand motor cars.  The doctor asked the man to help him turn the car, as he did not want to get into the ditch.  The man held the lantern and the doctor started his car; he went forward, reversed; went forward and reversed, again and <Col N="1593" /> again&mdash;and eventually landed in the ditch; and the man with the lantern said: &ldquo;All right, you are in it now, sir.&rdquo;  That is exactly what the Minister for Supplies said to us.  No attempt was made to create any kind of reserve of supplies but as soon as the crash came the Minister said: &ldquo;You are in it now, sir.&rdquo;  Yes, and we left our cars on the roadside.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister for Supplies could have done better than that.  If he is not able to do better than that, I do not see that there is any justification for his job at all.  In speaking on the wheat position, the Minister for Agriculture dealt with the price of seed wheat and said he felt that possibly something might have to be done about it in the future, but not at the moment.  As a matter of fact, I want to tell the Minister for Agriculture that he is late in doing it and that he should have done it before now.  I got a circular from the Minister for Supplies asking me to go out and advise people to grow wheat.  What is the position?  In my locality people grew wheat last year, sold it at 35/- a barrel, and sold all, as they did not consider it a good policy to put by some seed, but said they would buy new seed.  Then 35/- a barrel was supposed to be an economic price for wheat, and it was not a bad price by any means.  They sold the wheat at 35/- a barrel and now they are confronted with the situation that, if they want to buy two barrels of wheat to sow, they must pay £6 for it.  Yet I am supposed to go out and advise them to do that. Instead of saying, like the Minister for Agriculture, that it is too early to fix the price of seed wheat, I say that it is much too late.  The position at present is that not alone are farmers&mdash;the growers&mdash;getting 50/-, 55/- and 57/6 a barrel for wheat, but it is being bought by racketeers and people who want to make a further profit on it, as they feel that this campaign is going to rush the country into a kind of panic and that they will get any price they ask for seed wheat.  Yet the Minister for Agriculture thinks it was too early to interfere.</P>
    <P>Now, if we are in earnest about this <Col N="1594" /> job, we will have to attend to all these matters and we cannot expect the people of the country to respond únless they get a fair deal.  I know it is possibly difficult for the Government to meet the requirements of the farmers at present.  Probably, it is very difficult for them even to lay their minds down to do that as, so far as I know, they never have had any plan for farming in this country; they never have considered it at all.  As I said before on a number of occasions in this House, what appeared to me to be the besetting sin of the Government was that, because they always preached a self-sufficiency policy in this country, they thought it was operating; and when we did want it and wanted to be self sufficient in the production of cereals or crops, they thought the thing was there, but it was not.</P>
    <P>After the cease fire of the silly episode called the economic war, I remember speaking in this House on the absolute necessity at that time of getting this country back to increased production and I advocated at that time, here and all over the country, that pressure should be brought upon the Government to make available supplies of artificial manures for every man who wanted it at a cheap rate.  That went unheeded, and what happened? The present Minister for Supplies&mdash;who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;saw to it that no manure was allowed into this country unless it was able to jump a tariff.  That continued and there was still a quota order on that manure even long after the war started.  It is really hard to expect people who did that to do anything sensible in the present crisis.</P>
    <P>I remember that some time after the war started&mdash;probably last Summer&mdash;I got a summons to attend and give evidence before the Agricultural Commission. The day was fixed and they sent me a copy of a memorandum&mdash;a précis of evidence which I had sent on to them a year or a year and a half before that.  When I got this précis of evidence and read it down, I thought that it was the silliest thing in the world for the Agricultural Commission to be sitting at that time considering <Col N="1595" /> the type of evidence which I proposed giving in normal times.  Just then the world was crashing around our ears.</P>
    <P>I said so to the Agricultural Commission. I wrote and asked them not to call me; but the fixture had been made and they asked me to come along, so I went and told the Commission on that day&mdash;and I mentioned it here afterwards&mdash;that what ought to have been done at that time was that, in addition to setting up a defence conference, there should have been also a conference or council on production, and the basis of it was there.  The then Agricultural Commission, instead of considering matters for normal times, should be considering what should be done for this country in the present critical juncture.  But no steps were taken: the thing was just let carry along anyhow.  Now we are in the position that the land of this country is to be impoverished for the want of manure.  Less cattle are being in-fed and consequently there is less manure on the farms and the prospect held out to us here to-day is that we will have less than 50 per cent. of the supply of artificial manures which we had last year.  It is a poor prospect.</P>
    <P>I would like to lay stress on this point.  It was mentioned yesterday by Deputy Dillon.  Whatever industries we have in this country are largely dependent on the importation of the raw materials, which can be met only by the sale of something else from this country, and that something else must, and always will, be agricultural produce. We ought to be careful now that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  We may do that.  In the Minister's desire for wheat and yet more wheat, without any manure, we may come to the situation in which we will not have any export trade or any import trade.  That will be a terrible position if it arises.</P>
    <P>Probably we would all be the better of clearing our own minds and the minds of the people of the country on the real state of affairs, but there is nothing to be gained by the attitude taken up by the Minister for Supplies. There is no use in pretending that a <Col N="1596" /> game of bluff is going to carry us over this situation.  It will not.  We are all prepared to stand in, as far as we can stand in, in producing food for the people.  I do not stand in with the people who say that a bargain ought to be struck now and a revolver held at the heads of the community to get a price, or for any other condition as to the production of food.  The farmers of this country are patriotic enough to do their job, and they will do it.  They have not got a fair crack of the whip in the past.</P>
    <P>It is hard for them to get it now because circumstances are against them, but I say they can be relied upon to do the right thing.  The Government ought to be honest and straight with them, and tell them exactly what is the position.  The business of this country ought not to be neglected, as it was neglected in the case of petrol, and then have an attempt made to try and bluff it off by saying that nothing could be done: that the Government did not get a telegram from anyone to say that the tankers were going to be sunk.  Is not that too childish?  Was there not a huge risk there immediately the war started?  Did we not know, as an isolated unit in the world without ships of our own, the position we were in, and the risks we were taking, and was it not the job of the Minister for Supplies to build up reserves of the things that we need?  Now, we have a work to do and we are prepared to do it.  We are prepared to stand in as far as our assistance goes.  We want the Government to be careful that, in their efforts to provide the requirements of the people, they will not do something that will injure the people of the country eventually.  We have to be very careful in the steps we take.  I put this to the Government that, whatever they do, let them be candid, open and honest about the real position. We know now that we have not a supply of flour to carry us up to next harvest, although the Minister for Industry and Commerce assured us in July, 1939, that we had a supply for two years, no matter what happened next season's harvest.  That is not playing fair with the people of this country.  If the Government want a <Col N="1597" /> response from the people they will have to be straight with them.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to say that I hope the Minister for Agriculture will undertake at once to fix some price for seed wheat.  If 35/- a barrel was regarded as an economic price for the man who disposed of his wheat for flour, then there ought to be a reasonable price fixed, not so much ahead of that, for seed wheat.  The man who has to keep back his wheat for seed ought to get a chance as well as the man who grew his wheat and sold it for flour.  If the Minister does not do something about that, then I say he is neglecting his job.</P>

      <P>During the interval that has elapsed since 3 o'clock this afternoon I was called five times to the gate of Leinster House to see taxi-men who complained to me that, although their cars were registered early in January, they now have no petrol. They informed me that arrangements have been made to supply a number of them through one garage, but there are others with credit accounts in outside garages who are not able to get supplies because of the fact that there are not sufficient supplies in those garages. I promised them that I would mention the matter to Deputies and bring it to the notice of the Department concerned, in the hope that a sufficient supply of petrol will be made available to enable them to earn a living.  Some of them told me that if they did not get a supply they would have to hand in their cars and seek assistance elsewhere to enable themselves and their families to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise principally for the purpose of drawing attention to the fact that there is a very keen rationing system in operation in the poorer quarters of the City of Dublin.  There is the rationing of tea and of butter.  The majority of the people living in those quarters have not the money to buy butter.  We have been frequently told in this House that the average meal of a Dublin tenement dweller, unemployed or casually employed, is tea, bread and margarine three times a day.  As we know, it is mostly cheap tea they <Col N="1598" /> use.  Hence I was amazed this morning when I heard the Minister for Supplies say that there was no cheap tea available, and not likely to be in the future. When I heard that, I asked myself where are those people going to get the money to buy the dearer quality of tea for their principal meal, consisting of tea, bread and margarine.  Are they going to be left without tea, because that is what the Minister's statement amounted to?</P>
    <P>When going through Parliament Street yesterday I saw pneumatic drills being employed to break up the ice, which was about six inches thick. In Anne Street today a pickaxe was being used to break up ice of similar thickness.  We have been informed that coal is going to go up in price.  I am sure it will be a shock to the House to hear that there must be from 6,000 to 8,000 or 10,000 families in the City of Dublin to-day with bare, empty fire-grates, in homes where you have cold, shivering children due to the fact that coal is the price it is to-day.  I am anxious to hear from the Minister whether there is any reason why coal should have gone up in price within the last month, or why there should be any further increase in the near future, I suggest that some arrangement should be made to provide coal and tea for those people at prices which they can afford to pay.  Some are in receipt of unemployment relief or home assistance, some are casually employed and others of them are lowly-paid workers.  To tell us that there is plenty of dear tea in the city and that the shopkeepers and wholesalers are getting their share of it, and that there is plenty of dear coal in the city, is certainly of no benefit to the 10,000 people I have referred to, who to-day have empty grates in their homes and whose children are cold and wet.  I suggest the time has come for the Government to appoint a committee to go into all these cases and report on the best method of providing for that type of person.  In the matter of supplies, these poor people will be in competition with those who have good money to spend and, as we have been told, the latter can get tea.  But what <Col N="1599" /> is to become of the poorer people of the city who have very little money except what they get in the form of home help or unemployment assistance?</P>
    <P>I want to join with those members of the House who have protested against the Dáil not being called together oftener, not that I think the Government have anything to conceal, but some of us are afraid that they have very little to reveal.  The little there is to reveal should be given to the members of the House by a Minister in the elected Assembly of the people.  We, the elected members, should not have to wait to read prominent announcements in the newspapers or to hear them on the wireless.  This is the place where these announcements should be made.</P>
    <P>I heard with pleasure to-day references to the purchase of ships for Ireland's trade.  Some time ago, I raised the question of a mercantile marine and I was told by the Minister that the matter was engaging his attention. While we are talking about the purchase of ships, I should like to inform the House that there are 800 to 1,000 shipbuilders in Dublin who would be very anxious to see the foundations of a new ship placed in the dockyards which are ready to take them, so that, when they are finished the repair work on which they are engaged, they would not have to wait for another repair job. They could go on to the building of a new ship.  I believe there are, at least, three and, perhaps, four yards in the Twenty-Six Counties which could start to build ships immediately.  These yards have the men and they are waiting for an order from the Government to go ahead.  It would give much-needed and continuous employment and it is an industry that, I am glad to say, pays reasonably good wages.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to see that men who are engaged in industry and who require petrol to carry on their avocations be supplied without delay. It would be deplorable to see owners or drivers of these vehicles forced to apply for some form of assistance.  I <Col N="1600" /> took a note of a few phrases used to-day. These dealt with coal and tea.  I have a note of the difficulties that people I represent have in purchasing these things.  I have also taken a note of the prospects of a dearer loaf.  Some people will say that it is better to have a dearer loaf than no bread.  That is all very fine for those who can afford to buy the dearer loaf, but what about the people who have £1 a week, or less, and who have four or five children?  Every half-penny a loaf goes up in price means that, at the end of the week, there is a loaf less on the table of these people.  I earnestly hope the Government will consider the advisability of calling the House together somewhat oftener so as to give us an opportunity to put our views before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise because of certain remarks made by Deputy Brennan who comes from a neighbouring county.  Some of his remarks I thoroughly agree with and others I thoroughly disagree with.  I am prepared to concede that members on the chief Opposition and Labour and Independent Benches are as much interested in maintaining the food supply of our people as we are, but I fear one thing-that is, that they have a prejudice against the growing of wheat.  At a time like this, they should not allow that prejudice to run away with them.  Deputy Brennan said that the Minister for Agriculture should not push this thing too far, that the fact of asking people to grow wheat, particularly when there was not an adequate supply of artificial manure, would tend to bring about a state of affairs not at all desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the land of East Galway fairly well and I also know North Roscommon.  I respectfully suggest to Deputy Brennan that, on the greater portion of this land, wheat can be grown better without artificial manure than with it, because it is good, rich land.  When you put artificial manure on rich land and then sow wheat, the danger is that if the harvest weather is unfavourable&mdash;if there is too much rain&mdash;it will all &ldquo;lodge.&rdquo;  You can grow <Col N="1601" /> a better acreage of wheat on rich land without putting on artificial manure than with the over-use of artificial manure.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the difficulty of growing wheat.  I happened to be in the Library yesterday evening and I took down a book called the <i>Gazetteer of Ireland.</i>  I found there that in 1835&mdash;106 years ago&mdash;there were sold in the market of Ballinasloe 137,184 barrels of wheat.  That was at a time when, I suppose, we had no artificial manures and no tractors and when there was very little talk of petrol.  I am quite sure that what was possible 106 years ago is possible to-day.  Deputy Brennan mentioned one thing which was also mentioned by other speakers&mdash;the supply and price of seed wheat.  I am in thorough agreement with Deputy Brennan when he says that the price of seed wheat should be controlled.  It, certainly, should be controlled.  In part of my constituency, for the past couple of months, the price of seed wheat was as high as £3 15s. 0d. per barrel.  While it is possible for us to go out and ask people to purchase a barrel of seed wheat so as to grow an acre for their own use, they are not prepared to pay £3 15s. 0d. per barrel for a number of barrels so as to feed the community, the risk being on the part of the growers.  That is the difficulty I see in increasing the acreage under wheat. As regards the suggested difficulty of growing wheat, I cannot understand it at all where you have good, rich land which has been under grass for a number of years.  It would be better not to let the people use artificial manures on these lands.  There are varieties of spring wheat in use in this country for some years and it is quite possible to sow them as late as the 20th April and have a very good crop. I saw Diamante and Attle wheat put down as late as the 25th April and they produced ten barrels to the statute acre without the use of any artificial manures.  When that was possible in 1939 and 1940, I believe we should trust to the kindness of Providence&mdash; and we have to be thankful for a lot in that respect&mdash;to do the rest for <Col N="1602" /> us, if we have the will to sow the wheat.  Nobody should put imaginary obstacles in the way of wheat cultivation, so that we will be able to rest assured that we will get 600,000 or 700,000 acres of wheat sown.  No matter what people may say about other kinds of food, such as oatmeal and potatoes, the most palatable food and the staple food of the people is flour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a debate in which we all should speak what is in our minds.  Plain speaking is what is needed, and I am very glad that some Deputies have spoken very bluntly indeed. That is what we were sent here by our constituents to do, and we do not very often have an opportunity of doing so.  A number of speakers have already complained that the Dáil is not summoned sufficiently frequently. I should like to join my voice with those who have complained.  I think the Dáil should be summoned very much oftener for two reasons&mdash; reasons equally important to the Government and to members of this House.  In the first place, whether we like it or not, there is growing up a feeling that this body is becoming useless. It has gone beyond the length of conversation and has taken the form of articles in the Press and letters to the Press.  In order to preserve our democratic institutions and enable the Government to maintain the law, it is necessary that the body from which government derives its authority should not fall into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason is that in September, 1939&mdash;a day or two after the outbreak of war&mdash;a Bill was passed under which the right was given to the Government to legislate, as I may say, by decrees.  The general feeling was that this House gave those powers to the Government at the time on the assumption that, at regular intervals, this House would be summoned for the purpose of discussing the matters enacted by way of decree and supplementing or criticising them.  For these two reasons, it is highly desirable, at a time like this, that the Dáil should be, if I may use the expression, almost in permanent session.  Without being in <Col N="1603" /> the confidence of the Government or knowing the secrets of government, but acting upon my own reasoning, I have no doubt whatsoever that the situation at present is as serious as human language can describe it.  I have only got to contrast the situation of this country with its situation about two years ago.  One has only got to open the papers any day to realise that at present we are practically as isolated from the rest of the world as if we were some sort of planet.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the getting of ships and supplies.  Matters have reached such a stage now, during the second year of the war, that we do not know whether we shall be able to get bottoms in which to bring essential foodstuffs to this country.  I am not criticising anybody for that. There is enough criticism&mdash;criticism with which I agree.  What I am concerned with is how this matter is to be dealt with in the future.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage now where we cannot get even a rowing boat to bring stuff to this country.  In 1939, according to the Statistical Abstract, 11,061 ships entered the ports of this State carrying cargoes.  They were of varying tonnages and came from different countries.  It is right to say that a very large proportion of these ships came from Great Britain, but they came with cargoes that were transhipped in Great Britain from other parts of the world.  That is how the position works out as regards ships. How does it work out with regard to the value of the cargoes?  We imported in that year, under the head of foodstuffs, drink and tobacco, £11,545,000 worth of goods.  That takes stock of the position with the two tests&mdash;the number of ships and the actual value of the imports that have been cut off as a result of the war.  What we have to do is to face up to the reality of the position as it exists and find the best way to deal with it.  The solution amounts to this&mdash;to ask the agricultural community to accept the burden of filling the mythical holds of the ships that came here in former years and to make up the difference between what is <Col N="1604" /> coming in now and what came in heretofore. That is the only thing that can be done and it should be done at once. This debate has, to a certain extent and in certain ways, turned upon the means by which increased production is to be got from the soil of this country.  I submit that, had the members of the agricultural community had conceded to them the facilities that were urged from this side of the House as necessary to meet the necessities of the situation during the past two or three years, it would not be so necessary now to call for this enormously increased production from the soil. With some knowledge, both as a person who farms land himself and who knows his neighbours who dwell beside him, I have always advocated the necessity for credit for the members of the farming community.  The Minister for Agriculture this evening dealt with the question of credit and I am sorry that I had not an opportunity of speaking before he spoke, because I would have put my point of view to him.  It is absolutely necessary in normal times that certain less fortunate members of the farming community should have available some ready and easily accessible means of obtaining credit at the commencement or during the pendency of the farming year.  There is hardly a business in this country that is not run, to a certain extent, on credit.  There is not a public board in this country that does not run its business, to a certain extent, on credit before it gets in its rates or taxes.</P>
    <P>The same thing obtains amongst the members of the farming community who run their farms as a business.  It is true that there is a great number who can afford to do without credit but, like every other business, there must be some simple means of providing credit for the farmers during the year.  The sole judges of whether or not a farmer is credit-worthy at the present time are the joint stock banks and they will not give a farmer credit unless he has ample security.  From their own point of view they may be acting rightly, but there should be some means of providing the farmer with credit.  Such means do exist in the British Dominions beyond the seas. <Col N="1605" /> They have chattel mortgages in Canada.  I do not know what they call them in Australia.  But when new land is opened out in those districts credit is available for people who come from Europe as emigrants with nothing in their pockets except possibly a pocket handkerchief or a few other things. They go on to virgin soil and the Government, from whom they are entitled to ask nothing, provides them with ready means of credit and it does not involve a whole host of inspectors and it does not involve their going down on their knees to the banks or raising heavy mortgages on their homesteads. There should be a ready means of credit and that credit should be available to the farming community in normal times.  The present crisis, so far as the deficiency in our food supply is concerned, is the result to a large extent of the fact that farmers have been physically unable to increase the production from the soil.</P>
    <P>The next matter that I come to&mdash;and I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here&mdash;is the question of the marketing of the crops at the end of the season.  Some farmers are in the position that they have storage facilities. Other farmers are in the position that although they have storage facilities. they cannot afford to wait but they have to sell at perhaps a loss.  But those who have storage facilities can wait until the price gets better towards the end of the year.  The reply of the Minister for Agriculture to that is that there is a guaranteed price for wheat and that that is a price that should appeal to everybody and should induce every person to sow a crop in the soil. But so far as I understand the tilling of the soil, there is a rotation of crops. Taken in proper rotation, the soil will take wheat, not every year, but every few years, and while you are guaranteeing the price from a particular acre, apparently, for one year, you are really guaranteeing the price for two or three or perhaps four years.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to take the best out of that soil for one season and to leave it barren for the other two or three or four.  My submission to the Minister is that there should be a guaranteed <Col N="1606" /> price for all crops which have to be grown for the purpose of providing the food supply of this country, because it is fictitious to say in connection with a certain field that you are going to get 35/- or 40/- or whatever the price is for your wheat when you are going to lose the value of the crops for some years after it, when you have got to put your hand in your pocket and re-manure the land and possibly have to go to the expense of putting it back into grass again.  This set of facts exists in normal times.  How much more important is it at the present time to provide adequate credit facilities and guaranteed prices?</P>
    <P>We are faced here&mdash;and I do not minimise it at all; I go further than any speaker to-day&mdash;with a gigantic problem.  As a person, I hope, of commonsense, following what is happening in the world to-day, I believe that if we do not take care we are not far from famine.  We have been talking here for the last two days on the basis that the harvest of this country is always a success.  What is going to happen if the harvest is a failure?  We had a particularly good year last year, a particularly dry year. We are talking now in figures of the deficiency between the results of last year's crop and what was imported that has to be produced this year.  What is going to happen if there is a failure of the crop?  We are going all out on wheat.  A Deputy on the opposite benches who spoke just now said that we on this side of the House are against wheat.  I am not against wheat.  I have been growing wheat for some years.  But there is this danger, that the wheat crop is the crop that, under adverse weather conditions here, is the most likely to fail.  We know what happened in the history of this country in the past, in the days of the famine, when a similar set of circumstances occurred.</P>
    <P>The problem that has to be faced here is a gigantic problem.  It is rather difficult to find out how many acres the Minister for Agriculture has advised the Minister for Supplies are necessary in order to make up the deficiency in our foodstuffs for man and beast <Col N="1607" /> this year, but reading various statements that were made and taking a mean average figure, I have come to the conclusion that the figure in the Minister's mind is the figure of 1,000,000 acres.  I think it is a figure that has been mentioned in this House and it relates to wheat, oats, potatoes and, I think, barley.  I am not quite sure either whether that extra 1,000,000 acres that is asked for is asked for as from, say, the beginning of this month or the beginning of the autumn, but at all events, it is 1,000,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies in this House realise what the cultivation of 1,000,000 acres means?  As far as possible I always keep away from figures.  I prefer to deal with round facts rather than with figures but, as an example to this House, I would like to point out exactly what the cultivation of 1,000,000 acres means.  Once again I go to this admirable work, the Statistical Abstract for 1940.  I take the figures for the year 1939.  In respect of the crops of which the extra acreages are sought, with careful, planned cultivation, careful farming economy, year by year, the total cultivated land of this State in the year 1939 was only 184,000 acres more than the extra acreage that was asked for by the Minister during the last few days.  In other words, practically at a moment's notice, we are asked to double the area that is usually cultivated in this country. That is a stupendous task.  It would be a stupendous task under ordinary circumstances.  It is a much more stupendous task under the circumstances that exist at the present time&mdash; shortage of manures, high prices for seeds and so forth.  Therefore, the position is that, however necessary it was to provide the individual farmer with credit and with guaranteed prices in normal times, it is much more necessary to do so to-day during this time of crisis because I believe what the Minister has said; I believe in order to prevent the possibility of famine and starvation in this country it is necessary to till that extra acreage.  It is necessary to win from the soil the maximum amount of food possible and, believing <Col N="1608" /> that it is necessary for the success of that object, I impress upon the Government the necessity of providing rapid and easy methods of credit, and proper guaranteed prices.  Take the position. If my figures as quoted here are correct, it means that the ordinary small farmer, who, in 1939, in his ordinary farming economy, was tilling perhaps 15 acres, has now got to till an extra ten acres at least.  He has got to do that slightly towards the end of the season; he has got to go into a market in which there will probably be a competition for seed; perhaps he will have to employ extra labour.  He has got to do all those things in a period of emergency, and, while he may have all the will in the world to do it, while meetings of county committees of agriculture may be held all over the country, and while the Minister for Agriculture may go down there to impress upon the local people the seriousness of the situation, it will be a physical impossibility for a man who has no money in his pocket, and no credit, to get the necessary extra seeds or to pay the extra labour which may be necessary for the cultivation of those ten acres.  The man who tilled 100 acres has to till about 90 extra acres, and so on, right down from the biggest farmers in the land to the smallest.  It is not with any motive of criticising the additional tillage necessary in this country that I make those remarks; it is with the object and the desire of seeing the extra tillage and proper returns obtained.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk here about wheat.  I have already stated that I believe that, in the event of a bad harvest here, the wheat crop is the one likely to suffer most.  There has also been much talk here about black bread and brown bread and white bread, but what I should like to emphasise is that it may not be a question of black bread or brown bread or white bread; it may be a question of no bread at all.  If that is so we want to prepare some substitute food, and, therefore, we should go all out to advocate increased production of potatoes, vegetables, and other suitable crops so that we will be able to bridge the gap in the unfortunate event <Col N="1609" /> of the harvest in this country being a failure.  We do not always get years as good as last year, and we may not have a good harvest this year.  Even if we do have a good harvest, I gather that we are going to be put to the pin of our collar to fill the gap.  On this side of the House we could say a lot about the reasons why the present situation has been brought about.  We could bring that home by arguing against the v a r i o u s Government Departments.  I do not intend to do so.  In common with every other member of this House I have a stake in this country and I have to live in this country.  We are cut off not only physically but, I believe, sympathetically from practically the rest of the world.  We have got to live on ourselves alone.  The petrol business brought the matter to a head so far as the public is concerned.  There will be something else next week; there will be something the week after.  From on high there has fortunately up to now shone down on this country the blessing of peace; we have been able to avoid the horrors of war.  Let us hope that, in addition to that, we will be able to avoid the horrors of famine.  I believe we can only do so if we all march together in a sincere desire to meet not a problem of petty politics but a problem of life and death; not a problem as to whether black bread or brown bread or white bread is more suitable, but a problem as to whether there is enough food on this island to keep us all alive.  We must step together for that, and perhaps out of evil may come good and that when the descendants of Celt and Norman and Dane meet in this isolated spot in the world, and standing together with the descendants of Elizabethan and Cromwellian, we may find the only problem that really matters in the end is the preservation of life and energy in the country in which we live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking this motion at its face value, one was led to believe that it was tabled for the purpose of getting information regarding our present supplies, and for the purpose of conserving supplies and ensuring that as many essential supplies as possible <Col N="1610" /> were got into this country. I agree with Deputy Esmonde that this is no time for playing Party or petty politics.  To my mind, unless we work unitedly and wholeheartedly, our people will be exposed to grave hardships and grave dangers.  I regret the action of some of the Opposition leaders who, when addressing the House on this subject, spent more of their time in indicating and attacking the Minister for Supplies regarding a matter over which he had not full control but, in reality, very little control. I also wish to deprecate the allegation made by a number of Deputies that motor owners were cajoled or threatened into taking out road licences for this year.  That is untrue. As far as I can see, when taxing time came around, there was a reluctance on the part of a good many motor owners to tax their cars, and I never heard one word about trying to cajole or threaten them until I heard it here from, I think, Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>The saddest part of this debate is that a number of the Front Bench Opposition leaders do not seem to realise the seriousness of the situation. They do not seem to realise that this is no time for frivolous and petty attacks on political opponents.  From listening to their speeches here last evening and to-day one would get the impression that they expected the Minister for Supplies to be a modern Moses, who with a rod would strike a rock, from which a stream of sparkling petrol would gush forth.  We are not living in an age of miracles.  This is an age of grim, and, unfortunately, tragic realities, and I think the members of this House should realise that and conduct themselves accordingly.  I take it from what we have been told here that the situation regarding the supply of petrol for the remaining portion of the year is none too bright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Supplies that if economies are to be effected in any commodity, the sooner they are effected the better.  I would not like to see any man put off the road because of a shortage of petrol. I know that the humblest motor driver, <Col N="1611" /> the hackney man, and the richest man in the land who drives his car for pleasure, are in normal times entitled to act very much as they please and I realise that the more petrol that can be purchased by these people the better the return to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the important item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>But when we have to conserve our supplies of petrol I suggest there should be a careful study of the whole situation and full allowance should be made for the running of essential and national services.  I suggest, also, that public wastage in the consumption of petrol should be eliminated. You have a situation here regarding transport which is all right in normal times, but not in times like these.  Take this city as an example. You have petrol-driven buses running from it into the country, going down to the chief towns, in competition with the railways, and both the buses and the trains are under the control of the one company.  So far as the south is concerned, the company have a full monopoly of both road and rail services. I may be asked what will we do with those people who will be put out of employment as a result of this change over.  I do not like this change over, but if you are forced to economise you must cut out the services that are least essential.</P>
      <P>Some of the vans for delivering bread, milk and other essential commodities are reduced in their petrol allowances while, at the same time, you will see buses running parallel with the railway line for miles, buses that have a petrol consumption probably giving only five or six miles to the gallon.  You will also find in certain areas vans, particularly bread vans, going into towns to deliver bread to the inhabitants and these are towns where probably there are one or two bakeries. That is a pure waste of petrol.  I suggest also that public officials and others who get a mileage allowance for their cars should not be given any concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> These concessions should be retained for the hackney car men.  You have all over the country officials who get 4d., 5d., or 6d. a mile for running their own cars.  They run them through the country and they get two incomes at the same time, their own and the wage of the hackney car man.  I think that is not fair.</P>
    <P>I should like the Department of Supplies to make sure that whatever supply of oil is in the country for the running of tractors and the lighting of ordinary country lamps should be conserved as much as possible purely for tractor use, as we will have to depend from next harvest onwards on the food we can grow in our own country.  A very high percentage, probably 80 per cent. of the threshing mills in the country are driven by tractors using ordinary paraffin oil.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of food supplies and I will first take human food, namely, wheat and potatoes. Our information is that from next harvest onwards we will have to depend on the food we can grow here.  It appears that we have got to depend on it as there does not seem to be any likelihood of imports from other countries. There are certain economies that could be made.  If it is contemplated to put an admixture in the flour of either barley or oats, why not get down to it immediately?  For instance, if in normal circumstances our wheat supply would last for six months, when you add one-sixth of an admixture will you not then get another six months' supply out of your wheat and why wait until next harvest? To my mind that is a thing that should be done immediately.  Also, if the people of the country, and particularly the people in the towns and cities, will co-operate they could do a lot to conserve our wheat and bread supplies by just changing their diet slightly, consuming more potatoes and less bread.</P>
    <P>I think the crop of potatoes grown last year in this country was probably the best in living memory.  If a certain amount of retrenchment with regard to supplies of wheat could be made, would not that also help to prolong our supplies?  I should like to know from the Minister for Supplies or some <Col N="1613" /> other responsible authority if there is any simple system of preserving potatoes over a period of three or six months for the purpose of human food. I know that there is a system of preserving potatoes for animal feeding over a pretty long period, but I wonder could that system be applied to the preservation of potatoes for human consumption?</P>
    <P>I thought that Deputy Esmonde's speech was most helpful.  I know that we need not expect much artificial manure this year, and it is quite possible that an intensive wheat drive or general tillage drive may impoverish the land somewhat, but what is the land for?  Is it not for man's use and benefit?  Down the centuries, our people have been fighting for land and for the assertion of their right to own land.  In that fight, the people of the towns and cities united with the men who lived in the countryside.  Is it not now time that the land itself and the people who own it, should contribute something towards helping the people generally to exist?</P>
    <P>The saddest feature of this drive for more food and more wheat which I have seen, I witnessed when coming up to this House on last Wednesday evening. As the Deputies from the South, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle himself, know, the Great Southern Railway runs right through the heart of the Golden Vale.  I dare say that is the most fertile district in Ireland.  The Golden Vale at one time was Ireland's wheat belt, but what is it to-day? Nothing but grass.  As far as the eye could see, beautiful verdant fields were growing nothing but grass for animal feeding.  I think I could honestly say that not 1 per cent. of that land was put under the plough during 1941.  I think it is a shocking state of affairs that that should be so, and I think that the responsible Government of the day would be wanting in its duty and, in fact, committing a crime against the Irish people in the face of the pressing danger that confronts us, if it did not compel the people of that district to do their share in the tillage drive.  We have heard a lot of talk about artificial manures, but there are no artificial <Col N="1614" /> manures required for that particular area.  Why, the surface of the land there, if carted away, is rich enough to fertilise a large portion of North Cork, and West Cork and Kerry.  It is sufficiently rich to be self-fertilising and yet the people there, as far as anyone passing up and down on the train can see, are not doing their duty to themselves and their country.  There may be an excuse for that because tillage is an art, and when people get out of the practice of carrying on ordinary tillage, they lose that art.  It may take them some time to recover it, but there are plenty of efficient men in the Department, and plenty of men outside, who could be employed in a temporary way and sent into districts like that to educate and help the people to get the best return possible from their land.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by some Deputies about the sowing of winter wheat and they appeared to be under the impression that it is now late to sow winter wheat.  Speaking as a practical farmer and as one with some little experience of the growing of wheat, I think that is a mistaken idea. In the district in which I live, a neighbour of mine had some land prepared for wheat in 1939, but he could not get in the seed until the 14th March.  The only seed he had available was that known as Queen Wilhelmina, a winter variety.  The crop was harvested a little bit late, on the 8th and 10th September, but it provided the most magnificent yield he ever had.  He had a yield of 12 barrels to the statute acre.  In normal seasons, winter wheat sown early in winter or in mid-winter, yields only about eight barrels per statute acre.</P>
    <P>I agree with some Deputies who suggested that a credit system might be made available for farmers to enable them to buy seed and manures where they are procurable.  I would suggest to the responsible Ministers, as I have already privately suggested to the Minister for Supplies, that they might put up a scheme somewhat similar to that at present operated between the sugar company and beet growers whereby the sugar company provides <Col N="1615" /> credits.  The millers might take the place of the company in this instance. I know there are complications, but I think these could be got over.  If the millers provided the necessary credits, they could recoup themselves in the harvest for the cost of the seed and manures.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, though it may be a somewhat sad pleasure, I am glad to know that Deputies realise the seriousness of the situation that confronts us. I repeat the statement of Deputy Esmonde that this is no time for Party politics or for the scoring of small points off our political opponents.  If we want to secure our people against the pangs of hunger for the next year, I think we should all unite and do all we can to encourage the growing of all types of food supplies.  Above all, we should be very careful to ensure that anything we do or say here or elsewhere should not become an impediment or a deterrent to anybody to produce the most they can from the land.  As Deputy Esmonde pointed out, we are isolated from the rest of the world.  We are left largely to our own resources, but if we unite and if we give of our best in this crisis&mdash;I know that the farmers will do their part&mdash;I feel that we shall successfully weather the storm.  Then when history's pages are turned over in years to come, it will be seen that the present epoch formed one of the most glorious pages in the story of our country, that when we were thrown on our own resources we forgot all our dissensions of the past as far as internal matters were concerned, and that we successfully braved the storm even though we received no assistance from any other portion of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in spite of what Deputy Meaney has said that it has been proved in the course of this debate that members of all Parties are willing and anxious to co-operate with the Government in their efforts to secure that essential supplies shall be maintained.  There is really no compliment about that, because Deputies have their responsibility to their constituencies <Col N="1616" /> and, in the light of what the Minister for Supplies stated yesterday, it is absolutely necessary that there should be that co-operation for which the Minister asked.  I feel certain that not alone will there be co-operation amongst members of all Parties in the House, but that there will also be co-operation between people outside who are members of the various political Parties.  I come from a country which has always had tillage in the forefront of its farming economy, and I am perfectly satisfied that that county, in response to the Minister's appeal, will do what is necessary to help him to provide the essential foodstuffs for the people in the coming year.  It is pleasant to know that, with the exception of flour, the other essentials necessary for the people are rather plentiful and that there is no prospect of an immediate scarcity at any rate.</P>
      <P>Like others who have spoken, I am of the opinion that during the emergency the Dáil should meet more frequently.  The Taoiseach has indicated repeatedly, when this matter was raised, that the reason for the Dáil sitting so infrequently is that Ministers are too busy.  That may be so.  But, I think, if Ministers were given an opportunity to come to the Dáil and, through that medium, let the people outside know from time to time what the position is, it would help to ease their burden.  We all know that at present Ministers are at their wits' ends in dealing with the various situations which confront them in this emergency.  When the Dáil is out of session, rumours of an alarming kind are usually in circulation.  Deputies feel foolish when they are asked to contradict them or to give their opinion about them.  After all, Deputies have the same responsibility to the people who sent them here as Ministers have, and it is only right that an opportunity should be provided, at least once a fortnight, for Deputies to hear from Government spokesmen what is the exact position in the light of the emergency through which we are now passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion irreparable damage <Col N="1617" /> will be done to democracy and Parliamentary institutions if the Dáil is not called together more frequently and an opportunity given to members of finding out what the position is.  This war is such an unusual one that things are happening from day to day which were unheard of in years gone by, and, as I said, rumours are in circulation about this country when the Dáil is not sitting. If the Dáil were in session, those rumours could be contradicted before any harm could be done.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said with regard to the petrol situation.  It came as a bombshell on the country to learn on the day after St. Stephen's Day that there was a very small supply of petrol in the country.  One would have thought that the Minister for Supplies could have dealt with the situation prior to Christmas Eve; that he could have told the country what the supply of petrol was and what the possibilities were of the supply being kept up.  I should like the Minister to let the country know as soon as possible what the exact position is in regard to petrol.  I am not concerned so much with the private motorist.  But the Minister knows quite well that since the petrol crisis arose a great deal of unemployment has been caused and that there will be in the very near future a great many more placed on the unemployment register.  That is a very serious state of affairs.  I think that if the Minister, even at this stage, were to let the country, and especially the industrialists, know what the possibilities of obtaining petrol are, if he removed the uncertainty that prevails, he would prevent further unemployment. I hesitate to believe that the position with regard to petrol is as serious as was indicated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Apart from petrol, most of the debate has centred upon the question of the supply of wheat and flour.  As I said before, I am fully satisfied that the people will respond to the appeal of the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture in regard to this matter.  Deputy Belton referred to the motion on the Order Paper in his name <Col N="1618" /> and told us in no uncertain language that the only alternative to the fixing of a certain price for wheat was the provision of black bread for the people. I think that is a scandalous statement for any Deputy to make.  To my mind, it is equivalent to holding the people up to ransom in the midst of an emergency hitherto not experienced in this or any other country.  I am satisfied that the price fixed by the Government has been accepted with a very good grace by the farmers.  I have not heard any complaints from the farmers as to the price fixed by the Government of 40/- per barrel or 5/- more than last year.</P>
    <P>In view of that price, I suppose it will be necessary to increase the price of bread.  I earnestly hope, however, that something will be done by the Ministry to prevent any increase being imposed on the very poor.  We all know that the poor at present find it very hard to live.  The prices of all the necessary commodities that the poor have to consume day after day are increasing and if, as a result of this increased price for wheat, they are called upon to pay even more for their principal article of food, I shudder at the consequences which we will have to face next winter.  The motion put down by Deputy Belton calls for a large increase in the price of wheat. The Minister has already agreed to an increase.  A great number of people are unable to buy bread at the present price.  The Minister has refused to sanction an increase in wages for rural workers.  The position, therefore, is a very serious one.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal said as to the provision of allotments for unemployed workers.  In our cities and urbanised towns schemes are in operation to enable the local authorities to provide plots for unemployed people. In other towns under a certain population there are unemployed people who are not eligible for plots.  I urge, as other Deputies have urged, that this scheme should be extended to enable the public health boards or county councils to deal with these unemployed workers in the same way as urban workers are dealt with.  In that connection <Col N="1619" /> I ask for a further extension so far as this scheme is concerned.  In various towns in Ireland there are unemployed people who live in houses that have no plots attached to them. Because of the fact that they are unemployed, the Minister permits the council functioning in their area to acquire certain land in order to give these people plots, and they are provided with seed and garden implements to enable them to till these plots.  Now, in the same towns there are often men living in houses with gardens attached, and these people are in the same degree of comfort as the people who have no gardens attached to their houses, but the Government are not doing anything to provide these people with seed.  I should like to refer to that matter again in the presence of the Taoiseach, now that he is in the House.  What I am referring to is that unemployed men, living in towns, who have no gardens attached to their houses are given plots free of charge, or practically free of charge&mdash;at a nominal amount per year&mdash;that they are given seeds free, and also implements free to till their plots when they get them, but in the same town there are men in the same degree of comfort, with gardens attached to their houses, who are unable to buy seeds for the tilling of these plots or gardens, and I suggest to the Taoiseach that that question should be examined with a view to giving those people, who are in the same degree of comfort as the others, the same facilities as are given to people who are provided with plots under the tillage scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not think we would get very many in the towns.  At any rate, I suggest that these are people in the same degree of comfort&mdash; or perhaps it would be better to say, in the same degree of want&mdash;as the others, and there would not be the same expense in the cases of the people to whom I refer because, for one thing, their plots would not have to be <Col N="1620" /> fenced, and the only thing it would be necessary to give them would be seeds. I think it would be well worth the Government's while to consider the idea.  Again, so far as these allotments are concerned, in some towns the demand for plots is greater than the local authorities can deal with.  The acquiring of land is a long, tedious process, and I am of opinion that under the Emergency Powers Act, the Government ought to give local authorities power to acquire land more quickly.  I know of places where there have been arguments about the price of land over a period of months, until it was too late to hand over the plots to the unemployed so as to enable them to get the potatoes and cabbages sown in time.  Again, I think the Government should fix a price per acre to be paid for these plots in order to save time.  If that were done, and if the Government used certain emergency powers to enable them to get these lands quickly, by a sort of short-circuit arrangement, so to speak, I think you would find a bigger and better response from the people who would be anxious to take advantage of this allotment scheme.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am satisfied that this debate has served a very useful purpose and that it had not the political complexion or bias to which some people have referred.  All who spoke have shown their desire to co-operate with the Government in the effort of the Government to see that the people are supplied with the necessary foodstuffs during this period of emergency. So far as my Party is concerned, I can say that we are prepared to help the Minister in every way, and I am sure that that response will also come from every member of every Party in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a few matters which call for rather different treatment under each heading. The first matter to which I would like to refer is the road licence tax. Undoubtedly, a number of people thought they were going to get a lot more supplies of petrol than they did get.  Others even go further and charge the Government with taking their <Col N="1621" /> money under false pretences.  Others go a shade further than that, and suggest that some of the circulars issued were a step even beyond that. Now, I should like to suggest to the Government that there is a very simple way of settling all these criticisms, and that is by adopting a procedure which is adopted in other parts of this country and in Great Britain, namely, that the persons concerned decide for themselves when they wish to give up their road licence tax.  I understand that they can surrender it at any time. Naturally, there is some small premium charged to them, but they can give up their licences and have a refund of their money.  Now, why should the Government here take up the attitude that once they have taken the people's money the door is closed?  In a number of commercial concerns your money will be refunded if you are not satisfied with your purchase.  Why should we have a lower standard of commercial morality for our Government than they have in neighbouring countries?  I should like to suggest that in the present time the Government might very well proceed to consider whether they could not let a man out of his road tax and let him decide for himself how long he may choose to keep it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I pass from the road licence tax to petrol, there is a sort of a halfway house, namely, what is an essential service?  There seems to be an idea that everybody who is in a motor car is redundant.  I should like to suggest that there are many commercial travellers who keep going around the country, some of them on commission on their own earnings and others employed by firms.  Those people are really essential for industry.  Is it suggested that those people can give up their motor cars and walk around the country or go by train?  I suggest that that is quite impossible.  It brings you still to the petrol question, and everything seems to be almost mixed up with petrol.  Petrol is the bread of industry &mdash;I should like to put it that way. Deputy O'Reilly, from the Government Benches, asked us last night, would we rather have bread or petrol?  I would suggest that it is the Government's <Col N="1622" /> fault if that choice has been thrust upon us.</P>
    <P>The burden of the remarks of Government speakers to-day seemed to be that they never minimised the gravity of the present situation; that there were no concrete proposals coming from this side; that there was no trouble over petrol until now, and that they are not responsible for the sinking of tankers.  We could agree with most of that, but I am afraid it will not clear the Government of criticism with regard to petrol supplies. In my opinion the question begins and ends with this query: whether the Government was practising what it preached, namely, that adequate supplies should be built up.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking to-day, did not give us any facts.  I suggest that at the outbreak of war the storage capacity represented roughly two months normal civilian supplies.  Naturally the Army had something to say to that and, I understand, stated that the supply should not fall below a certain point, which, for the sake of argument, we will call threequarters of that supply.  Nobody would quarrel with the fact that on the outbreak of hostilities the Army must have the use of any petrol in the country.  It comes to this then, should the Army not have its own petrol?  If it had not, we were trading on two or three weeks normal civilian supplies.  Is that a stock to leave the country with? That is the essence and the root of the problem.  There is criticism as to whose fault it is that additional storage capacity was not supplied.  The Minister for Supplies denied that there had been negotiations, and yet when pressed later, he said that a number of people had placed before him proposals for additional storage.</P>

I accept his explanation, but it seems to me there is something lacking in the explanation before the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I contend that it is.  I will leave it by saying that the storage capacity was totally inadequate for the supplies that should have been here.  That is my opinion for what it is worth.  Whether it is accepted or denied that there were negotiations or proposals, some people got so far as to suggest that there were meetings.  Even taking that as untrue, my contention is that there ought to have been such meetings. The Taoiseach says that the difficulty was not one of storage capacity.  It was stated last night that the companies could not be got to fill up the tanks.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that they were not being filled up.  I wish to point out that the filling of these tanks is a very special arrangement.  We all think of oil as petrol.  There is petrol, kerosene and fuel oil in a tanker.  You have to get a tanker filled with what is required, and in these days that tanker cannot be sent round to Dublin, Limerick or Cork, but has to go to one port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the military embargo, with which I would agree if I had anything to do with the military authorities, the other question that ought to be considered is ordinary civilian supplies.  I understand that by maintaining a sort of shuttlecock arrangement with tankers of a special size, the companies kept the tanks fairly well filled until <Col N="1624" /> this disastrous war occurred.  The Government had no control over that. Some tankers were sunk and others were taken over.  My contention is that the stock which the Government had in this country was totally inadequate, that, if they had greater storage capacity, another class of tanker would have been available, namely, the huge tankers.  There were times when they could not come in because we could not take them in. My point is that, if there were additional storage capacity, these tankers could have come in and we might easily have had a supply of petrol which would have run for many months.  The Minister for Agriculture is very courageously trying to work the bread supply up to 12 months.  If he came in and told us that the bread supply of this country was a fortnight's, we would be looking for his scalp&mdash;I think there would be violence in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is this.  Last night the Minister for Supplies referred to the tremendous increase in our production and manufacture in this country.  That is quite true, but I am afraid there is a corresponding disability which the Government did not watch sufficiently carefully at the outbreak of hostilities. Comparing this country in the 1914-1918 war and in the present one, we see that in the 1914-1918 war we had very little production, but we had a very large distribution.  In troubled times the people engaged in distribution are often just as well able to sense a market as a manufacturer can, and enormous supplies were accumulated here which I think more or less enabled us to face the whole war period.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister for Supplies said that we had made a large increase in our productive capacity.  He referred to sugar, cement, glass bottles and jars. Glass was an unfortunate choice. Sheet glass is made in this country, but that company ceased production last July and some people have been anxious to find out the reason for giving up the manufacture and asking when a new start would be made.  I do not suggest that the Government withheld any information&mdash;I think they <Col N="1625" /> did not know&mdash;but nobody has been able to find out when they are going to start again.  Personally, I had the fear that something like that might occur, and early last year I tried to raise the question of the stocks in distributors' hands.  I found after a number of months that what I thought was within the province of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was really within that of the Minister for Supplies and <i>vice versa.</i>  Ultimately, I raised the question and was invited, by the courtesy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to state my views and a meeting was held, but at that time the supplies had ceased.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Government that they have held the import of goods into this country too closely, too tightly.  It was all right protecting industries, and everybody would be in favour of that, but what really happened was that their machinery in some cases was laid out for only barely meeting the demand and in a rush before the war and just after the outbreak of war, when supplies of material were available and stuff could be brought from all over the world, the Government were unable to grasp the fact that in a lot of cases they should have issued licences to anybody who could bring in goods and hold stocks.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to a practice that has hit the country hard.  Some manufacturers have not realised the advantages that the larger holder of stocks and the distributor conferred on them and on the country, and stocks have been steadily cut down, so that I am afraid what we gained on the swings we have lost on the roundabouts.  If anything that I have said could induce the Government to take another look at the policy which they have pursued in the past and are still pursuing, to see whether it is to their interest that stocks as in other countries should be held in distributors' hands, a great deal of good will have come out of this debate; but if the Government are of the opinion that a new order has dawned and that the manufacturer should distribute to the user, let them say so and I suppose we will all have to face it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Leader of the Opposition wrote to me asking that a meeting of the Dáil be summoned to discuss the motion on the Order Paper, naturally I was pleased, as the situation was one in which not merely the Opposition but we also felt that it would be well for the people of the country to be made aware of the situation, in so far as it is possible for anybody to anticipate the course of events in the present circumstances. I am not going to refer in any way to the tenor of the debate nor to the way in which it has gone on: I am quite sure our people are well able to judge for themselves whether the criticism is just and fair and whether the Government, the Minister for Supplies or any other Ministers, are in fact in any way responsible for the position that has arisen.</P>
      <P>Next to active defence, next to the Army, the question of supplies is the most important one that we could discuss.  On it the whole of our economic life depends and consequently, every suggestion and every criticism that is directed towards making the situation safe ought to be welcomed, and I think is welcomed by every member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is that the Dáil should be informed, as far as it is possible, of the present position, and the likely future position in regard to supplies. The present anxiety is due probably to a realisation, in a way in which it has not been realised up to the present, of the actual position. The sudden shortage of petrol brought people sharply up against what could very well happen in our situation.  The question is: is there any foresight, any care which would prevent such a situation from developing?  Could we have foreseen these things, and if we could, and failed to make reasonable preparations for them, are we blamable?  If not, I think it is right that it should be understood clearly what the difficulties are, and why preparations, such as would have saved a situation like that from occurring, could not have been made.  As I have just said, next to the <Col N="1627" /> Army and its equipment the most important thing for us is the question of supplies.  In one respect it is even more important, because it was long ago said that an army marches on its stomach, and if we had not our supplies here: the food and the other things that are necessary for the community as a whole, the equipment for the Army, such as arms, would be of very little value.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, not at all complaining that this meeting was called, that questions have been asked and that criticisms have been made; but it is right that we should survey the situation fairly and squarely, and that in so far as it is possible to predict the situation or to indicate what our position is, that should be done fully to the public.  I think no good at all is done by suggesting that the Minister for Supplies, or any other Minister, or the Government as a whole, is not frank with the people.  What is to be gained by not being frank with the people?  I do not see it.  One must refrain from creating panic.  If, for instance, it appears that a shortage of some particular commodity should be imminent and if you feel that tomorrow that shortage can be made good, while those who are immediately in charge may be anxious, is anything to be gained by sending that anxiety right through the country and, as it may turn out, needlessly creating a panic?  I do not think there is, and the only extent I think, in any circumstances, to which full and exact information should be kept back would be in a case like that.  Otherwise, the fullest information to the people is best, both from a Governmental point of view and from the point of view of the people as a whole.  As far as I know that has been the policy of all the Ministers who are concerned with this matter of supplies.</P>
    <P>Now, we anticipated the importance of supplies long before the war began at all.  The Government decided that this matter of supplies was, in our circumstances, of such fundamental importance that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked to <Col N="1628" /> consider the question even then of establishing a Ministry of Supplies. That was before the war began at all. At that time a compromise was reached. A special section of his Department was set off to consider this question of supplies and to make preparations, with the result that, immediately after the war was started, it was possible to detach that whole section and make it function as an independent Ministry of Supplies.  So it is obvious, from that anticipation and that previous preparation, that the importance of the question of supplies was fully appreciated, and, in so far as it was possible in advance to make administrative arrangements for dealing with the situation, that was done.  It is not necessary to go back and remind the House to what extent efforts were made to build up stocks of various materials, and, mind you, that cannot be easily done.  In some cases there is a question of storage, there is the question of getting supplies quickly, there are insurance questions, questions of finance: quite a number of questions are involved the moment you try to anticipate a situation such as the war brought about and try to prepare for it by building up large reserve stocks.  In so far as it was reasonably practicable that was done.</P>
    <P>The criticism in this debate has been mainly on a couple of points.  First of all there is the question of the immediate criticism of the petrol situation. It was suggested that this situation should not have been permitted to occur: that the Minister for Supplies should have anticipated it, that he should have built up reserves of various kinds, and that if our storage capacity was not sufficient, when we were making preparations in advance of the war, that the storage capacity should have been increased.  As a matter of fact, long before the war questions in regard to our supplies of petrol in war time were giving anxiety, and it was partly on that account, and partly in pursuance of the general policy to be as independent in regard to supplies as possible, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce as he was at the time&mdash;the present Minister for Supplies&mdash;set out to try to <Col N="1629" /> deal with the question of an oil refinery here.  The belief was that, in a time of crisis like the present, supplies might be difficult to get, and that we would be in a better position if we had such a refinery.  I am not going to go back on any of the controversies in regard to that.  I am simply giving an indication of the foresight, in regard to some of these matters, which was shown by the responsible Ministers.  That was not done.  Certain difficulties arose and that project was not brought to completion, but when the war started, and even before the war started, our storage capacity was not fully availed of.  That was not the fault of the Minister for Supplies because every pressure that could be brought to bear upon the distributing companies was tried to get them to fill up all the available storage capacity.</P>
    <P>It was not fully availed of when war broke out, and immediately the war broke out an arrangement had to be entered into as to the quantity which we were going to receive.  That quantity was barely sufficient, on the ration rate, to meet our requirements and it was not possible to get any more. There was no question, and could be no question, of building up a reserve, because if you tried to do so, and even if you were prepared to resort to subterfuge, you could not have built up a reserve.  The only thing that would have been gained&mdash;it is not right to say gained&mdash;the only thing that could have been done was to reduce the consumption and if you had reduced the consumption you were going to reduce the replacement and you were going to get less than you got before, and the result of that would have been the dislocation, unemployment and everything that follows from a reduction of that sort.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies see that it was quite impossible for the Minister to do the very things they think and say could have been done quite easily.  I think the House will admit that if a Minister and a capable staff are spending their time trying to foresee these things and trying to find solutions of these problems, and if a solution does not appear, the chances are that there <Col N="1630" /> must be some difficulties which have not been made apparent to those who criticise and I should like to know from those who ask why was there a shortage of petrol when there could have been reserve stores built up, how they could have managed it under the conditions I have mentioned.  It is said that the Minister should have known that there were likely to be sinkings.  Of course, he knew there were likely to be sinkings&mdash;he had only to look at the papers to know it&mdash;but, until the last occasion, these sinkings had not resulted in a cutting down of the supply we were receiving under the ration system.  It was not the sinkings which caused the difficulty, but the inability to replace the sinkings, which in previous cases had been replaced, under these circumstances and the conditions which then prevailed.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary for me to labour the point any further. We have all been anxious about petrol, and I think that most of us would agree very largely with the view expressed by Deputy Dockrell that, under modern conditions, petrol is the fuel which keeps industry and transport generally going.  The motor industry and associated petrol industries are amongst our biggest interests. They represent one of our biggest industries in which a great deal of unemployment can be caused and, consequently, it received the full attention of the Minister.  I do not think that anything that it was possible for him to do was left undone, and I do not think that anybody has pointed out in this debate what he could have done which was not done.  I pass away now from the question of petrol.</P>
    <P>The next question is wheat.  Deputy Brennan, repeating some phrase used earlier, said that the Minister deceived the House and the country with regard to our position in relation to flour, and he referred to some statement made here by the Minister in September, 1939.  I listened to the extract as it was read.  Now what did it say?  Looking forward in September, 1939, it said that there need be no anxiety in regard to flour for a couple of years ahead.  I thought at the time that it <Col N="1631" /> was a very bold thing to say, that with a world war just beginning, on account of the reserves that were there, and the possibilities of our own production, we could look forward for two years&mdash;I wish to heaven we could look forward for two years now&mdash;and say that within these two years, which would bring us up to next September, there was going to be no need for anxiety in relation to flour.  That is roughly what it was.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the prediction with the actuality, and what is the position? It means that until June next, with our present consumption, we would still be free from anxiety, that is, the Minister was two months out so far as this question of having no anxiety is concerned.  Our anxiety begins next June and it can be divided into two periods&mdash;the period from June until the harvest comes in and the period after that.  So far as the period from June until the harvest comes in is concerned, with the foresight and the preparation possible now, we can carry on without any grave inconvenience to the public until the harvest comes in, but if we do, we must try to husband our stocks properly, and we believe that once the public knows what has to be done, they will co-operate and voluntarily help in this matter, as they have co-operated in a number of other matters in which we have asked their co-operation since the beginning of this war.</P>
    <P>Now the co-operation necessary is this: we want those who can use other foods rather than bread to use them in a greater quantity than before, and in this case I am appealing mainly to the women of the country.  They can do it very well for us.  If those who are able to substitute other foods for bread will do so, they will leave the bread for those who have no alternative foods, and these are the people we are most anxious about.  It is true, as Deputy Dillon said, that there will be food enough in the country and that this community ought not to starve. He put it in a very expressive form when he said that we could not eat all the food in the country if it were rammed into our stomachs with a ramrod. <Col N="1632" /> That is not a picture of the situation at all because it is not enough to have food of one kind or another in the country.  There is the question of seeing that it gets to the people, of seeing that the people are able to get it, which brings in the whole question of unemployment, and there is, above all, the fact that we cannot overnight change the food we normally take.</P>
    <P>The poor are in a particularly difficult position.  They, as a rule, have few alternative foods which they can get, and we must see at all costs that the poorer sections of the community have the one food they can have, that is, bread.  It cannot be rationed in the ordinary way, as the Minister pointed out, so we have to appeal to the other sections of the community, and particularly to those in the rural areas, who can diminish the quantity of bread and flour they use and see that, in that way, our stocks are husbanded.</P>
    <P>In the country, it is possible to use less bread and more potatoes at the present time.  It is possible to substitute oatmeal for bread.  There is no doubt whatever that good, alternative, palatable foods are available, particularly for farmers and people living in the rural areas.  My appeal is principally to the rural section&mdash;that they get the alternative foods which are available and of which there is no shortage and that they use them, leaving as big a reserve as possible of flour for bread for the poorer people in the towns who are not able to get an alternative.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's part, I think he has done exceptionally well in being able to put us in a position in which we can, if we set out to do it, make good from our own supplies in the coming year the shortage which we have to anticipate in the imports of wheat.  My information then is&mdash;I want to give it to you as categorically as I can&mdash;in regard to wheat, that the six months' stock of wheat and flour has to be stretched so as to last until August.</P>

      <P>It has to last until the harvest is available.  In addition to stretching it in the way I have indicated, an attempt will be made to stretch it further by increasing the percentage of extraction which has already been increased from 75 to 80.  We intend to stretch our supplies by increasing the extraction and, as indicated, if necessary, to mix it with other cereals.  I believe barley has been found to be better than oats for this purpose.  Deputy Belton may be interested to know that the addition of barley whitens flour instead of darkening it.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the question of colour at the moment. There will be plenty of time to talk about price later.  I have indicated how other foods, such as potatoes and oatmeal, could be substituted for bread.  As regards the bread situation, there need be no panic if we act prudently and if we get the co-operation we are asking for, but the situation after the harvest comes in next year will be a very serious one.  Therefore, we want the biggest harvest we can possibly get and it will cause far less dislocation of different kinds if we get a sufficient supply of wheat, which has been the cereal used, so far, for bread.  Surely, nobody can say it is the Government's fault if we do not get that supply because, day in and day out, not merely since the war began but long before, we have been urging the farmers, for the sake of safety, to give us as much as possible of our own needs in wheat.  We have tried to induce them to do so by fixed prices and we have got a considerable response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fixing the price, you must have regard to various things.  You must have regard to the prices of other <Col N="1634" /> crops which the farmer produces.  What you want to do is to give an attractive price but, to the farmer, more than the attraction of the price is the fact that he is certain of disposing of his wheat at that price.  We have given him that guarantee.  Considerable investigation was made before that price was settled either for any previous year or for this year.  If we had fixed 50/- instead of 40/-, somebody would be looking for 60/-.  If we had fixed 60/-, somebody would be looking for 70/-.</P>

      <P>There is no use in saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that.  We know it is a fact.  What we had to do was to ascertain what would be fair remuneration to the farmer for growing wheat. We had to give him such remuneration as would naturally induce him to grow the crop and make the doing of it not merely an act of patriotism but a reasonably profitable transaction.  We believe that the price fixed is such a price.  It will be said by Deputy Belton and others: &ldquo;You will not get it at that price.&rdquo;  It would, likewise, be said if we had fixed 50/- or 60/-, that we would not get it at that price.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could not be sure of getting what he wants at any price.  It is for that reason that the Minister has had, in addition, to insist on the cultivation of the land to a certain percentage.  It may be said: &ldquo;Barley is a good food and so are oats and potatoes good foods; why do you not give a fixed price for these?&rdquo;  If <Col N="1635" /> we went into the matter in the same way, we would have the same objection to every price fixed.  In these matters, we do the best we can.  We believe, after close investigation&mdash;the Department went into it&mdash;that this is a fair price to give to the farmer.  We ask those who can grow wheat to do so.  We ask them to do so because they will be doing a service to themselves by getting a reasonable profit and they will be doing a great national service as well.  We are appealing to them, then, to do this for the nation.  We hope that it will be not merely for the present but that it will continue and prove to be, as I myself believe it is likely to be, under certain conditions, for many a long year to come, the most profitable way in which they can use their land.  There may be a difference of opinion about that All I am stressing is that this price of 40/- has been fixed as a fair price.  The Minister will say that, so far as his information goes, it is a fair price.  Deputy Belton will say that we shall not get all we want at that price.  We can only answer that we could have no assurance that we would get it at any price and that we cannot go beyond the figure fixed.</P>
      <P>Bread is, undoubtedly, the most fundamental food for us, because a large section of our people, particularly in the towns, would be in a very serious position, indeed, if bread were not available for them and rationing, so as to assure them of a fair amount, would be extremely difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are thinking of the poor, the next question that you will naturally ask is, what is our position with regard to tea?  Whatever people may think about it, tea is used to a very large extent and a failure in our supplies of tea would cause a great deal of inconvenience and a considerable amount of suffering.  The position, I am informed, is that at the moment we cannot see any immediate reason for a shortage, but again we cannot be absolutely certain of that.  The supplies we were expecting to get and which we were assured we would get may for one reason or another be cut off.  I do not <Col N="1636" /> want to create any panic, but I want to save myself from the possibility of being charged with misleading the House and the country by saying that we can never be sure of these things. There are not stocks in hand sufficient to tide us over indefinite periods.  These stocks have got to be replenished.  If they are replenished, as we hope they will be, then we have no reason to anticipate any immediate shortage.  If there is a shortage then we will have to resort to rationing.  We have been asked what steps we are going to take for the reasonable and equitable distribution of these essential commodities. We will have to resort to rationing, and if rationing comes into operation the individuals will have to fill up the gap by resorting to other forms of beverage.  They will have to use more milk.  I was often hoping that we could use a great deal more milk than we are using at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A little light beer is all right.  If the Minister for Finance lets up a little bit, that can be managed too.  But, in any case, that is the situation.  There again if there should be at any moment fear of shortage and that is announced, the best way to meet that is for those who are in an advantageous position, certainly the farmers, to try to reduce the amount of tea and to use more milk in their households.  I am sure a considerable saving in that respect could be effected and it would leave the tea for those who are not able to get any alternative.  We are looking for voluntary co-operation in these matters and I would ask the people who, in regard to food, are in a relatively strong position, namely, the farmers and others in the country, that when they <Col N="1637" /> are asked to co-operate they will do it with a will, knowing that when they are doing so they are assisting in the best possible way the poorer members of the community who have no alternative.</P>
      <P>The next thing that occurs to one to ask is, what is the position in regard to sugar?  That has been referred to already.  The position is that if the farmers grow the beet for us in the required amount&mdash;and the price, again, has been calculated on a price which will give them a reasonable return for their labour&mdash;we can meet all our own requirements.  But if, for instance, some accident was going to destroy one of our factories then, in the case of sugar as in the case of the other commodities, we would have to resort to something like rationing or we would have to try to go short or to get substitutes as far as we could.</P>
      <P>The next thing one thinks of in dealing with food matters is butter. Butter, again, is very important. Various factors contributed to a shortage of butter from now until the spring time, until the full butter season begins again.  The reasons for the shortage have been explained and the community have been asked to try to adopt a voluntary system of rationing so as, again, as far as possible not to cause shortage where shortage would be felt most and cause the most hardship. Again, it is a question, perhaps, not of the very poorest who, unfortunately, are not always able to have butter and for whom a shortage of it will not mean a tremendous lot&mdash;but a question of making it possible for those who can and do use butter to get it.  There are substitutes.  Margarine immediately occurs to one, but the situation in regard to margarine is not so easy either.  There have been difficulties there, too, in regard to certain of the raw materials.  It seems to me the only alternative at the moment, particularly for the poor, is that there is a great supply of lard available and we will not starve, at any rate, as long as fried bread is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a fair picture of the food situation.  I do not think it is possible to give a fuller picture.  I do <Col N="1638" /> not think it would be possible for anybody to give a fuller statement in regard to it than I have made.  Somebody to-day suggested that we were deceiving the public, that we were not frank with the public.  I forget temporarily the phrase that was used, but it suggested at any rate that the difficulty was that we had no picture to give.  It is quite true that nobody can give a picture that would let you see through to the end of this war and right through its course.  It would be impossible to give a picture showing that there was no need for anxiety from now to the end of the war.  The truth is, of course, that from the moment this war began there was reason for anxiety. From the moment the war began we might know that in our circumstances if it took certain courses it was bound to mean hardship for us.  I think we ought to be thanking God here that a year and a half of that war has passed and that we have suffered so little as we have suffered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future I might remind the House that when the Minister spoke in 1939 of two years ahead he was in a very different position from those who are criticising now.  Two years ago nobody was able to give a picture of the war situation as it is at the moment.  If such a picture were to be given by any Minister here as a probable thing he would be laughed at, possibly.  Of course, the difficulty about all this is that when you try to make preparations in advance by imagining what the course will be you will be said to be exaggerating.  You will be accused of trying to create panic.  When you are trying to make preparations and to warn people that preparations are necessary, that insurance of various kinds and the cost of insurance have to be borne, you will be criticised for that as painting too gloomy a situation and, of course, afterwards, if something happens that you have not foreseen or made arrangements for in advance you are criticised because you have not done so.  As far as we are concerned, at any rate, if we are able to get the country through the rest of the war as well as it has come through so far we will be quite prepared <Col N="1639" /> to stand any criticisms that may be levelled at us.</P>
    <P>The next thing to examine is the position in regard to clothing.  I am informed that there are adequate supplies of imported raw wool, and that we can produce all our requirements, though not perhaps in such variety as in normal times.  We are producing all the boots and shoes we require, and our tanneries are producing the leather.  I think I can pass away from that.  In any case, if all went to all, we could afford to wear our suits much longer than we are wearing them, and a number of other things could be done in that regard.  I do not want to say that anybody should be complacent about it, because there are other aspects to be considered besides the mere actual clothing and keeping the cold out.  There are other aspects to be considered&mdash;the aspect of the employment to be given by those who are making those clothes, and in that way giving a service from which people get a livelihood and supply their own needs.</P>
    <P>Let me come then to the next important matter, the matter of housing and shelter.  It is true that we have not enough houses, but we are probably no worse off in that regard than we were before the war, so if we are considering the matter purely from a war standard we are no worse off in that regard than we have been.  I do not mean to say that we should be content with that.  I should like to say here that our attitude towards this situation ought to be, all the time, to try to make a virtue out of necessity, and to use the crisis, when minds are working in a certain direction, to do things which people were not prepared to do under other circumstances.  I hope that attitude of mind&mdash;it is the attitude of the Government&mdash;will be common, and that the brains of the country will be used to try to utilise this situation, so that, if we are spared from the destruction of the actual physical conflict of the war, when we come out of this crisis we may be a stronger and better nation than we are at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> With regard to the continuance of our housing programme then, we know that we are producing a surplus of cement.  There is a shortage of timber, but we have substantial stocks of imported timber, and there is, if we are driven to it, some mature wood available to meet the year's requirements. It is growing, of course, and there would be difficulty and delay no doubt in that regard, but it is there all the same, and if we are driven to using it we can use it.  The matter, however, has been under very close observation, and, where suitable alternative materials to imported timber are available, the necessary specifications will be modified.  The idea is to try to modify the specifications in regard to building and so on, and to use more and more home produced materials in building.  The position with regard to steel is regarded as moderately satisfactory, but that is due to our being able to get certain supplies, which, of course, are uncertain, as everything is uncertain that we have to get from outside at the present time.  The only things which are certain are the things which we can set out to produce ourselves, and we can do those things if we bend our energies in that direction.</P>
    <P>There may be a certain amount of Government influence and Government direction, but again the greatest progress can be made by private initiative. If we have private initiative, with the help that can be given by Government Departments, we will be able to get out of the present situation certain advantages which we would probably never have got otherwise.  The next thing one is anxious about, naturally, is fuel.  In that regard, my information is this: we all know of course that in 1939 and 1940 imports of coal were above normal, and that substantial reserve stocks are consequently held. There is no indication of a shortage in the immediate future, but nevertheless the sound, sensible and safe thing to do is to increase the production of home fuel, turf.  Just as in wheat and in other things, certainly the Government cannot be blamed for failing to press forward the development of our peat resources, the development of <Col N="1641" /> turf.  We have talked about it enough anyhow; we have set up a board to examine it; so that, so far as drawing public attention to it is concerned, and trying to urge that things be done, and putting up machinery by which it could be done in so far as it is humanly possible to do it, the Government has done its part.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true of practically everything I have said.  We are only taking things purely from the national point of view, the pool point of view.  If it is in the pool, then there is another big problem, the problem of distribution.  That occurs with regard to everything.  As we are talking about that, I want everybody to understand that we realise that that is a fundamental problem, and that employment, namely earning a livelihood, by which distribution is normally brought about, will be carried on, and that if it should fail at any particular point the people who are affected will have to be supplied somehow.  That is perhaps even a more difficult problem than the problem of increasing the supplies in the total pool.  For the moment I am dealing only with the pool situation.  I need not speak about the petrol position. I have spoken about it already, and you know about it, but again in regard to that there ought to be the greatest care exercised.  It is suggested for instance, that there was some element of deception in insisting that petrol would not be given to people who had not registered their cars, and I have heard somebody&mdash;I think it was Deputy Dockrell&mdash;suggesting that, even when people had licensed their cars in advance, whenever they wished to stop they should get a refund.  That is the proposition as I understand it.  That would be most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> It is quite obvious that if there is a danger with regard to our petrol supplies we ought to do everything to discourage the use of cars which are not essential.  Only when they are essential should they be registered, and if they are essential they will get first claim.  But not merely should there be the ordinary safeguarding of our stocks in that way, if we need it, but we ought to look for alternatives.  We ought to try as far as possible to get alternative modes of transport where they are available, and use them to the full. It is said now that the railways will be used again, that we have to go back, and we may not be altogether the worse for going back a little in regard to some of those modes of transport. It may be no harm at all if the people had to go back a little bit more to the railways, and it is possible if they use the railways somewhat more that we would ultimately be in a better position. However, it is a problem, and the solution of that problem may get us to a better general distribution than before.  However, it is there as an alternative and the extent to which it could be used when there is a shortage is a matter which will gradually work itself out.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is possible to give any direction at this stage.  The Ministers from time to time will indicate what can be done, and we ask the community as a whole to follow the directions given by the responsible Ministers so as to use alternative methods when the usual method is not available.  Producer gas is a possible alternative in certain classes of vehicles.  It is being used elsewhere to a far greater extent than here, and there is no reason why we should not try to advance in that direction and make ourselves, to the greatest extent possible, independent of precarious supplies from outside.  I do not think it is necessary for me to speak further on the question of transport or fuel generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to shipping, that, of course, is absolutely necessary for the supplies we get from outside countries.  The position has already been explained to the House.  We <Col N="1643" /> know, in general, that belligerent shipping is not available to us; that we were dependent largely upon Greek ships and these are no longer available. We know that large numbers of neutral vessels have been taken over for service by the belligerents.  We know also that American vessels are prohibited from sailing to certain areas, including our ports, and you have been told that the Government have been examining the possibility of purchasing ships for registration here.  I want to warn you that, even if practicable, that would not necessarily solve our problems, because we could have the ships for a period and then they could very well be lost.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered fairly generally the main classes of commodities about which we are mainly concerned.  As the Minister pointed out, there are thousands of articles which used to come in here, the availability of which will affect in one way or another sections of the community. It would be quite impossible for us to give a complete picture of the position with regard to every commodity.  I want to assure the House that in so far as it is possible, through human foresight, to make adequate provision, that is being carefully attended to.</P>
    <P>The question of glass was raised a short while ago by Deputy Dockrell. My information in regard to that matter is, that prior to the outbreak of the war the bulk of our supplies of sheet glass was produced at home, the home-produced article having replaced supplies imported mainly from the Continent, but also from Great Britain. Within recent months the home production of sheet glass ceased.  The difficulties that led to that position have been examined and there is a hope that they will be surmounted.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is so, it is a splendid example of how a situation such as the present may be utilised so as to produce a better economy here. If sand which was suitable for glass was exported to other countries, while other sand was being brought in here, it seems to have been a foolish performance. We have now an opportunity of utilising our own resources for the purpose of manufacturing this glass.  If what has been suggested was done, I regard it as a piece of foolishness and it should not be allowed to continue.  Therefore, in so far as any Government direction can do otherwise, every effort will be made.  I have just been told that there was only one cargo, so that places the matter in a different light.  That is the position in regard to glass, and if we are able to resume production of sheet glass we will be all the better off inasmuch as we will be able to use our own raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ideal industries for this country are obviously the industries for which we have not merely the equipment in the final stages of the product, but the raw materials.  The more we get into that type of economy the better I would be pleased.  I am told that the supplies of glass other than sheet glass have so far been readily obtainable from Great Britain, but sheet glass was available from that source only to a very limited extent.  There has been no difficulty in meeting our <Col N="1645" /> requirements of glass bottles, etc.  The main thing is that there is a hope that the situation in regard to sheet glass will be remedied in the quickest possible manner.</P>
    <P>I and the other members of the Government welcomed the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition that we should have a discussion on these questions. Naturally, everybody in the country is anxious about the situation. I have given the facts about the principal items in so far as it is possible to look ahead.  All I want the people in the country to realise is that we are in a war situation.  Immediately the war began, one of our first acts was to get the Constitution amended so as to assimilate this position to a war situation.  It was obvious that we were going to be affected almost as much as the nations that are at war.  We are not to be blamed if, nevertheless, people go on thinking that everything is secure, just the same as if there was no war at all.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate to have gone so far without suffering greater hardships. We cannot expect to get on for the future as well as we have done in the past.  This war is really only beginning, so far as anybody looking out on it can judge.  The hardships that are going to be inflicted on every country are going to increase from now on and if this community is going to survive and come through it&mdash;and I hope, with God's help, we shall&mdash;we will have to take a number of these problems much more seriously than we have taken them up to the present. For instance, we shall have to face the problem of producing all the food we require in a more serious manner.  We will have to consider&mdash;it would be a big omission on my part if I failed to advert to it&mdash;not merely food for human beings, but food for our primary industry, agricultural live stock.  We have to get food for man and beast; that food must come off our own soil, and it can only come off our soil by the labour of our hands.</P>
    <P>It is foolish for us to think that every section of the community can be sheltered in the present situation.  No <Col N="1646" /> section is going to be sheltered.  What we have got to see to is that the weakest sections do not suffer most. Our efforts must be bent so that the backs which are broadest will bear most of the burdens.  There are going to be burdens, heavy burdens, placed upon us during all this time and everyone of us who has an opportunity of working will have to work harder.  I do hope that it will be made possible for many who have not got work at the present time to find employment, because on the whole question of employment in the devolopment of the present situation is going to depend whether there is going to be extreme misery in certain sections or not.</P>
    <P>The situation is so difficult, so serious, that I think that every member of the House ought to approach it in that spirit of seriousness and earnestness and if I might say so, truth, so as to co-operate in remedying that situation.  There is no time at all for indulging in what I might call pure academic debates as if we were simply a debating society.  Everybody is entitled, and ought to try, to get at the truth of the situation, and, if every brain in this House is used properly and if we get the combined wisdom of the House, we shall have a reasonable prospect of facing the situation properly.</P>

      <P>The last speech is very welcome because of its attempt to get at reality, even though the effort may not have been entirely successful. I want to make an appeal to the Taoiseach, as he possibly may be leaving the House shortly.  I think he was lucky in speaking to-night after one of the speeches we heard earlier in the day, because even his rather platitudinous remarks as to the necessity for shipping sound refreshing to anyone who heard this evening the speech of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.

      <P>The Taoiseach made one remark which stood out well from the face of the whole speech.  He asked, in a rhetorical way, why should Ministers not be frank with the House.  Last night there was an episode in this House when a Deputy gave out certain information.  I think there was then an attempt on the part of certain Ministers not to be frank with the House or with the country.  I often wonder why that should be so.  I think it is partly due to the fact that there is a belief in some circles that the country will not stand certain kinds of bad news.  I <Col N="1648" /> think it may also be due to the fact that when certain weak minds get hold of repressive powers they are bound to use these powers in a certain restrictive way.  I think there is a sort of feeling in certain circles that the people should be led along the easy path and that it is much better that they should be jolted into reality when a disaster actually comes upon them.  One of the questions that had to be discussed yesterday was the question of storage, particularly the storage of petrol.  A statement was made by a Deputy and a Minister said there was no truth in it.  The Taoiseach wanted the word of the Minister who said there was no truth in that statement to be accepted. Let the Taoiseach remember the way in which a deliberative assembly runs. We, private Deputies, have no official sources of information.  We meet reputable people and we meet scaremongers, and it is a matter which must be left to our judgment to segregate the information which we get from scaremongers from that supplied to us by people whose information can be trusted.  I do not think it is right that when a Deputy accepts a statement from a reputable person and gives the substance of his information in this House, the assertion of a Minister that it is a lie and that there is no truth in the information should perforce be accepted here.  As I am on the matter of frankness with the people, truth and honesty and frankness with the House, we shall see if the Minister gave us these in a moment.  Last night Deputy Dillon said that he had information that there had been negotiations going on as between the petrol companies in this country and the Government.  Am I wrong in saying that, or is that the Minister's evasion?</P>

I objected to its being persisted in when there was no evidence put forward on the other side. I may say that I have since read a letter to which Deputy Corry referred last night.  I have read it critically, and again I say that the case that has been built upon it by the Deputy was quite unjustified by the letter as it stood.  I thought I was right in appealing to the Chair, in accordance with the general practice of the House, that when a categorical denial of any statement is made it should be accepted until some evidence to the contrary is produced.</P>

      <P>On the 3rd January, 1939, certain officials of the Minister's Department were visited by the petrol companies and they were told that no decision had been come to on the matter that had been discussed in October, 1938.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is frankness with the Dáil.  On the 3rd January, 1939, the petrol companies were asked to investigate the difference in storage costs at the Park or at the port.  That was put up by Deputy Dillon yesterday and was denied.  On the 23rd January, 1939, another memorandum was handed in showing that the difference in the costs of storage accommodation at the Park as opposed to the port was £504,000 as against something short of £300,000.  I will repeat that because this is an item that was challenged yesterday&mdash;that the difference in the costs of the storage accommodation at the Park as opposed to the port was somewhere in the region of £500,000 as opposed to something short of £300,000. The actual figures were £504,000 as against £288,000.  Next day the companies took two officials of the Minister's Department for a walk round the East Wall to show where there were good sites, and at that meeting the question of the oil refinery site and its position was discussed.  Something like that was stated by Deputy Dillon yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Something very unlike it.  I will get what Deputy Dillon stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was denied.  I want to read this again.  Mr. Dillon asked: &ldquo;Was any offer made by anybody&mdash;was any proposal submitted to you?&rdquo;  The Minister replied: &ldquo;No proposal involving the storage of petrol for use here was ever submitted to me by those petrol companies.&rdquo;  That is a flat denial, although there were two memoranda prepared at the request of the Department.  When the first one was put in it was stated that, if this were adopted, of course the companies expected that their financial position would be stabilised.  They were asked to discuss the proposal to have storage accommodation at the Park instead of the port and they showed the cost to be so flagrantly ill-adjusted as to be between £500,000 and £300,000.  That ends at the beginning of the year 1939, and so far as the petrol companies <Col N="1654" /> were concerned nothing happened thereafter.</P>
      <P>But in April, 1940, the petrol companies got an intimation that shipments were going to be curtailed, and the Minister was asked if a representative was sent across would he discuss this matter to find out what storage was available and what extra supplies were required.  A request was sent back to know who it was proposed should meet the Minister and what was his standing, or, if there were more than one, what was their standing, names, official position, and so on. That was supplied in the middle of the month of April and from that moment the Department has been silent.</P>
      <P>That is the story I have here.  I am not going to say from whom.  Is that right?  I stand over every word of that. If that is right, there was not frankness with the Dáil last night.  There was an attempt made to get away from this.  The only thing at issue, when we get back to bedrock, was whether the Minister had a plan given to him, whether he had considered the question of the extra storage accommodation, whether there was any scheme put up and what happened to it.  It was denied that anything had taken place.  The Minister got angry, as he generally does, when any of these extracts are given.  He said that if those combines availed of the storage facilities they have it would solve our difficulties; that any difficulties we have are due to the petrol combines not making use of the storage available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said our difficulties are not due to the absence of storage accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here it is: &ldquo;If those combines availed of the storage facilities that they have, it would solve our difficulties.&rdquo;  That was the only thing said.  There was no addition to it.  That was the phrase used last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;If those combines availed of the storage facilities that they have, it would solve our <Col N="1655" /> difficulties.&rdquo;  That is an ugly story, a very ugly story.  I do not mean the way the Minister treated the combines. When a Deputy stated that something had taken place he was told that it was not true, that no such offer was made.  The Taoiseach tried to get the Deputy who said that, and who had the same informants as I have, to withdraw and accept the word of the Minister.  I will find it very hard to accept the word of the Minister after that.  I was not very agreeable to accepting his words in most things after other episodes.  That certainly is a discreditable episode. There was a definite statement here by Deputy Dillon that this occurrence had taken place and there was an equally definite denial.  I do not think what I have said now is going to be denied in any detail that matters.  I think that is the crux of the whole matter; that is like a searchlight on the whole business.  We meet here after there has been a certain withholding of information from the country, and in this House representing the country that episode occurred. I think it is indicative of the attitude which Ministers adopt towards the House.  The best thing to do is to bluff out of any ugly situation, deny that the thing happened, challenge the people who put it up to give the names of their informants, knowing very well that they are not going to get that, and then attempt to write off that matter with a sort of victory, the victory of officialdom, that it is on the files and can be got.</P>

      <P>Yes, I brought them to life.  They are a bit of a ghost for the Minister.  The Minister cannot get out of it by jibing or sneering or by smiling now.  He was in his most belligerent humour yesterday&mdash;&ldquo;not true&rdquo;, &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the Deputy had no right to give that information unless he also gave the names of his informants&rdquo;.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that that is not the kind of thing which should go on in this House, <Col N="1656" /> particularly when something was said here that was fundamentally true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I can actually give the names of the various civil servants to whom these documents were handed, but I do not think it is right to be asked to do that in the House, particularly in the present circumstances.  I gather from the Minister that a great many other documents were handed in at one time&mdash;actually a detailed list could be given&mdash;and I do not see what is to be gained by evidencing the matter in a more particular way by naming here the people who got these documents.  I think this whole matter gets back to this: Why were the people not told earlier about these two things, the two big things that are under discussion here, petrol and wheat?  Why were the people not told earlier about these?  The problem of supplies can be easily reduced to its essentials, as the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures said here.  What is the availability of supplies, have we money to buy these supplies, and have we ships to transport them or will those ships be provided? The complaint I make is that, at the time when supplies were available, when transport was easier to get, and when, as I understand, we had an exchange, we did not lay in greater stocks of some of the things that are now found to be wanting.  That was the pivotal point, and why was the Minister for Supplies so agitated last night and so concerned to refute the idea that at one time he had had a chance of additional storage and refused it?  A discussion took place in this House either on the 2nd day of September or on a later date in September of 1939, and it took a good deal of questioning to find out from the Minister what was the supply of wheat it was expected could be stored in this <Col N="1657" /> country, and in the end we arrived at some such calculation as this: that we had at the moment about six months' supply.  The question was then put: Why not get more accommodation?</P>
      <P>This was a debate in which the present Minister for Supplies, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that, not merely had we good and substantial quantities of wheat already but that there had been a bumper crop of wheat everywhere and that it was being sold cheaply all over the world. He was then asked: Why not get more accommodation?  And the Minister for Agriculture asked: How?  And was told to build the necessary accommodation. The answer we got in September of 1939 was that, possibly, we might not have any wheat to put into such stores or buildings if they were built, but we were assured at that time that, all over the world, there had been a bumper crop of wheat and that nothing was cheaper than wheat, relatively, with regard to other crops or commodities.  Suggestions were made with regard to the storage both of petrol and wheat, but the Minister for Supplies now says that he thinks words must have lost their meaning if anybody has failed to realise that, all the while, he was impressing on the people the necessity of maintaining supplies both of petrol and of wheat. I think that words have lost their meaning if that is the Minister's deduction.  He must remember that, all the time, his main incentive was that his Department was a very &ldquo;live&rdquo; Department, that it had more forethought, and had made great provision for an emergency.  He will remember that, as far back as September, 1938, when opening some establishment in Navan, he told us that he was then actively engaged on the question of supplies.  The phrase he used was to this effect:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Both myself and the officials of my Department have been compelled during the last few weeks to neglect our ordinary activities and, instead of exploring other possibilities and preparing necessary <Col N="1658" /> legislation, we have been hastily devising plans to meet the possible emergency of a European war, including the rationing of petrol, the provision of necessary supplies, and the control of distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far back as September, 1938, the Minister was on that subject, and he did not indicate that it was a very heavy job at that time.  Let us jump now to 1940, and we find that he used this phrase.  Now, I know that he used other phrases, but the phrase that all the newspapers headlined&mdash; well, they did not headline it exactly, but they put it as one of the important items of the speech&mdash;was this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The country can face the possibility of six months' total blockade with equanimity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that sentence were turned a little bit it would have been more effective. Supposing he had said: &ldquo;Our resources are such that, if we are implicated in the war or blockaded, we can only face six months,&rdquo; but the phrase he used was that we could face the possibility of six months' total blockade with equanimity, and he did carry us on through speeches here in the Dáil, where he told us about the petrol situation and the question of storage, and said that he saw no reason to doubt that the present arrangements would last.  He made odd speeches through the country in which he dealt with petrol, amongst other things, and I do not think I am exaggerating the result of these speeches by pointing to that one that he made in June, 1940, to the effect that if this country were totally blockaded it could face the prospect for six months with equanimity.</P>
    <P>He tells us now that he broadcast to the people that they should economise in the use of petrol.  I remember that he did say so, but towards the end of his speech yesterday he said that if people told him that they should have eked out the supply and saved part of it, it would have been no good, because if they had cut down consumption, the only result would have been that they would have got less petrol in.  If that <Col N="1659" /> were the case, then why broadcast to individuals about the necessity to economise?  The only result would have been that they would not have drawn as much upon the stores of petrol, and if the Minister could not have put the amount available into reserve, either from lack of storage or for other reasons, in any event it would not leave this country better off as far as additions were concerned.</P>
    <P>Then we moved suddenly to a crisis in October, when stocks got very low, but at that time the Minister received assurances with regard to replenishments. He believed those assurances, evidently, and he said here, dramatically, the other evening, that if anybody had asked him or had asked any officer of his Department on the forenoon of Christmas Eve as to our position regarding petrol, he would have said that, so far as he could see, it was the same as it had been for months before that, but that on the afternoon of Christmas Eve the whole prospect changed: that he had got word that certain cargoes of petrol that had been coming here had been sunk&mdash;he said at first that they had been lost, and I wondered whether that meant that they were diverted or sunk, but he used the word &ldquo;sunk&rdquo; later on, in an interruption. The movements from that time on are of interest.  On the 27th December of last year supplies of petrol were stopped and distributors were ordered not to make any further deliveries.  An announcement was made over the wireless here, in a peculiar way, at 7 o'clock that evening, that as from the next day&mdash;that is, some time in the morning of the next day&mdash;there would be no way of getting petrol. That was the situation on the 27th December.  What happened after that?  On the 31st December, we are told, not that new tankers had arrived, but that, according to the Minister's story, he had got assurances of a further cargo about to arrive, and, coupled with that assurance, the warning that there was a risk that the cargo might not come here.  On the 27th December he closes down distribution on the ground that supplies would not be available, and on the <Col N="1660" /> 31st December, he gets an assurance that a cargo&mdash;I do not know what is in a cargo&mdash;might arrive, but coupled with that assurance, the warning that it might not arrive&mdash;that is what the Minister said; I do not know where he got the warning, but he said that he was warned of the risk that the cargo might not arrive.</P>
    <P>On that he goes to the companies and gets an announcement made that the petrol companies were authorised to resume distribution on a restricted basis, on the old basis of two gallons to each coupon.  The public feel that they have been treated scurvily by the Minister, because the warning was a shock to them and was brought up against Christmas, that there would be no further distribution of petrol allowed.  Then, on the assurance that one cargo would come in, there was a further announcement on the 31st December that petrol would be allowed on a particular basis, and it was added in the official notice that the unit had not been changed and was to be a gallon for coupon purposes.  Garage proprietors were warned that for the next week or two they could not expect to get normal supplies.  I do not know what that was supposed to represent to the public, except this, that they might be tightly held for petrol for one or two weeks, but that in future they would get normal supplies.  On that a number of people paid the licence duty on their cars, and paid for the full year, when they certainly would not have taxed cars if the situation that developed on the 27th December had lasted.  The official announcement said that the coupon unit had not been changed, and they were warned that they might not be able to get normal supplies for the next week or two.</P>
    <P>On the 9th January, a further intimation was given that they would be prosecuted for using cars that were not taxed, although in the ordinary course 14 days were generally allowed.  On the 9th January, when most people had fallen for the bribe, the petrol supply was reduced to one quarter.  I think when talking of frankness in this House, I am entitled to talk about frankness with people outside.  Looking <Col N="1661" /> back, I do not think that was a proper way to treat this matter.  I do not know if the Minister would say that some people might have been deluded by the way the announcement was worded at the time it was given out.  It was said that there was only sufficient to keep up supplies, that it was not possible to accumulate reserves, and that even if it was possible to do so petrol could not be stored without loss.  Any number of companies have managed to store petrol even though it means loss.  That is drawn in at the end of the debate, that reserves of petrol could not be accumulated.</P>
    <P>First of all, it was said not to be practicable, and even if it were practicable, it could not be stored because it could only be stored at a loss.  That is given as an excuse for not facing the more realistic problem of bigger and increased storage accommodation. We were told later about the future, when the next cargo comes&mdash;when it will come.  We have to take that with the further qualification&mdash;if it is not sunk before it arrives&mdash;that no matter what cargoes come in, we can never replace the one lost in December. After all that was said the Minister wound up by saying that he was hoping the situation would improve.  Is it any wonder that people complain that they do not know where they are?  They would prefer the brutal frankness of the 27th December to the delusion that has gone on since.  That is typical of the complaint the people have, and it is especially typical of the complaint that we in the Dáil have about the way the statements made last night were treated.  There is no doubt that the public have been scandalously treated in this matter, by inducing them to tax cars.  It is worse now when we know that the Minister's optimism in his forecast about normal supplies not being available for the next week or two is based upon the assurance of one cargo, even though warned that it might not arrive.</P>
    <P>The same thing holds really with regard to wheat.  I do not know if at this stage it is possible to mend matters, except that we ought to see that what occurred in the past shall not <Col N="1662" /> occur again.  In September, 1939, we were told, in words I have quoted so often, that there were bumper stocks of wheat in the world.  On the 29th September in a continuation of the debate, the Minister for Agriculture was asked about providing additional storage, and he agreed that the only way was by building.  His excuse for not doing so was that we might not have the wheat by the time the storage was available.  On the 18th October, 1939, the present Minister for Supplies &mdash;and I again admit I am using a phrase that the Minister took exception to yesterday, that alarm should be created by what was said; I am only taking a counter to that&mdash;said there was no reason to appreciate any shortage of wheat at all.  That was the crescendo.  The Minister complains that he went out not to alarm but to warn the people, and that they did not take the warning until they complained that nothing was done.  No matter what phrase you take were not the Minister's words capable of the interpretation? Can he complain if they did not look on the bright side and accept them?</P>
    <P>I put it that the Minister and his colleagues have definitely misled the public as to what the situation was. We are told now that we have about six months' supply in the country and it is emphasised, correctly I think, that it is not six months' reserves but six months' supply from this date, so that if we consume the ordinary quantity, we will be short at the end of June, and will not get the new harvest until the end of August or some time in September.  The point that occurs to most people is, when was the warning given about wheat shortage to the public, and when the Ministry had it brought home to them that there was going to be a shortage?  As I gathered last night from the Minister, by the end of November we reached a position of absolute scarcity.  The Dáil met a couple of days after that in December. At the end of November, we were warned of absolute scarcity.  There was a warning at the end of November about grain.  Incidentally, if the Minister wants to get a laugh before <Col N="1663" /> any audience let him go and describe Grain Importers Ltd. as a non-profit-making concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The shareholders are non-profit making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that Grain Importers Ltd. are not making a profit&mdash;a big profit?  Let me say that I hope hereafter we will not have what the bacon scandal revealed happening again.  Grain Importers Ltd., this non-profit-making concern, told the Minister that for some weeks before the end of November they had not been able to charter a single boat to bring wheat here. There were some ships chartered but they had been chartered previously, and it was hoped that they were coming, but Grain Importers Ltd. told the Minister that, for some weeks prior to the end of November, they had not been able to get a single ship to come to this country.  The situation then was that the Ministry knew that Grain Importers Ltd. had been having evidence accumulated as to the scarcity.  They let the Minister know in the end of November and the Dáil met on the 11th and 12th of December. Did we hear a word?  So far from hearing anything about that, what happened was that the Taoiseach went to the Broadcasting Station on Christmas Night, I think it was.  He spoke across the wireless to America and the phrase that he used was that he hoped &ldquo;that our friends in America would see to it if the blockade got any tighter&rdquo;.  This is the man who had the information from Grain Importers Ltd. that, on the 30th November and for a few weeks past, they were not able to get a single ship to bring wheat to this country. He asked America to make an effort to see to it if the blockade got any tighter and to assist us to get wheat.</P>
      <P>On the 31st December the Minister for Agriculture made a broadcast.  The third paragraph of his address that night is the only one I wish to read:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When speaking to you in the past I hesitated to sound an alarming note in regard to our supplies of <Col N="1664" /> foodstuffs for human and animal use. The time for hesitancy is past.  I now wish to state quite positively that if our people can survive the dangers which lie ahead, all essential foods must be produced at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on the 31st December.  We had the other information at the end of November so that a meeting of the Dáil took place in between at which some Parliamentary announcement should have been made.  I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture would tell us whether there would be any better likelihood of getting a bigger crop of winter wheat if he had spoken at the end of November than if he had spoken when he did.  It is not as if there was nothing to be gained by saving that month.  Why was it not given about the end of the previous month?  Why was not some hint of danger given?  As I have said, there was a meeting of the Dáil on the 11th and 12th December. Why was it not availed of to bring this warning to us?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into this question of tea.  I understand from the Minister that, so far as his investigations go, all that happened in regard to tea was that one wholesaler restricted his supplies to his customers.  If that is the situation&mdash;and mind you, I doubt it very much&mdash;the spread of that man's deliveries over the City of Dublin was enormous.  I mean the ordinary spread, because the number of shops in which people were being offered a ration was great and the usual ration that was made was a ½ lb. where previously one got 2 lbs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to convey was that one man who restricted deliveries succeeded in creating a certain scare which restricted sales in other places without justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>So when the wholesaler met the other wholesalers they agreed that there was no necessity for rationing but, because one man restricted supplies, they did so also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They decided that he should give his usual distribution as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1665" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one speaks to people in very different quarters of this city, in different suburbs and in the interior of the city, one finds that there were restricted sales about that time. As far as I can make out, the ordinary ration doled out was about a quarter of what people were in the habit of getting, and that, we are told, depended on one wholesaler who caused that scare.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One retailer caused a scare in sugar about two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but this is a condition in which every wholesaler knew that that was an artificial scare created, this time about tea, and notwithstanding that I understood the Minister to say they agreed first to restrict their own supplies, and he now says what they did was to bring that man to book. If that was it, they did not move very speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They did, indeed.  It was said yesterday here that the complaints already had disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That scare over the city lasted quite a long time and it was a very rigid thing while it did last. I do not intend going through the list of commodities or the list of raw materials needed for Irish industry.  I simply compare what was said in the House with the memorandum circulated by the Federation of Irish Industries.  The circumstances here do not tally with that.  Sometimes the divergence is very great, sometimes it is not so bad; but it represents two different viewpoints and the view of the federation is less optimistic than the one taken by the Government spokesman here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the Minister for Supplies made his complaint that people did not understand him when he sent out a warning at the time.  Is he making the same mistake with regard to raw materials in Irish industry?  If there is to be any pressure, any leaning of emphasis, it ought to be towards the restrictive side, it ought to be <Col N="1666" /> definitely stated that the only policy to follow at this time is the conservative one.  People should not be let become over-optimistic and, if we are to have our purchases reduced, then let it be done by a gradual adjustment to the new situation rather than by a jump as we had in regard to petrol.</P>
    <P>I again come back to the point that the difficulty that the country faces and that this meeting of the Dáil was to resolve was this difficulty with regard to the relationship between members of the Government and the public generally.  I said at the beginning that this was partly due to a belief that the people would not bear easily hard things.  I think they should be trusted a bit more.  Their fibre has not been so weakened as all that.  It was also due, I said, to the great powers put into the hands of an unworthy person which had led that person to abuse those powers.  I refer to the censorship.</P>
    <P>I think there should be a proper appreciation of that, as I want to tell everything frankly and do not want questions about belligerents passed over.  Is there an appreciation throughout the country that one of the belligerents is sinking as well as it can any supplies coming to this country?  That belligerent is making no distinction between supplies coming to this country and those going elsewhere.  Is there an appreciation that the other belligerent is helping us to get supplies in, and not only that, but that whatever we get in is with the active, and I would almost say unremunerated, aid of that belligerent in spite of the other?  Is there any appreciation of that throughout the country and, if there is not, can the fault be laid anywhere but on the censor?  Why should that not be promulgated throughout the country?  I should say that, in these circumstances, the only policy that should be adopted for this country is to try to interlock our economy, in so far as it is complementary, to the English economy.  I do not see how it is possible to make people's minds properly attuned to that unless the situation that I talk about is properly, fully, honestly and constantly pressed home upon them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> That is one of the big handicaps in the present situation&mdash;that there is no real appreciation of the position we are in.  People talk vaguely and people have talked vaguely.  At least, the phrases are almost certainly used concurrently: &ldquo;We are not at war&rdquo; but &ldquo;there is a war on.&rdquo;  We should have some clearer outlook than that. We are now able to tell a little bit better what the war means to us, even though we are not at war.  I think we should also be able to tell a little better and in more specific terms just how we are being helped and hindered while still not in the war.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been stressed in the papers is this.  I know it is a dangerous thing to deal with because if it is not taken in the proper spirit it will be regarded as most offensively personal.  Ministers now confess that they appear to have failed in their efforts to convince people that there is a serious situation.  I have been asking myself whether Ministers compare their own activities with their own words and whether their example could not be a little bit better and whether it might not increase the importance that they wish to have attached to their words.  I am not referring to things that have been vulgarised through the Press and used to be made a topic of abuse by present Ministers against us.  A Minister had himself given an impression in ordinary dealings with people that there is a crisis, a serious situation, but nothing making for tension, nothing that ought to work against undue relaxation.  I will go a bit further.  I do not know if Ministers feel that they are giving to the country an example of hard work or of efficiency in their work.</P>
    <P>I think, without in any way disturbing themselves, that a better example could be given.  I ask further that some time or another Ministers would take the Dáil a little more broadly into their confidence as to what they have done when we are discussing past things.  We do not want to indulge in any great lamentations about spilt milk.  Our desire is that those people <Col N="1668" /> who break pitchers will not be trusted with these valuable things again. Would Ministers tell us what they are doing for the future?  Have they any idea of a changed situation arising after this war is over?  We may have to move with a certain amount of speed and alacrity when that day comes.  Has anybody considered that, and have any tentative conclusions been arrived at with regard to that?  I see no evidence of it.  If Ministers are doing that, they are keeping quiet about it.  It would do the country good, I think, if Ministers were to give a lead in that regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, an appeal has been made to have the Dáil more frequently in session.  I think there was definite neglect on the part of the Government, in so far that the statement with regard to the wheat position was not made here when the Dáil met on the 11th and 12th December.  Deputy Esmonde, I think, asked that the House should sit continuously.  I do not know if there is a need for that.  Perhaps it would meet the situation if the House were to assemble fortnightly so that we might have a statement on what had happened in the meantime.  Ministers in other countries who are overburdened with heavier cares than our people are doing that.  There is no reason why the people in this country should not have the same advantage. I should prefer that to the practice of broadcasting statements, because here we can ask questions but you cannot retort on the wireless.  I plead with the Taoiseach that, for the future, we should have a little bit more frankness with the people and with this House, and that we should have more frequent meetings of the House, so that that better frankness can be evidenced here.</P>

      <P>I propose to quote from the Dáil Official Report.  It is not yet the Official Report, but I presume its accuracy will be accepted. Deputy Dillon said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am putting it to the Minister that independent parties offered to build, in this city, storage for a 12 or 18 months' petrol supply, and they were told by the Minister that he would not make the land available for them because he wanted it for his own oil refinery on the quays.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That is not true.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: I am submitting that that proposal was made to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Will the Deputy say who were the parties?</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: When that proposal was made the Minister suggested that they should go to the Phoenix Park, make a hole there, and put petrol there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We discussed it at some length, but the suggestion was that independent parties had offered to build storage accommodation sufficient to keep a 12 to 18 months' supply of petrol, that they were told by me that I would not make the land available which they wanted, because I wanted it for an oil refinery, and that I suggested instead that they should put their storage accommodation in the Phoenix Park.  The facts are as follows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: Who offered to build the storage tanks?</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: The offer was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1670" /> Mr. Lemass: By whom?</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: By certain parties.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacEntee: Surely the Deputy could give the names?</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: I believe the offer was made by the petrol combines to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: That is not true, and if those combines availed of the storage facilities that they have it would solve our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Was any offer made by anybody&mdash;was any proposal sub mitted to you?</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: No proposal involving the storage of petrol for use here was ever submitted to me by those petrol companies.  The oil refinery project, which was discussed at great length here, was the subject of negotiations for a long period.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Was there not a proposal which did not mature as a result of failure to reach agreement with the Government?</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: No such proposal was ever made to my knowledge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The facts are as follows: On the 3rd January, 1939, the representatives of the oil companies were summoned to a conference in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time.  The purpose of the conference was to discuss not so much the volume of the oil storage accommodation available, but its safety.  There was a discussion as to whether and, if so, what action should be taken to protect the oil stores against damage during air raids or other belligerent activity.  In the course of that discussion the representatives of the oil companies represented that it was undesirable that the additional oil storage accommodation which it had been suggested might be built underground should be constructed at the North Wall.  The representatives of the oil companies suggested that a much more suitable site in the vicinity of Dublin would be the Phoenix Park.  I <Col N="1671" /> want, for the information of the House and of Deputy Dillon, to point out that that suggestion, that the oil storage tanks should be built underground in the Phoenix Park, came from the representatives of the oil companies who, without having considered the matter, suggested that it might be a more suitable site.  They were requested by my Department to examine the technical problems that might arise in connection with the construction of such oil stores, either at the North Wall or the Phoenix Park, and to prepare an estimate of what they would cost to build.  The memorandum of the 16th January, 1939, which has been mentioned here was a a reply to that request: an intimation that its main purpose was to give an indication of the cost of erecting accommodation not for a 12 or a 16 months' stock, but for a three months' stock.  They also intimated that on further consideration of the matter they did not consider that the idea of building storage at the Phoenix Park was a practicable idea.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion conveyed by Deputy Dillon that the oil companies wanted to build storage and that we were preventing them by denying them a site, the officer of the Department who met the representatives of the companies, following the submission of that report, stated in his report that &ldquo;there is no likelihood of the petrol companies undertaking this underground storage themselves.&rdquo;  The only other record that I can find in the files that have been sent to me concerns another conference at the Department which related not to the question of extending storage but to the complaints which my Department were then making that the existing storage was not being kept fully filled by the oil companies.  That was the conference that was held in April of that year.</P>
    <P>I think these facts, which are incontestable, should dispose of this matter. Personally, I do not know what the importance of the matter is.  Deputy McGilligan stated that, in April of last year, I was asked to meet representatives of the Petroleum Pool Board, <Col N="1672" /> and that I intimated that I desired to be informed who the representatives were and what their status was.  I am speaking from recollection, and my recollection is that I was asked to meet the representative of one petroleum company.  I did ask to be informed who the representative was and of his status there.  I do not know if Deputy McGilligan thinks that my position as a Minister of this State is such that I must meet any representatives that any companies might choose to send to see me.  The incident ended when I was informed by the managing director of the subsidiary company here that he was going to make inquiries on that matter, and I heard nothing further about it. I am speaking from recollection.</P>

      <P>On 10th April, this particular man, who later approached the Minister's officer, had got a letter saying that shipments were going to <Col N="1673" /> be cut down&mdash;and there was some adjective after that&mdash;and then there is a request for an interview with the Minister in order to have supplies of petroleum products discussed.

      <P>I can say definitely there is no such memorandum on <Col N="1674" /> the records submitted to me.  I am speaking from recollection and this matter of storage accommodation came under discussion with the companies at the request of the Government, and for the sole purpose of ensuring that our preparations against the war situation were complete, and we did not get any satisfactory result.  In any event, it is quite clear that if we had the whole country dotted with petrol storage tanks, underground and overground, it would not improve our position by one gallon at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the question of expanding the wheat acreage.  Representing a country constituency it might be said that a person like myself was not able to judge in detail what farmers required in order to carry out the Government programme, but if you take the advice of the right people and go around the country, you will learn what regions or areas of any particular part of the country are equipped for wheat growing, and when you talk to people generally and study comparative reports, perhaps it is almost easier for a person who is not himself immersed in the work of farming, at least to make a comparison between the situation as it actually exists and as it might be under better circumstances.  I should like to submit to the House that this country is far from being adequately equipped to face a rapid growth in our tillage, to face an enormous ploughing up of land, and that the steps the Government have taken in the way of offering grants to farmers for land improvement are excellent, but require a great deal of expansion, if the ideal is to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now about to extend further our tillage.  We have a very small and <Col N="1676" /> negligible supply of artificial manures. We have certainly a considerable number of farmers who are improperly equipped to produce farmyard manure. We have at least 500,000 acres which, in the past 20 years, have gone back to rough grazing from being arable land.  We have literally thousands of miles of choked drains and thousands of miles of hedges that have grown beyond their normal confines, and we have a vast area of old pasture land which, according to any modern definition, is unfit to take its place in a proper rotation of crops.  I should say that, without any exaggeration, only 5 per cent. of the farms in Athlone-Longford were fitted, from the standpoint of modern agricultural technique as it exists to-day, to face a war situation; that about 45 per cent. were fairly well equipped; and that 50 per cent. were grossly lacking in the elements of ideal farming equipment, both as regards farm equipment and the condition of the land.</P>
    <P>This is not a debate in which we need do any post-mortems.  For 20 years, we have discussed matters of importance superior to that of developing intensively our agriculture, and we now have to see what we can do to remedy the situation when it requires remedying.  We know that we cannot get artificial manures, but we know that we can encourage the agricultural community to improve the land, to put rough grazing land back into cultivation, to clean land, to clean out drains and to take every step possible to make the land we have, even without artificial manures, produce as much as possible.  I heard Deputy Fagan in a recent debate&mdash;I think it was the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture&mdash;say that the headlands and uncut hedges in his constituency were in such a bad condition that if they were properly cut and if the headlands were cut back, there would be a sufficient area for production to feed the people living on the farms on which these headlands existed.  That perhaps was rather a dramatic statement, but it certainly had an element of truth in it.  Further, as we know from the last war, the yield of all cereal crops rapidly <Col N="1677" /> declined about 1917, as a result of a heavy tillage programme without sufficient artificial manures.  We are bound to face that situation, so that even if we were able to grow a sufficient quantity of wheat, of animal feeding stuffs, on a given acreage this year, by 1942 we should have to have a still greater acreage in order to make up for the lower yield in the crop.  That is a serious circumstance.  We also know that the fact of cleaning land, drains and hedges provides a certain amount of humus which can be thrown back on the soil and which, while not sufficient to rehabilitate land that requires artificial manures in addition, is of great assistance to the farmer.</P>
    <P>I submit that the land improvement scheme has not been sufficiently advertised and that it is just as well that it has not been, because if it had been properly advertised and explained, there would be an insufficient amount of grant to provide farmers with the necessary facilities.  I think it is the beginning of a magnificent scheme, and I think the Government are to be congratulated for having devised it.  I am aware that the officials in the Department of Agriculture took immense pains to think over all the difficulties that immediately arise when you have any form of scheme involving subsidised labour.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the Department is considering an extension of the scheme and I shall be glad to hear from the Minister that he has this in mind.  According to the figures given by Deputy Maguire of the amount allocated to a certain area in his constituency, it would appear as if increased funds were required.  It has also been represented to me that there is a certain class of farmer who has not the capital to finish the work himself without receiving an instalment of the grant paid by the Department of Agriculture. I admit that that involves great administrative difficulties.  I can see that it is much easier to pay a farmer the grant when he has performed his own part of the task than to give him portion of the grant during the course of the work.  But if it is possible to get over the difficulty in certain areas where these grants are <Col N="1678" /> most urgently required, it would be an excellent thing to do.</P>
    <P>In connection with this land improvement scheme, the question of finance arises.  Assuming that it is not going to be so easy as it was before to obtain finance for such schemes, I submit to the Government that there are certain Departments of State spending money on relieving unemployment in a way which was, perhaps, good enough in peace-time but which is not sufficiently co-ordinated during hostilities.  I refer to money spent on minor relief schemes, bog roads, pass roads, bog drains, money spent by county councils, and money granted by the Central Government, to the county councils for road work.  At the same time as money is being spent in this way, we have this growing need for land improvement, and we have a certain fund already allocated to that purpose by the Department of Agriculture. We shall have to make alterations in our manner of life during this war and, if petrol is not going to be available, there is not so much need to repair the roads.  There is certainly no need to straighten corners at which, so far as one can ascertain, no accidents have ever taken place if the roads in question go through country urgently in need of land improvement.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is one factor which should be considered by the Department of Agriculture: it is an undesirable thing to be able to go along a road in the country in the middle of this war, when there is an urgent need for increased tillage, and see men actually straightening a road which does not require straightening from the standpoint of accident, because there has been no accident on it, while alongside that road there are fields one-fourth or one-fifth or one-third of which are going back to rough grazing, with choked drains on either side.  It may be said that road schemes are an easier way of spending unemployment relief moneys, because the labour-content is greater and the work more simple to supervise.  Therefore, we mend the road and neglect the fields and drains on either side.  Again, <Col N="1679" /> I submit that the time has arrived to reconsider that matter and, before any road is straightened with State finance, the lands in need of improvement around that road should be considered. If we put some of those 500,000 acres, which have gone back to rough grazing, into cultivation, it will enable the farmer to get over the difficulty of rapidly increasing the tillage area.  At the same time, as I have mentioned before, extension of the grants for land improvement will make available humus which will be some kind of substitute for the artificial manures we need so urgently.</P>
    <P>A question also arises as to the definition of &ldquo;arable land&rdquo; by the different inspectors who go around the country in connection with the tillage scheme.  I notice that in areas where there is a number of good tillage farmers&mdash;people who, so far as I know, have done tillage simply because they found it possible to do and who had no special means whereby they carried out tillage&mdash;some of these inspectors take a rather lax attitude in defining arable land.  In the midst of this great crisis, you find an inspector defining a field which is a perfectly good field but a few perches of which at the top may be a little bit rough and may want cleaning badly as non-arable land.  I realise the difficulties of farmers in putting land into cultivation but there, again, it seems to me as if it would be necessary in the future to have sterner standards as to what is, in fact, arable land.</P>
    <P>Turning from the question of agriculture to that of industry, I think it would be a good thing if the Minister for Supplies could say a little bit more about the future of industry&mdash;about industry not as it is now but as it will be from four to six months hence.  It is absolutely true that at the present time there is no sign of any great or extensive unemployment in virtually any branch of our manufacturing industries. We still possess raw materials in most of these industries.  It is, however, well that the country should be made aware of the probable position. Our industries may be divided <Col N="1680" /> into three categories&mdash;(1) those in which there is absolutely no sign of a shortage of raw materials; (2) those in which there is a sign of very evident shortage, from three to six months from now, unless shipping is made available; and (3)&mdash;I am glad to say a small category&mdash;in which, already, an acute situation is arising.  Luckily for our own economy, an industry which is at the moment progressing most satisfactorily is the clothing industry.  As far as one can ascertain, as mentioned by the Taoiseach, there are no raw materials in connection with the clothing industry we cannot obtain either in this country or in England.  Even in connection with that industry, it is well to warn the public that we have no very large stocks of cotton yarn in this country&mdash;about three or four weeks' supply&mdash;and that if air bombardment should become very intense in a certain area in England, our cotton factories would, in a few weeks' time, be out of business.  Even although the material is there, it is material that would, naturally, be vulnerable in war time and we cannot rely on continuous delivery from England even in respect of an article like that.  It is well, too, that the country should be aware that we have a heavy kind of wool used for making worsted cloth, but due to the war the factory which makes worsted yarn here was not able to complete its equipment and the wool has to be sent to England to be made into wool tops before coming back here to be made into yarn.  One stage of the manufacture here is missing&mdash;the combing part.  It would not be fair, if war becomes more intense six months from now and if a certain portion of the clothing industry is adversely affected, if the people were to say: &ldquo;You told us everything was right about the clothing industry and look at what is happening now.&rdquo;  It is well to make the country aware of these things.</P>
    <P>When we turn to a second group of industries in which it would appear that there is still plenty of raw materials available we find that in some cases the manufacturers have no idea of where the raw materials are to come from in six months from now if <Col N="1681" /> no shipping can be obtained.  In certain of these industries 80 per cent. of the raw materials may be available but 20 per cent. may not be available which may make the use of the 80 per cent. ineffective.  In other words, if you want to make a certain kind of brush, you may have the fibre and the wood, but if you lack the stitching wire you cannot make that kind of brush.  You can possibly make some substitute, but that does not help employment in the brush industry.  I merely mention that as an example of an industry where materials may be available to a certain degree but where shortage of one material may hold up the industry.</P>
    <P>Again, take an industry which uses a certain kind of solvent.  White spirit, for example, is a very important commodity with very precarious delivery in this country and white spirit is used as raw material in a number of industries.  It is used in the production of paints and polishes.  The delivery of white spirit has in fact been held up on occasions.  It is rationed strictly by the British Government. There again is an industry which looks perfectly all right at the present time but which may become serious later on.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to make a very large list of these industries.  I merely wish to indicate that there is a great region of industry where there are likely to be difficulties after a certain time.  There is no doubt that, as the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures said, we can create extraordinary substitutes in time of war.  Obviously you could make shoes without metal eyelets.  You could make shoes of rough leather which you would not use in peace time.  You can maintain industry to a certain degree but there is no question that if the normality of our production is disturbed it will affect employment even though people may have clothing and the other articles they may require for their ordinary needs.</P>
    <P>Then there are three commodities where there really will be a very great scarcity shortly.  One of them is paper.  One factory I know for a fact <Col N="1682" /> has only one week's supply of pulp left.  The whole of the metal industry, except a very few categories in which the English have a surplus, will be absolutely depending in six months time on supplies from America and the shipping that is available from America.  In certain cases a certain number of factories using metal have had to go on short time.  We may be able to get ships.  It is possible the British Government may release for export certain things they have restricted because they have a sufficient number of them for their war effort, but at the same time let us not delude the country into believing that the metal situation is entirely satisfactory, which it is not.  The third article is timber.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, timber stocks vary from six to two weeks' supply. Although certain companies may have timber for a greater period, I know one of the largest companies in Dublin has very little timber left.  The timber is waiting on the other side of the Atlantic, just as the wood pulp is waiting and just as the metal is waiting.  A very great deal of it is lying on the quays of the United States' harbours, but cannot be got here until we have ships.  I trust the Government are taking steps to go into the native stocks that may be available.  Sooner or later the decision to use native timber, instead of imported timber, will have to be made in view of the approaching shortage.</P>
    <P>I do not wish in anything I have said to exaggerate.  I am merely pointing out that the situation is not satisfactory, as the Minister himself has said, and I want to enlarge a little on the various items of industry in order that the public may have some conception of the position.  We do know what the import position in this country is, generally speaking, from the figures that were given in the last number of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, which I think every Deputy should be aware of.  The volume of our imports is clearly indicated in the last number of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> in this way: the imports have been equated in the Department's statistics on 1930 <Col N="1683" /> prices in order to give an idea of volume as compared with value.  In August, 1937, at 1930 prices, we imported just under £4,000,000 worth of goods.  In August, 1940, the figure was £2.79 millions, already showing a very distinct reduction.  In October, 1937, the figure was £4.03 millions.  In October, 1940, it was £2.16 millions.  In other words our imports were very nearly half as compared with 1937, making a revaluation in price in order to allow for the situation that prices have increased for most articles.  I merely mention that because there is the absolute proof of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Then it is just as well that the country should be aware of the list of articles published in the papers the other day as being subject to licence for export by the English Government, articles which we were previously able to import quite satisfactorily without obtaining a licence.  Those articles include a great number of miscellaneous machinery and tools of the kind which we do not need very much at the present time, but they also include very important raw materials which the public may have missed sight of through not having read the list in detail, such as cocoa butter, glucose, dried peas, coal, the raw materials for polishes, iron and steel, raw silk, cotton and jute yarn.  Of all those articles the British Government had evidently a large export surplus before, and although they may continue to export them to us they evidently think it is important to regard each shipment as being worthy of study and that a licence should be given in connection with each shipment.  There, again, one can see we are entering into a difficult position.</P>
    <P>In fact, regarding the situation as a whole, as far as industry is concerned, we are once again up against the difficulty of shipping.  There is almost nothing that we could not import from the United States for our industries if we had the shipping.  I would like to submit to the Minister for Supplies once more the suggestion to him that has been made from other quarters, that we are rather lost on this side of <Col N="1684" /> the Atlantic so far as American purchases are concerned.  Many of our manufacturers have no experience in dealing with American manufacturers. Nearly all the goods have to be paid for when they leave the factory in America before they arrive at the port or before they are put on the railway to come to the port in America for shipment.  In other words, instead of paying for goods as we used to in the old days on their arrival here or on their being placed on board in New York, they have to be paid for the moment they are manufactured in the United States, in the factory there. That creates very great delays in delivery.  It creates delays in payment and creates delays even in the ordering of the goods and I would like to suggest to the Minister for Supplies that he should consider whether some sort of committee in America could not be of assistance to us in expediting purchases and in obtaining what shipping is possible and even in obtaining supplies of shipping.  I know there is no ideal remedy.  I know it could not make the difference between an entirely satisfactory situation and the present situation, but even if it would increase the available importations from America by 10 or 20 per cent. it would be justified, particularly in the case of materials which are required to maintain very important types of employment in this country.  I would like to ask the Minister for Supplies whether he has given consideration to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>As far as the shipping situation is concerned, it would appear, in discussing shipping, one immediately initiates a <i>post-mortem:</i> it would have been better if we had a mercantile marine. We have not got one and, therefore, all we can do is to negotiate for ships that are available and to use them for our necessary importations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in rather a difficulty, particularly as I happen to be speaking immediately after Deputy Childers, because I am afraid Deputy Childers has a habit of making speeches in this House with which I find myself in almost complete agreement. <Col N="1685" /> I do not think that is a compliment I could pay to any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am delighted, at any rate, that Deputy Childers took his courage in his hands and gave us, from the facts that he personally is aware of, the situation as far as industry is concerned.  In the statement he made he mentioned a number of articles the export of which from Great Britain is now prohibited, including glucose, grain, coal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to licence, yes. There is one other item extremely important to this country to which the very same thing applies at this moment as far as England is concerned.  The fact is that nobody in this country can at the moment get supplies from England&mdash;except under licence&mdash;of turnip seeds or mangold seeds or any other type of vegetable seeds, the ordinary common or garden seeds that are needed in this country.  My information from shopkeepers in the country is that they do not expect to get their normal supplies of seeds for the ordinary farm production, or even to get any seeds unless licences are negotiated by the firms in England.  I know of one instance where firms in England have written to people here and informed them that unless they can succeed in getting export licences from the Ministry in England they will not be in a position to supply turnip or mangold seeds.  We have been debating here for two days now, and anybody listening to the debate would think that the entire life of this country depended on petrol and wheat. There are hundreds of other items equally vital, and I say that turnips and mangolds are equally as vital as petrol at any rate, whatever about wheat.  I was not aware of the situation until the day before yesterday, and I would ask the Minister for Supplies whether he can do anything, in negotiation with the British Ministry, to see that those people get licences to send us the seeds that will be badly required here.  The time is short now, though not as short as in the case of wheat, but in a month or two all those <Col N="1686" /> seeds will be wanted, and if we are facing the position that, at the end of March, the ordinary wholesaler or retailer of seeds in this country is going to be told by the persons in England who supply seeds that they have not got those export licences, there will be a most extraordinary situation here as regards agriculture, and there will be a particularly extraordinary situation here as regards the small farmers of the country.</P>

I want to know can our Minister do anything to induce the British Ministry to give those licences.  If I am to accept Deputy Belton's word that there is a shortage, it merely means that we have got to go out on a campaign to grow nothing but oats and potatoes here.  We are told there is a shortage of spring wheat, and now Deputy Belton says there is a shortage of those seeds, and, as far as 75 per cent. of the land of this country is concerned, if we have not turnips and mangolds in the small mixed farming areas the only things we can possibly grow are oats and potatoes.</P>

      <P>Quite seriously, if my information is correct, I feel that the position in regard to those seeds is desperate.  As the Minister for Supplies is not present, I would say to the Taoiseach that my information comes from the country shopkeepers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get it looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be difficult for the Taoiseach.  All I want is that, if the position is such as I state, it will be looked into immediately. Another point I want to make is on the question of artificial manures.  I appreciate that there is a shortage, and like Deputy Childers, I am afraid that <i>post-mortems</i> will not increase the supply of artificial manure.  But I want to say this much: The system for the sale of artificial manure in this country was a rather peculiar one, because there was a longer term of credit for it than possibly for any other article retailed in a country shop.  The country shopkeeper was able to sell artificial manure on credit, because the terms he got from the wholesaler or the manufacturer of artificial manure in this country enabled him to do so.  I have no sympathy at all with the people who manufacture artificial manure in this country, because I think the present Government has protected them fairly well, but the thanks that the Government got and the thanks that the people of this country got who have been paying increased prices for their artificial manures is that at this moment they have suddenly decided to close down the entire credit system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of the Minister for Supplies, through the Taoiseach, I might tell him that the former terms between the retailer and the manufacturer <Col N="1688" /> of artificial manures were as follows: 5 per cent. discount for payment on 30th June, 2½ per cent. discount for payment on 30th September; nett on 31st December following.  That was the system upon which every retailer of artificial manure in this country worked as long as anybody can possibly remember.  That is the reason that the retailer of artificial manure down the country was able to supply artificial manure to the farmer and wait for payment until the crop came in.  Now, the manufacturers and wholesalers of artificial manure have notified the retailers that, from last week forward, the position is going to be exactly this: credit is curtailed to the merchants to this extent, that every delivery made to the merchants, whether or not it is only 25 per cent. of the stock he got last year, must be paid for before the 10th of the following month.  If I am delivered 20 tons of superphosphate in January I must pay for it by the 10th February.  If I have not paid for it by 10th February I will not get any further supplies of artificial manure.  If I want an extra supply of artificial manure before 10th February I have got to pay for it.  A number of Deputies in this House have made case upon case in regard to credit.  This is an important item which affects the whole life of the agricultural community&mdash;the fact that retailers of artificial manures in this country will not be in a position to give artificial manures to the farmers on the same terms of credit as they have been doing for a number of years past, simply because the manufacturers have closed down credit.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is no justification for that position, and I can advance a number of reasons for that assertion. There are only two firms of any standing, of any size, making artificial manure in this country; I go as far as saying that there is practically only one firm which deals with the entire output of artificial manure in this country.  In practically every small country town there is one agent, one shopkeeper, representing either one or other of the two firms.  They have been dealing with those shopkeepers <Col N="1689" /> for ten, 20, 30 or 40 years.  Those manufacturers know whether or not the shopkeepers are credit-worthy. They are not dealing with people who jump in one day and buy supplies and drop out next day.  They are dealing with people to whom they have been supplying manures for 30 or 40 years. They know exactly what their position is.  They know that they are credit-worthy, and that if the same system were allowed to be carried on they would be paid on the same terms on which they were always paid.</P>
    <P>But they have decided to close down credit, and they have put the retailers in the position that if they cannot provide cash on the 10th of the following month or in advance of the next delivery they will not be in a position to supply artificial manures to farmers. I would ask the Taoiseach if he would be so kind as to direct the Minister for Supplies to deal with that question, because like everything else we have been discussing here I feel that the position is rather urgent as regards that.  If something is not done about it immediately the retailers will not be in a position to pay for the artificial manure, they will not be able to get it, and the extraordinary position will arise that there will be a number of retailers in the country who are in a position to put their hands on ready cash and a number of farmers who are in a position to put their hands on ready cash, and they will get the artificial manure, while the small man, whether a shopkeeper or a farmer, will be left to do without it.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of petrol is concerned the only thing I care to say about it is this, that personally I think there is a terrible lot of petrol being wasted in the country.  I was very glad to hear a Deputy colleague of mine suggesting that there were certain people who should not get extra supplies of petrol.  He referred to officials of the Government&mdash;it was a very brave statement coming from a Government Deputy&mdash;who are paid by mileage, and who have their own cars and do hackney men out of a job.  I think that is a fair interpretation of what was said.  I do not think those <Col N="1690" /> people should get petrol.  If the Minister for Supplies is going to make a long list of what he regards as essential services in this country, he should be very careful.  I could quite imagine that every hackney car owner in this country, every man with a lorry who is delivering various supplies, every man with a bread-van delivering bread regards his as an essential service.  The bread supply is an important item now, because people have got entirely out of the habit of coming into town for it.  If you are going to compete in the market you have to deliver it to them.  I think Deputy Meaney will agree with me that the same applies with regard to the delivery of milk and other commodities.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to set out a list of essential services, I warn him that the people will resent some things very much.  Deputies of Dáil Eireann might be considered by some people as persons carrying on an essential national service.  The suggestion was made in the daily papers that Deputies were so essential that they should be entitled to extra supplies of petrol.  I suggest that the only fair way of dealing with the situation is that if a Deputy has a car he ought to scrap it, and if he gets 20 or 30 gallons of petrol he should divide it between the lorry driver, the hackney car driver and the man with the van.  Whether that would be considered a proper course in the eyes of the Department, I do not know; I merely give it as an example of what would be fair.  I can imagine a person who is so lazy that if he or she has to go to Mass or to the pictures, the car has to be used.  If the Minister is going to set out a list of essential services he should be very careful in regard to what he considers an essential service.  What a Departmental official would regard as an essential service and what the people in the country would regard as an essential service are entirely different things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible <Col N="1691" /> that there are a lot of people in the country who would not be sorry if there was not a gallon of petrol distributed for the next six months.  I can imagine people in the small country towns, who have been magnificently provided with transport services to take them into the cities and elsewhere, saying that if those services were not there they could easily go back to the old ways.  It just struck me that possibly the Taoiseach would agree entirely with that view.  If we are going to have a shortage of tea and petrol we may come to the stage in this country when we will have reached the ideal of the Taoiseach and we will be living the simple life, drinking light beer or milk, riding bicycles, or else driving in pony traps.  Some people might consider that the ideal situation.  At any rate, if petrol is going to be distributed, let it be distributed only to people who are engaged in the distribution of food for human beings and live stock.  I do not think that the ordinary professional man is entitled to any extra supply, with the possible exception of the dispensary doctor.  I would not give it to doctors who are not dispensary doctors. I would not give it even to local solicitors. I would let them go to the court or the Dáil or anywhere else by train.  The quicker we cut out petrol supplies for people of that type the better.  The train should be good enough for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in regard to one matter the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures could help me as the Minister for Defence is not here. I say that the Army people are wasting a terrible lot of petrol.  This has nothing to do with Army manoeuvres; it is purely a business proposition.  My information is this, that in the Southern Command practically all the contracts for supplies to the Army are in one area&mdash;Cork City, for example&mdash;and that on certain days of the week from barracks or houses that the military occupy, some 40, 80 or 100 miles away, empty lorries go to the city for meat, bread and other necessaries. From the Army point of view it may be a much more economic idea to have <Col N="1692" /> one single contractor in Cork City who will supply everything, but the fact is that if an Army lorry leaves Killarney for Cork to get a supply of bread or meat it is driving 60 miles empty and thus wasting petrol.</P>
    <P>It is quite within the ingenuity of the Minister to devise some scheme whereby commodities such as bread, meat, eggs, butter, potatoes and other vegetables could be supplied to the Army by people in the vicinity of the military post.  Everybody knows that the statement I am making is absolutely correct, because you cannot travel any road without being passed every 20 miles by two or three Army lorries carrying the driver and perhaps one man.  These vehicles are driven empty on the inward journey, and I suggest that there is a great waste of petrol.  Instead of centralising contracts, as has been the practice here for years, they should be distributed among the areas where the military are situated.  When the Army officers propose to establish a military post, they go to a town and spend days looking around to find suitable accommodation to house the soldiers.  During that period they could equally well find out whether there were people prepared to supply them with bread, butter, milk or meat.  That would obviate Army lorries driving empty over long distances through the country.</P>
    <P>The entire debate seems to turn on the question of petrol.  I am thinking of hackney car men more than anybody else.  The Minister for Supplies and Deputy Meaney were very indignant at the suggestion that people were threatened or induced or chased into taxing their cars.  Everybody knows that a statement was made on the radio and was published in the Press suggesting that if persons had their cars out early in January, without having them taxed, they would not be supplied with petrol and possibly would be prosecuted.  Car owners did not get even the customary 14 days' grace. That did not matter so much to the private car owner, to the Deputy, or the professional man, but it did seriously affect the hackney car owner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> There is a certain difficulty in the case of the hackney car man, and I have referred to it on at least two occasions here.  Every county council in Éire has a system under which quarterly licences are issued.  Let us say the tax on an ordinary Ford car is £16.  I and other people may be in a position to pay the tax for the full year, but there are unfortunate hackney car men who cannot afford to pay £16 and they are obliged to tax their cars quarterly.  The trouble caused to the county council officials in issuing four slips of paper instead of one costs the hackney man an extra £2, because he is charged £4 10s. a quarter.  That amounts to £18 a year for the man who cannot afford to pay the full amount of tax.  Compare that with the £16 charged to the private owner who can afford to tax his car for the full year.  I raised the matter on a number of occasions.  When the last Budget was under discussion I asked the Minister for Finance to do something about it.  The position is that the man who has not the money necessary to pay the tax for the full year is penalised.  Some official of the county council has merely to stamp a small slip of paper four times a year and that means an extra £2 for the man who takes out a quarterly tax.</P>
    <P>Those unfortunate people were the people who were caught by the petrol shortage.  They are hard hit because it means the livelihood of many of them.  I can imagine the feelings of some unfortunate hackney car men who have paid the full tax and insurance and now they have no guarantee of a petrol supply.  I wonder how the Minister or Deputy Meaney would feel if they were induced to tax their cars and were placed in the same position as many hackney car drivers. I say that as far as these people are concerned 90 per cent. of them are earning their living solely as hackney car drivers, but I believe that, since the price of petrol went up, they have been finding it hard to make a living. The whole point about the tax question is this, and I would ask the Taoiseach to speak to the Minister for Finance about it.  If there is anybody in this <Col N="1694" /> country, either a hackney car driver or a private owner, who is now prepared to say that, owing to the shortage of petrol, he will cease using his car altogether, if he has paid a full year's tax, will he get a rebatement of three-quarters of that tax?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The hackney car driver is in a different position from a private owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin, but not in the country.  There is an entirely different situation as regards the taximen in Dublin.  There is no essential difference between the hackney car owner in the country and the private owner except that the hackney car owner must have his car inspected periodically to see if it is fit for hackney purposes.  Let us assume that there is a hackney car owner in my town who had £16 on the 31st December last and who paid his full year's tax.  He now finds that, owing to the shortage of petrol, it would be much better for him to try and earn his living in some other way.  If he notifies the county council that he is scrapping his car, and that he does not intend to run it in future, will the Government make arrangements whereby he will get a rebate of three-quarters of the tax that he has paid?  I know that, as the law stands, even if you use a car once in a quarter, you are liable to pay a full quarter's tax.  I think, however, that it is most unfair if people who have these cars now find that they are in the position that they cannot make a living out of the cars, and if they are prepared to lay them up, will not get a rebate of at least three-quarters of the tax.  If a man is prepared to say that he will make no further demands on the reserves of petrol, that man is doing a national service to a certain extent and he is making it much easier to maintain the country's essential supplies.  I think the most these people should be charged is one quarter's tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the question of wheat, I do not claim to be an expert on wheat-production, but like a number of Deputies from Cork and Kerry and <Col N="1695" /> from constituencies in the West, I realise that if we are going to get any very large increase in the acreage under wheat it must come from the people who have good land.  As far as the people of North Cork and of West Cork are concerned, the Government might be making tillage orders for the next 50 years before they would be affected, because we were tilling more than one-fifth of the holdings there long before tillage orders were heard of.  I have listened to people talking about tillage farmers since I came into this House, and I have got the feeling that there is a general assumption that the only tilling worth while is done in counties like Wexford and Carlow, but the mixed farmer in my area, tilling a farm from 40 to 60 acres, produces as much proportionately from his farm in the way of animal and other feeding stuffs as any other area in this country. Deputies from my area know that there are places that will grow turnips and mangolds in that district but that will not grow wheat very well.  I feel that the wheat-growing should be left to other areas, though I have no doubt that the farmers in my area will grow as much as they can.</P>
    <P>It is said that a panic was created about the agricultural situation.  I feel that that panic was created simply and solely because two Government Departments, on their own statements, not verbally, or not over the radio, but in black and white, showed that they did not know their business.  This morning I had the temerity to ask the Tánaiste whether the Minister for Agriculture would intervene in the debate and the Tánaiste replied with that historical remark: &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;  I waited, saw and heard and I must confess, as a person who is not an expert, that I am not now any better educated that when the Tánaiste told me this morning to wait and see.  I wonder who is Minister for Agriculture in this State?  Is it Deputy Seamus Ryan or Deputy Seán Lemass, the Minister for Supplies?  For a number of years since Fianna Fáil came into power, the Dáil and the country, at the behest of the Government, have been paying a salary to the Minister <Col N="1696" /> for Agriculture, Deputy Dr. Ryan, to carry out certain functions.  I have always felt that the Minister for Agriculture is one of the few people in the Government that is hard to tackle. One can get cross with the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I would not say that one could get very cross with the present Minister for Finance, but one could get cross with the former Minister for Finance and one could get definitely very cross with the present Minister for Supplies. The attitude of the general body of people in this House, however, towards the Minister for Agriculture is that he is not a bad poor fellow.  Everybody feels it is like shooting a sitting bird to attack him at all.  With his benign and innocent countenance, he can get away with things that no other Minister could get away with, but if he is going to get away with what has happened in the last fortnight, all I can say is: &ldquo;Lord deliver us from Ministers for Agriculture.&rdquo;  He is supposed to be Minister for Agriculture.  He is the man who is responsible for making tillage orders.  He is the man who has officials by the thousand all over the country in a position to tell him what policy is necessary.  He made a statement that the amount to be tilled for the coming year was one-fifth of all arable holdings.  I think everybody was satisfied with that.  They felt that it was an advance on last year, when the area was one-sixth.  People, in general, felt that they should face up to that situation even though there might be a difficulty about seeds and manures.  Neither the people of the country nor Deputies kicked up a row or objected to that acreage, but the Minister for Supplies actually lost his head at the idea that only one-fifth of the arable land was to be put under tillage.</P>
    <P>As I say, we have that in black and white and I want to know who is Minister for Agriculture.  If the Minister for Agriculture is right in saying that one-fifth of the arable land is the correct area to be tilled, why should the Minister for Supplies write to every Deputy stating that that order was not sufficient &ldquo;to ensure that wheat will be <Col N="1697" /> grown in sufficient quantities&rdquo;?  If the Minister for Supplies felt that the order made by the Minister for Agriculture, prescribing one-fifth of arable land as the area to be tilled, was not sufficient to ensure the production of wheat in sufficient quantities, he should have gone to the Minister for Agriculture before the order was made and said: &ldquo;Look here, you are making an order as to the amount to be tilled and I am warning you now that the area you ask to be put under tillage is not sufficient to ensure the production of wheat in sufficient quantities.&rdquo; Apparently there is not sufficient co-ordination between Ministers.</P>

The Taoiseach says that I would not get very far in court with an argument like that.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach should intervene as he did.  He suggests that I am not serious and that I am quibbling.  I am delighted to cross swords with the Taoiseach over the interpretation of a sentence.  The Taoiseach has been questioning the interpretation of sentences for 20 years longer than I have.  I suggest that he has the failing he always had, that he is not able to interpret a sentence in the common or garden way in which it is meant by the writer of the letter.</P>
      <P>There is one other item I should like to refer to.  One would gather from the debate that wheat and petrol were the only two things required in this country.  I think Deputies from mixed farming areas will agree that there is one other great item of agricultural produce that must be, and can be, developed, and that is dairy produce. The position is that, owing to an exceptionally dry year last year, the milk yield dropped and there was a certain scarcity as we all knew when the butter situation arose.  Assuming that tea would be difficult to acquire, that coffee would be difficult to acquire, and that the various things which make cocoa and chocolate would be difficult to acquire, there is only one alternative in this country, except light beer, and that is milk.  I am quite satisfied that one good thing this Government could do, so far as the farmers are concerned, is to say this year that the milk that is going to the creameries should be made available for the people in the towns and cities who want that milk.  In Dublin they are paying 2/6 per gallon for milk and my neighbours are delivering it to creameries at 5d. per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put up this suggestion from a farmers' organisation which is entirely non-political or anything like that.  It is the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association.  They are not going to say that they will not supply any milk if they do not get a better price.  They merely say that, in areas where it is not possible to reap the benefit from the production of wheat and other crops the price of which will be guaranteed, there will be farmers who are actively engaged in tillage and supplying themselves and the dairy cattle with the food they need.  Some scheme ought to be devised by the Minister for Agriculture this year that would give the farmers who are supplying milk to the creameries a better average price than last year.  I think that can be done in this way.  There must be thousands of people in the cities, thousands of children whose mothers would give anything for milk to give them.  During the emergency, at any rate, I do not see why the milk that would be normally turned into butter to send away at a price nobody is satisfied with should not be sent to the towns and cities and sold at a reasonable price to the poor people who want to buy it and why the farmers delivering it to the creameries should not get a reasonable price for it.  I do not suggest that I am expert enough to work out a scheme.  But I feel that we are facing a position like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this is a scheme that could certainly be adopted during the emergency.  I should like to put it from the point of view of the small farmer who is not in a position to pay cash for his manures or seeds this year or to pay for much extra labour and who will not be in a position to sell the tillage he grows for cash, because he will need it for himself.  He is entitled to get something to enable him to carry on as well as anybody else.  The only way he can do that is to give him a proper price for milk.  There have been 101 schemes in this country.  We have sunk sufficient money in bogs to keep the country floating in milk for a number of years. If the money sunk in the bogs was used to help the small farmers I would be better pleased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that point there is just one other reference I should like to make. I did not get an opportunity earlier because I only came across the point this morning.  There are many lime-kilns throughout the country which have been out of use for years, as everybody knows, and are practically derelict.  Now, the fact that there is a scarcity of manure this year will increase the demand for lime and, while we have these lime-kilns all over the country, most people do not know who owns them.  They are there on the side of the road, unused and derelict, as I have said, but quite a number of people throughout <Col N="1702" /> the country would be quite willing and prepared to work them on a cooperative basis.  Groups of farmers in a particular area could arrange to work these lime-kilns in co-operation with one another, and I do not think it would be such a terrible demand to ask the Minister for Agriculture, in cases where a group of farmers are willing to work these lime-kilns, to provide, say, £30, to enable them to do so.  I do not think that would be an excessive demand, and it is certainly work that would be of great benefit to the community.  We have these lime-kilns all over the country and the limestone is also available quite adjacent to the kilns.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general situation, so far as the people of the country are concerned, the question of tea and other commodities of that nature is not quite the same, but the very same situation may arise there as in connection with seeds.  Can the Minister for Supplies tell us whether there is any danger that the import of tea into this country will be restricted in the same way as seeds and that we would not be able to get such commodities as tea except under licence? If so, the very same kind of thing is going to happen in regard to tea, and I am afraid something has happened in connection with tea that is not very nice.  As far as I am aware, the country shopkeepers had a normal supply of tea and have been giving it out in a normal way, and I was very much surprised, when I came up here to Dublin, to hear every second person I met saying that they could not get tea here or that they could not get it there, while there seemed to be no shortage in other places.  If that sort of thing is going to happen in this country, then the sooner we ration commodities such as tea the better.</P>
    <P>If you ration such commodities, then everybody who should get them will get them, but if you do not ration such a commodity as tea, in such circumstances as I have referred to, then the people who cannot afford to spend a lot of money or to pay down cash at the moment, are at the mercy of the traders, who will only sell for cash or to people who can pay a lot of money. Take the case of the unfortunate <Col N="1703" /> woman who has to wait for Saturday night to come along in order to have money to make her purchases, and contrast her case with that of the persons who can pay a lot of cash down at any moment and get all they require and more.  Therefore, if there is any danger in regard to tea or any such commodity, I say that the sooner it is rationed the better.  In that regard I say that it is vitally necessary in this country, so far as the distribution of supplies is concerned, and in case the situation gets so serious as to make rationing necessary, that we should have some type of national registration here, because unless you have some kind of national registration, such as they have in other countries, how are you going to ration these commodities?  If you have not got a system of registration the same thing will happen as has happened in regard to other things.  It will be a matter of what somebody said was an essential supply at a particular time last year, or it will be based upon what some people said they got at a particular period last year.  If there is any likelihood of a shortage in such commodities, then I say that the Minister should ration them immediately.</P>
    <P>As far as this campaign for extra tillage is concerned, might I say this to the Taoiseach: that whether the figure of one-fifth was right or wrong, I do not think the Minister for Supplies was right in suggesting that the one way to expedite or help an increased tillage campaign in this country was to hold public meetings.  I would say quite frankly to the Taoiseach that if there is anything that the people of this country are really fed up with it is the holding of public meetings. They have had dozens of them in the past six months, a regular flood of oratory.  Now, the Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;induce&rdquo;.  If you are going to use inducement on the farmers to grow extra wheat, you are leaving yourself open to a very dangerous situation.  I do not have to tell the Minister what that means.  The word &ldquo;inducement&rdquo; means something that is obvious to the Minister, from the paper that is before the House to-day. <Col N="1704" /> We are going to induce people to do this, that, or the other thing, and I do not think you will get very far in that way, because it means that one section will be induced to do certain things and be paid very well for doing them, while others, who have always been doing their best to carry on and who will carry on, are not being offered any inducement or being paid for it.  That is the reason I mentioned milk.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should induce one section of the community to go in for certain things and pay them for doing so, and at the same time leave another section of the community to produce everything for themselves and for their animals and for the community and get nothing out of it.  I am quite satisfied that the small farmers here will produce more than the one-fifth. They will produce everything for themselves and their animals, and more.  Listening to the debate here from all sides of the House, and being aware, of my own knowledge, of what the position is as regards seeds, I would say, on behalf of the small farming community of this country and the people in the small country towns who have small plots and gardens, that they do not want any inducement to grow everything that is necessary, and if the rest of the community acts up to this emergency in the same way as the small farmers, the Taoiseach will not need anything to induce anybody to grow sufficient for all our requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F. Crowley Mr. F. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of unfair criticism has been levelled against the Government regarding supplies, and I am wondering, do some of the Deputies realise that the Government have only direct control over what is produced in this country and practically no control over outside supplies or imports coming into this country?  I must say that some very helpful suggestions have been made from all sides of the House during the course of this debate, but I certainly did not like the tone of Deputy Dillon's speech last evening.  When the Government were going all out on a campaign for extra tillage, increased wheat and so on, Deputy Dillon thought it good enough to suggest to the farmers that there may be no possibility of a shortage and that, if there were, we could <Col N="1705" /> go over&mdash;hat in hand, as Deputy Corry said&mdash;to the British Government and ask them for wheat and food supplies to feed us.  That is an amazing outlook for a man of the standing of Deputy Dillon, particularly in view of the fact that the British themselves are involved in a life-and-death struggle at the present moment and have not even sufficient food for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only rising now in order to touch upon one or two vital points.  I wish particularly to refer to the matter of transport, and I do so because I am fairly satisfied that there is a certain amount of abuse in the use of petrol, and not alone has there been abuse, but I hold that petrol has been misused and wasted in this country.  At a recent meeting of the Kerry County Council, where the annual expenditure on the maintenance of main steam-rolled roads was being considered, the County Council decided, after serious and protracted discussion, to cut that expenditure on main steam-rolled roads by 50 per cent.  They did so for three reasons: (1) on account of the shortage of petrol; (2) on account of the unnecessary plying of buses on routes parallel to the railways; and (3) on account of railway lorries running on routes parallel to the railways. I suggest that Nos. (2) and (3) are definitely abuses of the use of petrol and I think it is the duty of the Minister for Supplies to see that we do not have two or three kinds of locomotion running on parallel routes.  I need only bring you down to Nassau Street or Westland Row here in Dublin, and what do you find?  You find the railway leaving Westland Row for Dún Laoghaire, and only about 100 yards from that you have the Tramway Company also running on a parallel route to Dún Laoghaire.  I do not think that the distance between these two routes is more than 150 yards at any point, and yet you have them running parallel for a distance of about 12 miles.  Side by side with the tramway track you also have a bus route.  I think this country is too poor to support a luxury like that.  You have there three forms of public communication with one particular point 12 miles outside <Col N="1706" /> Dublin, and any of the three different systems are not more than 100 yards from each other.  I have worked out within the last few hours, from my own experience, what that means.  It means that either by bus, train or tram you can get to Dublin, and if you miss one bus there is another one every four and a half or five minutes.</P>
    <P>When there is a shortage of petrol I suggest that the whole question of transport should be investigated.  If there is a scarcity of petrol only desirable services for the delivery of seeds and necessaries to farmers who live in country districts should be allowed, as well as the collection of beet and supplies of milk.  It is unfortunate, as Deputy Dockrell stated, that petrol should be the bread of industry.  As we allowed that position to develop my suggestion is that as petrol gets scarcer we should revert to horse traffic.  When the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce was before the House I made an earnest plea for reversion, as far as possible, to horse traffic.  At that time I suggested that there would probably be a shortage of petrol, and that we might be thrown back on our own haunches.  I mentioned that if the running of unnecessary buses and lorries was discontinued, it would mean that we could put 35,000 horses and cars back on the roads.  The change would mean a saving of £3,500,000 yearly, assuming that the drivers got £2 a week.  In addition there would be an expenditure of £1,050,000 for feeding, and possibly £11 or £12 yearly for the maintenance of each car and repairs to harness.  I worked it out to a figure of £6,000,000 annually.  For these reasons I would not be sorry if the petrol shortage continued.  Possibly reversion from lorries to horses and cars would be too big a leap to take at once, but if it came gradually, I would not regret the change, because we are not producing buses, lorries or petrol and these three items represent £3,000,000 yearly going to other countries.</P>
    <P>After transport I wish to deal with credit and seeds.  Nobody wants to boost dishonesty or laziness, but there are cases of financial hardship where <Col N="1707" /> farmers have got into debt through no fault of their own, where they may be in arrears for rates or annuities, or possibly owing to sickness, expenses incurred with hospitals and where nobody was available to take the place of the breadwinners during their absence. In such cases I suggest that the Government would make some arrangement to examine the records of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Land Commission, and pick out the worst cases.  They might then arrange with local seed merchants to advance seeds to these people, the subsequent crop to be a guarantee for payment, with an assurance from the Government that they would not seize the crop for arrears of rent.  I understand that a similar arrangement has been made by the Beet Company.  I agree with Deputy Linehan that there is a tightness in credit at present, as small shopkeepers are not getting credit from big merchants, who may not be getting credit from the banks.  The question of providing seeds is one that the Government should take particular note of.</P>
    <P>In areas in the congested districts where land has been reclaimed, many people are going to try to grow wheat, but that land is more suitable for growing potatoes.  Within the last six months some three or four potato meal plants have been operating very successfully in England, and I suggest that the Government here should investigate the possibility of getting one of these plants as an experiment.  As I got some details from a creamery manager, I consider that the matter is worthy of examination.  One plant is available at present, and would cost about £10,500.  In six months that plant could deal with 9,000 tons of potatoes.  It would need 2,500 tons of turf to dry the potatoes to give a meal equal in food value to maize meal at a slightly higher price per ton.  I stress the importance of investigating the possibilities there, in view of the statements of some Deputies, that there may be a surplus of potatoes and that we might not know what to do with them.  The same plant could manufacture potato flour.</P>
    <P>When the Estimate for the Department <Col N="1708" /> of Industry and Commerce was before the Dáil last year, I stressed the importance of a Ministerial pronouncement with regard to turf.  I asked him to give a guarantee that if there was sufficient turf of a suitable kind available he would restrict the imports of coal.  Unfortunately, at that particular time he could not see his way to do that, and the result was that there was only a quarter more turf produced than was available the previous year.  The turf cutting season commences in April, and I now suggest that the Minister should make a pronouncement, because we are paying out about £6,000,000 yearly for household coal.  I am not suggesting that we could do without coal, but, of that £6,000,000, some £3,000,000 might represent storage, transport and merchants' profits, leaving £3,000,000 for wages. If that £3,000,000 could be kept here, 40,000 extra men could be employed at 30/- a week, or 30,000 men at £2 a week.  That indicates the importance of paying attention to peat development, and that is the reason I urge the Minister to deal with the question.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I want to mention concerns the production of producer gas from coal and turf.  A start was actually made with the production of gas from turf, and a lorry was successfully driven by that power in County Carlow.  During the Great War small milling plants sprang up all over the country, catering for the crushing and grinding of grain for farmers.  In order to explain the importance of developing the small mills, I might illustrate the position by stating that wheat grown in Dingle, in order to be converted into flour, must be taken a distance of 30 miles to Tralee, or 20 miles to Killarney, and possibly 50 miles to Mallow.  The flour has then to be brought back, involving a journey of possibly 100 miles.  Small mills would save all that transport, and would prevent the damage to flour which always occurs on long journeys from exposure to moisture.</P>
    <P>If you had a smaller mill that would be capable of supplying the farmer and his own particular family, the towns could be supplied from the bigger mills in Cork and elsewhere.  I believe that <Col N="1709" /> the Government have done remarkably well so far as supplies are concerned, that is, under the present circumstances. I do not know that there is any great justification for creating the alarm that some people have created. I have been very, very pleased to be here in the House and to realise how seriously some of the Deputies in the Opposition have taken the debate and that useful suggestions have been made.  It is one of the first times I have seen a really healthy criticism of any problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is indebted to Deputy Cosgrave for providing the opportunity for this very interesting debate.  I think it was Deputy Alfred Byrne who remarked to-day that the Government had nothing to conceal and very little to reveal.  I am not quite sure that he was right.  In my opinion the Government have a good deal to conceal&mdash;in fact, they conceal some things that they might very well have admitted.  This is a war situation but, nevertheless, I am quite satisfied in my mind that many things could be made clear to the people that are not now made clear.  I do not want to say anything that may be labelled dangerous. There may even be certain things made plain to the ordinary citizens of this country about which they are in doubt, as to the happenings in the importation of our most necessary merchandise.  As every Deputy knows, the country is full of rumours&mdash;some of them rather dangerous rumours&mdash; which might possibly be dispelled if there were a little more frankness in Government Departments and not such a severe censorship on the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of things that the Government have revealed, I am not objecting so much to the smallness of the revelation as to the manner in which the revelation was made.  Had there been a little more frankness generally&mdash;and, personally, I am not quite sure whether the Ministry was indisposed, or afraid, to be frank&mdash;we might not have had so much confusion of thought amongst the people generally. From various speeches made by the Ministers primarily responsible for supplies&mdash;the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;the <Col N="1710" /> people have gathered rather contradictory conceptions.</P>
    <P>In some of the speeches the people are led to believe that they might be comparatively secure of supplies and, in the next breath, some other Minister, or possibly the same Minister, says with equal force that there is fear of a scarcity of certain articles.  We had that revealed even in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned what I may call the petrol scandal&mdash;it really is a scandal&mdash;and when he said, in rather mild terms, in one of the mildest speeches delivered in this House, in opening this debate, that people were induced and compelled&mdash;I think he used that word&mdash;to take out licences by the happening of the last week of the year and the beginning of this year, he was then referred to in a rather nasty manner by the Minister for Supplies.  I understand the Minister said there was no truth in Deputy Cosgrave's accusation.  Now it has come out in the debate that there was very much truth in what Deputy Cosgrave said and that, as a matter of fact, he had put the case very mildly. At this late stage in the debate, I do not want to enter into a repetition of what has been said already by very many Deputies on this subject, but it must be clear to the majority of Deputies in this House, whatever Party they may represent, that there was at least, from the way in which the petrol situation was handled, a reasonable doubt in everybody's mind &mdash;doubt that could have been dispelled by a frank exposition of the position by the Minister for Supplies.  That Minister said that, on the 24th December, all was right, and that on the evening of that day all was wrong.  I understand he said that it got a little better towards the end of the month. Anyhow, the position on the 31st December was little different to that on the 2nd January, but on the 31st December the people were told that they might expect in January, if they taxed their cars, to get the value of the unit in their permits.  If that was not a clearly implied statement to the owners of motor-cars that, if they took out their licences, they would get&mdash;on the January permits, of which they <Col N="1711" /> were in possession&mdash;an amount of petrol equal to the units on their licences, then I do not know what plain language is.  It was clear to the Minister that the bulk of the people on the 7th or 8th of January had taken out their licences and gone beyond even that.  This is a point which I do not believe has been stressed hitherto in this debate: some of the people who might have laid up their cars not only took out licences but also renewed their insurance policies, which fell due in the same period.</P>
    <P>They found out to their dismay that the value of the coupon, which they assumed on the 31st December would get them one gallon, was reduced to a quarter of that.  If that was fair treatment to the motor owners of this country, I do not know what words could be used to express my opinion of it.</P>
    <P>The debate has run over a great many subjects.  It has occurred to me that we have not had proper concentration by Ministers on the supplies that were available or the possible supplies that might come on.  On the question of rationing, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the only thing they attempted to ration was petrol, and they had the satisfaction that the people got a reasonable supply during all the period.  In fact, I think the Minister said that they got more than a reasonable supply, that while the sea was thick with wrecks the people got a fairly well assured supply of petrol.  I suggest that when the sea was thick with wrecks of tankers, that was possibly the time when the Minister might have said to the motor users that our tankers were being wrecked, and that the possibility of a continuance of a supply had greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>At that time the Minister might have taken the precaution of cutting down the ration that operated, thereby stretching out as much as possible the amount in hand.  The way in which the matter was handled caused immense confusion and a great wrong to motor users.  It was said in this debate that the only thing directly rationed was <Col N="1712" /> petrol, but a number of other things were indirectly rationed.  For example, we produce more butter than we need for our own requirements, and yet it was rationed, if not directly by the Government, then by others.  I think one Deputy said that, wisely or unwisely, the Government passed on the dirty work of rationing butter to the retailers in Dublin and in other centres.  There were many people in Dublin who were able to get only one-third or two-thirds of their usual supply, while, as some Deputies said, there were many poor people who found it very difficult to get any butter at all.  There can be no excuse for that.</P>
    <P>It should have been apparent to the Minister for Agriculture and his advisers that, due to the very dry summer we had last year, there would be a big falling-off in milk production at the end of the summer, and that, consequently, the output of butter would he much less than in a normal year. He should have known, therefore, that if the exports of butter were not stopped earlier than in former years there would be an insufficiency of butter to meet normal demands during the winter.  The Minister for Agriculture did nothing.  In fact, he allowed the exporters to export butter when he should have insisted on retaining enough to meet the demands of the home market.  The export of that butter did not benefit anyone in this country.  It was a disadvantage in this way: that the people primarily concerned, the farmers, got less for their butter which was exported than they could have obtained for it on the home market.  That was a clear case of muddling.</P>
    <P>With regard to tea, there was also indirect rationing.  Deputies have pointed out that in the City of Dublin a rationing system was operated.  In many cases people could not get tea at all.  The defence offered for that by the Minister for Supplies was that one wholesaler in Dublin held up supplies and did not pass on enough to his retailers to enable them to meet their customers' requirements.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan who described the Minister's explanation as rather farfetched. The manipulations of this <Col N="1713" /> wholesaler must have been rather widespread, because I am aware that for a period of from eight to ten days one could scarcely get a lb. of tea in the City of Limerick.  It could not be got for love or money, and there was a regular panic there in regard to tea. Whether the explanation of the Minister is correct or not, the fact remains that tea was rationed for a period.  If, for any reason arising out of the war, we are not able to get sufficient supplies of tea to meet the ordinary demands of the people, then I agree with Deputy Linehan that the proper policy to adopt is to face up to that situation now and make a distribution of the available stocks so that people will have supplies of tea over a fairly prolonged period.  It would be much better to do that than wait for the inevitable disaster and then spring on tea users the surprise that was sprung on petrol users on Christmas Eve.  One hopes, however, that the position in regard to tea and other commodities will improve.  These are matters that ought to be considered seriously by the Government in view of the grave doubts expressed by Ministers as to the amount of shipping that may be available for this country in future.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to wheat has been very widely debated.  Several Deputies mentioned various counties in which wheat could be grown in an extensive way, due, as they said, to the suitability of the land.  Those Deputies should bear in mind that, while it is necessary for all of us to back up the campaign for the growing of more wheat for the production of all the flour we need, it is also necessary for us to produce a sufficiency of other foods that are almost equally necessary for our people.</P>
    <P>It might very well happen&mdash;I do not say that it will&mdash;that the application of a compulsory tillage order in certain districts of the country would result in damaging rather than helping the State.  The application of such an order may imperil the industries carried on in those districts as regards the production of butter, milk, pigs and other agricultural products, all of which are almost as necessary for the people as wheat for the production of <Col N="1714" /> bread.  In my opinion there should be no diminution in these products referred to because if so it will be severely felt.  Take the county that I represent.  It is a dairying county and the land there is rich, if one cares to say so.  I have no hesitation in saying in this House or elsewhere that the people living on that land have done their duty by this State as readily and as wisely as the holders of land in any other county in the State in the matter of the production of food of various kinds, in the quantities produced and in the amount of labour engaged in the production of that food.  Taking all these things into account, production in that county compares more than favourably I would say with that in any other county.  The percentage of labour engaged by the farmers in the dairying industry in County Limerick per acre, or even on a population basis, is amongst the highest in the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to pass on that point as regards the amount per unit of the valuation, to Deputy Allen if he likes.  We are a very highly valued county.  Our valuation is much higher than the valuation of the Deputy's county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because of the value of your land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Our overhead charges, consequent on that valuation and on the inevitable rise which has taken place in local expenditure in recent years, are much heavier than in the Deputy's county.  That rise in local expenditure hits the farmer in our county much more heavily than the rise in the Deputy's county.  The Deputy will hold up his county as being the foremost county in the State in relation to employment on the land and as an example of the principle that tillage will give more employment than anything else.  The Deputy <Col N="1715" /> will be the first to argue that, and his county has, possibly, more tillage than any other county but, per acre, per unit of valuation, or whatever way you like, we employ more labour in County Limerick than is employed in County Wexford.  That is an indisputable fact, which can be shown by statistics issued by the Department. It is an established fact which has been stated here on several occasions, and which cannot be denied.  I, for one, am prepared to go out and tell the Limerick dairy farmer, if it is essential to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>And it will be done.  I am prepared to do my part and to set a headline, but personally I do not believe it is the right policy.  I do not believe that a sufficiency of wheat can be got in other counties.  I am not referring to Deputy Allen's county, which has produced its share, but other counties perhaps have not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that it is in counties like the Deputy's where so much can be done?  The counties which are doing what the Deputy calls their share at the moment will not give us the increase. It will have to come from the places which have not been doing that particular production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I say that these farmers will give you the increase, but it will be at a sacrifice. <Col N="1716" /> The increase must be brought about by sacrifices and, if people make sacrifices, they ought to be recouped for doing so.</P>
      <P>I come now to another point which probably may be somewhat unpopular. Although I listened to this debate as carefully as any Deputy, I failed to ascertain, from all the speeches made, the exact acreage of wheat we require or the exact acreage already sown. We did not get any clear expression in regard to that from the Minister for Agriculture to-day.  So far as I understood him, the Minister said that 300,000 acres had already been sown and that he did not expect any more winter wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister tells me that he expects 300,000 acres of spring wheat&mdash;because that is what it comes to&mdash;I say that the Minister is expecting something which he will never get and which every Deputy knows he will never get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one point.  I doubt whether the seed will be available. The extra tillage has to be provided, as the Taoiseach admits, by farmers who have not done tillage already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase is to be brought about by breaking up lea land and if any Deputy tells me that, without a tremendous inducement, without almost compelling the people to do what it is not proper to do, you are going to get a decent crop of spring wheat off lea lands, he had better preach agriculture to somebody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I flatter myself that I know more about wheat growing than Deputy Meaney ever knew or learned.  You may call me a dairy farmer or any other kind of farmer, but I know more about wheat growing than most of the Deputies talking about it, and if any Deputy tells me that you are going to get 300,000 acres of spring wheat off lea land&mdash;well, I am not in the habit of making the retort made here by a Minister to a Deputy on this side; I never called any Deputy or Minister a liar and I am not going to do it now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We need more frankness in this debate.  If we had had more frankness, we would not have witnessed some of the scenes we witnessed to-day, and if the Minister for Supplies had been more frank and had been prepared to give the House the information which he ought to have given, we would not have had all the arguments we had.  If the Minister, when Deputy Dillon made his statement yesterday, had given the information that was dragged out of him by Deputy McGilligan later, instead of hurling at him the reply that he was a liar, or something to that effect, the debate would have proceeded more smoothly. It was apparent, when Deputy McGilligan rose to his feet and when we saw the sheaf of documents come up from the Department, that the Minister's statement that there was not a word of truth in what Deputy Dillon had said was all a fake, because the truth of what Deputy Dillon said, and what Deputy McGilligan repeated, emerged during the discussion of the petrol transaction when the Minister was forced to give the information asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be frank with one another and let us face facts.  If the Minister for Agriculture is correct in his statement that we have got nearly all the winter wheat grown that we are likely to have grown, I say that it is almost idle for us to expect that we are going to get the balance of it from spring wheat grown on lea land.  If we do, it will be almost a miracle, which brings me <Col N="1718" /> to this point, that if we are going to do the miraculous, there are only two ways in which to do it.  One is by imbuing the farmers with the fear of starvation. The fear of starvation will produce much, but it will not of itself produce 300,000 acres of wheat on lea land.  There must be some other inducement.  Every farmer in the country is not like every Deputy here.  Some of them, mainly because there was not that frankness and that exposition of the position facing the country there ought to be, are not completely aware of the vital necessity of the position.  If they were, there perhaps might not have been the reluctance there was in regard to the provision of the necessary amount of winter wheat.  We might have had, two months ago, as has already been stated here, the demand made which was made in such strong language to-day, and the situation to a great extent might have been saved.  Winter wheat might have been grown to a greater extent, but the position becomes much more difficult at this late hour of the day.</P>
    <P>One of the inducements to grow more wheat is fear of starvation.  Another is cash.  By that I mean a fair price to the people in return for the trouble which they take. In all the circumstances and having regard to the war position, I believe that £2 per barrel is not sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fair price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the circumstances in which we are, with a war situation.  The Taoiseach said that they had made a fair investigation into the price.  I would like to know what form that investigation took.  Was it made in the way in which investigation into the question of a fair price for any other commodity would be made?  If it was necessary for the country to produce some other article, how would you arrive at a fair price?  You would approach some person, or group of persons, say that the country wanted such an article and ask them if they could produce it.  The reply would be that they could produce the article but they would have to get a certain price and they would have to be guaranteed a <Col N="1719" /> sale for it&mdash;in other words, competition would have to be eliminated.</P>
      <P>There would be some negotiation between the Minister and the industrialist, and everything would be arranged.  The industrialist would get his price and would be assured of the market.  While there is a fair price, a fair profit and a guaranteed market for the manufacturer, when you want the farmer to produce anything, it is a question of compulsion and eviction. That is what the Taoiseach tells us is a fair investigation.  With whom was the price settled?</P>

      <P>The motion before the House states: &ldquo;While recognising that the area under tillage, particularly the area under wheat...&rdquo; I am sorry; I have quoted Deputy Belton's motion.  The motion before the House is: &ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government should define the probable future situation in regard to <Col N="1720" /> essential supplies and indicate what steps are contemplated for their equitable distribution...&rdquo; Wheat is the most essential foodstuff there can be. The Taoiseach and Ministers were allowed to deal with the question of distribution in this debate.  We were told that there would not be enough to distribute unless 300,000 extra acres were sown.  That will not be produced unless an adequate price is offered. We cannot distribute what we have not got.  I am trying to advise the Government as to the best method to produce the required acreage.  I may be frank with the House and say that I do not believe we are going to get the 300,000 acres of spring wheat, but let us, in the name of God, get as near to that acreage as we can.  Let every Deputy pull his weight.  I shall pull mine.  But the Government must give more encouragement than they are giving. Give the farmer-producer the same inducement that you would give a manufacturer.</P>

Nach bhfuil fhios ag an domhan gurb iad na daoine bochta is mó itheas an plúr?

Níl mé á n-iarraidh i n-aisce uilig, ach ba cheart iad a thabhairt antsaor do no daoine seo.  Mar gheall ar bheith ag obair ar na bóithre nuair ba cheart dóibh bheith ag cur fhataí níl an síol acu féin agus ní féidir leo iad fháil.  Anois, ná bíodh leithscéal ag an Aire ná ag an Taoiseach faoi airgead, mar féadann sé airgead a fháil le haghaidh chuile rud eile.  Mar sin, fagadh sé an t-airgead le haghaidh an tsíl.  Tá oifigigh i gConamara ag an Aire Talmhaidheachta cho maith agus tá in Éirinn agus a dhéanfas a ngnotha má fhaghann siad an t-ordú ón Aire. Má chaitheann muid cur a dhéanamh, caithfemuid síol a fháil.  Leis sin, ba mhaith liom go dtiubharfaí amach beagán síl céad-fhomhair.  Bhí fataí nua agam féin an 24adh Bealtaine cho maith agus d'ith mé ariamh.  Duine ar bith a mbeadh siad seo aige agus rud ar bith leo, ní caillfí leis an ocras é.</P>
    <P>Anois faoi na boithre iarainn. Dubhairt an Taoiseach go mbha cheart dúinn uilig an méid úsáid a bhaint astu seo agus d'fhéadfadh muid.  Chuir an Teachta ó Luingeacháin leis seo. Nach furasta don Teachta agus don Taoiseach bheith dhá rá seo!  Nuair bhí bóthar iarainn againne i gConamara thóg an Riaghaltas seo aníos í, dhíol siad na ráillí leis an Sasanach nó le duine eicínt eile, agus d'fhág siad sinne gan bóthar iarainn.  Thug Balfour in aisce dhúinn é, agus thóg sé an Riaghaltas seo é bhaint dínn. Anois, muna bhfaghann na lorries agus na busanna petrol sa cheanntar seo, ní bheidh aon cheanntar ann.  Beidh ocras agus anshógh ann, marbhadh agus mailís ann.  As ucht Dé, ná tugadh an Taoiseach cead é seo tárlachtáil. Feicim na céadtha cár ó tháinig mé annseo go Baile Átha Cliath ag rith le taobh na dtramannaí agus na mbusanna; agus aréir sa teach ósta a raibh mé a' fanacht, bhí damhsa ann; ar an taobh amuich dhe, ar an tsráid, bhí go hárd os cionn leithchéad carannaí.  Petrol le haghaidh mailíse agus diabhlaidheachta agus pléaráca agus gan deoir le haghaidh obair Dé ná a leitheide!  Bhfuil aon ionghantas go bhfuil muid mar támuid?  B'fhéidir go n-iarrfaí: &ldquo;Céard a rinne sibh roimh petrol ná railways?&rdquo;  Bhí báid againn annsin ach, faraoir géar, leigeadh na báid le fánaidh agus tá faitíos orm <Col N="1725" /> nach bhfuil teacht ar ais acu, mar níl na saortha ann le n-a ndéanamh mar bhí fadó.</P>
    <P>Duine ar bith a thógas isteach an méid atá ráidhte agam, feiefe sé go bhfuil droch-aimsir roimh Chonamara agus a leitheide, gan iad a' fáil blas ó dhuine ar bith ach déirce, le hais an méid atá an chuid eile den tír a' fáil. Tá sean-ráite ann: &ldquo;Déirce dá chuid fhéin don amadán.&rdquo;  Nach shin é atámuid a fháil, ag íoc as scéim leictreachais, as scéim biatais agus eile, agus gan sinn ag fáil blas ar ais.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Taoiseach as ucht Dé breathnú isteach annseo é féin.  Muna ndéana sé ar son na ndaoine atá beo é, déanadh sé ar son chnámha an Phiarsaigh agus Cheannt é, mar dá mbeadh siad sin beo indiu, ní bheadh an Ghaedhilg agus an Ghaeltacht mar tá siad, gan Murchadha gan Mánus, gan srian gan aigheastar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this discussion has been very useful, and the Minister for Supplies should be thankful that we have had it, because a good many points have been covered and a good deal of information from different parts of the country has been brought to his notice and that of other Ministers.  With regard to the distribution of manures, I should like the Minister for Supplies or the Minister for Agriculture to take special care that there is an equitable distribution. Some counties are in the fortunate position of having land capable of growing a number of crops without manure.  That is a very fortunate thing for the country in a crisis like this, especially when there is a shortage of manure.  There is another type of land that has no reserve of fertility and, unless there is a sufficient supply of manures, not only will the crops be a failure, but, in the event of this emergency continuing for a couple of years, that land will be absolutely useless.  I should like the Minister to take a note of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the distribution of petrol, I do not want to go over the ground that has been covered already by other speakers, who pointed out where mistakes had been made.  There <Col N="1726" /> is one thing I should like to draw particular attention to.  There is a great waste of petrol caused by giving supplies to buses that are running parallel with the trains.  I suggest that in that respect there is absolute and unnecessary waste.  I merely call attention to that now in order that an effort may be made to discontinue it.  It is a practice that involves not only using up valuable supplies of petrol, but it is doing grave injury to the railways.  In that way there is a double dis-service.</P>
    <P>The main point in this debate concerns our petrol supplies.  I suppose there have been mistakes made with regard to petrol storage, but I am convinced that the biggest mistake this country ever made, a mistake that is largely responsible for nearly all our economic troubles, was made when we changed over to relying upon the power produced from petrol.  We had an alternative source of power and that was horse power.  That type of power was most suitable for this country and this country did little short of committing economic suicide on the day it dispensed with horse power and turned all the men who were engaged working horses and everything connected with the working of horses into the labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>To-day there are many hundreds of men with long, lean faces looking for doles, instead of being employed in the various occupations that kept them busy before the petrol engines were introduced.  One man with his motor car or lorry is now doing the work that occupied ten men in other days.  These people are simply agents for collecting money and sending it out of the country because we have not the raw materials to produce motor cars, nor have we oil wells such as they have in other countries.  It is a popular slogan that we must advance with the times. It may be grand to talk like that, and to advance with the times.  Other countries favour motor cars and motor power, and they have done away with horses.  Every country has its own peculiar resources, and what is applicable to one country is not applicable to every country.  We in this country are not mechanically minded; we are <Col N="1727" /> not gifted in the manufacturing line, and, even if we were, we have not the raw materials.</P>
    <P>Let us compare this country with the United States of America.  In the United States I think there is a motor-car for every five of the population. But what are the conditions in this country as against those in the United States?  I will give you the views of a man who knows all about the motor business in America and in this country &mdash;I am not an authority on those things.  He told me it is much cheaper to run a motor-car in America, that it would be between two and three times more expensive to run a motor-car in this country, taking into account the cost of the car and the expenses involved in the running of it.  In addition to that, the average income in America is more than three times the average income in this country.  Therefore, it is costing the user of a motor-car here about nine times as much as it would cost in the United States.</P>
    <P>The worst feature in this connection is that whereas all the money spent upon that service in the United States is circulated in that country, every shilling we spend on motoring leaves our country, never to return.  I am talking self-sufficiency now and I am not the person to go out of my way to preach it.  The Government have been preaching self-sufficiency for years, but all the self-sufficiency has not made up for all the unemployment that the transition from horse-power to motor-power has cost this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>For some years past there was but one body in this country <Col N="1729" /> well aware of the international situation, only one group of men in this country, outside the foreign representatives in the State, who were aware whether we were likely to be involved in peace or war, or rather whether Europe was likely to be involved in peace or war.</P>
      <P>From the information available to them, the responsibility was on the Government of this State to decide, in the year 1938 or 1939, whether or not it was likely that we would be faced with a war situation.  The country was entitled to expect that the necessary steps would be taken to ensure that, as far as this country was concerned, it would be placed in a position to meet the emergency that was likely to arise out of a war situation. During those years we got very little information in this House and we got no information other than in the House, regarding that situation. It is obvious from what has transpired, particularly having regard to the statement that has been made by the Minister for Supplies, that in 1938 he was engaged in considering the steps that would have to be taken to deal with the distribution of petrol in this country in the event of hostilities breaking out.</P>
      <P>A good deal of criticism has been directed at motorists and at the motor-transport industry generally, during the course of this debate.  That is a short-sighted and very unwise policy on the part of those who are engaged in it.  It is quite clear that scarcely a single one of those who indulged in that criticism ever paid any attention to what are called the Finance Accounts, a publication issued annually in this State since its foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last published Finance Accounts for the year 1939-40, it appears that the customs duties collected here on oils, mineral hydro-carbon (heavy), mineral hydro-carbon (light), other sorts of oil, motor parts and accessories, motor vehicle duties, sparking plugs, tyres and tubes, etc., amounted to £3,046,349 10s. 6d., or almost half the total collected in income-tax in the last year, and within £100,000 of what was collected in the <Col N="1730" /> duty on beer.  Over £1,000,000 of that money was devoted to the upkeep of roads throughout the country, giving employment to great numbers of people.  Is that a negligible matter, or do those who criticise motor transport in this country realise that, without motor transport, somebody else has to be taxed to the extent of £3,000,000, or, alternatively, some services we are providing at the moment are going to be left short of the money that is at present spent on these services?  That is one of the reasons for this motion, and I think it is obvious from what we have heard in this debate that Deputies with very few exceptions feel that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his capacity as Minister for Supplies, has failed in his responsibility to the State.  Unfortunately, he seems to have satisfied not only his own Party, but the Government, that he has done his duty.  It was obvious in 1938, on an examination of the then existing storage capacity in the country, bearing in mind the type of hostilities that took place during the last war, that we had not at that time sufficient storage capacity for the requirements of the State and to meet the situation that would be likely to arise on the outbreak of hostilities, but nothing was done about it.</P>
    <P>Coming down to a still later period, the Minister's statement regarding the steps that had been taken to parcel out petrol supplies was unsatisfactory and unconvincing.  It is almost incredible that countries like Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland presumably, and possibly Belgium and Denmark, did not realise that if they were to store petrol they would have to face a loss in the event of their worst fears regarding hostilities not materialising. Obviously there would be a loss. Would it not be much cheaper for us to sustain a loss in that way than to be placed in the position in which we find ourselves at the present moment? If the steps that are being taken in regard to petrol supplies are insufficient to maintain revenue from that motor transport, apart altogether from any question of the employment that is likely to be interfered with by reason of the non-delivery of petrol, would it <Col N="1731" /> not have been worth while to spend the £200,000 or £300,000 that was mentioned by Deputy McGilligan in order to ensure that the State would have the necessary commodities to maintain an industry which, as I have pointed out, contributed £3,000,000 annually to the Exchequer?  Apart altogether from the question of revenue, would it not have been worth while in order to safeguard people whose livelihood is now endangered, to spend £300,000 on providing storage accommodation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For a three months' supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, that would mean a revenue of over £700,000.  The Minister admittedly was drawing money under false pretences during that period as far as petrol was concerned.  He could do nothing! That is his own conception of his responsibility.  Apart from that, the manner in which motorists have been treated since the 24th December is not creditable to the State.</P>
      <P>In the forenoon of Christmas Eve the situation was perfect; in the afternoon it could not have been worse.  On the 31st December a notice was issued saying that the value of petrol coupons was not being changed. What was the meaning of that?  If there was any meaning in it, the motorist was justified in concluding that the petrol coupon to which he was entitled would have the same value as before.  Ten days afterwards, having paid his road tax, he finds that the value of it is reduced to one-fourth. I say that that money was collected under false pretences and, in all equity, it should be returned if a person paid in good faith and has not got the value he was entitled to expect by reason of that announcement. It is not a small matter, and to my mind the manner in which the Government has dealt with this question is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we turn to the question of wheat.  Was it not obvious, from the information at the disposal of the Ministry, that there would be a shortage in practically all European countries soon after hostilities commenced? <Col N="1732" /> According to what we have heard from the Minister, we have six months' supply but no reserve beyond that.  The unfortunate issue of this debate, to my mind, is that the Ministry has not convinced those who were willing to be convinced and who were hoping that we would be able to convince them in regard to the situation which we have to meet.  For some four weeks past, the sinkings of vessels have been the lowest by almost 50 per cent. of the average for the previous five or six months.  During all these months it was obvious that we were coming to a point in which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replenish supplies.  It was rather refreshing to hear from one member of the House the fact that although we are neutral and have officially adopted a policy of neutrality, the treatment we get from the belligerents is that one belligerent will sink anything coming here and the other belligerent, to whom perhaps we are not as impartial as we might be if we are to judge by certain pronouncements, is willing to help us, and has helped us, in this emergency.</P>
    <P>Let us be perfectly candid with the people and let them understand the situation.  So far as the German belligerent is concerned, it is he who is sinking our vessels and making it difficult for us to import.  So far as the other belligerent is concerned, we have had it from the Minister himself, as far back as March or April last, that he was getting every facility and accommodation possible.  I am not at all satisfied that it is not possible for the Minister to get even more assistance from that source, and I think the country is entitled to get all that it can, and that it might be made mutually advantageous to the two parties.  We have certain goods which are useful and indispensable to them and they have certain goods that are equally useful and practically indispensable to us.  If we come to a still more important matter, the provision of foodstuffs for our people, we are faced with quite a number of items of goods which have to be imported: tea, wheat&mdash;if it is possible to import it&mdash;and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> If there is likely to be a shortage of these materials, are we going to be presented, within a certain given number of months, with the same situation as we have with regard to petrol?  If we are, the sooner there is a national register, and that there is fair treatment all round, the better.  The Ministry, through its spokesman, the Minister for Supplies, some months ago advised people to store all that they could.  Everybody cannot buy.  Presumably those in better circumstances stored all they could, but those who have not got much money could not afford to buy, and must purchase weekly supplies according as they are available.  If it so happens that the cheaper sorts have been absorbed by those better able to purchase them, and only the dearer sorts are now left for the poorer people, it is a situation which should convince the Minister that he should have a rationing scheme without delay.  My opinion, for what it is worth, is that the Minister was informed in the early part of 1939 by a certain group of merchants that they would purchase tea to cover a three years' supply, and that that offer was turned down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not somebody's job to answer it?  If food is being used for one purpose that is required for a more important purpose, is that not the concern of some member of the Ministry?  And should it not be stopped?  Has the Ministry, during the last six or eight months or at any time, ever examined a report of the Banking Commission with regard to the farmers of the country?  Do they realise that, according to that Banking Commission Report, practically half of the farmers were indebted in one form or another to the banks, that a very large number of them had frozen loans?  If, by reason of the difficult financial position in which those farmers <Col N="1734" /> are placed, there is going to be any shortage of output from these farms, whose business is that?  Is it the business of any member of the Ministry?  Is it impossible to solve? I do not believe it is.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed, perhaps, more with the speech of the Prime Minister than with that of any other member on the other side.  If I gathered a correct interpretation of his speech, it is that &ldquo;he was informed,&rdquo;&ldquo;that his information was,&rdquo; and so on.  In other words, he is taking it from somebody and it is that person's responsibility. This situation is too serious to hand over to somebody else in a month or two.  Some particular person ought to be held responsible for it and, in my view, if one person has responsibility more than another, that person is the Head of the Government and he should have a greater sense of responsibility than to accept the words of a Minister.</P>

In other words, I want to be convinced, in connection with this tillage proposal that we are getting now, that the land will produce the proper quality of produce. I do not know whether I have explained in that short sentence what I mean.  Is the Ministry satisfied now &mdash;apart from propaganda&mdash;from expert advice, that this extra tillage is not beyond the capacity of the land, that it is not going to deteriorate the land?</P>

The Minister's speech and nobody else's.  What is the reason for that? Surely the entire wisdom of the State is not centred in the Ministry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not very much behind time and, in any case, there is always an extra half hour.  There have been applications by quite a number of people in different parts of the country for an extension of tillage plots in our towns, or even in rural areas.  That ought to be afforded.  Mention has been made here of black bread.  I am rather surprised that anybody mentioned that.  It is unlikely that any admixture that is going to take place is going to produce black bread; it may be brown bread, but there is a difference in the two colours.  If we are likely to be faced with a shortage of wheat in June or July, the people of the country are prepared to face any temporary inconvenience, and it will not be an inconvenience to all of them in a case of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I suggest that, if we have to add barley to bread&mdash;it is a subject <Col N="1738" /> about which I know nothing whatever &mdash;we ought to get the barley without interfering with other industries.  It ought to be possible to purchase barley without going to the distilleries and interfering with their work.  At any rate, the effort ought to be made to get it in other directions before we go to hold a pistol to the heads of those in that industry.  It is quite true that we will get it from them if we need it, but it is true also that it is unreasonable to get it where it is used for other purposes and where it will interfere with employment.  I do not want the Government to get away with the idea that I am opposed to breaking the land.  I am not opposed to breaking it.  I am opposed to the breaking of land and getting no results.  If, by reason of the extension of the tillage that is proposed, we are satisfied from agriculturists that it is possible to do it, I am perfectly prepared to back that proposal.</P>
    <P>May I say that, while the Government has put down a proposal to till one-fifth of the land of the country, I inquired from the Land Commission to know what lands they had, and they informed me they had about 90,000 acres.  I inquired how much of that could be tilled.  They told me one-third at first, but I was informed later that only one-ninth of it could be tilled.  I wonder if, in that connection, the Land Commission is going to be relieved of the responsibility by doing the one-ninth instead of the one-fifth, and if any consideration will be given anywhere else to the same set of circumstances. I know one particular case in the country where there are practically 1,000 acres of land, a Government holding. Will that be tilled in its entirely?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one-fifth of the arable land&mdash;the land that can be tilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I am satisfied with that.  What about the holding of 1,000 acres&mdash;if that is arable land?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the Land Commission: it is in the Department of Defence.  I think it is in Cork.  If it is arable land, will it be tilled in full?  Will the whole of the land in Tallaght be taken?  Assuming that it is arable land, will it be tilled?  We are asking other people to make a great effort: will we, on our part, will the Government on its part, show a good example?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to keep the House any longer.  I am very considerably disappointed by the manner in which the Government have treated this motion.  It was not put down with a view to raising any acrimonious discussion.  In my opening statement I was hoping that the Government would realise their responsibility.  I am very much afraid that it has not. I am afraid that they are prepared to go along hoping for the best, but not prepared for the worst.  In a situation of that kind they would be well advised to reconsider their whole policy with regard to the present difficulties. I do not know whether Deputy Dockrell told the House to-day about the saying of Bismarck: &ldquo;So far as rumour is concerned, you need pay no attention to rumour until it is officially contradicted.&rdquo;  That is the <Col N="1740" /> situation I would like to have corrected in this country if it were possible.</P>
      <P>So far as any effort or co-operation towards improving the general situation is concerned, in getting in all the food that is possible for the people and in taking every measure to safeguard the lives of the people and to preserve the national economy of the State, we are prepared to help in every way that is possible, but we are entitled to ask that, regarding what we are asked to co-operate in or what it is desired that we should do, we should be convinced that such a thing is desirable and that it is good sound policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good policy to till all we can, if we can turn out good stuff from it.  I cannot go around the country advising the Minister in each particular case, but I would again urge the undesirability of breaking land where it is not suitable for the purpose of producing food.</P>
