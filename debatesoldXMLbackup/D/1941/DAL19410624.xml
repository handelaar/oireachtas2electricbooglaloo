      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, pending the introduction of the measures for the purpose of providing compensation for loss of life, property and personal effects as a result of the Dublin City bombings, steps will be taken without delay, by Emergency Order or otherwise, to make available financial aid (by the allocation of a cash allowance) to enable those affected to restore or partly restore their homes and business, and also to provide a substantial weekly cash allowance to the widows and dependents of victims of the bombing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's wishes are already being substantially met by the arrangement between the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the Dublin Corporation, under which the corporation have authority, subject to recoupment In the Government in due course, to carry out repairs to damaged dwelling-houses sufficient to make them habitable, to provide temporary accommodation for people left homeless and to make cash advances for the purchase of furniture and clothing.  I have no reason to think this arrangement, coupled with the assistance being rendered by the Irish Red Cross and other agencies, does not meet the situation reasonably well, pending the making of definitive provision for compensation. The necessary measures to this end are in an advanced state of preparation; the Bill dealing with property losses is expected to be ready for introduction in the House next week:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the last portion of my question &mdash; whether any arrangements have been made to give a temporary cash allowance to the widow, Mrs. O'Loughlin, and the widow, Mrs. Callery?  Where are they to get the means to maintain themselves while the Bill is being prepared?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I consulted with the City Manager and I believe the City Manager has no power to give a cash allowance to maintain those widows or their dependents during the period that will elapse until the legislation is enacted.  If what the Minister says is correct, I shall be very glad if he will communicate with the City Manager and indicate to him that he can make a cash allowance for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the cause of the delay in sanctioning the proposed extension of Dean's Grange burial ground, and if, in view of the report of the county medical officer of health and of the engineer concerning the necessity and the suitability of the proposed extension, he is prepared to sanction the same without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed extension of Dean's Grange burial ground requires careful investigation and consideration and no unnecessary delay has taken place in dealing with the matter.  The original proposal was not agreed to.  A subsequent report of the board's, consulting engineer suggests alternative lands for an extension of the burial ground to those originally proposed by the board.  A decision will be notified to the board in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the Department sanctioned an investigation into the proposed extension?  Has it not authorised an investigation into the matter and the digging of trial holes in 35 acres of land belonging to Mr. Nolan?  Has not that land, with the sanction of the Department, been valued and a price agreed to by the Dean's Grange Burial Board and has not a detailed scheme in relation to the new ground been sent to the Department at the Department's request? So far as I am aware, everything possible has been done by the Dean's Grange Burial Board to complete this matter and the Department has been notified that within ten years there will be no burial space in the existing burial ground.  In view of all this, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate if the Department is against an extension of the Dean's Grange burial ground, or is it going to sanction the proposed extension, seeing that the ground has been tried and a price agreed to, and everything, in fact, completed and submitted to the Department?  I might say that each step in connection with this matter was approved by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> I have nothing to add to that unless this, that, according to my information, the existing burial  ground should meet requirements for the next 25 years, and there does not appear to be any occasion for in urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he received a proposal from the County Kildare Board of Health to increase the wages of Mr. P. Dempsey, who is employed at the Waterworks, Newbridge; if he will state the date upon which the first proposals were received, and what is the cause of the delay in authorising the increase proposed by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was appointed caretaker of the pumping plant in 1936.  In 1938 the board of health proposed an increase of 10/- a week in his remuneration.  The maintenance charges of the Newbridge water and sewerage services are very high.  There has been excessive consumption of water in the town due apparently <Col N="7" /> to leakages.  The claim for extra remuneration was apparently due to extra time occupied on pumping water each day.  It is the duty of another employee of the board to supervise the distribution system. Until there is evidence of suitable action being taken by the board to curtail the considerable waste of water and reduce the high maintenance costs the proposal to increase the reimuneration of the caretaker of the pumping plant cannot be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this matter has been under consideration by the Department for three years; that I was promised constantly by the Department that an inspector would be sent down to Newbridge to inquire into this man's duties, and into whatever difficulties have arisen, but notwithstanding frequent promises no inspector has, in fact, gone there after three years, which is a scandalous delay, even for the Department of Local Government? Will the Parliamentary Secretary now take some steps to have the matter inquired into by an officer from his Department?</P>

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board,as a matter of normal policy, makes a supply of electricity available wherever it is possible on a reasonably economic basis.  In view of the anticipated shortage of coal supplies in the near future, as well as the growing difficulty of obtaining supplies of materials, the board finds itself unable to arrange for new installaions and has to urge its existing consumers even to restrict their use of electricity.

The high expense, among other considerations, would not be warranted, particularly in present circumstances.  Irish dance music is well catered for at present, being broadcast on an average three times a week.  Apart from dance music, national music is a regular feature in programmes contributed by the Irish Radio Orchestra, An Ceol Chumann and various branches of the Gaelic League.  Every prominence is given to new compositions and new arrangements by our leading musicians.

I may mention, too, that out of 182,694 licences in force on the 31st March last only 302 were in respect of crystal sets.  The fairly complex administrative arrangements that would be necessary to collect a smaller licence fee from this small number would be entirely unwarranted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page II, to delete lines 25 to 30.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should accept my amendments, Nos. 15, 16 and 17.  Very often the fear of a shortage or stoppage of supplies is worse than the actual stoppage, when it comes.  There is no need for me to tell the Minister that we are living in peculiar times, so peculiar that, when-people register their motor cars.  many find that there is no oil for them.  I suggest to the Minister that the fairest way to treat people who are doing business with the Government is to she them a square deal.  If a person registers a motor car, he does so because he thinks he will be able to use it.  If they find that an extraordinary set of circumstances has arisen, by which they cannot enjoy that benefit, there ought to be some way of meeting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> If a trader took money from another person on a promise to perform a service and then found that he could not perform that service, some compromise would be effected.  I suggest to the Minister that it would not be all loss to give to the community their due. If duty is exacted from a person and he is uncertain whether he can enjoy any benefit from it, many individuals will not avail themselves of that service by paying the duty.  If the Government took power to allow people, in such a set of circumstances, to make a compromise for the rest of the term, I am snre a number of people would take out licences who otherwise would not do so.  That is what I meant by my opening remark, that the fear of a shortage was often worse than the actual shortage.  Whether the Minister regards this as a square deal for the motor car users or whether he regards it as good business practice to charge only for the service that is given, his best course would be to take power to give back to the people who cannot use their cars for the rest of the term a portion of the fee for the unexpired term.</P>

I do not think that the emergency should be used to ask this concession as a permanent matter from the revenue.  The owners of motor cars who have not been able to use them to the full extent, owing to the shortage of petrol, or for some other reason, have been fairly met.  We are also considering the alteration of the regulations so as to permit of the issue of a monthly licence.  With these amendments, I think the situation will have been fairly, if not generously, dealt with.</P>

      <P>What will be done under this Money Resolution is about the only thing the Bill will do.  It will provide jobs for three people and it is the only beneficial thing, one might say, that the Bill will do.  It will take three people off the unemployed list &mdash; very likely, three casualties of the last election or three difficult folk who cannot be placed in jobs at present.  This Bill and this Money Resolution are being put to the Dáil, I believe, under false pretences.  The Minister insists, in the absence of any demand for the Bill from workers, trade unions, employers or the community generally, on throwing a Bill of this contentious kind into the public arena at this stage.  In the course of his opening speech, he endeavoured to deceive the House into believing that this Bill would cure unofficial strikes, that, in fact, it would bring more order into our industrial relations, but the Minister knows perfectly well that a reading of the Bill will disclose clearly that it will do nothing of the kind.  It will not prevent strikes; it will not prevent unofficial strikes; it will not in the slightest promote harmonious industrial relations; and the Bill is not intended to do any of these things on its face.  The Minister tried to suggest that the Bill was <Col N="41" /> welcomed by the trade unions, although every trade union which has spoken on the matter has expressed the utmost condemnation of its terms.</P>

      <P>That just shows the Minister's mentality in relation to the Bill.  If the Minister could only hear the stories which his own Deputies who sit behind him told the trade unions, he would know perfectly well that they do not want this Bill, and if the Minister were prepared to take off the Whips, he would realise that he could not get a majority for it.  In spite of the fact that nobody wants the Bill but the Minister and probably a few civil servants who advise him, or misadvise him, as I might more appropriately say, the Minister still persists in pushing this Bill through the House.  I put it to the Minister and to those members of the Government Party who are still free to exercise any independent judgment, that, in view of the widespread opposition to this Bill, in view of the fact that it has been roundly condemned by the trade unions and in view of the fact that its introduction at this stage will seriously impair and not foster the national unity so necessary at present, would they not be prepared to withdraw the Bill, to postpone it until the question of whatever difficulties exist in the trade union movement can be considered in a calmer atmosphere and an atmosphere free from the many other issues which to-day render it very desirable that we should avoid discussions of contentious matters like this Here, in the middle of a war situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I submit.  Sir, while I do not want to develop the argument <Col N="43" /> at any length, that I am entitled to put it to the Minister that at this stage, and in view of the widespread opposition to the Bill, and in view of the fact that he could not get a majority of his own Party to support the Bill except by the threat of putting on the Whip and the threat of expulsion from the Party, he ougth to withdraw the Bill so as not to increase at this period of crisis the indignation and national disunity which has been caused, and is being caused, by the introduction of a Bill of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir.  I am being asked to withdraw a Bill of which the House has already approved in principle.  It seems to me that the speech of Deputy Norton is not a speech which should be delivered on the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May not similar arguments apply here as applied in connection with the Valuation Bill, which has been on the Order Paper for about three years?  The Minister said, in connection with that Bill, at the time, that it would be a boon and a blessing to the ordinary working-class people if it could be passed, and he wanted to rush it through the House.  Yet that Bill has remained on the Order Paper for the last three years, and I say that it would be no harm if this particular Bill were treated with the same lazy indifference as the Valuation Bill or the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Bill.  There is no reason why we should have to pass this Bill to-day or why we should enter on the Committee Stage of the Bill to-day.  Nobody wants the Bill; and if the Minister or his Party had any sense they would deal with the question of supplies which our people cannot get, or with the question of coal prices, or with the question of the export of our male population to Great Britain, or the absence of employment.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, I realise that, but I suggest that instead of dealing with this Bill we should be dealing <Col N="44" /> with these issues.  While these issues are being ignored, and while the interests of the people and the country as a whole are being neglected, the Minister comes along with a Bill of this kind, the purpose of which is to weaken the rights and privileges of trade unions, on the one hand, and, by means of the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, keep down the wages of the workers.  I suggest that nobody wants this Bill, and that the only useful thing which it may accomplish is to produce jobs for three pals.  I suggest that it will not do anything more than that. In my view, the Bill should not be proceeded with, and should be left on die Order Paper to keep company with the Valuation Bill of 1938, which is still there on the Order Paper after three years.</P>
      <P>Who wants the Bill?  Nobody except the Minister.  The Minister is trying to get this Bill through this House by false pretences, by pretending that it will do things that it will not do, and he seeks, as a result of the parsing of this Bill, to weaken the trade unions on the one hand, while doing nothing whatever to protect the interests of the workers on the other hand.  You failed to control prices in the interests of the workers; you failed to maintain employment in the interests of the workers; you failed to maintain supplies in the interests of the people; and having failed to do all these things, you want now to weaken the trade unions, the only instrument left to the workers to do the work which ought to be done by the Government in the interests of the workers and the people generally.  I protest that this Bill is unnecessary, that it is uncalled for, and that it is making war on the trade unions which took such a magnificent part in the building up of this State. These powers are now being sought for the purpose of using them to smash the trade unions, which played such a magnificent part in the building up of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, if, in spite of the advice that has been given to the Minister by trade unions, and of the advice, which I believe, has been given to him by many followers of his own Party, he insists on pushing this Bill through <Col N="45" /> the House, then let him not think that he has still made it law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because although you pass this Bill a thousand times, so far as I am concerned I shall do my left to recommend the trade unions of this country not to recognise it, if and when it should be passed, because it is not democracy but tyranny, and its only object is to muzzle the trade unions and prevent them voicing and protecting the interests of the workers of this country.  As a protest, Sir, we do not propose to move any of the amendments that have been submitted in our names.  So, let the Minister go on with his jack-boot tactics now.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister what this Money Resolution was for, and I should like to repeat that so that the Minister might have a chance of telling the House, in an ordinary and full way, why exactly a Money Resolution is being associated with this Bill when, so far as we can see, through every clause of the Bill the most elaborate precautions are being taken to see that any cost of this measure is going to fall on the trade unions that are being dealt with.  The Minister can only be convincing, in suggesting to the House that a Money Resolution is necessary, if he tells us what particular part of the machinery that is going to deal with this measure is going to be paid for by State funds, and what the functions of that particular piece of machinery are going to be; because I suggest that there is no operation in connection with the Bill for which some section of this BU1 does not provide that the trade unions, or the people representing them, will have to pay.</P>

If the Taoiseach and the Minister for <Col N="46" /> Industry and Commerce, who is the prime mover in this matter, and the other Ministers of the Government, are sincerely anxious to preserve the unity which has existed amongst all sections of the people during the past 12 months, the Head of the Government will come into this House, and, in the interests of peace during the period of the emergency, ask his Minister for Industry and Commerce to withdraw this measure.  I pointed out, during a previous discussion in connection with this measure, that there did not appear to be any justification for its introduction under existing circumstances &mdash; on the grounds that any labour troubles had.  been caused during the past 12 months at any rate.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has just said that the Second Reading of this Bill was approved by a majority of the House.  We all know perfectly well &mdash; and the Minister for Industry and Commerce better than anybody else &mdash; that the Fianna Fáil members of this House, or at least the majority of them, did not listen to any of the discussions on this measure, and that the majority of them were not present in this House at any stage of the proceedings.  Look at the House at the moment.  Out of 77 members of the Fianna Fáil Party, elected by the people of this country to give expression to the will and desire of the people on matters put before the people during the last general election, only seven of them are present, and one of them, representing the City of Dublin, who knows the views of the workers as well, I suppose, as anybody else, is sitting outside the House and will not come in here.</P>

Of course, I daresay the <Col N="47" /> Minister is not concerned about the cost of the Bill since he will be able to recover it from other people.  Is there anybody &mdash; including Deputy Tom Kelly, who ought to know something about the views of the workers of Dublin &mdash; who is prepared to stand up and give reasons why this measure should be rushed through the House, in the hasty way in which it is being sought to be rushed, during this, the greatest crisis that has ever occurred in the history of this country?  Will Deputy Cooney come inside the House and give some reason, which the Minister has not so far given, as to why we should have all this haste in rushing this matter through the House?  I admit that Deputy Cooney, from his personal contacts, must have considerable knowledge of the views of the workers of this city in this matter.  He received a very high percentage of their votes, and is he going to sit silent outside, or come in and support the Minister in rushing this thing through, and rushing it through, as the Minister knows and as Deputy Cooney knows even better, at a time when peace and unity are absolutely necessary amongst our people ?</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Norton in deciding not to proceed with the amendments put down in the name of the members of the Labour Party, for the very good reason that the members who are going to vote for or against these amendments will not listen to the merits of the discussion on the amendments.  I do not know the Minister's views on the amendments that have been submitted, but the Minister may possibly accept one or two of these amendments.  I do not know whether he will or not but if he decides in his wisdom not to accept any of the 48 or 50 amendments we put down for consideration, we can talk as long as we like to the silent Fianna <Col N="48" /> Fáil Benches opposite and, at the end of the discussion, the Minister will have the bell rung and will get a majority registered against us, no matter what views have been put forward in favour of these amendments. That is the farcical procedure that we have been asked to subscribe to in this House over a long period and that is a very good reason why Deputy Norton has decided &mdash; and I agree with him in his view &mdash; that it is merely a farce to proceed with discussion of these amendments when those who can decide the merits of the amendments will not listen to the discussion.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister was as well pleased as any of his colleagues in regard to the unity movement which was brought about here 12 months ago.  I appeal to him that if be wants, as I believe he does, to maintain that spirit of unity in the country he should not proceed any further with this provocative measure.  Deputy Norton referred to the measure that is on the Order Paper since before the last general election.  Is it the Minister's personal wish that that measure should have remained on the Order Paper for so long or is it because there was some strong feeling put to him by some interested parties that they should not proceed any further with the remaining stages of that particular measure?  I do not know what is the reason but there is surely some reason why a measure which got a First Reading in this House three years ago is still lying on the Order Paper and has not gone one stage further.</P>

      <P>I join with the Labour Deputies in appealing to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to withdraw this Bill.  It is ill-chosen, ill-timed, ill-advised, and its immediate effect will be to destroy that spirit of co-operation outside this House which everybody within the House purports to be anxious to preserve.  I have no intention of traversing ground covered already by Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin.  My principal objection to the Bill is because of its Fascist implications. There were other Bills of a different nature from this but showing the same trend, which I opposed on the same grounds.  When some of these County Management Bills were before the House I pointed out then that I considered that this snatching away of authority here and there throughout the country could only have one ultimate effect, and that some day we would probably be discussing a Bill in this House which would be taking away the privileges and rights of Deputies.  I see in this Bill a very real danger that we are moving as rapidly as we can in that direction.  As I say, I think it is very ill-timed and ill-advised, and I would appeal to the Minister to respond to the appeals made, not only by the various Deputies in the House, but by very strong representations in the trade union movement outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to protest against the Money Resolution, perhaps on different grounds from Deputy <Col N="50" /> Davin.  I am not personally concerned whether the Fianna Fáil Benches are bereft of their occupants or packed to suffocation.  I am more concerned with the underlying principle of this Bill. It was introduced, Deputy Norton said, under false pretences.  I repeat that charge.  It was introduced on an allegation that there was certain looseness and lack of discipline showing itself in the trade union movement that called for attention.  As a result of that, certain discussions took place between representatives of the Government and representatives of the trade union movement, but at none of these discussions was the fell purpose of the Bill disclosed as it shows itself in Section 6, which indicates clearly what is at the back of the mind of the Minister and the Government, which is nothing short of trying to put the trade union movement out of commission in this country.  Nobody on these benches could possibly stand for the passing of money in this House to introduce legislation for so vile a purpose, which is so ill-advised and which is going to have such disastrous consequences, I believe, on the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement of this country has done nothing to deserve this treatment from the Fianna Fáil Government.  As I say, their whole case is given away when they put a premium upon non-unionism.  It is not necessary to be a trade unionist; you can have all the negotiation machinery you like and carry on with no fee.  The fee is only put on the person who has the temerity and courage to belong to a union.  That is really the kernel of this Bill.  The rest of it is padding-up stuff.  It is definitely aimed at bursting the trade union movement and, as I said on another stage, I wonder what the Minister proposes putting in its place.  When he has succeeded, if he does succeed, in passing this measure and upsetting the machinery that has taken a century and a half to build, I wonder what he contemplates putting in its place.  The company unions, the House unions and the scabs will be there to run the affairs of industry in this country.  I think it is an insult to ask anybody, not alone those on the <Col N="51" /> Labour Benches, but anybody who has the peace and harmony of this country at heart, to pass money in this House to enable the Minister to get away with this scheme of his, which is disruptive in its conception and which will be disastrous in its consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to repeat what I said when this Bill was being introduced. I then appealed to the Minister to withdraw the Bill.  I am now more convinced than ever of the need for withdrawing the Bill.  I was present at a meeting on Sunday in College Green.  I have my own conception of what mass meetings can be at times, and I understand the feeling that can be aroused at those mass meetings, but at the meeting on Sunday there were thousands and thousands of men, orderly, quiet and resolute.  There was not a, contentious word raised at that meeting.  The one desire was that this Bill should be withdrawn in the interests of peace first of all.  In the second place, as one who has some knowledge of the trade union movement and who has had some experience in dealing with employers over a number of years, I am opposed to giving any money to the Government to provide for this Trade Union Bill. The Minister ought to consult his executive officers in the Department and he will find that, as far as the South of Ireland is concerned, there was no need for any of his officials to go to Cork in the past three or four years to preside over a meeting between employers and trade unions. This is not a Trade Union Bill, but an anti-Trade Union Bill.  If there were any need to bring in a Trade Union Bill, surely there would be evidence of such a need in the South of Ireland. When you come down to complaints which were made here about friction between unions, I want to say to the Minister, very definitely, that he has refrained from dealing with the very things that are likely to cause, and are causing, friction between trade unions in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not honest to say that it is because there are too many unions there is all that friction.  I am quite satisfied that, if he consulted his executive <Col N="52" /> officers who have presided at conferences of employers and trade unions over a number of years, he would find that it is not altogether a question of inter-union strife.  We have in this country at the moment a certain amount of unity and solidarity among the people, and we have men from the different trade unions giving honest, voluntary service in the different services in the country.  I want to say to the Minister quite seriously that he would be doing a good day's work for this country if he withdrew this Bill until the country is in a better frame of mind to discuss it.  First of all, I do not think there is any need for this Bill.  The trade unions will rectify their own domestic troubles that the Minister complains about.  In addition to that Bill, we have other things being introduced at the moment which are not in the interests of the working-class people, and which are making things far more difficult for them. Reiterating what previous speakers have said, I say with a.  full sense of responsibility that the Taoiseach would be well advised to ask his Minister to withdraw this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to set aside money for the financing of this tribunal.  If there is any part of the Trade Union Bill which is more obnoxious than another, I think it is the part dealing with this tribunal.  The tribunal is to be composed of three individuals, one a practising barrister and two other people whose qualifications are unstated. They are to determine the position and the scope and the size of the future trade unions when this Bill is passed. Surely the Minister or the House cannot for a moment suggest that the operations of that tribunal are going to bring any peace or harmony to the trade union movement.  The purpose of it definitely is to regiment and arrange trade unions according to the views of the chairman of this tribunal and those of its two other members. The Minister and his Party boast very much of their democratic principles.  I suggest to the Minister and to the House that no Bill which has gone through this House, while I have been a member of it, at any rate, has caused <Col N="53" /> more dissatisfaction and more spontaneous agitation throughout the whole country than this Bill has caused.</P>
      <P>If there is any spark of democracy left in the Minister and his Party, then I would advise them to hearken to the voice of the people who are opposing this Bill.  If he thinks that he and his Party are now so secure and that their position in the country is so safe that they can, with impunity, flout the opinions of the workers of this country, then I think he will be very sadly mistaken. Deputy Hickey referred to the meeting in College Green.  I was not present at that meeting, but I am informed by impartial outsiders that it was the biggest meeting ever held in Dublin.  Surely the Minister is not still going to rely on the argument that he and the Minister tor Finance represent the workers of Dublin?  Surely that is the voice of Dublin speaking to him and asking him definitely to withdraw this Bill.  Similar meetings were held in other centres, and the opinion was unanimous that this Bill should not be proceeded with.  If that is not democracy trying to function, I do not know that is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving reasons why we are in opposition to this motion. One of the reasons is that we know the feelings of the people outside; we take cognisance of the feelings and opinions of the citizens of this country.  To my mind that is the function of democracy. If the Minister ignores them and flouts them, we do not.  This is tyrannical autocracy &mdash; by a machined majority in this House trying to shove across a Bill which the people of this <Col N="54" /> country do not want.  I have never seen such unity on any matter as there is on the desire tor the withdrawal of this Trade Union Bill, but the Minister is blind to it.  We are trying to wake him up to the fact that that feeling ia abroad &mdash; a feeling which may have more sciious reactions than the Minister thinks.  I am very sorry that the Taoiseach and other Ministers are not present, because the position is so serious and the determination of the Minister is so dangerous that it is no harm that the Government as a whole should be made aware of the position. I am definitely of the opinion that the Minister is trying to force this through from sheer downright pigheadedness &mdash; nothing else.  He has not advanced any argument as to why this Bill should go through.  He has not advanced any arguments as to why this money should be voted.  We have tried to advance arguments in a reasonable way as to why the money should not be voted.  We are pointing out the dangers of the Bill.  We are pointing out the serious position that may arise in this country as the result of the passing of this Bill.  We are pointing out that there is no necessity for the Bill.  We are pointing out that there are other Bills which have been on the Order Paper for over three years, and which we were told at the time of their Second Reading were most important Bills which should go through this House and should be in operation in the country.  Wiser counsels prevailed.  We are trying to impress on the Minister the necessity for withdrawing this Bill at this stage. I think there was never a time in the history of this country when unity was more essential, and the Minister is doing his best to wreck that unity.  I have heard expressions at trade union and labour meetings that will have very serious reactions if acted upon, as a result of this Bill.  We are trying to point those things out to the Minister. We had hoped that he would not proceed with the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House passes the Resolution, I do not see any use in going ahead with amendments.  The Bill is so bad in principle &mdash; it is so bad intrinsically <Col N="55" />&mdash; that amendments, no matter how favourably they may be received by the Minister and by the Government, will not help to improve it.  The genesis of the Bill is that the trade unions are to be machined and controlled and regimented as would he the principle under a dictatership.  Surely we have some vestige of democracy left in this country?  Surely we are not so bound up with Government regimentation in other ways that we expect to have this Bill operated by the trade unions calmly and quietly?  There again I want to point out to the Minister the very serious position which would arise. Does the Minister tell this House that, with the passage of this Money Resolution and with the passage of this Bill, according to the ideas he has in his mind, the regimentation of the trade union movement will take place? Is he aware that this trade union movement has been built up over a long period &mdash; about 150 years &mdash; through blood and tears and sacrifice?  Does he imagine that, at the behest of the Fianna Fáil Government, the trade union weapons will drop in the workers' hands and that they will remain quiet and humble while they are shepherded and regimented by this Bill?  Surely the Minister in his wildest dreams does not hope for that?</P>
    <P>We have tried to point out these things to the Minister, to show him the feeling in the country with regard to this Bill.  We have tried to enlighten him to the fact that this is looked upon as an anti-Trade Union Bill, not alone by trade unions but by people who have made a study of the trade union movement &mdash; people who are apart altogether from the membership of the trade unions.  It is looked upon as an anti-Trade Union Bill, one which will create discord, disunion and trouble in the country.  Surely these should be reasons enough for the Minister to withdraw it, and not proceed with the Money Resolution.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution there is very little in detail to be said, but one must get down to the principle which is at stake.  When he spoke on the Second Reading of the <Col N="56" /> Bill, the Minister tried to cloak the whole thing under the general slogan of &ldquo;peace in industry in our time.&rdquo; How is he proposing to get this peace in industry?  By pressing this measure in the face of the opposition to it that has been exposed already?  The measure is framed appropriately enough &mdash; although by accident &mdash; between the Finance Bill in its present state and the Emergency Powers Order No. 83 down for discussion to-day. Industry has to face immediately a period of crisis.  To certain people that crisis is complicated and to some it is made very much more exacerbating by the facts revealed by the Minister for Finance on the opening of the Finance Bill.  He told us that the Revenue Commissioners had discovered that profiteering on a large scale was taking place.  Following on the previous promises he had made to the country, at the time the Emergency Powers Bill was passed &mdash; that profiteering would not be allowed &mdash; the Minister came to us with that particular measure; but when demands were made that growing industry should be preserved and should not be put in the same role as the obvious and notorious profiteers, he then &mdash; despite his own statements that the Revenue Commissioners had discovered that these huge profits were being made &mdash; threw overboard, the clauses he had inserted in the measure.</P>

If that proposal is to <Col N="57" /> be discussed in the setting of a financial measure in which the Minister has revealed that he has discovered that profits are being made by people out of the war and that he does not propose now to take those profits, that is one setting.  A second setting is the Minister's Order No. 83. that is to be discussed here.  The Minister proposed, not merely to take action regarding excess profits &mdash; I would not mind if he had even used the phrase &ldquo;excess incomes&rdquo;&mdash; but he proposed under that older to prevent incomes rising to a point where they would agree with the increased costs.</P>

      <P>I am arguing on the Financial Resolution motion and hold that I am entitled to do so.  We were told that people would not be allowed to make excess profits, but now people are not being allowed to get any increase in their incomes.  The Minister proposes to introduce a measure which takes away the old guardianship and power from the smaller people, having revealed to us that other people do not need that support, because they already have it in the standstill measure.  It is iniquitous to proceed with this.  It has got no support from anybody connected with labour matters throughout the country and has been contested everywhere. It has met with popular indignation, greater than anything that met any measure the Minister has introduced for some years back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us it was based upon certain agreements &mdash; or implied agreements &mdash; amongst trade unions themselves, that some change was necessary in trade union regulations. In the last debate, the Minister proceeded to quote from documents and then ran away from the documents when he was told they would have to he exposed to us, so that those who would have to answer the arguments would be able to see them.  Notwithstanding that suppression of documents <Col N="58" /> in the background, two matters have been revealed &mdash; the definite attempt to depress still further people who are already particularly depressed at the moment, and to keep uplifted people whom the Minister decided to condemn because they were profiteering.  By taking his stand over that on the plea of &ldquo;peace in industry&rdquo;, the Minister will wreck any possible chance of progress.  I object to giving a single shilling in furtherance of that purpose.</P>

      <P>There was; and the Minister knows that that was the reason why the Local Government Bill was postponed 12 months ago, and also why the St. Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill is still on the Order Paper, and why the Valuation Bill was postponed.  Now, in the midst of the emergency, when the country is united, having created an atmosphere of united spirit &mdash; which they were appealing to other Parties in this House to respond to &mdash; the Minister brings in legislation which is going to tear the country from one end to the other &mdash; and rightly so.  The Minister takes objection to the speeches that are made from this side of the House in connection with this measure, and says that we have no right to make statements of this kind on the Financial Resolution, that all this was said on the Second Reading of the Bill.  When introducing this financial motion to-day, the Minister said very little &mdash; merely that he was moving that the motion be passed.  He is asking that taxes be taken now from the people of this country to put into operation a measure which the people do not want. He will be collecting taxes from people against whom he has made an order which will prevent them getting any increase in wages to meet these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, the Minister and his Government <Col N="59" /> made no effort to protect the poor of this country from the profiteers as soon as the war began.  Now he is taking a step, through the medium of this Bill, to prevent the poor from getting the necessary money to enable them to pay the very high prices for commodities, which the Government has failed to control.  The unfortunate people who will be asked to pay the taxes to put this controversial measure into operation are the people who are being mulcted to the extent of 4d. an ounce on tobacco and high taxes on various necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister when he had a revolutionary mind.  I remember the Minister when he would stand up to any Government which would attempt to put through a measure not half as severe as this.  I want to tell the Minister that the revolutionary spirit is not yet finished in this country, and that I, for one &mdash; and I say this in all seriousness and with all the responsibility I have &mdash; will advocate that the law will not be observed when this Bill is passed, and I will take the consequences. From what I know of the country, the country is ripe for taking such advice.  The workers of the country will not stand idly by while a Government put into office by the workers of the country tramples upon them.</P>
    <P>We have in this House representatives of the City of Dublin who were sent here by the workers of Dublin, and I defy them to get up in this House and say that the workers of Dublin are in favour of this Bill.  We did not hear their voices on the Second Stage of the Bill; we have not heard them yet on this resolution, and we await what they have to say.  The Minister and his Government, have become so cock-sure of themselves during the period of the emergency, because of the co-operation which they have had from the different Parties in the House, that they think it is only necessary for them to crack their whip through the medium of the majority that they have in the House and the people will accept anything.  The people of Ireland are patient people; but no emergency powers, no decrees from the Government, <Col N="60" /> will make the workers of the country accept this measure of slavery. The trade union movement had to be fought for in this country; blood and tears were shed in order to establish that movement, and the workers of the country will not accept it from the Minister, who sits in his bench with smug complacency while he takes away from them the rights they have won over a period of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join the other members of the Labour Party in registering my protest against this Bill, and I am prepared to issue a challenge to the Government.  There is a vacancy for a representative in County Wicklow, and if the Minister is so cocksure that the people of the country are prepared to support him, why not have a by-election in that county?  We are prepared to abide by the result of that election on the Government's mismanagement of the past two years.</P>
      <P>The workers of the country responded to the appeal made them in the cause of unity, believing it was sincere.  I am one of the few who could not agree that the Government were sincere in looking for unity, and, therefore, I have never appealed to the workers in any constituency to accept the Government's plea that they wanted the workers to unite.  Notwithstanding the Emergency Powers Order, they have granted concessions to men with £1,500 a year; they have granted increases to engineers on public boards while, at the same time, refusing to grant an increase of 2/6 per week to workers.  These are the kind of actions we have had from the Government who are supposed to be representative of the plain people.  If they are satisfied that they represent the people, why not take steps to ascertain the feelings of the people at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister has been misled by some people who are alleged to be representative of the trade union movement, and the proof of that is the wholesale opposition of the organised workers of Ireland, represented by the meeting last Sunday in Dublin.  The Minister would show himself to be a bigger man by recognising that fact rather than by using his machine <Col N="61" /> majority to achieve his ends.  If the Minister wants to have unity, which I do not believe will continue much longer, why is he not prepared to meet the real representatives of the trade union movement in order to preserve peace in industry, if he is genuine in his desire to have peace in industry? His excuse for bringing forward this Bill is that there were disputes occurring in industries which the real organised workers were not aware of. If they were, I am sure he would receive the co-operation of all sides, not alone in this House but outside the House, to prevent any unnecessary strikes or friction.  If he has been misled or deceived by interviews with certain parties, let him now realise the seriousness of the position, postpone the Bill, meet the representatives of the Trade Union Congress and discuss the matter with them and see if, with the support of the trade union movement, he cannot improve the Bill in such a way as to carry out the wishes of the Government and of everybody concerned to secure peace in industry. I submit that the Minister would show himself to be a bigger man by admitting that this Bill will not achieve what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>To-day we see the Government allowing young men to be exported across to England for work there which is denied to them at home.  Over 100 young men from my own town went to England to-day and had passports granted to them within 24 hours, which could not be got by other people inside a month.  Then we are toid that they do not want to work in Ireland.  That is going on wholesale all over the country. The on way in which the Minister and his Department can try to solve the unemployment problem is to export the youth of the country and the tradesmen of the country to whom work is denied here.  Yet, in a serious situation like that, we have our time wasted here considering this Bill and other Bills brought in in order to make the people believe that, the Dáil is a very important Assembly.  But the people are not fools.  If there is one Party more than another whirh is bringing this Dáil into contempt and trying to bring it back to what the <Col N="62" /> Government said it was in 1923 &mdash; not representative of the people &mdash; it is the Government Party.  In every action of theirs, day after day, they have treated the elected representatives of the people with contempt, so that we had the Executive governing the people and not those elected by the people.</P>

He may have the Army and his henchmen to do certain work, but he will be unable to defeat the united will of the trade union movement.  The Labour Party in opposing this Bill will not alone have the support of the real trade unionists but everybody who has a grievance against the Government will join in supporting the Labour Party and the Trade Union Congress in any action they may take to prevent the Minister's scheme being put into operation.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with my colleagues in protesting against this measure.  Personally I am not at all surprised at what the Government are prepared to do in return for the support they have received from the workers of the country.  I never bad any misunderstanding in that respect. My friend, Deputy Everett, has issued a challenge.  In my constituency we are in the same position and I would like to issue another challenge.  I will invite, the Minister and his Government to have a by-election in my constituency to fill the seat rendered vacant by the death of Deputy Gorey.  I understand that there is also a vacancy in Deputy Hurley's constituency and he tells me that he is very anxious that the Government should have a by-election there.  If you want to test public feeling on an important measure of this kind, that is the proper and the democratic way to do it, or, if you want to do it in the 100 per cent. fashion, you should have a general election.  The Government, in a fit of temper on one occasion, decided on a general election and, unfortunately for the workers, <Col N="63" /> they succeeded in getting back into office, but they did so under false pretences.</P>
      <P>The Chair has given me a little latitude, for which I am grateful.  On the Resolution, I want to protest, as vehemently as I can, against this wastage of public money.  Ministers have been telling us that we must make sacrifices and we must economise in this period of great national emergency and then they proceed to bring in a Bill of this type.  The Minister is afraid to tell the House to-day what amount of money is required to put this legislation into operation &mdash; that is, if it ever becomes operative.  I protest against this measure on behalf of my constituents, the vast majority of whom are in a deplorable state, because they live in a county which has been almost scourged to death by the terrible plague that has affected our cattle.  The farmers, and the workers employed by them, have gone through a trying period and no amount of compensation that they may receive from the State would be adequate to enable them to look to the future with any sense of contentment. I desire to join with my colleagues and others on this side of the House in protesting against the unwarranted action of the Government in trying, with their steam-rolling majority, to push through this unwanted legislation.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a very important measure, a measure the Minister called important, a measure that we all realise is important. The Minister introduced this matter very unhappily.  Apart from the Bill itself, that was the impression one had from the general tone of his speech.  He introduced the Bill very unhappily and he followed it up much more unhappily and, if the approach of the Minister to this important matter is going to be continued in the same spirit &mdash; and that seems to be the tendency from the unhappy manner in which he approaches it now &mdash; then I do not know what the Minister thinks he is, or what he thinks we are in this Assembly.</P>
      <P>In the interest of peace in industry, and all the other things the Minister claims to be concerned about, I appeal to him to give us and the working-class people of the country a definite answer to a simple question.

      <P>There are 11 members of the Government Party behind the Minister.  We are in Committee on <Col N="65" /> Finance and we are dealing with a very important matter.  We are asked to vote State moneys for the purposes of this Bill.  The Bill, to my mind, seems to provide that the trade unions will pay all the expenses that the administration of this legislation will create. Surely we are entitled, as members of Parliament dealing vith the finances of the country, to know why this money, coining from the taxpayers, is being asked for.  I appeal to members of the Fianna Fáil Party to consider this very carefully.  Are they going to force a discussion of this important matter in an atmosphere in which an Irish Parliament cannot get an answer to a simple question put seriously in relation to a very important aspect?</P>

So far as one can understand from the Bill, any money that may be necessary to work it is going to be taken from the trade unions.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section says that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act and the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, may be cited together as the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1941.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think this Bill is worthy to be classed with what have been called the Trade Union Acts of the past which have been steps of progress for labour, for working organisations, and for peace, harmony and progress in industrial life.  We asked, originally, that the consideration of this Bill should be postponed until we had the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation, and of the evidence given before that commission.  On the Second Reading of the Bill we indicated why the members of the Oireachtas and the ordinary people of this country should have expected that nothing in the nature of this Bill would be brought forward until the report of that commission was before them, and more particularly in view of the fact, as has been pointed out, that since the beginning of the emergency nothing has occurred to upset ordinary conditions or the social life of the country in the way of strikes.  Quotations, are frequently given from the Encyclical letters of our Holy Father the Pope with regard to labour conditions and labour organisations, and the outlook in regard to them.  In the Encyclical, <i>Rerum Novarum</i>, we find this in paragraph 42 under the head of Trade Unions:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The most important of all are workingmen's unions; for these virtually include all the rest.  History attests what excellent results were brought about by the artificers' guilds of olden times.  They were the means of affording not only many advantages to the workmen, but in no small degree of promoting the advancement of art, as numerous monuments remain to bear witness. <Col N="70" /> Such unions should be suited to the requirements of tills our age &mdash; an age of wider education, of different habits, and of far more numerous requirements in daily life.  It is gratifying to know that there are actually in existence not a few associations of this nature, consisting either of workmen alone, or of workmen and employers together; but it were greatly to be desired that they should become more numerous and more efficient.  We have spoken of them more than once; yet it will bewell to explain here how notably they are needed, to show that they exist of their own right, and what should be their organisation and their mode of action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is one of the distinguishing features of trade unions, as pointed out there, that they have in no small degree promoted the advancement of art, and on another side have become more numerous as well as more efficient.  I say that this Bill is not worthy to be classed with the other Trade Union Acts, because Section 6 of it completely wipes out any of the smaller unions that would naturally be so close knit with regard to the organisation of their personnel that they would give a, contribution to art: that they would be craft unions in the sense that we spoke of craft unions.  In paragraph 34 of the same Encyclical we find that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When work people have recourse to a strike it is frequently because the hours of labour are too long or the work too hard, or because they consider their wages insufficient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Because a union is a craft union is no reason why it should be prevented from dealing with some of the things that are most important to it.</P>

      <P>Yes, as to whether the Deputy's speech is in order. The principles of the Bill may not be re-discussed on this or any other section. A dissertation on Papal Encyclicals <Col N="71" /> and their relationship to this or any other Bill, is not relevant on this section; neither is it relevant to quote a subsequent section, Section 6, as a reason why Section 1 should not pass. It is against all practice to discusss Section 6 before Section 1 has, gone through.</P>

      <P>As I say, I find myself rather in a difficulty owing to the fact that some amendments were put down in the names of members of the Labour Party that might have been put down by members of our Party if these amendments were not already in. Now these amendments are not being moved.  I take it that the circumstances in which these amendments are not being moved will accentuate the position brought about by the unfortunate way in which the Bill has been conceived and the manner in which it has been presented to the House by the Minister.  If the Bill were a serious Bill which was going to be implemented, and which could be expected to do anything Jor workers, or as between workers and employers, I should like to see an amendment in here governing the regulations, so that regulations dealing with important matters would not simply be passed by the Minister and then be left in a position in which they were unchallenged or unchallengeable by the House.  It just indicates, however, the spirit in which the Minister prepares his Bill, that, when he takes power to make regulations dealing with the tribunal and the fees to be paid by trade unions for this, that and the other thing, he so drafts his Bill as to exclude both Houses of the Oireachtas from any say by challenge of any kind, in the regulations he proposes to make.  It is characteristic of the whole spirit in which the Bill is prepared.</P>

      <P>May I express the very mild protest, that no matter how this conspiracy of silence may have begun, whether out of pique or anything else, in the interests of Government, of Parliament, of the country and of Irish trade unionism, it should not continue?

I do not care &mdash; I have no knowledge of &mdash; what the reactions of this Bill may be, but surely it is unfair to expect Parliament to be regarded as a serious and responsible body if it is to pass a Bill that may have very serious reactions, without getting an explanation from the author of the Bill as to the meaning of the different sections which he is moving.  It is quite another matter whether amendments are moved or not, but the Dáil and the country are entitled to get a clear, brief statement from the Minister as to the meaning of each section.  We have now passed three sections of this Bill, just like three votes of condolence, passed in silence.  We are now up against the fourth section, the one that naturally hangs out of the three votes of condolence &mdash; the burial expenses of Irish trade unionism.  We are asked in this section to vote the money out of public funds for the expenses of working this Bill.  Does anybody know, if the Bill is to go through in the present atmosphere of bad feeling, what the expenses may be?  Even though we may lightly talk of the burial expenses of Irish trade unionism, it may very well include the burial expenses of Irish trade unionists.</P>
      <P>Now, this is a Bill that was introduced originally as a Bill to bring about peace in Irish industry.  Let us make all allowances for the Minister and say that he believed that statement when he made it.  Let us say that he was misinformed by alleged representatives or spokesmen of the trade union movement.  Speaking from an entirely detached position, I have seen, and can see, every trade unionist, and every man associated with trade unionism without being one himself, violently, bitterly and angrily opposed to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not, outside of that bench opposite, heard any voice raised in favq|ir of the Bill.  Now, I do not expect the Minister to do a somersault at this stage, but as one Deputy, with a certain sense of responsibility and a certain respect for this House, and hoping that people outside of it will develop equal respect, I think that this silence on the part of the Minister should, and must, cease, and that some brief explanation must be ghen of sections requiring explanation.  On the Money Resolution &mdash; there was a certain amount of heat in connection with it &mdash; the Minister was pressed to give a brief outline of the possible, probable, or likely expenses.  We are now asked lo adopt the machinery, in <Col N="79" /> this section, for issuing those expenses, and I think that some explanation should be given to the House on a section of this kind.</P>

      <P>I have been asked to explain Section 4 of this Bill.  I have too much respect for this House and too much respect for the intelligence of the members of the House to think that there is any one of them who requires an explanation of Section 4, the meaning of which must be plain to any person who can read.  The section states that &ldquo;the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That is just the usual section which one finds in a Bill of this sort.</P>

I do not think I have impeded legitimate discussion in any way, and I do not think there is any necessity for the House to adjourn for an hour in order that other sections of the House may approach the Bill in a better frame of mind.  After all, I am not responsible for the fact that members of the House have seen fit to divide on the question a&amp; to whether this Act may be cited as the Trade Union Act, 1941, nor am I responsible for the fact that, with all the problems with which the country has to contend, members have seen fit to challenge a division on the issue that the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Those are the matters upon which the House has been divided, but the House has not been divided by the Government.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section the expression &ldquo;excepted body&rdquo; means any of the following bodies, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a body which consists of persons all of whom are employed by the same employer (not being a local authority) and which carries on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment with that employer only.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), lines 21 to 24, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute in lieu thereof the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a body which consists of persons who are constantly employed in a particular form of work and are constantly or continuously employed by the same employer (not being a local, authority) and which carries on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment with that employer only and which has been registered on application previously made to the Minister, by the Minister in a Register of excepted bodies.</P>
      <P>I have several amendments to this section&mdash;amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 8. They are all different approaches to the same thing, in regard to the section. As I understand the section, any group of workmen who may never have met together under the same employer before may come together for the purpose of, say, a particular building scheme.  Having been farm labourers before, they may come under the sway of some contractor and they, apparently, may become an excepted body right there and then.  I want to put some limitation on them &mdash; the phrase I have used may not be appropriate&mdash; and the first limitation I seek is that. they shall only be an &ldquo;excepted body&rdquo; if they are in the habit, so to speak, of working for the same employer, and if he is in the habit of employing them; in other words, if they are workmen known to a particular employer and he is known to them.</P>
      <P>The same idea is embodied in my second amendment, that is, more or less habitual work with the same employer, with the addition of a Parliamentary approach so that the Minister can agree that certain people will be excepted bodies.  Under amendment No. 5, a group shall only be an excepted body if, having complied with certain conditions, they are registered as such.  For that purpose, the Minister would have to set up a register of excepted bodies and he would have to take control and responsibility for accepting certain bodies as excepted bodies.  I grant that, once that happens, the thing is brought inside the scope of the Dáil and comment can be made on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other amendment I have, and I am indifferent as to which of these will be taken as long as there is some restriction put on this rather wide section, is amendment No. 8.  What I want to achieve there is that no body shall be regarded as an excepted body except it deals with unorganized workers; that if there is an organised trade union catering either for the <Col N="87" /> people in that locality or for workers of that type in the country generally, then it shall not be possible to have an excepted body of such workmen.  The clear purpose of that is that you can only have excepted bodies where there is no real trade union organisation. As I say, I am indifferent as to which of these amendments is put in, but I should like to have some restriction put on that very easy way of being excepted entirely from the provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been considering the points raised by these amendments and I am prepared to accept amendment No. 6 in principle.  I think that the idea of having a register of these excepted bodies is a very good one and should be a useful safeguard As to the phraseology of amendment No. 5, I have some difficulty in accepting the words &ldquo;constantly employed&rdquo; or &ldquo;continuously employed&rdquo;, but Deputy McGilligan has suggested a word which I think would meet the case.  We can use the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; for both of these conditions. There might also be a question of having some registration fee, but that is a matter that could be dealt with on the Report Stage.  I do not know whether it would be safe to delete the word &ldquo;constantly&rdquo; in the amendment as it stands and the words &ldquo;constantly or continuously&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise on this section a rather fundamental matter which I think properly arises on sub-section (1) of this section, that is to say, the bearing of Article 40 of the Constitution on this section and consequently on the Bill as a whole.  Article 40, sub-section (6) of the Constitution provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of those rights in sub-paragraph (3) is the right of the citizens to form associations and unions.  I should like to know if the Minister and his legal advisers have considered the bearing of these particular provisions of the Constitution on the drastic proposals contained in this Bill and the implications of those proposals.  In Section 6 (1) there is a definite prohibition against a body of persons, not being an excepted body, carrying on negotiations for the fixing of wages or conditions of employment unless such body is the holder of a negotiation licence.  In other words, there is a very definite statutory prohibition against rhe formation of an association for purposes which have up to this been more or less the prerogative of trade unions. At all events, there is a definite prohibition <Col N="90" /> against a body of citizens forming an association.  I should like to hear from the Minister how he proposes to reconcile the provisions of Section 6 (1) with the definite guarantee-of what is called, in Article 40 of the Constitution, the fundamental rights of the citizens.  One of the fundamental rights of citizens is to form associations subject to public order and morality.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, this Bill is not brought in or justified by reasons referable to public order and morality. Therefore, this section, which requires certain very drastic requirements to be complied with before an association of the kind can be lawful, appears on its face to be in the teeth of the so-called guarantee in Article 40 of the Constitution. I emphasise in this connection the words &ldquo;so-called guarantee&rdquo;, because it appears to me that this is only another instance of the cumulative effects of the policy of the proposals for legislation that have been introduced and are being introduced by the Government undermining every single fundamental right that was supposed to be guaranteed in this Constitution to the citizens of the State.  The right of <i>habeas corpus</i> is practically gone.  I say quite deliberately, and I will continue to hold the view until the Minister convinces me to the contrary, that the proposals in this Bill are in the teeth of the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution.  I suggest that the Minister or his legal advisers should have recognised that if they had adverted to the provisions of Article 40.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there has been no advertence to the provisions of Article 40 in reference to this Bill.  If any such advertence had been made, there would have been some reference in the draft to the provisions of the Article.  That attitude is again the attitude of the Government towards the provisions of the Constitution, eating into fundamental rights by ordinary legislation.  I take it that an effort will be made, if this matter is considered by the Minister or his legal advisers, to justify this Bill as being a law enacted under Article 40 for the regulation or control in the public interest of the exercise of the right of the citizen to form an association or <Col N="91" /> union.  The only possible justification for this Bill must be found in this line &mdash;a law for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the constitutional right of citizens to form an association or union.  This is not a law for the exercise of a constitutional right at all and, if this matter had been carefully considered, and an endeavour was being made to justify this Bill as a law under Article 40 regulating or controlling in the public interest the exercise of the foregoing right, some reference would surely have been made to that Article of the Constitution.  No such reference has been made.</P>
    <P>So far from this Bill and this particular sub-section being a law for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the constitutional right of citizens to form an association, this particular provision is taking away the rights of citizens.  Our citizens are supposed to have rights to form associations.  This is a Bill preventing them from having such rights unless two very stringent requirements are complied with.  There must be a large number of people in the associations, and the associations must be sufficiently wealthy to be in a position to give the deposits mentioned in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>You cannot have your fundamental right as a citizen &mdash; the right the Constitution so grandiloquently stated on paper &mdash; unless you are sufficiently wealthy to be able to exercise it.  That is what the Bill says in so far as it can be justified at all as a law regulating or controlling in the public interest the exercise of a constitutional right.</P>
    <P>What about the rights of the small craft unions which have been in existence for very many years, and which have been exercising a right which would appear to have been reinforced by the provisions of the Constitution? That is being taken away; it is not being regulated or controlled by this Bill.  The right of such an association of craft workers, a small number of people engaged in a particular skilled employment, to look after their own interests, is not being regulated or controlled; it is being taken away.  A <Col N="92" /> vested right which has been in existence for many years in the case of unions dealing with skilled craftsmen is being taken away.  They are being deprived of the vested right they had when the Constitution came into operation, a vested right which would appear, from the grandiloquent language of the Constitution, to have been further assured to these unions.  It is now being taken away under the guise of ordinary legislation.</P>
    <P>I think a strong case will have to be made here, and probably elsewhere, for this Bill.  This particular point has not been adverted to in the discussions that have taken place, on this Bill.  I am convinced there has been no advertence to Article 40 in connection with this Bill and, if any advertence is made now, it will be made on the spur of the moment by the Minister and probably by, reference to the three-line clause in Article 40.  When proper consideration is given to it, the present attitude will be found to be entirely unjustified, and it will be seen that the provisions of Section 6 (1), taken in conjunction with the provisions of Section 7, are entirely unconstitutional and do not give a fair or ordinary meaning to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If we are to take the constitutional meaning at its face value, this Bill should never have been introduced; but we have long since learned the Government attitude towards constitutional problems and other matters when they are raised.  The Constitution is then nothing but a series of coruscating words, a series of words put forward to dazzle the public at elections; but when the Government are asked to give effect to the so-called fundamental rights which are supposed to be guaranteed to the citizens, matters stop short there.  <i>Habeas corpus</i> stops short of practical extinction; the position of the judiciary has been altered to a mere recollection of the past, and now the right of forming associations and unions is taken away to such a point that it will crumble and fall at the first shock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister stated that a section was so crystal-clear it was unnecessary <Col N="93" /> to explain it to the House.  The Minister cannot make that statement about Section 6.  That section seems to me to be the strangest section which I ever read in any statute.  It appears to me, under the guise of a Trade Union Bill, to slip in a provision which makes any federation of employers entirely illegal.  I will read Section 6:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any body of persons, not being an excepted body, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment unless such body is the holder of a negotiation licence&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and a negotiation licence can only be given to a trade union under Section 7. Now, to have a negotiation for wages, or any other purpose, you must nave two parties to the negotiation; you must have an employer and workmen.  Trade unions may negotiate but a federation of employers cannot negotiate.  In other words, a formation of employers, in a Bill calling itself a Trade Union Bill, is entirely illegal.</P>
      <P>But it goes very much further than that.  Suppose there is a limited liability company with a board of directors.  They are a body of persons and they cannot carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment unless they have a negotiation licence.  A board of directors of a limited liability company cannot, as I read this section, carry on negotiations with their own workmen, fixing the rate of wages or the conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have some explanation or I may be very dull.  There may be something standing out somewhere but, as I read the Bill, it seems to me to be hardly the product of a sane mind.  I go that far.  A board of directors of a limited liability company are employers of labour, but a board of directors of a railway company cannot carry on negotiations with their servants about the fixing of fair wages or hours of employment.  Surely a Bill that contains a provision of that nature is hardly the product of a sane mind.  Although the Minister may have some explanation, there is nothing that I can find in the Bill which takes away from the plain effect of the section, that no body can negotiate except <Col N="94" /> with a negotiation licence.  A negotiation licence cannot be given to a board of directors of a company or to a federation of employers except in the case of a single employer who could not be called a &ldquo;body of persons&rdquo;.  A single employer can negotiate with his workmen but a board of directors or a federation of employers cannot.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading I drew the Minister's attention to the position of organisations like the Federation of Irish Farmers, which is registered under the Trade Union Acts. I asked if that organisation would be affected by the Bill and the Minister stated definitely that it would not.  It seems to me that that promise is not borne out by the wording of the section, Wad I would need some greater assurance than the Minister's promise that the section will not affect farmers' organisations.  Any body of persons cannot carry on negotiations with regard to wages and conditions of employment.  It might be necessary for organisations of farmers to discuss with labour organisations or with representatives of agricultural workers the question of wages and conditions of employment and to negotiate settlements. If this section is passed in its present form farmers' organisations would be debarred from doing so and <Col N="95" /> would be heavily penalised.  Conditions of employment is a wide term.  Conditions of employment might mean conditions under which farmers or their dependants are employed and might cover the prices of farm produce For example, the beet growers had frequent negotiations with the Irish Sugar Company concerning the pi ice of beet. If the price were adequate that would affect the conditions of employment of persons engaged in the industry.  In addition, there was in the beet industry a general strike against growing beet at an uneconomic price.  Under this section the Beet Growers' Association or similar organisations would be penalised.  The statement made by the Minister on the Second Reading does not safeguard farmers' organisations.</P>

That is the general intention.</P>

      <P>I will look into that matter.  I am advised where a company is the employer that in that case a single person who is a direct agent acting on behalf of the company would be competent to enter into negotiation. The Deputy has raised a point, however, which I will investigate.  There was no substance in the point the Deputy made in relation to railway companies. They conduct their negotiations through conciliation boards, and one of the purposes of the House in accepting amendment No. 10 was to allow me to make joint industrial councils and conciliation boards excepted bodies for the purposes of the Act.  I cannot understand the point made by Deputy Cogan.  As a rule agricultural wages are settled between representatives of groups of persons and are fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The Agricultural Wages Board is definitely excepted from the provisions of Section 6 (1).  I cannot understand the laborious process by which the Deputy tried to drag farmers' organisations, whose main purpose is the fixing of prices, inside the scope of this Bill.  If the beet growers meet to fix prices of beet with the Sugar Company they are not going to settle the wages of workmen. Undoubtedly the price at which they sell their beet will have reactions on the wages of the workmen, and I am sure that will be taken into consideration by the Agricultural Wages Board when making its determination.  I cannot see how the farmers' organisations, of which the Deputy spoke, come inside this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was an assurance which I gave him on the Second Stage, and which still holds good.  If, on the other hand, they want to constitute themselves as an employers' organisation for the purpose of negotiating wages and conditions of employment, then they will be in exactly the same position as every other association or federation of employers under this measure.  They will have to register as a trade union. Some of those farmers have, in fact, registered as a trade union.  Not only will they have to register as a trade union, but they will have to take the further step of making a deposit and <Col N="97" /> of complying with the general provisions of the Bill in regard to the lodgment of rules, the furnishing of the names and addresses of the committee of management, etc.</P>

If a board of directors agree to negotiate with employees and appoint, as he says, one man to do it, then according to sub-section (2), &ldquo;such of the officers of such body as consent to or facilitate such act shall each be guilty of an offence under this section&rdquo; and shall be liable to a fine of £10.  My reading of that is, that the body, even though they act only through one particular director, is still a body acting and, consequently, the members of the board of directors would each be liable to a fine of £l0 for daring to negotiate with their own workmen as to wages and conditions of employment.</P>

      <P>On the constitutional point that has been raised it is, I think, common case here, to quote the words of the Constitution, that the right of association is one that is guaranteed under the Constitution.  It is also common case that that right is subject to the impact of the type of law that is passed here.  As stated in the Constitution, the laws that may be passed are, more or less, for the common good as well as to regulate and control the right of association. Does not the Minister know that there is a definite exception to only one of the fundamental rights that is guarded by association, the exception being that the law to regulate and control the exercise of this right shall not be subject to any religious, political or class discrimination?  We have here a measure that is definitely going to discriminate on this basis: can you put up £2,000 or not?  Is that in accordance with the Constitution?</P>

      <P>An argument has been advanced from these benches by Deputy Costello and repeated, to some extent, by Deputy McGilligan, and the only answer the Minister gives is that he consulted somebody or other. He did not attempt to deal with the argument.  I confess that, in many respects, my sympathies are with the Minister.  In his words, at all events, Deputy Costello showed some respect for the Constitution.  The Minister, by his words, in replying to Deputy McGilligan, did not, and I think the Minister is right, because practically all the fundamental rights which we were told by the statesman who introduced the Constitution were to be interpreted by the ordinary man in the ordinary way, and not by pettifogging lawyers, have gone.  This right of combination that was guaranteed by the Constitution now goes.  Our experience is that practically every other fundamental right in that Constitution has now gone.  There is some slight guarantee, I think, with regard to religion, but it is very slight, and is not by any means as broad as some people think.  The right with regard to class distinctions is now wiped away.  The only thing guaranteed by <Col N="100" /> the Constitution that is left at the present moment is the number of members that there shall be in the Seanad.  One after another all the fundamental principles have been wiped away.  In fact, to incorporate rights in the Constitution has become as dangerous to these rights as, say, the forming of a treaty of friendship is in international politics.  The Minister has clearly expressed by his words, by his actions and by his smile his supreme contempt for that instrument. Really I have a certain amount of sympathy with the line he has taken up in this particular matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said, in reply to a suggestion I made, that when this Bill was being drafted there was no real advertence to the provisions of the Constitution.  He said that the points I made were adverted to, and left the matter at that.  It would appear to me to be quite obvious that, although he was suggesting to the House that there was advertence by somebody to Article 40 of the Constitution, that he himself never adverted to it.  If I am to judge by the manner in which the Minister treated the point which I put up to him &mdash; I did so in all seriousness &mdash; he has not the remotest idea about the serious position that is going to be created by the provisions of this Bill in its impact on the Constitution.  I think I stated that the whole tendency of legislation here since the Constitution came into force was towards the undermining of these so-called fundamental rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may almost say that the rags and tatters of these rights are scarcely left. I do say that the point I put up was, at least, deserving of being treated with some degree of seriousness, because it is one which is going to affect, very seriously, the type of legislation that may follow in reference to this particular right.  It was argued by counsel appearing for the present Government in certain constitutional matters that the courts had to take cognisance of the fact, when the Legislature passed a particular law, that it considered whether or not it was contrary to the Constitution &mdash; that the mere fact that the Legislature had passed that law <Col N="101" /> was something of which the courts ought to take cognisance.  If we pass this law without adverting to the Constitution, that principle may, possibly, be extended.  There is no reason why, if this is not contrary to Article 40 of the Constitution, the right to strike might not also he taken away under the Constitution.  If this section, regulating the method by which associations may be formed, is constitutional, then a law dealing with the right to strike or to picket, or any other right in connection with matters that fall within the scope of trade unions in their efforts for the betterment of wages and conditions, may also be constitutional. If this Bill is constitutional, a Bill to take away the right to picket or to strike would be equally constitutional. That is a matter of very considerable importance, and it should not be thrust lightly aside by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The single net point which Deputy Costello made several times in connection with this section was that Section 6 of Article 40 of the Constitution had not been adverted to. I am now looking at a document &mdash; I hope he will take my word for it&mdash; dated 19th November, 1940, in which that matter was specifically referred for legal opinion and advice.</P>

      <P>I did not say that the Minister had made the suggestion in words but he has done so by his conduct.  Deputy Costello quoted the relevant Articles of the Constitution, and put forward reasons to show why this section was opposed to the Constitution.  The Minister has not met a single argument put forward by Deputy Costello.  He has simply stated that he has the opinion of somebody on the subject.  It is not those people who are passing the law; it is the House <Col N="102" /> which is supposed to be debating this Bill.  We have already had a number of examples of how the House is being helped to debate the Bill, which involves many fundamental issues.  I admit that the Minister is consistent in refusing to touch on the arguments raised.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that advertence was had to this point, but I want to know whether it was properly and adequately adverted to.  I have said before here that there is no use in flinging the magic phrase &ldquo;legal opinion&rdquo; at Deputies.  A legal opinion is worth only the grounds or reasons given for it.  If these are not proper grounds, then the opinion is of no use.  There is no substance in the phrase &ldquo;legal opinion&rdquo;.  I do not know whose opinion was obtained and I am not particularly interested to know that.  I assume that the opinion was that there was nothing unconstitutional in this Bill.  Assuming that that was so, I want to have the grounds for that opinion.  I am not in the least interested in the statement that an opinion was given.  I want to test that opinion, now that we have a chance of testing it.  An opinion is not worth the paper it is written on unless the grounds on which it is given are good grounds.  The House is entitled to knew these grounds.</P>

      <P>What is the cause of the Minister's shyness?  If he has an opinion and reasons are put forward for that opinion, the Minister is capable of mastering those reasons and reproducing them in the House, either in his own words or in the words of the opinion which has been given to him.  Why his shyness?  The Minister is not, normally, a remarkably shy man.  One would have thought that the Minister was not altogether wanting in self-confidence.  Why is the Minister overwhelmed with a fit of shyness on this occasion?  Why will he not give to the House the arguments advanced, if arguments were advanced and if it were not a mere negative opinion larking argumentative form?</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>(1)  No body of persons shall be granted or hold a negotiation licence unless it is a body (in this Act referred to as an authorised trade union) which fulfils the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that either it is registered under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, or, if not so registered, it is a trade union under the law of another country and its headquarters control is situated in that country, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that it has deposited and, subject to the provisions of this Act, keeps deposited with the accountant of the courts of justice the appropriate sum.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section the expression &ldquo;the appropriate sum&rdquo; means the sum appropriate to the number of members of the relevant body in accordance with the Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete paragraph (b), lines 42 to 44.</P>
      <P>The clause which the amendment aims at deleting deals with one of the conditions that must obtain before a body of persons shall be granted a negotiation licence, namely that it has deposited and, subject to the provisions of this Bill, keeps deposited, with the accountant of the courts of justice the appropriate sum, the appropriate sum being not less than £2,000.  We have not been able up to the present to get any clear idea of what is intended by this Bill.  We have got no idea as to how small craft unions are going to stand: we have got no idea as to the particular classes that will be regarded as separate classes for the purpose of a trade union and, generally, we have got no idea of the principles that are working in the Minister's mind.  Even if this Bill were a serious Bill, intended to achieve serious piece of organisation, it does not seem at the present time, and until the preliminary movements in that organisation had taken place, that it is desirable to impose any property qualifications on any trade union.</P>
      <P>The one point I wish to make is that it is an extraordinarily inappropriate time that the Minister selects to require a property qualification for a group of workers who want to act as a negotiating body for themselves and for their class.  I think the last figures that have been published for registered unemployment in the country show that the number of persons unemployed at present is within 3,000 of the total number of persons unemployed a year ago.  My recollection is that the relative figures are 60,000 and 63,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the thousands of men who have gone into the Army and who have gone out of the country, the unemployment position here at present is such that the number of registered unemployed is within 3,000 of what it was 12 months ago, before the big Army recruiting drive started and before the large body of men who left the country within the past 12 months had gone away.  It is that very inappropriate time that the Minister selects to say that organised workers shall be required to have a property qualification, to have not less than £2,000 before the State will recognise them as people capable of looking after the interests of their class in respect of wages, conditions of employment and so on.  If the Bill were a serious Bill, designed to do something for the workers, there is no necessity for this qualification.  As a matter of fact, it would be most undesirable to have it because, before the ground could be reviewed, before it could be established <Col N="107" /> that some of these smaller bodies were not absolutely necessary or desirable as negotiating bodies, they would be forced out of their positions as negotiating bodies since they had not this money to put up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion of Section 6 disclosed that the proposals generally with regard to negotiating bodies and the limitations on them are somewhat unconstitutional.  It also disclosed the ramshackle way in which the provisions of the Bill are put together, but I want to add, in relation to what is proposed in Section 7, that it is contrary to the great Christian aspect of the Constitution which is so often spoken of and to the spirit which is supposed to have been enshrined in it.  On Section 1, I quoted an extract from <i>Rerum Novarum,</i> and I now want to quote from <i>Quadragesimo Anno.</i>  In paragraphs 79 and 80 of that Encyclical we find these words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is indeed true, as history clearly proves, that owing to changed circumstances much that was formerly done by small groups can nowadays only be done by large associations. None the less, just as it is wrong to withdraw from the individual and commit to a group what private enterprise and industry can accomplish, so too it is an injustice, a grave evil and a disturbance of right order, for a larger and higher association to arrogate to itself functions which can be performed efficiently by smaller and lower societies.  This is a fundamental principle of social philosophy, unshaken and unchangeable.  Of its very nature the true aim of all social acthity should be to help members of the social body but never to destroy or absorb them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The State, therefore, should leave to smaller groups the settlement of business of minor importance, which otherwise would greatly distract it; it will thus carry out with greater freedom, power and success the tasks belonging to it alone, because <Col N="108" /> it alone can effectively accomplish these: directing, watching, stimulating, restraining, as circumstances suggest and necessity demands. Let those in power, therefore, be convinced that the more faithfully this principle of suhsidiary function be followed, and a graded hierarchical order exists between various associations, the greater will be both social authority and social efficiency, and the happier and more prosperous the condition of the commonwealth.</P>
    <P>This proposal to make bodies of workers deposit £2,000 before they can enter into any negotiations in respect of wages and conditions of service of their workers cuts entirely across die principle enshrined in that paragraph, which emphasises that the principle is a fundamental principle of social philosophy, unshaken and unchangeable.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what is proposed with regard to these smaller craft societies, those societies which can be regarded as being referred to in the paragraph which I quoted from <i>Rerum Novarum,</i> that they were the means of affording not only many advantages to the workman, but, in no small degree, of promoting the advancement of art as numerous monuments remain to bear witness.  The Minister is interested in technical efficiency, industrial efficiency and craftsmanship, and if we are going to succeed in the modern world in keeping our industries in the position both of serving the country and of facing up to competition, we must have a spirit of craftsmanship in our people. Where is that to come from except from those who are associated in craft unions, and what is going to become of our craft unions, the personal sense of craftsmanship which you can find only in these unions and the development of their craft technique which can only come from inside these unions, if they sue to be denied the right to act as spokesmen for their members in respect of conditions and other matters which are of such importance to them? Anything we can read into this Bill shows that they are either going to be wiped out of existence or smothered by the larger unions.  The paragraph <Col N="109" /> of the Encyclical which I quoted says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Just as it is wrong to withdraw from the individual and commit to group what private enterprise and industry can accomplish, so, too, it is an injustice, a grave evil and a disturbance of right order for a larger and higher association to arrogate to itself functions which can be performed efficiently by smaller and lower societies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as we can find out, we have not demands by some of the larger trade unions that they should be allowed to arrogate to themselves the functions of the craft unions, but we have the State forcibly driving the craft unions out of existence or into the larger unions, where that individualism, so essential for industrial efficiency and for the keeping up of a high standard of craftsmanship, is likely to be smothered.  The Minister has not given us any answer to that.</P>
    <P>Again, in paragraph 87 of the same Encyclical, we have these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Just as the citizens of the same township are wont to form associations with very diverse aims, which each citizen is perfectly free to join or not, similarly, those who are engaged in the same trade or profession will form equally voluntary associations among themselves, for purposes connected in some way with their occupation.  Our Predecessor of illustrious memory has explained clearly and lucidly the nature of these voluntary associations. We are content, therefore, to emphasise this one point: not only is man free to institute these unions which are of a private character, but he has `the further right to adopt such rules and regulations as may best conduce to the attainment of the end in view'.  The same liberty must be asserted for the founding of associations which extend beyond the limits of a single trade or profession. Let those voluntary associations which already nourish and produce salutary fruits make it the goal of their endeavours, in accordance with Christian social doctrine, to prepare the way and to do their best towards the realisation of those <Col N="110" /> higher corporations or vocational groups which We have mentioned above.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have a Vocational Commission sitting at the present time.  They have been sitting for a very long period, and I think that for some time past they have finished the taking of evidence. and we are waiting for their report.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to amendment No. 16 which, under the terms of Section 7, would put completely out of existence the smaller trade union organisations which have been built up around a particular craft and which would be wiped out of existence. I do not know by what kind of a scheme, but by some kind of a manipulation that could be brought about inside of six months after the passing of this Bill, and, apart from the desirability of seeing that there was a proper examination of the situation in order to harmonise these bodies in the best possible way with one another and to get the kind of structural organisation that is referred to here, actually an inquiry has been going on to see what kind of dovetailing of these organisations had best be brought about in order to serve the State socially, industrially and in every other way.  I am making the point that by the passing of this business now, not only are we flying against the spirit of the Constitution, not only are we flying into the imbecilities of which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney speaks, but we are flying, in a hurried way and without satisfactory examination, directly contrary to the principles that have been expounded in the Encyclicals that we hear talked about so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, before passing this provision requiring associations to make a deposit of £2,000 before being heard and before being allowed to continue as persons with any power or responsibility to negotiate conditions of employment, we should have some idea. either from some kind of an exposition <Col N="111" /> from the Minister or through getting the report or some information from the commission that has already been dealing with this matter, as to what exactly is going to be done with regard to these smaller unions.  This says: &ldquo;Wipe them out&rdquo; because the smaller unions have not the £2,000 to be put in.  So that in this section we are moving against our own Constitution and we are moving against the whole spirit of Catholic thought as enshrined in the various Encyclicals, that have been issued over a number of years by the Holy See, dealing with the organisation of working-men's societies, and I do riot think we should do that.  I think, therefore, that if this Bill is to be proceeded with, that qualification should come out, so that such societies as exist here can continue to exist while the manipulation of this Bill is going ahead, and that they will not be turned down as useful societies in the country simply because they have not got £2,000.</P>

      <P>If the Minister now pretends not to be aware of the existence of these smaller unions, probably a little reminder will recall their existence to his memory, because lie spoke of them on the Second Reading. Speaking on the Second Reading the Minister said: &ldquo;It has been said that it may affect small unions, craftunions and trades councils.  Of course it will affect them.  It will affect all of them in some measure.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister said then.  Does he say now that he is not aware of the existence of these craft unions?</P>

      <P>The Minister at that time said that the Bill will affect all of them in some measure, and Deputy Morrissey intervened to say: &ldquo;It will wipe them out.&rdquo;  The Minister then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Those which are not fit to survive as independent entities will either have to go completely out of existence or will have to unite, in some way or other, with other trade unions or with other labour organisations.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Well, the Minister has not shown himself to be sufficiently acquainted with the matters affected by this Bill to set himself up as an examiner of any Deputy in that regard. It is notorious that there are and have been for a very, very long time past, craft unions in this country, and it is equally notorious that the imposition of this deposit of £2,000 will seriously affect them, if not wipe them out of existence.  During his speech on the Second Reading the Minister went on to say that it was well known <Col N="113" /> that there were rivalries and jealousies between these small unions and large unions and that that had been the cause of a great deal of the industrial unrest and the unnecessary industrial strife in this country.  I had challenged the Minister on that earlier in the debate and had asked him if he would get the statistics, published by his Department from time to time, as to the number of working hours and the amount of money lost to trade and industry as a result of strikes over a number of years, and endeavour to make some estimate of what the rivalry of small trade unions caused in that way.</P>
      <P>We waited for an answer to that, but we did not get an answer.  All we got was to the effect that it was well known that it was the rivalry of small trade unions that had been the cause of a great deal of the industrial unrest and unnecessary industrial strife in this country.  Now, I am not aware that that is the fact.  I know that people, who are more intimate with trade union conditions than I can pretend to be, have denied that, and denied it very vehemently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The contrary is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister knows that if he had two points of view before him, he is going to accomplish one of them here.  He had a point of view with regard to overlapping activities and a point of view about the two great strengths of trade unions, as far as their numbers were concerned.  As far as overlapping is concerned, there are later sections of the Bill dealing with that, and there would be no requirements with regard to a deposit if all that was thought necessary in the interests of peace was to see that there would not be overlapping.  However, the Minister achieves a lessened number of trade unions hereafter and, up to date, has not made any real argument to prove that that is necessary in the interests of peace.  He has made a case which is false or which, I think, at least, he must know to be false, and that is that it is the rivalry and jealousies of the smaller and older trade unions that <Col N="114" /> have caused industrial unrest and unnecessary industrial strife.  That habeen denied here in the House and it has been denied outside the House by people who must be presumed to be competent to deal with the matter and to be conversant with conditions.  If the Minister denies that he has made a false representation to the House, what is the purpose then?  Of course some people in the country can see some good in the measure from the machinery point of view, but the modern tendency is rather to shrink back in horror from the great machine or the great organisation.  At one time there was a tendency towards the conception of the great, monster corporation, the monster union, the monster State, and so on, but people are rather in retreat from that conception now and are getting back to the dissipation of the great forces and great organisations towards the smaller groups, as being more definitely and closely related to the interests of the people they serve, the general idea being that the smaller groups can be expected to have more responsibility and to cause less unrest or strife in anything that they may be governing or connected with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this is an unwise provision. It is the kernel of the Bill so far as the reduction in the numerical strength of trade unions in the country is concerned.  I have seen no real reason advanced for it.  The Minister did not refer to this point in his opening statement, and I have read what he said in his closing remarks, and, except for what I have quoted, that matter was not dealt with, and my suggestion is that the phrase the Minister used there makes the false case.  This is the kernel of the Bill, and why should it be insisted upon?  If the Minister has no case, that he can substantiate with figures, that the strength of these smaller unions has contributed to any extent to industrial unrest, then he has no case for insisting on this deposit. If the effect is that the small union, as a separate entity, will disappear, and if it is going to preserve its existence in some sort of hidden or secret way by joining up with a larger body, then the Minister will have to <Col N="115" /> contemplate that, with the greater body, the people who were formerly members of two separate craft unions will find themselves involved.  What was the larger body going to do in these circumstances?  Does the Minister think he is going to get rid of unrest by simply driving back behind the scenes of the trade union movement the rivalries and the jealousies that he talks of?  Does he think that a small union is going to get its interests properly served by being submerged in the bigger union?  If he does not, is he not cutting at the roots of the trade union movement?  Is not the principle of the trade union movement being broken when people are asked to cohere when they have strength in their movement? The Minister is going to weaken their effort.  He is going to take away from the possible effect of any sort of cohesion for that purpose, and going to make the trade union system languish.  Under this Bill a whole lot of people of diverse interests will be put in the control of folk who have not their association for the particular type of work and who, therefore, cannot be expected to carry out negotiations with anything like the same intelligence, the same point or the same strength as these smaller unions had themselves.  Incidentally, if a bigger trade union, enclosing some of the smaller people in its ranks, is going to take up every quarrel which the smaller unions would have previously taken up, it only means that disputes that were localised are going to be conducted by the big union, and you are going to have instead of localisation, a spread of the trouble.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister the whole thing is not merely contrary to the current of modern thought, not merely contrary to the quotations Deputy Mulcahy has given from the documents that he has relied upon, but is contrary to the view of most people who have at all studied the conditions in industrial life in the big countries.  The movement in other countries which have suffered even much more severely from trade union strife than we have is definitely in the other direction, trying to net away from monster unions, trying <Col N="116" /> to have people grouped in such small associations that any dispute is brought home intimately to them.  In addition, their resources not being so big, the likelihood of their indulging in the last resource &mdash; it is the last resource of the trade union movement&mdash; the strike weapon, will be minimised. The Minister is doing a thing which I think in his own time he will live to regret.  Apart from any external causes there may be in regard to the way in which the measure is being proceeded with, he will live to regret the principle he is standing for in insisting upon this particular deposit.</P>

      <P>I have been challenged consistently throughout this debate to adduce evidence of the need for the proposals which are in this Bill. It has been suggested to me that I cannot produce any evidence that the smaller unions have been the cause of a great deal of the industrial difficulties with which we have been confronted, and I have said that one of the things which I hope to do by this Bill, and perhaps particularly by the section which we are now discussing, is to compel an amalgamation of the smaller unions.  I have asked Deputy Mulcahy, who has been talking about the craft unions, to mention some of those which he thinks would be compelled to amalgamate under this Bill. He has not been able to do it.  I do not think the Deputy knows what he is talking about.  I do not think the Deputy knows what he is talking about when he attempts to deny the fact that it is commonly held by, I think, the majority of trade unions that a great deal of trouble in the trade union movement and a great deal of the industrial strife in this country arises from the jealousies which do exist between certain labour organisations, among whom I would put as the principal offenders in that regard these smaller unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making that statement without having a great deal of support for it inside the trade <Col N="117" /> union movement itself.  I have here a ropy of a memorandum &mdash; and, Sir, I propose to table the whole of this document &mdash; which was presented to the Commission of Inquiry into the Irish Trade Union Movement on, I think, the 25th April, 1936.  I do not propose to read the whole of the document but, as I have said, I will table the document and any member who wishes to learn more about this business of trade union organisation and trade union rivalry and to appreciate the problem which the Government is endeavouring to tackle &mdash; the trade union movement itself having signally failed to do anything about it &mdash; can read it at his leisure.  In the course of the memorandum it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the outset it must be realised that the complete implementation of item (1) of the Terms of Reference means largely recasting the whole trade union movement.  That some recasting is desirable cannot be doubted.  A more modern and more compact trade union movement is necessary all will agree.  To attain that necessary and desirable end there is a large number of technical difficulties to be surmounted, which could be done with time and good will.  Preliminary inquiries, however, point almost unerringly to the fact that amongst the trade unions, whose overlapping makes them ripe for amalgamation or association, there yet appears to exist a great diffidence to merging into more comprehensive industrial organisations....</P>
      <P>
        <i>Craft differences.</i>&mdash; Craft or trade union pride and rivalries tend to keep alive animosities, which militate against comradeship and association.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Furthermore, it must be remembered that the internecine quarrelling of the trade unions weakens them, not alone physically but it also vitiates them morally.  This great evil can never be eradicated while the organic existence of the trade unions is confined to and dictated by the accidental divisions of trade, commerce or occupation.  Neither can legislative interference to end those inter-union differences be ignored.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> Legislation of this sort in fact was quite clearly forecast by the trade union movement itself in the year 1936 when it, having been given a chance to put its house in order, realised that public opinion in tins country was not going to stand for the continuance of the present abuses.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position of the organised trade union movement, as represented by the Irish Trade Union Congress, cannot be considered satisfactory, either from the point of view of the numbers organised or the manner in which the whole trade union movement is split up into some very small and often opposing unions.</P>
    <P>This memorandum goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Co-existent with the unions affiliated to Congress there is also a large number of local unions affiliated to the several trades' or workers' councils, and which, as trade union units, are unknown officially to Congress.  The condition of affairs disclosed indicates a great necessity for clarification, if order is to be brought out of the existing chaos.</P>
    <P>The commission kept strictly to their terms of reference, and considered a suggestion for amalgamating or merging the various unions within fairly clearly defined industrial demarcations.</P>
    <P>This suggestion contemplates the re-casting of the whole trade union movement into the following ten industrial union groupings, which it is claimed can adequately accommodate and cater for the industrial workers of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they recite those groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister recite the groups for us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  They are: (1) building and furnishing; (2) engineering. shipbuilding and vehicle building; (3) seamen and dockers; (4) rail and road transport; (5) printing; (6) bakery; (7) distributive, clerical and supervisory; (8) teachers; (9) Civil <Col N="119" /> service; and (10) general workers.  I am not advocating that classification.  I am not interfering with the rights of the unions to make their own associations and to frame their own relations with each other inside the movement.  I am merely, by means of the section which we are now discussing, compelling the trade union movement as a whole and in all its details to consider this question of amalgamation, and to consider it seriously, and to act upon it.  The memorandum from which I am reading goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Again, there is the question of the fairly large number of workers who are in small local unions affiliated to trades' or workers' councils.  Many of such unions are entirely too small and financially weak to affiliate with Congress.  Such unions cannot be left out in any reorganisation which may take place. They must be absorbed in the general reorganisation in their appropriate industrial setting.</P>
      <P>In interpreting the terms of reference on the above lines the commission were fully cognisant....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Perhaps this paragraph which I am now reading explains a great deal of the agitation which has been worked up in the City of Dublin in the last three or four weeks; I should like the House to hear it and consider it, and I should like the people outside this House and the workers of this city to consider it also.  This paragraph goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In interpreting the terms of reference on the above lines the commission were fully cognisant of all the great difficulties inherent in the proposals, not the least of which difficulties to be encountered will be the fitting into compatible office the various officials who will have to be moved about on the reorganisation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The memorandum goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The elimination of inter-union disputes, if nothing else were secured, will bring relief to all concerned. Such disputes do a tremendous disservice to trade unionism <Col N="120" /> and militate against that progress which should now be manifesting itself in the movement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say that in that memorandum there is evidence, there is ample support and ample justification for the proposal contained in Section 7 of this Bill. But it is not only in that memorandum that we will find that support and justification.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The following memorandum (III) has been approved by one member of the commission:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" />&ldquo;While I ardently support the principle of trade union amalgamation and recognise its efficacy as a weapon of protection to the organised workers, I regret I am unable to subscribe to the recommendations contained in Memorandum 1 on the subject of industrial grouping.  I would welcome a reorganisation of the unions as they exist to-day.  I would welcome a reorganisation of the unions with a view to avoiding the wasteful overlapping and baneful jealousy and rivalry which exists to-day....  I would prefer to see the question approached from the standpoint of examining the possibility of effecting grouping of unions in industries where, owing to the multiplicity of unions and the consequent weakness of organisation due to inter-union strife, the advantages of amalgamation are clearly demonstrable and the necessity for it more readily appreciated.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what responsible trade unionists have had to say on this question of amalgamation.  Having regard to the present condition of the Irish trade union movement, one of the ways in which it was hoped to ensure that this condition will be considered by those responsible in the movement is in this section of the Bill.  The report was demanded on a former occasion. At that time I was not aware that copies were readily available.  I regarded it then as a confidential document, but I am prepared now to table it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister, on the last occasion when he was handling that report, could have made that document available, he would have avoided <Col N="124" /> a lot of misunderstanding.  The Minister has simply made  case, on the point I was putting to him, even more elaborately than I made it.  If we ever heard of the blind leading the blind, here we have a case of the blind driving the blind.  The Minister says that the largest group in the commission considered that the trade union movement should be organised into ten groups, but lie does not agree.  He is simply taking the heavy stick to drive people whist, cut look on the matter he does not agree with, to do something.  He alleges that he has thrown the responsibility on them to do it, although nobody can be convinced by that suggestion. The Minister, in handling-this Bill in the way in which he has handled it in the House, has something-more in his mind, I would say, than he discloses to the House.</P>
      <P>Take the proposal that the Minister does not agree with.  The first group would be the building industry and furniture.  Has the Minister any idea that, say, painters, upholsterers, bricklayers &mdash; to go no further &mdash; can be suitably catered for inside the one union? Is he going to deny a separate existence to a painters' union if they have not £2,000, to the bricklayers' union and the upholsterers' union if they have not £2,000?  Are we to understand that people of that class &mdash; different trades and different crafts &mdash; will be thrown together simply because at some time or other they do something about a house. In the second case &mdash; engineering, ship building and vehicle building &mdash; are we to understand that an electrical engineer, a motor mechanic and a ship builder are all catered for inside one union, and that a motor mechanic cannot be allowed to have a separate existence unless his union can scrape up £2,000?  Will electrical engineers be treated in the same way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the House gives this big stick to a Minister, who says he has no mind of his own on this particular matter, and who does not agree with the mind of the trade unions, he ought to discuss in more detail the kind of mind he thinks they ought to have, or the kind of mind he thinks he might have-if he were left to carry out the reorganisation himself in the way suggested. <Col N="125" /> The Minister talks of what people in the city might think of the people who are opposing this measure, and asking for a little more information on it.  Deputy Morrissey raised the question of a group of a particular and characteristic type when we were discussing this matter on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>We can take a particular society&mdash; there are many to choose from &mdash; say, the Tipperary Workingmen's Protective and Benefit Society, which is a group of town workers.  The workers of the town are organised in this society.  They developed a very well-established and well-respected union&mdash; a position in which they were treated with the greatest possible confidence. They were most useful in the development of Muintir na Tíre and of the parish council organisation and spirit. Since April, 1931, they have been acting as the representatives of the general workers of the town of Tipperary. They have been registered with the Department of Industry and Commerce as a trade union since 1932, and have sent in their annual returns every year.  They have agreements with every firm in Tipperary employing workers &mdash; including the Condensed Milk Company, a Government concern. They have not only the confidence of the employers of the town &mdash; a town that was not famous for its industrial harmony in years past &mdash; but they have had stable and satisfactory agreements with the employers.  In contrast to the circumstances in Tipperary some years ago, Tipperary is now a place where there is industrial peace of the most stable kind.  They have a membership of 500, yet they are to be wiped out of existence as soon as this Bill is passed.  What union will take them over?  If we are working on the system of these ten unions, we find general workers &mdash; No. 10 &mdash; at the end.</P>

You have the same in Dundalk &mdash; the Dundalk Town Workers &mdash; and in other places.  Are these general town workers' unions, from Letterkenny down to Dungarvan and Kenmare, through lack of funds, to be driven out of the position they occupy between the workers and employers of the towns, and be made form one great big union extending from one end of the country to the other?  What is the idea, the necessity or the benefit which will arise through forbidding the existence of town labourers' unions or town workingmen's unions of the type I mentioned and forbidding them to carry on negotiations between employers and workers of that town?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on the way this interesting matter has emerged.  The Minister has given no arguments up to now on the points at issue.  The issue in this question is whether or not it is necessary to combine into a smaller group the trade unions which now run to a certain number.  The Minister quoted earlier from what I suppose was part of the report of this same commission. The unions affiliated to the Trade Union Congress numbered 48.  As he gave the numerical strength at the present time, 34 of these will suffer because they have not as many as 2,000 members.  14 will survive if they have the deposit necessitated by the strength of the membership; but 34 have to make other arrangements for themselves, that is, 34 out of 48.  If that is being demanded by the Minister, it must be on the basis that industry has been devastated by strife and that that strife is due to the multiplication of unions.  At long last the Minister decided to try to advance some proof or evidence of that, and the <Col N="127" /> way he does it is this: He told us on Second Beading that a Trade Union Commission was set up, and that two and a half years afterwards it reported.  The Minister tried to read extracts from that document, but was brought to order because he was not then prepared to publish the document; he had only extracts.  One peculiar phrase he used was that he would make public such part of the document as was then available to him.  Now he proposes to put the document in the Library.</P>
      <P>He has confined himself in his argument to telling us that six members of the body, which reported to that Trade Union Congress, reported in memorandum form.  But, apparently, the views of those six people were not accepted.  He then tells us what one person advocated in a memorandum.  In that biassed way, not giving us by extract what the people who apparently opposed those views said, not giving anything from them, the Minister makes his case upon a, memorandum backed by six people and a memorandum backed by one person.  What the context of these is we do not know.  I asked the Minister if the document was privileged and he said no.  It is apparently a document circulated to members of the Trade Union Congress.  The Minister faced another impediment in quoting, as I say, in a partisan way from a document and one has to consider the reaction to this upon other work that the Government may endeavour to get done.  As I understand the procedure now outlined by the Minister for another problem it may be this: that the Minister will get people interested in that matter and ask them to meet as a body ,to see if they could regulate their conduct in whatever way it required regulation.  These people submitted to the Minister a memorandum that went before them and on which they failed to agree and the Minister feels that it is open to him to make whatever use he likes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is on the Minister's argument on the matter, which may not be so completely relevant.  The only arguments the Minister has used to meet what Deputy Mulcahy and I have put to him are quotations from this particular memorandum.  I do not care what the quotations are; I do not care how partisan or biassed they are, but they have not met the point.  Will the Minister get back to the statistics his Department published with regard to loss of time and loss of money?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell me what percentage of time or money lost was due to the rivalries of small trade unions?  Is that relevant? Surely it is, because it is the small trade unions who will be killed by this requirement of a £2,000 deposit.  I have asked several times if the Minister will give an estimate of the percentage of these losses to industry that have been caused by trade union rivalry.  He advanced to-day so far as to say that a considerable number of the disputes in the country were due to rivalries of small trade unions.  He has not attempted to be concrete in any degree in this matter.  This is the pivotal point, the kernel of the whole matter, whether £2,000 should be demanded.  I see no reason for it.  It has nothing to do with the overlapping matter which is dealt with in another section which provides that people must go before a tribunal to find out whether a group or a number of groups are to have the right alone to cater for people of their own class.  That is to do away with the overlapping.  The only thing we are left with then is, how far small trade unions with their jealousies have caused trouble in industry.  I have got no answer to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now gone a little distance in disclosing home of the considered thought on this question of trade union organisation contained in documents of one kind or another in the past couple of years.  He did go a little forward since the last time.  I wonder will he go a little bit more forward.  Will he endeavour to give us some extracts from the memoranda submitted to the Vocational Commission bearing on this particular matter?  The Minister wants to get more efficient organisation, better mutual understanding, better harmony amongst workers themselves particularly, and between workers and employers. I quoted Dr. Lucey of Maynooth speaking at the Catholic Social Week as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A spirit of mutual understanding and collaboration and a strong regard for the common good, without which vocational organisation was but a sham, could not be infused into the leaders of Capital and Labour overnight by governmental decree.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the performance that we have had here on this Bill, I do not think that any order of the Minister issued within six months after the passing of the Bill will bring about any mutual understanding or collaboration or strong regard for the common good amongst the people on whom he has thrown the responsibility for clearing up the kind of mess in which he thinks the trade union is at present. If there is a serious problem to be dealt with, it has to be dealt with by collaboration and by thorough understanding. It is that feeling, that desire, the intention to collaborate and avoid mistinderstanding, that is one of the first things to be secured.  With that given, people then have to find what are the proper lines on which organisation can take place.  The Vocational Commission has appealed to the trade union organisations throughout the country and has got a very considerable amount of evidence and has had a considerable amount of discussion.  Can we have any of the suggestions that have been made by anybody before that commission, or can we have any suggestions from the commission itself, before we <Col N="131" /> take this irretrievable leap in the dark of wiping out, so far as negotiations are concerned or so far as people having any power to influence wages or conditions of work in industry are concerned, every group that cannot put up £2,000?</P>
    <P>If the Minister insists on wiping out every group that cannot put up £2,000, we ought to be told what groups are affected like that and in what direction they are likely to be absorbed, so that we can see what kind of absorption is going to take place.  We can then have the Minister's opinion as to whether that absorption is desirable and we can form our own opinions as to whether it is desirable.  If we cannot have that, if the Minister thinks his own mind is not sufficiently clear to tell us and if he thinks the.  trade union leaders' minds are too divided or confused to get any picture through him from them, then I seriously submit that the abolition clause ought to be left out and that in whatever discussions, negotiations and examinations that are going to take place after the passage of this Bill the unions should not be put out of the arena of thought and consultation and discussion simply because they have not £2,000.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister cannot make a case for telling every union that has not £2,000 to stand aside out of the remodelling that is likely to take place? The last thing anyone who was anxious to put trade unions on a more harmonious basis and organise them in a more satisfactory way should think of suggesting would be that every trade union that has not £2,000 should be wiped out of existence.  The Minister by insisting on this provision is going to do more damage than the bull did when it entered the china shop, particularly in view of the statistics he has given us as to the number of unions likely to have the £2,000.  Could the Minister at least tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have heard this speech for at least the tenth time.  He tried to make it on Section 1 and he repeated it again and again since.  I am not going to waste the time of the House by answering.  The Deputy will see what will happen to the trade union if it cannot provide or raise the £2,000. If the 528 men in it, according to the Deputy, cannot raise £2,000, then I do not think that the community of Tipperary has as much confidence in them as the Deputy professes to think it has.</P>

They cannot do so in that town except £2,000 is collected and lodged with somebody lest, I suppose, they break the peace or do something and have to be fined.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more than I can say about the Minister.  The Minister has not said anything on this Bill which would justify the charge that he is repeating himself.  He has dodged around in every possible direction for the purpose of seeing that nobody will get at what is in the back of his mind.  But at least he does realise this, that if this Bill is passed, a workman's association in the town of Tipperary, comprising 528 men, an association that has carried on satisfactorily and in perfect harmony for 11 years, in a period in which he suggests there have been all kinds of industrial difficulties in the way of strikes and animosities between the people in such a labour organisation, will cease to exist if it cannot lodge £2,000.  They have given satisfaction to one another, they have given satisfaction to the employers, but they are now going to be wiped out of existence because they have not £2,000.</P>
      <P>At a time when employment conditions, as disclosed by the last figures, were nearly as bad as those of last year, in spite of the numbers of men who have gone into the Army and gone abroad, they are asked to find £2,000.  I should like the Minister to relate his conception of how they ought to be able to find £2,000 with some of the debates that took place on the Budget, and on the Financial Resolutions, to the emergency that exists, and to the kind of emergency we are running into, as well as the crisis as regards prices that is likely to be here in three months.  The Minister has deliberately set out to withdraw machinery in Irish towns that worked satisfactorily and that brought about harmony.  What machinery is going to maintain that harmony; what machinery is going to step in when a difficulty arises?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the section, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which I now propose to make was hinted at in the discussion that took place on Section 6.  Suppose you have a difference which, judging by previous circumstances, is likely to create a wages dispute, say, in the drapery trade in Killarney. There are, let us say, two shops in Killarney in the drapery trade.  One is owned by a company and the other is owend by two brothers in partnership. As I understand, neither the company nor the two brothers can engage in negotiation separately with their own employees.  Jointly, they cannot, of course, engage in negotiation with their mixed employees unless these two brothers become a trade union and put up £2,000 or unless the company becomes a trade union and puts up £2,000 or unless either or both are members of a trade union. Quite a number of employers are not members of trade unions.  These people could not conduct negotiations in connection with a threatened dispute with their employees in some type of trade in which there are only a few shops engaged and, therefore, only a few employers because they had not taken the precaution to become members of a trade union and were not a trade union themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand, this Bill makes it <Col N="139" /> illegal for these people to carry on negotiations.  Take the case of a company composed of a small number of persons, all of whom are residents in, say, Killarney.  I am not taking the case of a big company in Dublin with a branch in Killarney.  I am taking the case of a small company with the minimum number of members requisite for a company &mdash; a private company of the family type.  As I understand, it is not lawful for these people to engage in negotiations with their own employees.  Two brothers in partnership, carrying on business under the names of both, cannot negotiate with their employees, and the combination of the two brothers and a small company cannot engage in negotiation.  I think that that is the situation, but I should like to know if the Minister agrees that it is.</P>

      <P>In a large number of towns there might be only three or four drapers.  A question might arise between these drapers and their assistants on which they would like to come to a joint decision.  The question might have reference to the length of holidays to be allowed or to the amount to be allowed for board. Some small matter such as that might crop up and these drapers would not be allowed to negotiate as a body.  A question might arise as to the closing of the shops on the weekly half-holiday. That would be a &ldquo;condition of employment&rdquo; and these three or four men could not come together and negotiate with their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the average country town where a question of wages might have to be decided by negotiation.  There may be a number of drapers in that town but the number who would have to employ assistants would be very few and these are the only ones that the Bill will affect.  If it were a question of wages in the drapery trade; there is no use in their joining together with licensed vintners to form a union for that purpose. The Minister said they could federate with other trades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of this particular trade, the drapery trade.  It seems far-fetched that three or four men should have to put up £2,000 merely in order to enable them to solve a passing difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions of wages and conditions of employment are not merely passing difficulties.  In most towns in Ireland they are frequently under discussion in one trade or another.  I am not suggesting that three drapers should come together, form themselves into a self-contained organisation and put down £2,000. What I am suggesting is that they should federate with other employers in the town to form an employers' federation.  The three drapers then, acting through that organisation, could conduct negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of fairly prosperous towns in the country with a population of about 5,000, but the people are not all employers. <Col N="142" /> There are quite a number of people amongst the 5,000 who are not, to use the language of statistics, gainfully employed.  There would be amongst these people many old persons and small children.  Possibly in a town of 5,000 you would not have more than 100 people of the employing class engaged in trade.  Because some drapers' assistants in one of the drapers' shops in the town have to enter into negotiations which will affect other drapers &mdash; say that there are not more than three drapers' shops in the town &mdash; all these drapers, the people who are in the licensed trade, the people who are provision merchants and people in all other sorts of business, have to get together to form a union and put up £2,000.  That is a fairly big levy to ask them to put up against the possibility of drapers' assistants causing trouble amongst three drapers in the town.</P>

They must have conditions as to the way people get in and go out of their trade unions.  When a dispute arises with the drapers' assistants they have to call the trade union officials together, employ all this negotiating machinery and observe all these heterogeneous conditions.</P>

      <P>Normally what would happen is that inside this federation there would be groups, one consisting of drapers, others of other <Col N="143" /> traders; these groups would have the services of a secretary and the organisation would help them to conduct negotiations.  In fact, the members to conduct these negotiations would be chosen by the federation of employers. No doubt they would be representative of the traders concerned.</P>

I was trying to find out from the Minister in the discussion on the amendment what was going to happen to a workmen's organisation in a town like Tipperary, in which there are 500 workers and where, over a period of 11 years, by peaceful negotiation, the employers and employees have maintained perfect peace and harmony in the business of the town.  The Minister suggested that it was rather queer if the employers in a town like that could not put down £2,000.  Then my mind woke up to the fact that not only have the workers to put down £2,000 on their side but that the employers have also to put down £2,000 on their side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I did not use any such phrase, because the Minister has been much too nebulous for anybody to make out what kind of legislation he has put forward.  Nobody has been able to figure out from anything he said what is going to be the result.  I would again ask the Minister, if the present situation is going to continue <Col N="144" /> in Tipperary, have the combined employers to put down £2,000 on their side, and the workers £2,000 on their side?  Could the Minister answer that?</P>

      <P>There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that that is so, because nothing the Minister has said up to the present has been of any assistance in clarifying my mind.  I take it that the only reason the Minister will not give a straight answer to my question is that the suggestion is too disgraceful, that, under present economic conditions, he should require the employers of Tipperary town and the workers of Tipperary town, if they are to continue working in the harmony in which they are working at present, to find £4,000 to put down.  Deputy O'Sulhvan raised a point with regard to employers generally in a town, but I should like to direct the attention of the House to Section 20, which says:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, where application is made to the tribunal by a trade union which claims to have organised a majority of masters of a particular class for a determination that such trade union alone shall have the right to organise masters of that class, the tribunal, after hearing such application and having considered all the circumstances of the case, shall either...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> What does &ldquo;masters of a particular class&rdquo; mean?  Is it possible that, in the town of Tipperary, the employers would all come together and be registered as a trade union and, if so, what interpretation are we to put on the words &ldquo;particular class&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>There are a large number of towns in the country, and if local organisations of any kind are continued and if £2,000 on one side and £2,000 on the other has to be put down, it means practically £400,000 altogether.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Mulcahy is important, and I take again that hypothetical case I gave earlier, of the small town where there are 100 of the employing class. There are some drapers, some publicans, some grocers and so on, in it. They may be able to find £100 each and other towns may be more or less inspired by their example.  They are going to have a small town trade union, and at that point the drapers' organisation, that is, of masters, in Dublin realises that the ground is being cut from under their feet.  They <Col N="146" /> go before the tribunal to be established under another part of the Bill for a determination that they alone are entitled to organise drapers and they get a determination in their favour. From that moment, no other one of these heterogeneous groups can get a draper in.  People in a town close to the first town I mentioned decide that they will get 100 of the employing class together to form a trade union.  They have to cut out drapers.  They cannot receive drapers, a determination having been given in favour of the main city organisation.  The licensed trade people will also be in immediately and get a determination, so that these people cannot join with their colleagues in business in the small town in order to get a trade union of a heterogeneous type.</P>

      <P>Having clarified very fully and satisfactorily the position with regard to urban workers and employers, and feeling that perhaps it could not possibly be clarified any more under present circumstances, we may pass to the rural position.  Road workers are a group which, in various counties, are very definitely organised, and they have always been able to carry out fairly satisfactorily their negotiations with the county councils. Under the present proposal, the negotiation of wages and conditions between road workers and the local authorities will, in future, be forbidden.</P>

      <P>I am not in any way responsible for what may arise out of the way in which the Minister carries on this discussion when addressing the Labour Party.  I am facing Section 7 and what it implies, if passed, in the light of what is contained in Section 6.  If Section 7 is passed, the road workers in any county, unless they put down £2,000, will not be able to carry on negotiations with the county council in respect of wages, or their general conditions of employment.</P>

If he had been, he would not be so concerned about road workers, because I indicated that I would move to strike out the words &ldquo;not being a local authority&rdquo; in paragraph 3 (a) of Section 6, but that will not keep the Deputy from wasting the time of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>8.  (1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Emergency Powers Act, 1939 (No. 28 of 193&amp;) is in force, and</P>
      <P>(b) the Minister is satisfied that, as regards any particular trade union registered under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, it would, on account of abnormal conditions referable to the war in which the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is now engaged, cause undue hardship if such trade union were compelled to make and keep with the High Court the full deposit specified by the next preceding section,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Minister may by order declare that every sum of money mentioned in the Schedule to this Act shall, as <Col N="151" /> regards such trade union, be deemed to be reduced to such extent not exceeding 75 per cent. as the Minister thinks proper.</P>
    <P>(2)  An order under sub-section (1) of this section shall have effect in accordance with its terms for the period specified in that behalf therein, save that no such cruder shall have effect after the Emergency Powers Act, 1939 (No. 28 of 1939), has ceased to be in force.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order, made after six months' notice of the making thereof has been given to the trade union concerned, revoke any order previously made by him under sub-section, (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so long as the Emergency Powers Act of 1939 is in force, to grant a reduction in the case of any particular trade union registered under the Trade Union Acts in this country, in circumstances where he is satisfied that because of conditions which have been created by the present war it would occasion undue hardship to that particular trade union to make the deposit called for by the Schedule.  This amendment will enable the Minister to consider that particular case and, with a view to the alleviation of such hardship, to grant a reduction, to an extent not exceeding 75 per cent., in the amount which it would have to deposit with the High Court in order to secure a negotiation licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the particular circumstances of the union, but the maximum reduction would be from £2,000 to £500 in the case of a trade union having not more than 2,000 members.  In the other cases the reduction would be proportionate, that is to say, in the case of a union where the appropriate deposit would be £10,000 the Minister could, if he felt that the circumstances justified it, reduce that deposit to £2,500.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This section provides that, where the Minister is satisfied that an applicant for a negotiation licence is an authorised trade union, he must grant the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 laid down certain qualifications which are necessary for a union to become an authorised trade union.  Why then in Section 9 is it necessary to bring in &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Minister&rdquo;? A trade union either is or is not an authorised trade union.  If it complies with the necessary qualifications in Section 7 it is an authorised trade union; if it does not comply with them it is not an authorised trade union. Why then should &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Minister&rdquo; come in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is responsible for granting the licence, he must at least be satisfied that the conditions provided in Section 7 are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have indicated on several occasions already that one of the difficulties about having a satisfactory discussion on this measure is that we do not know what is at the back of the Minister's mind.  In relation to not one single matter on which we have had a discussion has the Minister allowed himself to be pinned down to any definite statement of any kind. It is quite true, as Deputy Benson said, that the Minister ought to have no function in this matter, unless he wants to set himself up as an authority to pursue a policy of directing things with regard to the formation or the organisation or the classification of trade unions.  The unions are supposed to deposit a certain amount with the High Court.  The fact that they have made their deposit, the fact that they have registered as a trade union, and the fact that they have applied for the negotiation licence should be quite sufficient.  I see no reason why the section should not read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where application is duly made for a negotiation licence and the applicant is shown to be an authorised trade union, the Minister may grant such licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it is &ldquo;shown to the satisfaction of the Minister&rdquo;. The Minister is personally responsible for granting the licences, and, therefore, he must be satisfied that the conditions have been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the Minister's satisfaction come in when it is a question simply of facts f Under that section, although the facts may be all the facts that are required, if, for any reason, the Minister is not satisfied to have the union given a negotiation licence, the Minister has power to refuse it.  Would the Minister say for what purpose he desires to have that power of refusing a licence to a trade union that has carried out all the necessary steps which would entitle it to the negotiation licence?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear, when Sections 7 and 8 are read together with Section 9, that when the conditions prescribed in Section 7 are fulfilled the Minister must of necessity grant the licence.

      <P>The only justification for arguing on it is that there are three things which require to be done&mdash; they have to be a registered trade union, they have to lodge a certain amount with the courts, and they have to make an application.  When those things have been done, when an application is made by a body shown to be an authorised trade union, why a negotiation licence should not be granted, without the Minister being called in to express satisfaction or otherwise, is a matter that justifies questioning.  The Minister will realise our position?</P>

      <P>I would be very sorry to think that within the last ten years I have been responsible for so much waste of Parliamentary time as the Minister has been responsible for in the control of this measure from the time it was introduced.  The Minister has indicated that it is the trade unions which will have to settle all this.  There are trade union representatives that he thinks fit to quote here, yet he does not agree with them as to what they ought to do.  He tells us he has no plan in his mind, and does not think much about the plan the trade unionists have.  The only people that he thinks it worth while to quote here is the particular section that he has quoted.  In these circumstances he asks us to put into this section of the Bill an idea that a negotiation licence will be granted only when it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister that a certain body is an authorised trade union.  I think that the Minister is putting himself into this situation for some particular purpose he must have in mind, but which he is not disclosing to us.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1871, Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, shall apply only in relation to authorised trade unions which for the time being are holders of negotiation licences and the members and officials of such trade unions, and not otherwise.</P>

      <P>I think the House is well aware of the general purpose of the Act.  It frees the officials and members of these organisations from charges of conspiracy in connection with the organisation and prosecution of trade disputes and gives them the right of peaceful picketing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that these rights are being withdrawn from a body which consists of persons all of whom are employed by the same employer and which carries on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment with that employer only; that they are taken from agricultural labourers; that they are taken from people whose wages and conditions of employment are arranged by trade boards; taken from teachers, civil servants, and any other body of people, such as road workers, that may come under the excepted bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the House need not understand anything of the sort. There is nothing in this Bill which would prevent persons whose minimum wages are fixed by trade boards being members of a trade union; in fact the majority of the people so situated are members of a trade union.  Neither is there anything to prevent an agricultural labourer from being a member of a trade union.  I presume that some people who are employed as agricultural labourers are in fact members of general workers' unions, so that the case which the Deputy is making has no substance in it.  The main thing, as I pointed out when putting amendment No. 10 to the House, is that those bodies which are excepted, since they are exempt from making a deposit under the Bill, are bodies which it is anticipated need not have recourse to the strike weapon.  If they do wish to have recourse to the strike weapon and to have the benefit and advantages of Section 10, then they must join an <Col N="162" /> authorised trade union.  It is only the members of authorised trade unions who will have the benefits and advantages and special privileges conferred by these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a body of road workers in any particular county are not able to put up £2,000 in order to make themselves an authorised trade union able to deal direct, as in the past, with the county council, they will have to forfeit their rights under the Trade Disputes Act in order to be able to carry on negotiations with the county council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to put themselves in the position of any other person who would be subject to an action for tort, if they do anything to injure another person in his business or property, and who would not be entitled to carry on picketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not this difference between the existing position and the position according to the provisions of the Bill, that they must put down £2,000?</P>

      <P>Therefore, if any county road workers want to deal with their own affairs they will have to find £2,000, as otherwise they will not get the benefits to which the Minister has referred.  It is no good saying that this Bill does not take away from them rights which they have at present. This amounts to a fine of £2,000, because it practically means that it must remain there the whole time and they can never touch it again.  If they lose anything on it, they must pour more money into it.  Unless they can find £2,000, they get none of the benefits of those Acts.  As things stand at present, they could form a trade union without the loss of that £2,000.  The Minister may think that that is nothing, but it is a very severe penalty. It may in practice deprive them of the benefits of these Acts.</P>

      <P>Will not the section hit the smaller trade unions of craftsmen in different parts of the country which would not be in a position to <Col N="163" /> apply for a negotiation licence, and deprive them of the rights they have had for something like 70 years? There are a number of these unions in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other places.  If they have not sufficient members to enable them to apply for registration as a negotiation body, they will practically pass out of the category of trade unions as they exist at present. I do not know if the Minister has considered that point of view.  Take one of those now in the City of Dublin. There is an amendment down by Deputy Byrne to exclude it from the scope of this measure &mdash; the Regular Dublin Coopers' Society.  The membership is not much more than 300 in the City of Dublin.  If they were to be called upon to pay £2,000, it would require a levy of about £7 per man.</P>
      <P>There are two points that arise in this connection.  The first is whether the mind of the Minister is running towards allowing such bodies to exist at all as trade unions.  If they are allowed, the price is almost beyond their capacity.  The second point is this, that if the intention is to group these with a number of other crafts into a trade union, that trade union would have to have a long name if it were to include coopers, certain classes of men engaged in making good furniture, french polishers, printers and other people of that sort.</P>
      <P>What case can be made for the introduction of a Bill of this sort at such a period?  These trade unions have not occasioned the disturbance in employment that the Minister has spoken of, and it seems rather hard that, because there is a problem to be dealt with in respect of one section, we are, by a single swoop, to deprive these people of the advantages they have had for 50, 60 or 70 years.  Surely there should be some other means of dealing with a situation of that kind?</P>

      <P>People who are at the moment engaged in talking about the conflict that is being waged outside our country sometimes refer to the &ldquo;last war&rdquo;; people who want to get in a note of personal reminiscence of a <Col N="164" /> more ancient date refer to the &ldquo;Boer War,&rdquo; and quite a number of people occasionally give examples arising out of the Napoleonic wars.  When you are there you are back a good bit, but you are not back quite as far as the Minister wants to put the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>About the year 1800 it was discovered there were combinations growing up for the betterment of conditions in industry.  Up to that time they had been regarded as conspirators and the whole weight of the old employer-made law was put against these people. Everything that could be done by legislation and by the courts, giving effect to that particular type of class legislation, was done, and it all pivoted finally on the point that where people gathered together to do anything in restraint of trade, anything of the type we have got used to arising out of trade union activity, was regarded as conspiratory activity and people were sentenced for that.</P>
      <P>Somewhere after 1800 men began to get enlightened.  They realised that these combinations for the betterment of conditions in industry ought to be allowed and, by degrees, we got a, relaxation of the old laws about illegal combinations.  The trade union move ment got leave to grow and it grew to the proportions which we had in this country prior to the beginning of this war.  All that is ancient history.  A little bit more recently the Minister was invited to speak before a university gathering, where a student read a paper on trade unions.  I do not suppose there was anybody more flowery in his compliments to the trade unions than the Minister when he was speaking before an educated audience.  Today, that same Minister wants to drive the trade union movement back beyond the 1825 period, unless trade union organisations can produce £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ancient days it was the old, hard-crusted employer who had everything in his hands.  He was determined he would relax nothing, holding on to what he had, and he got the machinery of the law sharpened against the people who got together in order to secure <Col N="165" /> better conditions in industry.  The old-time employer governing the old-time Parliament and the old-time courts got his way until a period of enlightenment came, and then people were allowed to enter into those associations for the betterment of conditions.  Such betterment they brought about, as anybody will realise, and now, for no argument that anybody could count sound, the Minister proposes to divide trade unions, to reintroduce class discrimination. For the future, unless trade unions can put up £2,000, they are back again in the days of 1800 and 1825.</P>
    <P>I want once more to give the Minister the example of the provincial town of 5,000 inhabitants.  Perhaps I took an exaggerated figure when I said 100 might be of the employing class. Let me take it that there might be three drapers.  These drapers are faced with a difficulty if they get into some sort of unauthorised associations in the sense that they are not authorised trade unions under this Bill.  If those three men enter into a discussion with employees in their own premises with regard to the fixation of wages and the betterment of conditions, they are committing an illegal act unless they are in a big organisation extending through the country, or are joined with the butchers, bakers and candlestick makers to form a local union.  The men are also an illegal body unless they are members of a trade union or have the privilege of becoming the members of an excepted body.</P>
    <P>If either of them does anything that can be described as a restraint of trade or some type of tort protected by the Trade Disputes Acts then, unless they can put up the £2,000, they are in danger of being dragged before the courts on foot of the old-time charge of conspiracy.  That is what is being introduced in 1941 as enlightened legislation in order to bring harmony into society under the slogan of peace in industry in our time.</P>

      <P>That is the situation. I thought this clause might have been better hidden, but here is Section 2 of the Trade Union Act of 1871&mdash;<Col N="166" /> another war springs to the mind&mdash;and here is Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 and the more modern Trade Disputes Act of 1906.  All these things cease to apply except in relation to authorised trade unions and, for the future, men in this country are going to be allowed to boast that they are free in regard to associations only if they are sufficiently wealthy to be able to put up £2,000.</P>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister realised that that is the setting in which this measure must be presented to the people?  I wonder if the Minister thinks that is a proper setting or, if he does not think that it is an exaggerated way in which to present a Bill like this, does he not realise that some argument ought to be produced to show why there is a necessity for this particular type of control of the unions on the industrial side?  The Minister has told us there is overlapping to be avoided. Overlapping is not any part of this section.  It is covered in a later part of the Bill, which deals with the determination of one or many unions &mdash; that one or many unions have a right to organise workers of a particular class. So far as overlapping goes, it is out of it.</P>
      <P>The only thing left is this question of rivalry and dispute, and the Minister has not advanced to the point of telling us, if he can, what number of hours in any one year, taking the worst year in which we were most harried by industrial disputes, were lost through industrial disputes because of the rivalry or jealousy of small trade unions.  Until he comes to the point that there is not merely a case, but a multitude of cases, to show that the whole cause of the dispute is a small trade union, it is a scandal to the Parliament, to the Government and the age we live in that anybody should attempt to get back beyond the Trade Disputes Act and the 1871 Act and throw us back to the days of the anti-combination laws.</P>

      <P>A session of the referee and advisory committee was provisionally fixed for 5th May, 1941, for discussion and verification of the outstanding former South Roscommon Brigade applications under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934.  The session was postponed because (1) the brigade committee requested longer notice of certain additional cases for discussion, and (2) it was found that the detailed records of military activities supplied precedent to the session by the brigade committee were not satisfactorily certified.  The brigade committee have been notified that when these records are put in order the referee will be prepared to fix a definite date for the session.</P>
