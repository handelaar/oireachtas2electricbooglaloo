      <P>If the difficulties which the Deputy refers to are the difficulties arising out of the rationing of petrol I understand that reasonable supplies have been allocated for commercial lorries.  I may point out that the cost of licensing a vehicle is only a small portion of the running expenses.  If the proposal were agreed to licences would require to be printed for each month of the year as well as for quarterly and yearly periods.  I am not satisfied that there is any need for the change suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether before reducing to one ounce per head per week the tea ration made available to the public he considered (a) acquiring for equitable distribution the total reserves of tea held in this country by traders and others, and (b) purchasing in bulk quantities all imports of tea for equitable distribution to the public through the agency of his Department, and, if not, whether he will consider taking such steps with a view to providing people, who because of their poverty must rely mainly on tea as an article of food, with a reasonable tea ration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, I do not consider that it would be practicable to acquire the reserves of tea held by traders and others for distribution, nor am I satisfied that such action would permit of any increase in the ration now available. As to the second part of the question, it is not necessary for the purpose of the control over distribution at present exercised by my Department <Col N="1607" /> that all imports of tea should be purchased in bulk, apart from the considerable practical difficulties which would attend such course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state on what basis the allowance of one ounce of tea per person was fixed, and if, in view of the fact that tea is the principal item in the meal of the most needy of the population, he will see that this allowance is increased to a reasonable amount; if, further, in necessitous cases he will take steps to have the said increased ration provided free of cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The individual tea ration under the Emergency Powers (Distribution of Tea) Order, 1941, has been fixed on the basis of the reduced supplies which are being allocated to this country by the Tea Control of the British Ministry of Food, through which channel all our supplies are now being obtained.  When notification was received that allocations were being reduced to 50 per cent. of the normal supplies, it was found that the quantity available would not permit of a ration exceeding one ounce per week per head of the population.  As I have <Col N="1608" /> already informed the Dáil, notification has since been given that allocations will, for the present, be reduced to 25 per cent. of the normal supplies, and an adjustment of the ration to one half ounce per week per person has had to be made in consequence.  I regret that no increase in the ration can be made.  It is not proposed to provide tea free of cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the latter part of the question, would the Minister say if he is aware that there is a very large number of people at the present moment in the City of Dublin not able to buy tea?  I am speaking of those who have not the money to buy it, regardless of the fact that they may have ration cards.  They are in extreme poverty and the time has arrived to give them a ration of tea and other foodstuffs free of charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that advertisements have appeared in the Press offering quantities of tea in bulk lots at prices varying from 4/- to 6/- per lb.; whether he has taken any and, if so, what steps to ascertain the quantities of tea held by individuals or firms for purposes of retail at excessive prices and whether he will state what action he intends taking to obtain possession of excessive supplies so hoarded and to fix a uniform price for all tea sold by retail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that offers of tea at 6/- a lb. were made in advertisements published in the Press during the month of February last.  Since then, the offer of tea for sale in this manner has been made illegal under the terms of the Emergency Powers (Distribution of Tea) Order.  Every applicant for a tea retailer's licence under Article 11 of the Emergency Powers (Distribution of Tea) Order, 1941, is required to give particulars of the tea stocks held by him.  I am not aware that quantities of tea are held by individuals or firms for purposes of retail at excessive prices and any information in the Deputy's possession that excessive prices are being charged for tea or any other commodity will be welcomed by my Department.  The sale of tea by retail by any person who does not hold a tea retailer's licence is also an offence under the Emergency Powers Order.</P>
      <P>The question of fixing a uniform price for tea sold by retail has been under consideration in my Department. While no final decision has yet been taken on the matter my present attitude is against the adoption of such a course which would involve an appreciable increase in the prices now being paid by many classes of consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister himself read any of the advertisements referred to in the question and which appeared <Col N="1610" /> even on the eve of the date that the rationing scheme came into operation? Has he received in his Department any complaints of the kind referred to in the question; and, if so, what action has been taken or is proposed to be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether he has completed his examination into the prices charged for turf in Dublin, and if he will state (a) the prices now charged to bellmen and other small distributors, (b) the prices now charged by bellmen, and (c) the retail prices now charged for turf by coal merchants; and whether his Department has taken any part in the fixing of these prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation into the prices charged for turf in Dublin is not completed.  This investigation has shown that the conditions under which turf is purchased in the producing areas, the quality of the turf and the means of transport used in bringing it to Dublin vary considerably as between the different traders engaged in the business and, consequently, it has not been found possible to fix a standard price for turf generally which would be fair to producers, traders and consumers.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to his question on the 19th February last.  The prices given in that reply are still maintained for turf purchased from the Turf Development Board.  Generally speaking, the price charged to bellmen by coal merchants for this turf is 4/- per ton less.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the retail prices in Dublin at mid-February, 1941, of the undermentioned commodities, i.e., household flour, bakers' bread, coal, tea, granulated sugar, milk, eggs, potatoes, creamery butter, streaky bacon, sirloin of beef, leg of mutton.</P>

      <P>Prices of certain commodities at all places in Éire in which an employment exchange or branch employment office is situated are ascertained in connection with the quarterly compilation of the cost-of-living figure, for which purpose it is necessary only that the national average prices should correctly indicate the trend of retail prices in the country as a whole.  The returns received for Dublin are few in number, so that the average or predominant prices as derived from these returns cannot be regarded as much better than approximations.  There is always the danger that these prices may be used to indicate changes in the actual prices of particular commodities between one date and another for a certain area.  Such use of the following prices cannot be justified, for not only are the returns too few, but it is not always possible to obtain prices from exactly the same sources at each inquiry, while at the present time there is the further difficulty of obtaining quotations for identical qualities of goods.</P>
      <P>The average prices as calculated and stated with the above-mentioned reservations are as follows:&mdash;Household flour, 3/2 per stone of 14 lbs.; bakers' bread, 6d. per 2 lb. loaf; coal, 4/- per cwt.; tea (as used by wage-earning classes), 2/9 per lb.; granulated sugar, 4½d. per lb.; milk, 7½d. per quart; eggs, 2/4 to 3/- per dozen; potatoes, 1/4 per stone of 14 lbs.; creamery butter, 1/7 per lb.; streaky bacon, 2/3 per lb.; sirloin of beef, 1/7 per lb.; leg of mutton, 1/5 per lb.</P>

      <P>The furnace for the manufacture of any kind of glass has only a limited life and at intervals has to be rebuilt.  This involves a shutting down of manufacture for a considerable period.  There have been difficulties about obtaining the necessary supplies of sand and fuel oil.  Sand supplies have now been assured but consideration is still being given as to whether it will be possible to give the company such guarantees as are necessary in respect of continued supplies of fuel oil.  A guarantee of supply is necessary to avoid starting the plant and having it closed down after a short period. Until the position of fuel oil supplies has been clarified, manufacture cannot be resumed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the fact that the methods hitherto adopted to check the spread of foot-and-mouth disease seem to be ineffective and that the disease now threatens to destroy the whole live-stock industry of the nation he will indicate what further measures he intends taking to successfully combat the ravages of this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures taken by the veterinary staff of my Department to control foot-and-mouth disease have been effective where the Department have had the full cooperation of stock-owners in dealing with outbreaks.  Improvements in methods of control which experience has shown to be necessary and useful are being adopted.  An unsatisfactory feature of the present position is the occurrence of disease at centres in the country some miles apart from previous disease centres.  The disease is under control at these new centres, and if stock-owners in the areas would refrain from visiting other premises and not allow their neighbours or <Col N="1623" /> others to come in contact with their animals or premises and would give the Department's officials the fullest information they possess, no widespread extension from these centres is anticipated.  The Dublin area with its dense stock of dairy cattle is regarded as the most dangerous centre, but there are some signs of improvement recently in this area.  While the position generally must be regarded as serious, it does not threaten to destroy the whole live-stock industry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that 19 cows affected with foot-and-mouth disease were allowed to remain on the premises of Mr. C. Byrne, Cromwell's Fort, Crumlin, County Dublin, from 29th March to 5th April, when they were slaughtered and taken to the knackers; if, further, he is aware that there are further outbreaks in that district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The presence of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in cows on these premises about 6 p.m. on Saturday, 29th March.  The animals were valued on Sunday, 30th March, and 95 in-contact cattle were removed for salvage on that day.  The military authorities were requested to dig a pit for the infected cattle.  This work was begun on the 31st March, and it was anticipated that the pit would be completed and the infected animals would be slaughtered and buried that evening or the following day.  Extremely wet <Col N="1625" /> weather intervened, and rocks were met with, which held up work on the pit.  It was ultimately found impossible to sink a pit to a sufficient depth, and the burial of the animals had to be abandoned.  Steps had then to be taken to have them slaughtered and removed to a destructor.  This was completed on 4th April.  From the time the disease was discovered until their removal the infected animals were isolated in a house, and the premises were under the supervision of a veterinary officer and of the Gárda. Very complete precautions were taken to prevent the spread of infection from these premises, and I am satisfied that no infection was, in fact, spread from this source.</P>

I do not think I am overstating the case when I say that half of those have been affected since and slaughtered.  One case was brought before the Minister's notice indirectly by me, the case of Mr. Taylor of Templeogue, who appealed to me as his Deputy to do something to try to keep the disease from his yard.  These cows, 112, have since been slaughtered. The disease was nursed there by the incompetence of the Minister's Department.</P>

      <P>The site selected for the pit in which the animals slaughtered on this farm were buried was the most convenient and driest on the infected farm much of which was, at the time, in a water-logged condition due to recent heavy rains.  The nearest point of the pit to the boundary of Mr. McDonald's land is about 20 yards.  The distance of the pit from the water supply on Mr. McDonald's land is about 93 yards and the fall from the pit is towards the infected farm and not towards the water supply.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say whether in his judgment or in the judgment of his veterinary inspector, it is a reasonable thing on a 200-acre farm to bury 70 infected cattle within 20 yards of another man's mearing? In view of the fact that we all know that this disease is spread by hares and rabbits, is it reasonable where you have 200 acres which are scheduled as infected premises, to choose a place within 20 yards of another man's mearing to bury 70 affected cattle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will realise that there may be local conditions, such as the waterlogging of the land, which would determine the choice of site.  It is not advisable, if cattle are infected in a certain field, to bring them through other fields in through the farm.  The less movement the better.  As these places are fenced off, I do not think there is any greater danger.  If there is danger of infection from rabbits and hares net wire is erected.

      <P>Owing to the existence of foot-and-mouth disease on adjoining premises, the stock on Mr. Wilkinson's farm at Tyrrellstown was kept under observation by a veterinary officer who visited the premises on 13th and 20th March.  Disease was not noticeable on these dates.  On 21st March one animal was reported as having developed suspicious symptoms, and on examination on that day this animal was found to be affected with the disease.  All other animals on the farm were still healthy on this date.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for the reason that, in my opinion, there is nothing more important on the Order Paper, and I think it is a scandal, in view of the coal position in Dublin City, that the Government deny private members the time that should be made available to them to have this matter discussed.</P>

      <P>I have no objection at all to a discussion of the motion at any time that can be arranged, but Deputy Mulcahy knows quite well that this motion could not be made effective and that the committee proposed could not function without an amendment of the law.  The Deputy has been offered a committee which could function, a committee which could investigate the present prices of coal in Dublin.  I made that offer to him before the Dáil adjourned for the Easter recess.  If he had agreed to that we could have got the necessary procedure adopted in a few minutes, but he did not agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I redrafted the motion, leaving out the reference to papers and documents and anything that required confidential information. I redrafted the motion so that it would read that the House would set up a committee of Deputies to inquire into the prices charged for coal in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire since 1st January, 1941.  I restricted the inquiry to the period from 1st January, 1941. That was the period in respect to which a price for coal was approved by the Minister and in respect to which also the date occurred when the Minister increased the price to 63/- The Minister refused that motion and offered something that would not include an investigation into his fixing of the price.</P>

      <P>Surely the House may discuss the propriety of the Government withdrawing from us what is our guaranteed right?  They have made no case at all.  We are not asking for Government time.  We are merely asking that the Government should not take from Private Deputies the time that is usually allocated to them.  The attitude taken up by the Government is that if we want a discussion of the kind we think necessary in Private Deputies' Time, we can go to Hong Kong, for we will not get it.  Let us pause for a moment to consider the position.  There is growing up in this country a feeling that Deputies are wasting their time in Dáil Eireann and, so far as members of the Labour Party, the Opposition and the Independents are concerned, for the next six months if we go on a public platform we will be told that peaceful representations in Parliament elicit nothing better than to be told that we can go to Hong Kong.</P>

If the representatives of the people are going to be told in Dáil Eireann that they can go to Hong Kong when they ask for information about the acute sufferings of their constituents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the quota orders.  At the present time we are confronted with great difficulty in getting supplies of anything.  Is it sensible in that situation to be restricting supplies that are available, and, by legislating, forbidding people to bring stuff into the country?  As far as I am aware, we must be the only country in the civilised or the uncivilised world doing that at the present time.  Apart from darkest Abyssinia, every country in the world is trying to get supplies which they regard as vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standing out in the community of nations like a sore thumb is Éire, which declares: &ldquo;Not only do we not want to get them, but if anybody attempts to bring them in, we will confiscate them and throw them out again.&rdquo;  We may be married to the doctrine of economic self-sufficiency, although, God knows, we are getting a dose of it at present, and it may prove a salutary lesson to some of our amateur economists of the post-war period, but surely the Minister for Industry and Commerce should tune down the orchestra a little at present, and, instead of warning any of us who might be able to get supplies against trying <Col N="1650" /> to get them, should rather say that, for the period of this crisis, all quota orders go by the board, and that any person who can get supplies anywhere of anything that our people require is doing a public service and we will facilitate him in any way we possibly can.  Would the Minister give us his view on that aspect of this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt whether I could deal with the very wide question which Deputy Dillon has raised, but with regard to the particular quota orders which we are considering at the moment, I would ask the Deputy to bear in mind that these orders form part of an agreement which, whether for good or ill, was made with the British cotton manufacturers, under which our mills are assured, within the limits of reasonable ability to fulfil that engagement, of a supply of cotton yarns for their works.  Accordingly, we could not, in this case at any rate, decide that cotton-piece goods would be allowed in free of quota restriction, without giving notice that we wished to terminate that agreement and without jeopardising the supply of raw materials for our own cotton manufacturers. That is the position, and, as matters stand at present, I think it is in the best interests of the community as a whole that we should maintain our engagements with the British manufacturers in order that they will fulfil their engagements with us.</P>
      <P>On the general question as to the advisability of continuing restrictions upon imports in any form during the present emergency, I do not think that that properly arises on these motions. Perhaps the Deputy may wish to discuss it at a later date, upon a more appropriate occasion, and I would then be prepared to deal with it more fully.</P>

      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £208,121, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with the Administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1936, and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1940, and for sundry contributions and Grants, including certain Grants-in-Aid in respect of the cost of Benefits and Expenses of Administration under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum now asked for is to complete the sum of £311,121 required under the National Health Insurance Vote for 1941-42.  The figure covers the cost of central administration of national health insurance and also the cost of staff, etc., engaged in the administration of widows' and orphans' pensions. In addition, it includes the amount of <Col N="1652" /> £250,000 required for statutory exchequer grants for national health insurance and a special grant of £1,400 expenditure in connection with travelling expenses of persons examined under the district medical referee scheme.  There is an increase of £11,000 in respect of statutory exchequer grants due mainly to the increase in the armed forces in respect of which special grants to supplement contributions are made, and to an expected special repayment of a loan to the society for compensation purposes. The increase is partly offset by an expected decrease in benefits involving a corresponding decrease in State grant.</P>
      <P>There is also an increase of £1,425 in salaries, due to increments.  A decrease in the sub-head A A&mdash;Actuary&mdash;is due to the fact that it is unnecessary to make provision this year in connection with inquiries into the financial position. An increase of £1,742 under sub-head I&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;is an offset, leaving a net increase of £9,729 as compared with the year 1940-41.</P>
      <P>Two changes took place during the past year in the composition of the Committee of Management of the National Health Insurance Society. One change took place in the representatives of insured persons on the committee of management.  Each year, an election of five insured person's representatives takes place in accordance with the Acts, which provide for the election of two members of the committee as representatives of the insured persons in the Province of Leinster, two for the Province of Munster and one for Connaught and Ulster.  The representatives elected in 1940 include two persons resident in Dublin, one in Tipperary, one in Cork and one in Mayo.  Mr. T. Looney, of Blarney, replaced Mr. Horgan of Tralee. Amongst the representatives of insured persons nominated by the Irish Trades' Union Congress, Mr. T. Dunne, of Waterford, replaces Mr. J.J. Farrelly of Dublin.  All members of the committee of management hold office until the 31st July next, when new appointments and elections will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated number of insured persons at the end of 1940 was about <Col N="1653" /> 581,000, being a decrease of 15,000, and there was a decrease in the contribution income of about £6,000 to £708,875. Part of the decrease in the value of the contributions is due to enlistment of civilian insured persons in the armed forces, the contributions payable for soldiers being 4½d. a week only, as compared with 8d. a week in civil life. The number of insured persons in receipt of sickness and disablement benefits at 31st December, 1940, was 25,180, which was approximately the weekly average throughout the year. During the year, the number of separate benefit payments including sickness, disablement, maternity and marriage amounted to 1,174,157. Maternity benefit was paid in respect of 25,738 confinements.</P>
    <P>The cost of benefits at £695,000 shows an increase of £6,500.  The accumulated funds forming the assets of National Health Insurance amounted to £5,013,688 at 31st December, 1940.  This sum, together with the unredeemed paper reserve values of £1,945,213, represents the sum required to meet the future liabilities of the fund under the existing financial system.</P>
    <P>During the year, it was necessary to bring legal proceedings in 910 cases against employers who had failed to comply with the provisions of the Acts as regards payment of contributions. I would like again to remind employers that default of this kind often leads to loss of benefits to insured people and of contributory pensions to the widows and orphans of deceased insured men. Wherever possible such losses are recovered from employers and, during last year, a sum of £366 was so recovered.</P>
    <P>When the Government introduced legislation which effected the unification of societies, they did not regard that as a final settlement of the problems of the health insurance scheme. On the contrary, they had in view that it should be a starting point for future developments.  It had this advantage, moreover, that it afforded facilities for obtaining experiences and statistics referable to the whole body of insured persons, a position which had not been possible under the old system with <Col N="1654" /> many societies and many different standards of administration.  It is well recognised that in building for the future in any form of social insurance the foundation must be laid on the experience of the past.  If that experience is not reliable, the financial security of the future is jeopardised.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a stage where we have five years' experience of the working of the unified society.  I refer to the years 1935 to 1939.  The year 1934 was a transitional year and cannot safely be regarded as furnishing reliable data.  The broad fact emerging is that the national health insurance fund, which stood at £3,640,000 at 31st December, 1934, has increased to £4,746,000 at 31st December, 1939.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this apparently favourable result, the report of the Government actuary on his investigation of the society's benefit experience which was received in May, 1939, and laid on the Table of the House, disclosed that the expenditure on sickness and disablement, especially for women, has been very much heavier than was contemplated when the present financial basis of the Act was determined, which means in effect that there has been less money accumulating for reserves than was considered necessary to meet the future liabilities of the scheme.  The point which is now being considered is whether the reserve already accumulated may not be sufficient to meet the requirements of a scheme in which all insured persons are members of one society, and under which all new entrants become members of that society.  This position gives an assured annual contribution income, and the experience of the five years I have referred to indicates that that income, together with the State subvention and the interest on the accumulated funds, has been more than sufficient to meet the annual expenditure on benefits and administration.  If that position could be maintained for the future it would be possible to consider the release of a certain amount of money for the provision of benefits other than the statutory benefits.</P>
    <P>With this object in view, the actuary <Col N="1655" /> was asked in January, 1939, for a report on the general financial position and, in particular, as to the possibility of substituting for the present financial system of the Acts arrangements by which income would be equated to expenditure over a series of years.  His report, which was only received on the 31st March, contains a full review of the finances of the national health insurance system.  While the report was being awaited the whole position had been considered in great detail departmentally, and the conclusions reached are now being examined in the light of the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the reference back of this Estimate for the purpose of expressing dissatisfaction with the manner in which national health insurance is administered and the slothful indifference of the Department of Local Government in remedying the very obvious blemishes associated with national health insurance legislation. The original purpose of national health insurance was to make provision for curative treatment, on the one hand, and to provide some compensation for loss of cash income by the insured worker, on the other hand.  In fact, our system of national health insurance does neither.  We provide no curative treatment under the National Health Insurance Act for any sick, insured person and the cash income which a person receives&mdash;a maximum of 15/- per week for six months as sickness benefit and a maximum of 7/6 per week for any further period as disablement benefit&mdash;fails hopelessly to provide any reasonable compensation for an insured person in respect of the loss of his income through illness.  At present, we have no scheme under the National Health Insurance Acts by which a sick, insured person can secure hospital treatment.  We have no scheme by which a sick, insured person can receive dental, optical or surgical treatment or treatment for tuberculosis. As I have said, the cash compensation we give in respect of loss of wages is wholly inadequate.  Under the scheme of national health insurance societies which existed here, certain members had additional cash <Col N="1656" /> benefits.  On the creation of the Unified National Health Insurance Society, these societies, on amalgamation, had to take the results flowing from the valuation of the assets of all the societies grouped into one organisation. The result was that, on an actuarial basis, it was, apparently, found impossible to continue the additional cash benefits and the additional non-cash benefits which a large number of workers had enjoyed. These people have been clamouring since then to have these benefits restored to them.</P>
      <P>I called the attention of the House on previous occasions&mdash;and I want to do it again now&mdash;to the manner in which the accounts of this society are examined.  The actuary, in his periodical examination of the accounts of the society, has, invariably, suggested that national health insurance was insolvent and that the society was operating on an insolvent basis.  Look at the facts.  The income of the society in 1937 was £717,000.  Interest on investments amounted to £162,000. There were special grants amounting to £218,000, making a total cash income to the society of £1,160,000.  In that year, the society did not pay out in benefits or in administration anything like the sum they received.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated, the society is in a very strong position from the point of view of accumulated reserves.  In 1934 their assets amounted to £3,460,000.  That sum increased to £3,545,000 in 1935, and by 1937 had reached £3,617,000.</P>
      <P>In 1938 the figure was £3,731,000, apart from a sum of £221,000 held by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the national health insurance central fund.  A society which is supposed to be insolvent, a society which is not in a position to pay additional benefits, is able, nevertheless, according to these figures, to accumulate vast reserves &mdash; reserves which might very well be envied by any firm certified as commercially successful according to the rules of orthodox commercial success in this or any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the position of the society in relation to its finances further.  Take the year 1938.  After <Col N="1657" /> paying all claims for benefit in 1938, the society saved £290,000.  If you take the income of the society in 1938 and the expenditure in the same year, you find that an unspent balance of £290,000 was available for investment by the society.  When the actuary says that the society is insolvent, he is dealing with an entirely different matter from that to which I am referring.  He means that it is insolvent from the actuarial point of view and that, instead of saving £290,000, the society should have saved £390,000.  Having regard to our experience of national health insurance and to the dissimilarity of our method of organisation of insured persons from that in Great Britain, we should no longer be bound by actuarial methods which, while suitable to Great Britain, are entirely unsuited to the conditions obtaining in this country at present.</P>
    <P>Any examination of the investments of the national health insurance society will disclose at once that it is a very flourishing institution from the point of view of cash investments; that each year it yields a substantial surplus for investment.  My plea is that that surplus should be made available for the provision of additional benefits to the insured persons and for the provision of additional cash benefits, because the present cash benefits are clearly inadequate.  As I said, the method by which this society is certified to be insolvent is probably the British method of valuing societies.  In Britain there are 2,000 national health insurance societies, some of them on a territorial basis, others on a religious basis, others on the basis of some peculiarity of vocation or organisation. The British method was designed to provide for this possibility.  A society in Britain, for instance, might have recruited 1,000 members and no other person might desire to join that society.  Left then with 1,000 members and the dropping possibly of some of these, that society had to be concerned with providing for the theoretical last man; in other words, the funds had to be invested in such a way that, if the society had 1,000 members and 999 died, there would be still investments available to meet the claims of the survivor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> One could understand that method in relation to the circumstances of Britain.  But that is not the position here.  There is no likelihood whatever of that position arising here, there is no likelihood whatever of the possibility of there being a theoretical last man.  So long as you assume the survival of the Irish race, there is no possibility whatever of our having to provide for the contingency of the last man.  Here we have only one society. It can never lose its membership, because everybody in the country going into insurable employment must go into that particular society; everybody who is insured must be insured in that society.  There is, consequently, an annual flow of members into the society, and, if there is an outflow, that is made good by recruitment of members at the other end, with the result that the society is only concerned with organising its finances in such a way that its annual income is capable of meeting its annual expenditure. There may be need, of course, for a little more prudence even than that.  It would be desirable probably to have as a reserve against a possible epidemic some investments to meet the heavy claims on that society in circumstances such as that.  But, if you are to put aside, for instance, one year's income and say that the reserve ought to be kept at one year's income, then the most it is necessary to put away is £1,000,000 approximately.  But, at present, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, the society has £5,013,000 of accumulated assets, which really means that the society, so far as it is concerned itself, has assets amounting probably to ten times its own normal income and five times the amount of its income from all sources, namely, contribution income, interest, and State grant.  What is the purpose of locking up that £5,000,000 and saving money each year?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of that. I am pleading with the Parliamentary Secretary to bestir himself quickly in this matter.  There is no need at present to lock up £5,000,000 of the society's assets in investments.  Some of that money should be made available for the provision of additional cash benefits to insured persons, and some of it should be made available for the provision of dental benefit, optical benefit, hospital benefit, and medical treatment generally. Why can we not do it?  It is not that our insured people generally do not need dental and optical benefits; it is not that they do not even need medical and hospital treatment.  Notwithstanding the fact that they do need these, and that there is available an abundance of money which could provide them, no steps are taken by the Department to reorganise the basis of valuation of the society in order to provide these additional benefits.  The present scheme is a travesty of national health insurance, as properly understood. It is simply a mockery of health and insurance.  What we do at present is to give people a small cash benefit, and to tell them: &ldquo;Get well as quickly as you can&rdquo;, or, from the point of view of the solvency of the society: &ldquo;Die as soon as you can.  Do either one thing or the other&mdash;get better quickly or die quickly; if you get better quickly, you save the funds of the society, and if you die quickly, then you will not add an additional unit to that long list of units that disturbs the actuary occasionally in his reports.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have told us in the course of his introduction of the Estimate what he proposes to do in connection with this whole question of providing additional cash and non-cash benefits.  He should <Col N="1660" /> have told us above all when he was going to start doing it.  I addressed a question to the Parliamentary Secretary early this month, asking him to endeavour to have these additional benefits made available in the new benefit year commencing on the 7th July.  Beyond promising that he would do his best to expedite the matter, I could not extract from him any definite promise that the scheme would be made available for insured contributors in the new benefit year&mdash;either at the commencement or during the new benefit year.  There is a very serious position to be met.  These insured people are suffering for a long time from the withdrawal of these additional benefits, and from the failure of the society, because of control by legislation, to provide additional benefits for the contributors.</P>
    <P>I think we have reached a stage now when the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be able to tell us, with six or seven years' working of the society, that it is intended to abandon the British method of valuing the assets of the society and to adopt a method of valuation, which, while making reasonable provision for possible heavy demands in any particular year on the assets of the society, will nevertheless release for the benefit of the insured contributors the very large sums of money which have been locked away in investments on behalf of the society.</P>
    <P>Apart from this question, I think that there should be some effort made to co-ordinate the health services and to provide curative treatment for insured persons.  The method of giving benefit, while making no systematic attempt to cure persons of the disability which makes them seek benefit, is causing quite considerable concern on the part of persons who are interested in the creation of a satisfactory health organisation in this country.  I think, of course, that it is a mistake to have health insurance divorced from other types of insurance.  Unemployment insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions, and old age pensions are all different aspects of pretty well the same type of social service.  It seems to me that a very good case could be made for cutting out the waste and overlapping which go with these <Col N="1661" /> segregated services, and that, instead, we ought to adopt some kind of a coordinated social service which would lock together health insurance, unemployment insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions and accident insurances, and have an insurance department which would look after them.  At present we have old age pensions paid by the Revenue Commissioners, with the claims investigated by the Department of Local Government.  Health insurance is operated by a society and supervised by the Department of Local Government. Unemployment insurance is operated by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  You have pretty well no one looking after accident insurance which is most important from the point of view of the employed worker.  That is an aspect of health insurance which requires much more attention and consideration than I fear it has got so far.  The most urgent problem of all is that some effort should be made to have made available some of the £5,000,000 which is locked away in investments by the National Health Insurance Society.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, will be able to give us some idea as to when some of that money will be made available for insured contributors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether there is any difference between his Department and the committee of management of the Unified Society on this question of extra benefits?  The committee of the Unified Society passed a resolution which appeared in the public Press on the 29th March to the effect that the time was opportune for the provision of extra benefit, and calling upon the Department to give effect to the dental and other schemes already submitted and approved of. The people in charge of the Unified Society appear to be satisfied that it is now in a position to provide money for these extra benefits.  Is it the opinion of the Department that the society is wrong in so thinking?  After all, the committee is in control of the society.  The members of it are the people who do the main bulk of the <Col N="1662" /> business, and they ought to know what is the best policy to pursue.  When the society asks that provision should be made for these extra benefits, or for other schemes, will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what the Department intends to do in the matter?</P>
      <P>The question of these extra schemes&mdash; dental, optical, and others&mdash;is causing a lot of trouble in country districts where you had various types of national health societies functioning before the Unified Society was set up. The people who belonged to some of those good societies were provided with extra benefits before amalgamation was brought about.  After amalgamation, they lost the extra benefits, so that they are now in the same position as those who belonged to the worst type of society that existed before the Unified Society came into being.  The loss of those extra benefits has been a very serious matter for a large number of old members. Deputy Norton referred to the fact that nothing is being done for contributors so far as curative treatment is concerned.  I can quote an example in support of that.  I know a middle-aged labourer, a married man with a wife and four or five children, who had been putting on national health insurance stamps ever since the scheme came into operation.  He became ill two years ago.  He is suffering from an unusual form of heart disease.  It is not ever likely to kill him, but will prevent him from doing any kind of work for the remainder of his life.  He was certified as being unfit for work by doctors.  At one period he was turned down by the referees, but they subsequently passed him again.  He is getting 7/6 a week.  He has no other means.  There is no chance of getting him proper treatment for the type of disease he is suffering from.  He is living with his wife and four children and has nothing but this 7/6 a week. He would be much better off if he were not getting national health insurance at all, because then he would be able to apply for home assistance to enable him to support his wife, family and himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for adopting some kind of a scheme whereby a contributor, <Col N="1663" /> when he begins to suffer from some type of disease, will be enabled to get a special kind of curative treatment. Otherwise, he will become a burden to himself and to the State. Curative treatment of the kind suggested should, I think, be provided at the earliest possible moment.  It would give a patient a sporting chance of getting restored to health.  It would be a paying proposition for the patient and for the State.  Surely, it would be much better to have a scheme of that kind than to have a poor person hanging on for years, with no hope of getting cured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the capital of the society, its investments and the amount of its income.  The Vote for this service in 1931-32 was £309,917, while this year it is £311,121, an increase of £1,204.  An extraordinary feature of the Vote is that, while in 1931-32, the number of officials in the Department was 198, the number now is 304, so that we find the position to be this, that, contrasting the two periods, 106 more officials are required to administer or spend an extra £1,204.  Whatever the explanation of that may be, it certainly appears to me to be extraordinary business.  If there was any necessity to spend extra money in this Department it could, I think, be more usefully spent in financing some of the schemes referred to, rather than in the employment of over 100 extra officials to administer a small extra sum of money.  The only thing I am sorry for is that Deputy Corry is not here.  If he were he might be able to enlighten me as to why it was necessary to employ this number of extra officials.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, I should like him to deal with this question of extra benefits recommended by the committee of management of the Unified Society.  Will he tell the House why his Department is not bringing forward schemes to make provision for these extra benefits?  The committee of management appears to be satisfied that these extra benefits should be provided. The House would be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary why its wishes in that respect are not being carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The general consensus of opinion throughout the country is&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of it&mdash;that these two benefits &mdash;15/- a week for a sick man and 7/6 a week for total disability&mdash;are inadequate at the present time, and have been for years past.  Because they are inadequate, a very big burden is being thrown on the ratepayers.  In almost every case, when a man is totally disabled, he becomes a burden on the ratepayers.  Quite a large number of people throughout the country are of the opinion that, in that respect, national health insurance is not serving the purpose which it was originally intended to serve.</P>
      <P>A working man&mdash;say, a farm labourer earning 30/- a week&mdash;becomes ill and receives 15/- a week to maintain himself and family.  He may get free medical attention, but must be maintained in his own house and his family must be maintained at the same time. The time is opportune to consider this whole matter of national health insurance and insurance benefit. Something more is needed for the breadwinner who becomes sick.  I do not know whether the national health insurance scheme was originally meant to give a disabled man complete benefit to maintain himself, to get over his illness, and to maintain his family, but everybody who has anything to do with local authorities knows that a man who becomes totally disabled and goes on home assistance at the age of 40 or 50, suffering from chronic rheumatism&mdash; which is especially the case amongst agricultural workers&mdash;may go on until he is 70 years old.  The sum provided is totally inadequate to maintain himself and his family.  The whole question of that insurance and the other insurances mentioned by Deputy Norton should be reconsidered now, if that has not been done already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt generally throughout the <Col N="1665" /> country that some big change is needed.  Whether it can be brought about in a very short time or not I do not know; nor do I know whether it can be done in this time of war, but I am convinced, from my own experience, that a radical change is needed on this whole question of insurance.  I would say very definitely that it is not serving the purpose for which it was intended originally.  Nobody will doubt that the payments are inadequate to maintain a man, his wife and family, when a man is ill&mdash;and no one is getting full benefit unless ill.  There are other cases of workers on higher rates of wages who are even more seriously affected than agricultural workers, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with them in the near future.  We understood some years ago that this whole question was being considered, and we should like to know now what progress has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was instructive to hear Deputy Allen make suggestions from the Government Benches.  He has made an appeal with which I am entirely in agreement.  When we consider the position of a man who falls ill, we know that if he becomes unemployed he will get 15/- from the unemployment exchange, 5/- for his wife and a shilling for each dependent child, but under the Unemployment Insurance Act all he would get would be 15/- a week for himself and nothing for wife or children.  If he is unfortunate enough to remain sick for over six months, instead of an increase in his weekly payments they are reduced by half.  I could give several cases of this kind, especially cases of poor men suffering from rheumatism.  It is most depressing to see young men of 45 or 50 become physical wrecks from rheumatism and receiving 7/6 per week when they have been ill for over six months, their only redress being to fall back on public assistance for a supplementary benefit to make up the meagre amounts they receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is long overdue for recasting the whole social arrangements in connection with workmen's compensation, national health insurance, unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance, <Col N="1666" /> home assistance, the child welfare league, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions. All these purely social insurance schemes should be under one national head.  It would be most interesting to go into the cost of maintaining these various schemes as separate social services.  I hope that the Minister will seriously consider what has been said about recasting the organisation and increasing the benefits of national health insurance. Nobody can claim that it has met the point that it was intended to meet.</P>
    <P>I could give very striking instances of distressing cases to show the necessity for increasing the benefits.  I understand that the Committee of Management of the National Health Insurance Society over 12 months ago asked the Minister for Finance to bring in the necessary legislation to increase these benefits.  From replies here lately there is no indication that that will be done very soon.  Therefore, I wish to support Deputy Allen in this matter, and would be glad to see a statement from the Government Benches that the Minister is taking steps to make the necessary changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the request made by various speakers. It will not require new legislation, in my opinion, for the Government to restore certain benefits which were taken from the people when the societies were amalgamated.  Some of the societies gave dental and optical benefits, and these were withdrawn and have not been restored.  Especially in cases where the societies taken over gave those benefits, the Government should see that the members are not deprived of the benefits which encouraged them to join certain societies.  If it is admitted that those societies are entitled to have dental and optical benefits restored, surely that should be passed on to every insured person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I join with the other speakers in requesting that something more be done to deal with cases of tuberculosis.  I hold that it is very definitely the duty of the National Health Society of the country, when one of its members becomes broken <Col N="1667" /> down with tuberculosis, to provide proper accommodation, indoor treatment, sanatorium and other benefits necessary for restoration to full health. It should not be left to people outside to find that accommodation, but it is the duty of the Government to find it. I will go further and say that it is the duty of the Unified Society, when one of its members breaks down in health&mdash; or when a child of a member breaks down in health&mdash;to find proper hospital, medical and surgical treatment for that person.</P>
    <P>Dublin was shocked a very short time ago on hearing a prominent medical man tell of the case of a woman of this city who carried a baby to five separate hospitals, and was refused at each, and who found the baby dead in her arms on bringing it home.  That shows complete failure on the part of the national health insurance and of the hospitals of the city.  The Government and the public authority allowed that statement to go unchallenged, though I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary's duty to make inquiries within one hour after it was published.</P>

      <P>I went away from the point.  I wished to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, before this society became unified and controlled by the Government, there were societies giving benefits which members are not enjoying now&mdash;dental and optical benefits.  With other members of the House, I appeal to the Government to see that those benefits are restored, and that, where possible, further benefits be given where they would be to the advantage of the people, and which would keep them on the employed list instead of on the unemployed list and receiving the present miserable benefits.</P>

      <P>Seeing that this is one of the largest Estimates that come before this House, dealing with a very large number of men and women in this country, it is rather strange&mdash;particularly in view of the questions which have been put to the Parliamentary Secretary in the House recently&mdash;that he did not consider it necessary or desirable to give any information to the House as to whether the question of additional benefits was under consideration by his Department or not, whether the Department had come to any decision on the questions submitted to them by the committee of the Unified Society, whether the consideration had been concluded in his Department, and whether the matter is really being held up by the Department of Finance.  It is a very big service.  It is, perhaps, one of the most important services that we have in the country dealing with public health. It is dealing very inadequately, to say the least of it, with the health of the very poorest section of the community.  As has been stated by other members of the House, it is, of course, farcical to think of restoring to health a married man with a family on 15/- a week at the present cost of living.  As this Estimate comes before the House year after year, it only goes to show some of us that our fears were only too well-founded when this unification was brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us then expressed our fears that the only effect of the move which was then made would be to deprive great numbers of persons who were insured for national health purposes of very valuable benefits which they were then enjoying.  Those valuable additional benefits were not confined to the big societies.  For a number of years I was connected with a comparatively small society that had a membership of between 2,000 and 3,000.  It was not a select membership.  Its members did not consist of people who were in sheltered occupations but of people in a rural area.  As a result of careful management and close watching of the funds of the society, the members of that society were getting 18/- per week cash benefit.  Maternity and other benefits were correspondingly increased. The society paid five-sixths <Col N="1669" /> of the cost of new dentures, full dental treatment, full optical treatment and full hospital treatment.  Not only that, but if a member was unfortunate enough to lose a limb as a result of disease they provided a free artificial limb where required.  To-day, those unfortunate people are reduced to the position that they are getting the lowest cash benefit allowed by law. That being so, one would have expected from the Parliamentary Secretary a statement as to what the intentions of the Department were in that connection.</P>
    <P>In connection with what I might describe as a huge service like this, affecting some hundreds of thousands of workers throughout this country, I think one is entitled to have a more complete review of its operation over the previous 12 months.  I think we are entitled to be told what is being done, say, in connection with medical certification, whether that position is improving or disimproving, whether the Department is satisfied that things have been tightened up&mdash;and I think very few people who have any practical experience of the working of national health insurance in previous years are satisfied that there was not need for tightening up&mdash;or whether there is greater loosening as far as certification is concerned.  I submit that we should have been told what is the position regarding malingering, whether it has improved or disimproved.  We are asked here to vote a very considerable sum of money.  We are not told what has been done or what is being done or what is going to be done.  In a service like this where, I think it is no exaggeration to say, the lives of so many people are at stake, where there is so much of the human element, I think we are entitled to something more than bald statistics.  I hope, when he comes to reply to this debate, the Parliamentary Secretary will give us a little more information than he gave when he was introducing the Estimate.  In particular, he ought to let us know what is the position at the moment regarding the question of additional benefits, what are the prospects of having additional benefits provided and when he is going to be in a position <Col N="1670" /> to take the necessary steps to have that decision made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intervene in this debate in order to amplify the point made by Deputy Byrne in connection with the most deserving section of our sufferers in this country, the people afflicted with tuberculosis, and to recall to the House that in fact insured persons who were afflicted with tuberculosis did at one time enjoy special benefits administered through what were termed insurance committees. At that time the insured person had special rights of sanatorium and what was then termed demiciliary treatment through the insurance committees which functioned in various areas.  That benefit was withdrawn a considerable time before the societies were amalgamated.  I think that was a very serious loss to a very deserving section of our afflicted people.  There can be little doubt about the fact that in the matter of the treatment and even any reasonable approach to the treatment of tuberculosis in this country we are lagging very sadly indeed.  I believe that in the contemplated scheme for extra benefits for insured persons, special provision in this connection ought to be made.  I do not know whether any provision of that kind is included in the proposals of the society that have been submitted to the Government.  If not, I think they ought to be made and I think there ought to be recognition in this House that the service for national health insurance, instead of being the miserable thing that it is, should be a big measure of social protection to the sick people of this country.  It is very far from being that at the present time.  I say that, as one who has not altered his opinion in any way about the mistake that was made when a monopoly was given to one society in this country for what is termed national health insurance.  I think that was a mistake, and I think that three or four societies in this country, competing with each other as to the manner in which provision could be made for their members, would afford much better results for the insured <Col N="1671" /> people of this country than could be got otherwise.</P>
      <P>I press this point, of special benefits for insured persons afflicted with tuberculosis, on the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.  As a medical man himself, he must have very specialised knowledge of the needs of such people, and he must be aware of the fact that in many cases it is the fate of these people, when they become afflicted with tuberculosis, either to live at home for the short period of their lives, with the consequent danger of infecting other members of the family, or to go to the local poor law institution, or some other institution of the kind, not much better in some cases, for the purpose of ending their days.</P>
      <P>A great reform and a great change and improvement in the health of such people could be brought about, I think, through the agency of the national health insurance if it were developed on broad lines, and I see no reason why provision could not be made, in special circumstances and, of course, in normal times, to send people, who would need special treatment, out of this country to places where they could get that treatment, as a right inherent in their membership of the National Health Insurance Society and in return for the contributions paid by their employers, themselves and the State.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give us some information on this matter, and that he will be in a position to give some definite information to the House as to when insured persons in this country may expect some advance in the direction that has been asked for by the Deputies who have addressed themselves to this question here this evening.</P>

      <P>I am not sheltering in that way at all, but I do not see how we can have a detailed debate here on this Vote on matters that would involve new legislation. However, seeing that no other aspect of the Vote has been adverted to by the speakers, in a very general way, I shall deal with the one question that everybody appears to be concerned about, and that is the question of the possibility of securing additional benefits for the insured persons.  But let me say this at the outset: that, personally, I should be very happy if, to-morrow, the money could be found to finance full medical benefits for all our insured population and their dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, never mind.  I did not interrupt anybody who was speaking, and perhaps the Deputy would be good enough not to interrupt me. Perhaps, if it rested solely with me, I would find the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>But, at any rate, if additional benefits are to be provided&mdash; medical benefits, dental benefits, optical benefits, hospital benefits, or any other benefits&mdash;the money must be found wherewith to finance these additional benefits.  How can it be found? It could be found by increasing the contributions, by increasing the State grant; or possibly the money could be found&mdash;a limited amount anyhow&mdash;by radically altering the whole foundations of our scheme and the method of assessment.  Deputy Norton says that we are slothful&mdash;let me see if I have got his actual words here&mdash;and &ldquo;indifferent towards remedying that position.&rdquo; Now, that is scarcely fair.  We are not not as bad as that.  As far back as January, 1939, we referred this matter, of altering the basis of valuation, <Col N="1673" /> to the actuary for a special report. Now, it is not a matter into which to rush blindly.  We have to ensure that, if we make a radical departure in regard to the structure of national health insurance, the finances of our scheme are reasonably sound, and we have to have actuarial guidance and advice in that matter.  It is easy enough to submit schemes; there is no difficulty whatever in drafting attractive schemes of additional benefits for insured persons, but I think every Deputy will agree that it is of vital and fundamental importance that the financial basis of such schemes should be sound so that we should not find ourselves in the position in the future of having to withdraw some benefit that was hastily provided.</P>
      <P>I have been questioned on this matter from time to time during the past 12 months, as to when we were going to announce a decision in regard to policy.  I have not been in a position to give a definite announcement, and I am not in a position to give a definite announcement to-day.  The actuarial advice we have sought on this particular aspect of health insurance was only received in my Department on the 31st March last.  It is a big, comprehensive and complicated document. It will have to be studied, and studied carefully, before any decision can be come to, but the Department were not idle since 1939, since we asked the actuary to give us a special report on this matter.  In so far as the staff of the Department could investigate the position and have tentative proposals ready for operation, the Department have given the position very full examination, but their tentative conclusions must now be related to the advice that is tendered by the actuary, and what the ultimate decision will be I cannot tell until that further examination, in the light of the actuary's report received on the 31st March last, is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Linehan raised a question about the increased cost of staff in recent years.  There is no denying that the cost of administration under this Vote has been increased, but Deputy Linehan did not advert to the fact that <Col N="1674" /> the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act was not operating during the time which he took for the purpose of comparison.  The enactment of the widows' and orphans' pensions legislation was responsible largely for the increase.  Deputy Morrissey and other Deputies have referred to the effect of unification.  It is true to say that, by unification, certain societies that were flourishing financially prior to unification, have had to withdraw from their members, by reason of unification, additional benefits that their members previously enjoyed, but it is equally true to say that had the resources of all the insurance societies not been pooled, many societies would not have been in a position to give the statutory benefits to their members. There it is.  The people who, by unification, have, at any rate, secured the statutory benefits have gained to that extent.  The people who previously were in receipt of additional benefits now lose to that extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of certification Deputy Morrissey is concerned, but I can only say that certification is less unsatisfactory than it was previously. I do not think that what is called lax certification is entirely the fault of the medical certifiers.  Medical certifiers are mainly generously disposed, kind-hearted men, and they give claimants to national health insurance benefit the benefit of any doubt that may exist, but it seems to me that the drain on national health insurance benefit would be substantially less if the employment position were better. If a man is unemployed and has a minor ailment, and if he goes along to his doctor and asks for a medical certificate, that man is not necessarily <Col N="1675" /> malingering at all.  His ailment would be a substantially less burden to him if, in fact, employment were available to him at a good rate of wages.  I am giving my own personal opinion.  It may not be sound, but I have a fair share of practical knowledge of this problem inasmuch as I was medical certifier in my time in fairly populous areas.  The medical certifier, faced with such a dilemma, may not be sure that the patient has not the pains and the aches that he describes, but he is sure that the man is in need and he probably says to himself, in some instances: &ldquo;This man must be carried by some of our social services, and seeing that I have a doubt, I shall give him the benefit of that doubt.&rdquo;  I find it hard to criticise harshly a man who certifies in that way.  I do not think that Deputy Morrissey would harshly criticise him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come across such gross carelessness and irresponsibility, we are inclined to deal rather drastically with it.  I have here a return showing the number of fines that have been imposed within the last 12 months.  In one case the fine has been £10, in three cases £5, in five cases £3, in one case £2 and in 36 cases the certifier was warned.  That may seem a big number of cases but, as compared with the number of certificates issued, it is a comparatively small number.  Men who are found to <Col N="1676" /> be grossly careless in certification will certainly be drastically dealt with, but I do think that, if economic circumstances were better, our insurance position would rapidly improve.</P>
      <P>I do not think any other point was raised.  We have now the actuary's report on the financial structure.  We are examining that and relating it to the ideas we had before being furnished with his expert advice.  As soon as it is possible to give it full examination, we shall determine what the future policy will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be true to say they can, with this qualification.  If under the existing financial scheme they had a surplus of funds, that surplus could be devoted to providing additional cash for benefits but, in fact, under the existing financial scheme they are in deficit, substantially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point to which I am replying.  The point raised by Deputy Allen is whether in fact the society can in present circumstances pay additional benefits.  In present circumstances they cannot, because under the actuarial basis at present operating, the society is in deficit, but if the basis of assessment were altered, money would then be available for the financing of additional benefits.  That is the question that is being examined and it is on that question that a specific report has been received from the actuary.</P>

      <P>I cannot.  Deputy Norton will appreciate that it is not possible to give any approximate date on which a decision on a question of such magnitude can be reached. Deputy Norton was not in the House when I was speaking earlier.  This question has been under consideration for a considerable time.  It was in <Col N="1677" /> January, 1939, that we asked the actuary to give us a report on this particular matter.  The actuary was not able to report to us until the 31st March last.  We certainly would have got a report from the actuary much sooner were it not for the war position and the fact that he was engaged in other duties.  We have not an actuary of our own.  He was engaged on other matters arising out of the war position. We, however, got his report on the 31st March last and we have to examine it carefully before we come to any decision.  How long it will take I do not know, but I can assure the Deputy that we are quite anxious to reach a decision on this matter and that there will be no delay that can possibly be avoided.</P>

      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £300,000, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for payment to the Pensions Investment Account (Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1940 (No. 29 of 1935, Section 42 (2); No. 11 of 1937, Section 21; and No. 33 of 1940) ).</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum now asked for is to complete the annual amount of £450,000 in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1942.  The Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts provide that in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1938, and of each of the next seven succeeding years, there shall be paid into the Pensions Investment Account out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas the annual sum of £450,000, and thereafter such sums as the Oireachtas may determine.  The finance of the scheme is based on the assumption that in the early years the income to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund would be more than sufficient to meet the pension payments, but that in the later years this position <Col N="1679" /> would be reversed and that a point would be reached when the normal income to the fund would be insufficient to meet the outgoings.  For this reason, it was considered prudent to arrange that the State subvention required to supplement the contributions of employers and employed persons should be distributed over a period of years in equal annual instalments, in order to avoid undesirable increases annually in the amounts required to be voted by the Oireachtas. The excess income in the earlier years is invested, and held to make good the deficiency in income which will emerge in later years.</P>
      <P>The total number of claims for contributory and non-contributory pensions which have been received is 55,955. Out of this number, pensions have been awarded in 48,151 cases, pensions were refused in 5,951 cases, claims were withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn in 935 cases and there are 918 claims under consideration.  13,320 claims for contributory pensions have been received. Many of these claims were made in respect of persons who were not insured under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, and after being formally rejected under the contributory provisions they were transferred to the non-contributory class.  In addition, there was a number of cases where the qualifying conditions for the payment of a contributory pension were not satisfied, and these also were treated as claims to non-contributory pensions. The total number of cases transferred from the contributory to the non-contributory class was 6,507.  Out of the remaining 6,813 cases contributory pensions were awarded in 6,382 cases and there are 385 cases under consideration. Forty-six claims were withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>42,635 claims for non-contributory pensions have been received, to which should be added the 6,507 claims for contributory pensions which were either not properly within the contributory class, or which failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the grant of contributory pensions.  Out of these 49,142 cases, non-contributory pensions have been awarded in 41,769 cases; pensions <Col N="1680" /> were refused in 5,951 cases, 889 claims were withdrawn or deemed withdrawn, and there are 533 claims under examination.  Appeals to referees against decision that pensions were not payable or were payable at reduced rates have been received in 8,316 cases.  The appeals have been decided in 8,133 cases and there are still 183 cases awaiting decision.</P>
    <P>There were in course of payment at the end of February, 1941, 5,960 contributory pensions at a weekly cost of £4,160 13s. 6d., and 28,733 non-contributory pensions at a weekly cost of £8,552 16s., a total of 34,693 pensions amounting to £12,713 9s. 6d. per week.  These represent payments in respect of 33,446 widows, 21,645 dependent children of widows, and 1,772 orphans.  The corresponding figures at the end of February, 1940, were 4,669 contributory pensions at a weekly cost of £3,295 5s., and 29,199 non-contributory pensions at a weekly cost of £8,720 11s. 6d., a total of 33,868 pensions amounting to £12,015 16s. 6d. per week in respect of 32,727 widows, 21,320 dependent children of widows, and 1,624 orphans.  In the 12 months ended 28th February, 1941, the number of beneficiaries has increased by 1,192 or approximately 2.14 per cent. and the weekly payments by £697 13s. per week or approximately 5.8 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move the motion: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration&rdquo;, standing in the names of Deputies Norton and Keyes.  I wish to say at the outset that this question of making some provision for the widows and orphans is one that has agitated this Party since the establishment of the State.  We tried by every persuasive means, inside the House and outside the House, to get some kind of provision made.  Finally, in 1934 I think it was, we succeeded in doing so.  The amounts of pension payments that were then fixed are still the same.  The increase which has since taken place in the cost of living and the consequent decrease in the purchasing power of the amount of pension awarded is something which I should like to stress. Every member of the House has from <Col N="1681" /> time to time had the experience of witnessing the tragedy caused by the loss of the head of the family, the bread-winner, and the helplessness of those left behind, the widow and orphans.  In many cases that tragedy is increased by the fact that those left behind are practically in destitution. There are various reasons for that.  In some cases there are large families and no provision could be made for the future.  There are other cases, and I think in the greater number of them, especially within recent years, the reason for that want of provision was the unemployment of the head of the family while he was alive.</P>
      <P>I must say that the administration of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, from my experience of it at the head office, is very sympathetic.  I should like to pay that tribute to the officials there.  I have not the same to say with regard to the investigation of claims down the country.  There is a pretty rigorous means test imposed in connection with the paying out of State money under various social services at the present time, but I think the means test in respect to widows and orphans is enforced in even a more rigorous fashion.  I, and I am sure other Deputies, have had experience of the bullying attitude adopted by some investigation officers.  I should like to emphasise that the investigation of means by those officers should be carried out in a humane manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of cases, when closely investigated by the officers, are found to be genuine.  I suggest that the different officers should not approach the investigation of claims with a suspicious mind, with the feeling that there is something not being disclosed, and that, by adopting a kind of inquisitorial manner, they will bring it to light.  I do not think that the Minister or the Department would stand for that sort of thing.  It is one of the most important aspects in connection with the administration of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, because it involves a lot of hardship on unfortunate people.  Very often there is delay occasioned before payment is made, and that has caused much hardship to <Col N="1682" /> people who are sadly in need of financial assistance.  In many cases it is an undue delay, and the widows and orphans have to suffer; they must accept the charity of friends or find some other means of living until they get the meagre amount that is allowed to them.  The pensions which are granted to widows and orphans on the non-contributory side are so meagre that I believe I would be quite right in describing them as scandalous.  The widows on the non-contributory side form the bigger proportion of those relieved under this scheme.  I could not catch very clearly the figures mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, but I gathered that 5,960 cases came under the contributory heading, and about 28,733 cases under the non-contributory heading.  The 28,733 persons assisted under this scheme receive 5/- a week. What any woman, even the most careful and saving person, could do at the present time on 5/- a week is a mystery to me.  I may be told that the total amount is very large, and that this is only one of several social services.</P>
    <P>I think the essence of any social service should be the humane outlook of those administering it.  A social service should be such as to maintain the recipient, as was laid down in some definition or other, in some kind of frugal comfort.  It cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be contended that 5/- a week is sufficient to give frugal comfort to a widow.  I have to complain of the reluctance of the Government to increase the amount allotted under the non-contributory scheme.  To them such a suggestion would seem to be distasteful.  In my opinion, the amount allotted should bear some relation to the cost of living. I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary could disagree with that argument. There is no relation between the 5/- a week allowed to a widow and what it would cost to keep her in a public institution, even in a jail, or any other institution subsidised by the State.  The amounts allowed under the contributory scheme, which are something better than those allowed under the non-contributory scheme, are still not sufficient to meet the needs of a widow and her family.  In most cases, what is granted has to be supplemented from <Col N="1683" /> home assistance funds.  I have already complained about that way of doing business.  If the State takes on itself the responsibility of providing for social services, the provision should at least be adequate, and not have to be supplemented from other sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the need in this case is so great that an Emergency Powers Order should be availed of.  Emergency powers have been utilised for far less worthy objects, and probably objects of which many Deputies would not approve.  For these reasons I invite a frank answer from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Vote is one that is very dear to us on this side of the House and, in saying that, I do not wish to cast any reflection on Deputies in other Parties.  As far back as 1929 we spent some hours discussing this Estimate and, if I remember aright, the Parliamentary Secretary, who is now in charge of this Estimate, was present for part of the debate.  We have seen this scheme in operation, and even if it has defects, the fact that the framework has been provided should be an incentive for an examination, to see how far we can make it worthy of the ideals that animated us when it was discussed originally.  We are all ready, both here and elsewhere, to air our grievances, and perhaps sometimes we take more than passing pleasure in criticising a Department <Col N="1684" /> that we consider has been harsh or slothful in its administration, but it is a very special pleasure to me, particularly, to say that I regard this Department in its administration as being very efficiently run.  Information can be got quickly, one always gets a generous measure of courtesy, and receives prompt replies to correspondence. That makes relations with the Department very pleasant.  If we hear of cases that are unsympathetically approached, then there are other instances where that rather harsh feature is modified very considerably by the sympathetic approach of other officials.  I am quite sure Deputy Hurley has had the experience that others have had, that the final word of the referees in the matter of appeals lodged by claimants is on the whole fair and satisfactory.  Where there is some measure of doubt as to the means or alleged means in many cases of persons who appeal, I can say that the benefit of the doubt is always given to the claimants.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to be able to say that, and to pay my tribute to what I regard as a Department that is run in a very efficient manner.  I take this opportunity to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the question of increased contributions for widows' and orphans' pensions might be examined, and to state that I am prepared to stand for an increase of contributions for the purpose of supplementing the allowances paid to persons now in receipt of non-contributory pensions. In making that suggestion I feel that it is incumbent to suggest ways and means.  I am prepared to take personal responsibility for suggesting increased contributions to meet what I think is a very worthy object and one that should receive early consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that an opportunity might present itself for doing that by bringing classes into this type of insurance not yet within the limitations of income.  The scheme might be varied to permit of a large number of extra people being brought in to assist the fund which would to some extent be used for the object I mention.  I offer that suggestion to the Parliaments <Col N="1685" /> mentary Secretary because, while it is quite easy to make a case for the more liberal treatment of widows the question of ways and means will always arise.  It will enable the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the matter and to bring it to the attention of the Department concerned, with a view to letting the House have the benefit of its views, if not when concluding on this Estimate, at some later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without asking for legislation or amending the Act I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that what is really wanted is an examination as to how the scheme is operating.  I think he will admit the anomalies which exist between contributory and non-contributory pensions, which are entirely out of proportion. Take, as an example, that the widow of an insured contributor gets a higher rate of benefit, possibly rightly, so that it could be regarded there as a sort of life insurance.  Then take the position where a labourer who was contributing dies, and whose widow is the owner of a small farm in her own right. She was entitled to the pension under the contributory scheme but her neighbour, the widow of a shoemaker, of a carpenter or a workman, who was his own master and had his own little business, who left a family badly off, would not be entitled without an amendment of the Act.  As the scheme has now been in operation for some years there should be an examination of its working to see how it affects different classes of people.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have it investigated to see what benefits have accrued to the people I refer to.  If a person who is in possession of a small farm in her own right can draw the maximum amount, while the widow of a tradesman who left a family does not benefit under the Act obviously a definite hardship arises.  I know that one man paid into the fund, and that the other did not, but should that be the test for the granting of a widow's and orphan's pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object was to relieve destitution and the operation of the non-contributory scheme is not doing anything towards that end.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree <Col N="1686" /> that if the whole question was examined a scheme could be arranged under which it would be possible to have a better balanced fund than is the case at present.  I do not think it would be any hardship, or that there would be any great strain on the revenue, if a little more was paid to those who were not contributing to the fund.  If the object was to give widows some chance of rearing young families and relieving destitution, the whole question should be re-examined in the light of what is now happening. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that there is a case for paying non-contributory pensions at the same rate as is paid under the contributory scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, most of the discussion has been related to the desirability of amending the law.  The rates of contribution are fixed by law and cannot be altered by administrative action.  I was glad to hear Deputies who took part in the debate paying tribute to the sympathetic manner in which the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts are administered.  It is refreshing to hear that type of debate, and I believe there is no Department of State more deserving of such a tribute than the national health insurance and widows' and orphans' pensions section of local government.  As Deputy Murphy will remember, I have been interested in this question of widows' and orphans' pensions for a very long period, and, consequently, I am perhaps a little more critical of the administration of these social services than one who might not have been so intimately concerned with it over a long period.  I must say that I have always found, in my own relationship with them, the widows' and orphans' pensions and national health insurance sections most sympathetic to the claimants. Complaint was made here to-day about the bullying attitude of certain investigation officers.  I am rather surprised to hear that and I believe it is not general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are apparently isolated incidents of these investigation <Col N="1687" /> officers failing to rise to the full height of their responsibility.  It is very regrettable, but I remind Deputies that we in our Department have no control whatever over the investigation officers.  If, however, complaints on the lines mentioned, of a bullying attitude on the part of investigation officers, are forwarded to our Department, we will certainly take steps to ensure that the responsible Department will have them fully investigated. It would be an intolerable state of affairs that any servant of the State should bully these unfortunate people in the manner which has been described. I do not think that such an officer, if the complaint were brought home to him, would be retained in the service of the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Linehan refers to the anomalies such as that of the widow of an insured person who appears to get away with a high pension, while her neighbour, in almost similar circumstances, gets only a 5/- pension.  I think the soundness of that can scarcely be questioned.  If the bread-winner contributed out of his earnings during his life to making provision for his widow and children in the event of his death, I think that widow is entitled to a higher degree of protection than the State should be called upon to afford to people who made no such provision.  In the case of the non-contributory pensions, the State, of course, bears the whole cost.  It is nice to advocate an increase, and everybody, I am sure, will agree that 5/- per week in rural Ireland as a non-contributory pension is a very small amount.  We would all like to see it much higher, but it becomes a question of the amount of money that can be made available for this purpose, and, in that regard, it is well to remember that it is only within comparatively recent years that even 5/- a week has been made available, and it is, at any rate, substantially better than if nothing at all were made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the money for increases can be found at present.  In the present emergency, with the huge and exceptional impositions in the way of taxation arising out of the emergency, I do not think we could at all <Col N="1688" /> contemplate a substantial increase in the benefits under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.  If we do it in the case of widows and orphans, we would logically have to follow the same line of reasoning in relation to most of our social services.  If we were to increase unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, national health insurance, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and home assistance, and to keep them all in step, it certainly would mean an enormous additional burden on the taxpayers.  Whether that enormous burden ought to be undertaken in normal times is a question that might well be debated, but I do think that, in present circumstances, it could not be contemplated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy makes the rather novel suggestion that in order to increase the amount available for non-contributory pensions, we might increase the contributions of the contributory class.  I confess that it is a solution to which I have never given any thought.  It is a rather novel idea, but, at first glance, I should say that the people who would be called upon to make the contribution would scarcely take very kindly to the scheme.  They and their representatives generally claim that the benefits available to their own dependents are scarcely sufficient.  If they were called on to give an increased contribution, I should say that they would probably put forward a demand for an increase in the benefits available to them under the Acts, but I would be reluctant to believe that they would come forward with any enthusiasm to pay increased contributions in order to provide additional pensions for the non-contributory class.  However, Deputy Murphy is probably in more intimate touch with that particular section at the moment than I am.  It raises an interesting line of thought, at any rate, which can be pursued until we find what degree of encouragement might be got in the finding of a solution along those lines. I should be surprised if we found a great volume of support for such a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Parliamentary Secretary's point that a <Col N="1689" /> person who pays contributions is providing for his widow and children, but he will agree that there are thousands of people in the country in the position to which I have referred, that is, small tradesmen who are their own employers.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary visualise a scheme whereby these people would be entitled to stamp national health insurance cards and so give them an opportunity of ensuring something for their dependents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The main purpose of the Bill is to adjust certain matters relating to the export of butter and the collection of fees which have been affected by the present emergency.  As the introduction of the Bill for that purpose became necessary, a few amendments were included which were awaiting an opportunity of this kind.  As the <Col N="1690" /> House is no doubt aware, at the beginning of the war the British Ministry of Food decided that it would purchase certain commodities, including creamery butter, only through a central organisation on this side.  We were, therefore, faced with the necessity for setting up such an organisation for the export of creamery butter. There was in being at the time the Butter Marketing Committee, which I had constituted under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1935.  It had been in existence for some years.  This committee supervised, and advised on, the export of butter, but it did not actually export butter itself. It confined its activities largely to putting purchasers on the other side in touch with sellers on this side and seeing that prices were maintained&mdash;that there was no cutting of prices as between one creamery and another. This committee was, in the changed circumstances, the obvious body to undertake the selling of our butter as the members had the necessary experience, and there was a trained staff to deal with the matter.  This, which was forced on us by circumstances, involved three substantial consequences:&mdash;(1) butter had to be exported by a body which, legally, was not competent to do so under the Dairy Produce Act; (2) it did away, to a certain extent, with my powers of control of the making of butter, and (3) it took from me the right to collect the small fee payable on export of butter which goes to meet part of the general expenses of the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.  By the main Act, export of creamery butter is confined to persons registered in certain of the registers kept under that Act.  It would be possible for the committee to secure registration, but that would have involved a certain amount of unnecessary expenditure in the way of setting up premises, providing equipment and so forth.  It was not thought advisable to do this because it would only solve one of our difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another power vested in the Minister for Agriculture under the main Act was that of controlling the quality of creamery butter.  That extended only to creamery butter exported from the premises registered.  Under the new <Col N="1691" /> circumstances, neither my inspectors nor myself had, technically, any right to insist on a standard for export, though I may say that the standard was not reduced in any way.  To secure that no depreciation in the quality of creamery butter takes place, it is necessary to amend the Act to provide that butter sold to an approved marketing organisation, such as that set up, must comply with the same regulations as to quality, packing, etc., as have hitherto applied in the case of butter for export.  Under the 1924 Act, a fee was collected off butter exported by registered creameries to meet part of the expenses of the administration of that Act.  The fee was 4d. per cwt., and, in a normal year, the amount collected amounted to about £6,000.  As I have explained, creamery butter is not now exported by the creameries and we cannot, therefore, legally collect any fee. Neither can we collect the fee off the Butter Marketing Committee, because they are not a registered body under the 1924 Act.  While it would be possible to have this committee registered and to collect the money in that way, that would not meet the purpose of the framers of the 1924 Act, which was to collect the levy off the people who were getting the benefit of the Act.</P>
    <P>I had, therefore, to consider an alternative method of securing contributions from the dairying industry towards the cost of administering the Acts.  When the main Act was passed 17 years ago, a high proportion of creamery butter was exported.  In fact, the greater part of our creamery butter was exported.  In recent years, though the production of creamery butter is higher now than it was in 1924, the amount exported is less than half.  It is, approximately, one-third of the creamery butter produced.  To continue the old system would be unfair because the one-third who are exporting creamery butter would have to pay the part of the cost represented by the levy while those selling on the home market would go free.  It is considered more equitable, therefore, to put a fee on all creamery butter produced, whether sold at home or exported.  It <Col N="1692" /> is provided in this Bill that the fee will be 2d. instead of 4d. per cwt.  This will bring in slightly more than was brought in under the original Act. Under the original Act, we collected about £6,000.  The amount which will be collected under this system will be about £6,250, assuming a production of creamery butter of 750,000 cwts.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being availed of to take power to provide that, in future, managers of cream-separating stations and assistant managers of central creameries will be properly qualified.  Under the 1924 Act, it was laid down that future appointments of managers of central creameries would be confined to those properly qualified, but no provision was made for assistant managers of central creameries or for managers of auxiliary creameries.  We have now in the country many more men qualified than were available at that time, and it is not unreasonable, I think, to put in a provision requiring committees in future to appoint qualified men, if available, to manage auxiliary creameries. There is, however, a loophole in the Bill.  A person shall be regarded as qualified if he has satisfied the Minister that he is, in fact, capable of discharging the duties of manager or if he possesses a certificate issued by the Minister that he is so qualified.</P>
    <P>That provision will be necessary for some time.  There are, as Deputies are aware, various grades of auxiliary creameries.  Some auxiliary creameries have an intake of milk from 1,000 to 5,000 gallons.  It might be quite reasonable to expect that a qualified man would be appointed as manager of a large auxiliary or as assistant manager of a large creamery, but it might be unreasonable to insist that a qualified man be appointed to a small auxiliary creamery in a remote area.  This provision is being put in to give some latitude of administration in this connection.  I should like to say that managers of auxiliary creameries already appointed or assistant managers of central creameries will not, in the main, be interfered with.  If they are competent, as I presume they are, to carry on their duties they will continue to do so.  The same thing applied <Col N="1693" /> under the 1924 Act.  Even although managers of central creameries at that time held no diplomas or qualifications, they were permitted to continue in the positions which they held.  It was only in the case of new appointments that it was insisted that a qualified man should be appointed.  There are 420 separating stations in this country.  I think it can be claimed that the managers of these stations are not all highly qualified.  But, over the years, as vacancies occur, if we get a better type of man appointed in these separating stations we expect to have a more efficient system as a result.  It would be naturally of great benefit to the industry if we could get that done.</P>

It may be outside the scope of the Bill, but I merely take the opportunity, as this is a Dairy Produce (Amendment) Bill, to ask the Minister whether he will, even at this stage, consider some scheme which will benefit both the people who are sending milk to the creameries, the people in the country who badly want milk, and the people who will be very short of essential foodstuffs owing to the tea shortage, and make some arrangement by which milk will be available in every city and town in the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to see competent managers, not only in the central creameries, but in the branch creameries.  I know, however, of cases of very competent men who have graduated from a central creamery and have gone through as efficient a course there as they would in a college. Surely the Minister will not compel a society to appoint another manager in such a case, but will allow them to promote a man like that who is thoroughly competent, and who has graduated in the creamery, and knows his business from A to Z.  I think he should give an option to the creamery society to promote such a man to the position of branch creamery manager, when the society are satisfied that he is worthy of promotion.  I hope the Minister will look into that point, and see that that power will not be taken from the societies.</P>

      <P>This Bill makes provision for appointing managers with degrees in dairy science.  I wonder whether the Minister would consider that, in addition to a degree in dairy science, these managers should be trained in commerce. I believe that when the future of a very big industry is placed in their hands, they should have a degree in commerce as well as a degree in dairy science.  I think that the failure of many co-operative undertakings in the <Col N="1695" /> past was due to lack of business training on the part of managers.  I think that is generally recognised in connection with failures in the past.  Therefore, I think that it would be a good thing if future managers of creameries had a degree in commerce, and also if they had experience in commercial matters.  That would be most important for the future of the dairying industry, and of the agricultural industry in general, and I hope that the Minister will give consideration to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  With regard to that point, since I took up this position I think I can say from examining the circumstances surrounding the failure of any creamery that the failure was usually due to lack of interest on the part of the committee and to the manager realising that the committee were not taking a proper interest and doing things on his own, and probably taking more out of the till in very many cases than he should.</P>
      <P>That is very often, I think, the cause of the failure.  Of course, it is not so in all cases, because no doubt some creameries, where there were honest managers and good committees, failed owing to the circumstances being against them with regard to supply, etc.  These graduates get a certain amount of commercial training.  They get a good training in the book-keeping part of the business, and they are able to look after the office very well.  They do get a certain amount of training, I believe, in marketing, but that may not amount to very much.  In present conditions, however, the marketing is done for the creamery managers.</P>

With regard to Deputy O'Donovan's point, I do not think that any reasonable official in the Department, or any reasonable Minister, if such a thing is possible, will prevent a man from getting some promotion anyway.  I think the way this will operate for some time to come is that, where there is a large auxiliary, or where there is a very big creamery and an assistant manager is being appointed, the Minister will try to prevail on the committee to appoint a qualified man.  But, in the case of an appointment to a small auxiliary, he probably will not insist on it.  Even within the organisation itself, if a vacancy occurs, say, in a large auxiliary, and there is a man, known to be competent both by the Department's inspectors and the committee managing a smaller auxiliary, I am sure there will be no objection to promoting him.  In any case, there would not be sufficient qualified men to fill the positions in all the auxiliaries, and it will be always necessary to allow men without diplomas to be appointed. As to the point raised by Deputy Linehan, although it is out of order, I can assure the Deputy that it is a matter that the Government has very seriously under consideration at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Butter Marketing Committee, which I referred to on the previous Bill, has been in existence for several years, but was not itself as a buyer or seller of butter.  Its main functions were to regulate the exports to Great Britain so as to avoid a surplus arising in any importing centre, and to assist creameries which found difficulty in getting a market.  I have already referred to the fact that the British Minister of Food required a central organisation here for the export of creamery butter, and that this particular committee&mdash;the Butter Marketing Committee&mdash;was given charge of the export of butter.  So long as the activities of this committee were merely regulatory and advisory, its financial requirements were comparatively trifling.  It only had two or three of a staff.  There was no other financial requirement.  The total expenditure by that committee, as well as I can remember, was only a matter of £2,000 a year, but, when it became the sole buyer of creamery butter for export, its financial needs increased vastly, and as it <Col N="1698" /> will continue during the coming season as the sole buyer and exporter of butter and cheese, it becomes essential that its finances should be placed on a proper footing.  Since it has handled, and will continue to handle, very substantial quantities of these products in the ordinary way of business, it will require adequate financial resources.</P>
      <P>I propose, therefore, to take power in the Bill to enable me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to guarantee, up to a maximum of £500,000, the repayment of sums borrowed by way of overdraft, or otherwise, by the committee.  The committee was able to arrange with its bank to give it an overdraft to pay for butter before it got paid itself.  The bank would, naturally, like some guarantee when dealing with a collection of individuals, and the Government would be required to give a guarantee for these overdrafts.  Power is also being taken to compel the committee to keep proper accounts and for their auditing and certification by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
      <P>I had power under the 1935 Act&mdash;the Stabilisation Act&mdash;to pay the expenses of the committee in so far as they arose from butter marketing.  There was a section in that Act which gave the Minister power to set up a central marketing organisation for butter. There was also power to pay the expenses of the committee, but when it became necessary for this committee to deal with cheese, as well as butter, there was no power in the 1925 Act to pay the expenses of the committee in so far as they arose out of dealing with cheese.  The expenses are trifling, but as they have been paid since the 1st October, 1939, I am asking the Dáil for authority to take this power retrospectively&mdash;that is, as from the 1st October, 1939&mdash;to enable me to pay any expenses that may have been incurred in the marketing of cheese.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total expenses of the committee, as far as administration goes, amount to about £150 a week.  I do not know if we ever segregated the <Col N="1699" /> expenses of cheese because the same people were dealing with both butter and cheese.  With regard to the levies, some changes are being made, principally administrative changes.  There is a general power to impose a levy on stocks of butter in the hands of registered proprietors and butter traders on an appointed day.  As the law stands, this levy applies no matter how small the quantity.  It is administratively impossible to ascertain the stocks in the hands of several thousands of small retailers on the day on which a levy becomes operative, and, in fact, the levy was not collected from those small retailers.  Everyone will agree that in principle, it is wrong to have an Act that is not being enforced.  I am proposing that the section should be repealed and replaced by a provision excluding stocks not exceeding 3 cwts. from any levy which may be imposed on stocks.  Power to require the making of suitable returns by traders is included in the Bill.  As the Principal Act stands, a levy can only be made on the first day of the month.  Sometimes that has been found to be inconvenient for all concerned.  An amendment has been made in this Bill so that the levy may be imposed at any time, whether on the first day of the month or otherwise. As the law stands, a levy may be imposed on any purchased butter, but, strange to say, if a creamery holds butter which it has not made itself but has purchased from another person, a levy could not be imposed on it.  That, of course, was entirely inequitable, and is being made right in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes, as I have said, it was found inconvenient to do that on the first day of the month. Another point that we are trying to make right concerns butter that is held by a person, and that is intended for export.  Up to this, a levy on that butter was collected but recouped when the butter was exported.  In this Bill we are providing that we need not necessarily collect a levy on butter <Col N="1700" /> intended for export, and which is subsequently exported.</P>
      <P>Another point concerns butter held in cold storage.  Under the existing legislation, a levy must be collected on butter in cold storage.  That might amount to a substantial sum, and might be payable by the person who owned the butter, even though he would not be taking the butter out of cold storage for sale for several months.  We are providing in this Bill that the levy will not be collectible until the butter is being taken out of cold storage.  Within seven days from that date the levy will be payable. These, I think, cover the changes proposed with regard to the levy.  They are largely academic points because there is not the slightest chance, I think, that there will not be any levy collected on butter this year.  It will be the other way around because, with the prices prevailing for butter on the home market and so on, there will be no levy collectible, as far as I can see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, although rather long to read, is largely innocuous.  The majority of its provisions other than the mere drafting provisions have been discussed with the milk boards and have been substantially agreed upon.  There are a number of provisions for which I myself am responsible, apart from the discussion with the boards.  These are designed to meet the difficulties which might arise if, through a combination of suppliers, distributors or carriers, an attempt were made to hold up supplies. Before dealing with the provisions of this Bill I would like to refer to the working of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act of 1936.  It can be said that the Act has, undoubtedly, in the main, achieved the purposes for which it was passed.  It has secured the producer to a large extent against exploitation by the distributors, and has introduced a high degree of regularisation in the milk business which has been a benefit not only to producers but also to traders and to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been represented to me that during the flush season&mdash;that is, in the late spring and early summer&mdash;country producers do not get the full prescribed price.  Those producers have suggested certain measures by which this difficulty might be overcome, but, as I will explain later, I am not in a position to accept their proposals.  The milk producers have the remedy in their own hands and there seems little reason why, with co-operation, payment of the full price could not be secured to producers.  If producers do not stand up for the fixed price they must accept their share of responsibility for not getting it.  The Bill is designed to improve the existing machinery under the existing Act.  It makes provision for the winding up of affairs of milk boards, limitation of supplies of milk to sale areas by <Col N="1702" /> creameries, duration of contracts, and other matters.</P>
    <P>The first point is with regard to the winding up of a milk board and arises from the possibility that a supply may be held up.  Circumstances may arise which may render the continued existence of a milk board undesirable or impracticable and, in fact, it would be necessary to dispose of its assets and discharge its liabilities.  If, for instance, the milk board felt that things were better without it, legally we could not wind it up.  If, on the other hand, I were to decide that things would be better without it, there is no provision for winding it up. There is no provision for this contingency in the Principal Act.  The question arises then what to do, after winding up a board and discharging its liabilities, with any surplus that may remain.  It would be quite impracticable to try to return that to the people who paid the levies and so on, and I think it would be impossible to make any sort of dividend payment to those concerned, as it would be comparatively small.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Act, therefore, that the Minister for Agriculture, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, will devote those funds to the benefit of agriculture or rural industries in the areas concerned.  I think that is the best suggestion that could be made under the circumstances. Arising out of the stoppage of milk to Dublin in November, 1939, an undertaking was given that creameries which complied with requisitions for milk at that time would be guaranteed a place in the Dublin market if they wished to continue when the strike was over.  Only a few of the creameries desire to remain.  They have, of course, to comply with the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935, but those few creameries that desire to remain must get legal sanction under this Bill.  They will be limited in the quantity that they can supply roughly to the average which they supplied during the days of that period.  The position of producers in the Dublin area will not be affected to any great extent by allowing these creameries in.  As a matter of fact, with the exception of a few months in <Col N="1703" /> the late spring and early summer the farmer-producers in the Dublin area are not able to keep up a supply to the City of Dublin and the city is largely dependent on creamery milk throughout the greater part of the year.  During the winter especially, Dublin is very much dependent on the supplies from creameries.</P>
    <P>There is another class of creamery, creameries which were supplying milk to Dublin when the original Act was passed&mdash;and when I speak of Dublin here I may say that the same applies to Cork, which is another area under the Act&mdash;and those creameries are registered under the Principal Act.  No limit was put to the amount of milk they might supply, and there is always a certain danger that three or four of those very big creameries might combine and make it impossible for the suppliers in the Dublin area to exist. It is proposed here, therefore, to put some limit to the amount of milk they would send.  It is proposed in practice, as a matter of fact, to have this quantity decided on the average over three years.</P>
    <P>Power is taken in this Bill also to prescribe yearly contracts for the better regulation and stabilisation of the milk trade.  There are a number of suppliers here in Dublin who think that the yearly contract would be one of the most effective provisions which could be devised.  I myself have great faith in it, too, as the experience has been that the distributors here are willing to take all the milk that the County Wicklow or County Meath farmers can supply during the winter and early spring; but they are cut down to a certain quantity during the flush period and, sometimes, it is even lower than during the winter time.  That is unfair, and this yearly contract would ensure that the farmer who supplies a certain quantity during the autumn and winter would at least have a market for that quantity during the flush period.</P>
    <P>Under the Principal Act, it is unlawful for any producer, unless registered with a board, to sell milk in the sale area.  In the event of a stoppage for any reason, there is a certain obstacle <Col N="1704" /> there with regard to getting supplies into the area.  To overcome the difficulty, should it arise, I am asking for power in this Bill to issue licences to persons in a sale district to acquire milk from persons who are not registered under the milk board for that district.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the principal features of this Bill.  With regard to one point that may be raised, because it is a point of controversy, if you like, it has been suggested to me that I should go much further and should set up a central marketing board here or agency for milk in the milk board areas.  I am not prepared to do that, at the moment, at any rate. It may be possible later on.  Proposals of this nature were made by me to the various sections of the milk trade in Dublin about 12 months ago but when we came down to discuss the scheme only the country producers were prepared to agree to such a scheme. Country producers, as distinct from what are commonly known as cow-keepers, or the producers who deliver their own milk mainly from door to door, although they supply a substantial quantity, do not supply the greater part of the milk in the City of Dublin.  Their supplies are less than half.  It was impossible, therefore, to adopt a suggestion which had the support of that section only.</P>

      <P>If they were willing to do that, I would certainly be only too anxious to give them every help I could but I think it would be hardly justifiable under the circumstances to bring them in in a commercial way without co-operation and create this central marketing board.  I may say <Col N="1705" /> that it has been suggested to the people concerned that they might try to form a co-operative society and that they might try to get their idea carried out in that way, but, so far, that idea has not appealed to them.  I quite admit what Deputy Hughes says, that this may be a difficult problem but, on the other hand, if they are not in a position to co-operate in that way it is very difficult to see how any Government Department can do very much in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this problem and they should not be lost sight of.  To judge from the interest displayed by this House in this Bill one would imagine that it was of no importance but, in my judgment, it is of very vital importance.  It is of vital importance from two points of view: one is the point of view of the producers and the other is the point of view of the consumers.  I have identified myself as far as I can with the interests of the agricultural community of this country and I believe that the measures necessary to secure their prosperity are vital to the economic life of this country.  But, when we come to deal with a commodity like milk we have got to ask ourselves the question, are we, as the Oireachtas of this country, prepared to buttress the economic stability of any part of the community with the lives&mdash;nothing less than the lives&mdash;of poor people which will be sacrificed if they do not get sufficient quantities of milk?</P>
      <P>It is all very well for us to legislate to ensure that the producers of milk will get from the consumers an economic price but there is no use ascertaining the economic price for milk, fixing it and then discovering that those who most require milk are unable to pay that price and that we, by our act, have converted milk into a commodity analogous to champagne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this city at the present moment&mdash; and the same is true of many other cities in the State&mdash;there are thousands of nursing mothers and children who are not getting the milk that they require.  They are not getting it because they cannot afford to pay for it; for no other reason.  In my judgment, to pass a Bill of this character, designed <Col N="1706" /> to secure an economic price for the milk producers supplying urban areas in this city, without adverting to the other aspect of the case, is irresponsible and wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes has a unique acquaintance with the peculiar problems of the milk producers who are supplying urban areas and I have no doubt that he will deal in detail with the specific proposals made by the Minister in this Bill in so far as they react upon these men, men who have a right to every consideration and men who, we must remember, at our insistence, have spent large sums of money in equipping their cow-houses and dairy establishments with modern and up-to-date appliances in order to conform to the regulations made under Acts analogous to the Bill we have before us at the present time.  Their interests must be safeguarded or they will &ldquo;go bust&rdquo;.  I am making the case that the consumers' interests must be protected or they will die, and we here in this House have got to make up our minds to bridge the gap between those two legitimate claims in one way or another.  I take the view that people who can afford a moderately high standard of living may properly be required to pay the agricultural producers in this country an economic price for their produce.  Therefore, I say it is fair to fix an economic price for milk and require the residents of Merrion Square and the more prosperous parts of the city to pay that price.  But we cannot do that unless at the same time those who can not afford that economic price, but who must have that milk if they are to survive, are provided for.  This submission, Sir, would be true at any time but it is peculiarly true at the present moment.</P>

That we have the will, I do not think can be doubted by anyone.  That we have the way, I submit, is also clear.  But we only have the way if we use the commodities which we can command to the highest possible advantage.  Those commodities would be several&mdash;potatoes, fish, sugar, eggs and milk.

    <Col N="1708" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, Sir; but if we are going to facilitate further the fixation of price and the limitation of supply to the City of Dublin, we have got to do that with this mental reservation: that no fixation of prices, and no limitation of supply to the City of Dublin shall operate to drive the price of milk up to a figure which the poor cannot afford to pay.  Now, the only way we can do that under this Bill, without bankrupting the producers of milk in and around the City of Dublin and other cities, is to say, quite deliberately: If we ask Oireachtas Éireann to pass this Bill, we say at the same time that we will, if necessary, establish in this city, and in every other necessitous city in the State, depôts where pasteurised milk can be purchased by necessitous mothers and children at prices which they can afford to pay.  I would bring that milk from the farthest end of this country, if that were necessary, into the City of Dublin, pasteurise it here, and offer it for sale to the poor, and I would impose no means test.  Mind you, my submission is that you cannot proceed with this prices fixation and further regulation of supply unless you are prepared to give this guarantee against hardship.</P>
      <P>I would bring that milk in from whatever source I could get it, and I would pasteurise it, because we cannot hope to get Grade A milk from all over the country, and I would then give notice to all and sundry in this city that if they wanted milk for the preservation of their own health and that of their children, any person who presented himself at the depôt with a pint bottle and twopence would get a pint of milk, and would get it as often as he applied for it.  The only means test I would impose is this: &ldquo;If you are prepared to walk to the depot, and bring your bottle for the milk and bring it back, you will get the milk at 2d. a pint&rdquo;, or even less, if that were necessary in order to bring it to the poorer sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to warn this House that there are many elements abroad in the country at the present time who seek to represent us in this House as being controlled by vested interests of one kind or another in the country&mdash;<Col N="1709" /> whether it be farmers' organisations, manufacturers' organisations, or other organisations&mdash;and that, submitting to pressure by these highly organised bodies, we are indifferent to the sufferings and difficulties of those who have met with reverses as a result of the crisis that has hit the country and the whole world at the present time. Against that allegation we have got to take effective precautions.  If the morale of our people is to be preserved we have got to let them know that the resources of this country will be mobilised, first, to feed the people, and then, and only then, to protect the interests of any vested interest, whether an agricultural or an industrial one.</P>
    <P>Statistics have been furnished time and again to demonstrate the fact that poor women in this city, about to have their babies, are suffering from malnutrition when they go into the lying-in hospital, and that that largely results from their inability to consume sufficient quantities of milk because they cannot afford to buy it.  Evidence has been produced time and again&mdash; sometimes in a very mischievous way &mdash;to show that infant children of the poor in this and other cities even die from the want of food, and principally from the want of adequate supplies of milk.  I think that recent scientific investigation in America has made it clear that the introduction of the whole-meal loaf makes the supply of milk even more vital a necessity.  It used to be believed that, on all scores, the whole-meal loaf was a more nutritious food than the white loaf. Modern investigation suggests that the phytic acid contained in the wheat grain and incorporated in the whole-meal loaf operates to destroy calcium in the normal diet, and that a person consuming whole-meal bread without a sufficient calcium intake is in fact losing an essential part of the calcium that is required.  That makes an abundant supply of milk far more necessary to-day than it has been at other times. I am not suggesting to the House, and I do not want the House to imagine that it is suggested, that the whole-meal loaf is inferior, generally, to the white loaf.  I do not think it is, but it <Col N="1710" /> requires a dietetic adjustment, which is perfectly easy to make if that flaw in the whole-meal loaf is to be corrected in the normal diet of the people. That can be corrected by increasing the ordinary calcium intake of the average citizen.  Now, 90 per cent. of our people derive the calcium element of their diet from milk.  Therefore, urgent as it is at all times, in view of the vitamin content of milk, that the people should have an abundant supply of it, it is doubly urgent now amongst those sections of the community, the staple part of whose diet is bread and milk in one form or another.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that before this Bill passes through the House he should furnish us with a specific guarantee that this winter and this summer no poor household in this city or in any other city in the State will be allowed to go without sufficient milk because they are not in a position to afford it.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister, Sir, before he takes further powers to regulate the supply and price of milk in Dublin, to give me a guarantee that any act he does under this Bill will not operate to deprive the poor of milk. I ask him, further, to say that if any act of his would so operate, without ancillary action to correct it, that ancillary action will be taken.  I regard this as absolutely fundamental and of first-class importance.  I regard the opportunity to give that undertaking now as an invaluable opportunity to correct the harm that is being done by certain irresponsible persons who talk a lot but think very little.  I want an absolute assurance, before this Bill passes, that whatever may happen in respect of other foodstuffs that we cannot control, at least for the duration of this crisis and, if possible, for evermore, sufficient supplies of our milk surplus&mdash;and there is a surplus of milk in this country&mdash;will be diverted to the poor, to our own poor, whatever the cost may be, before any further steps are taken to protect the legitimate <Col N="1711" /> vested interest of the milk producers who normally supply our cities and our towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read this Bill, and listened to the Minister's statement, I am disappointed with his efforts to face up to his responsibility in the matter and his failure to ensure some degree of stability in the production and supply of milk for the City of Dublin.  The 1939 strike was settled on the assurance of the Minister that he would bring about better and more stable conditions for the milk producers and that there would be no victimisation.  If this is his effort to implement that promise, to show that his word is his bond, then I suggest to the House that the Minister has let down these people and has failed to fulfil his promise.  There is nothing in the Bill, to my mind, that would commend it to any section of the trade.  It is difficult to find a single clause which is designed to remedy the chaotic conditions that exist in the Dublin milk trade.  It is well to recognise that the 1936 Act failed completely to regulate the supply of milk or bring about stabilisation.  This amending Act completely ignores that aspect of the case. The Minister replying to some questions put down by me a short time ago, and again in his statement to-day, said that he tried to secure agreement between interested parties and that he failed to get that agreement.  Now, I think the Minister was an optimist when he expected to get agreement between conflicting interests.  Failing to get the agreement that he desired, it was manifestly his duty to bring in a measure that would not only secure stability from the producers' point of view, but would secure the best quality of clean milk produced under proper hygienic conditions for the consumer in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that considerable sums of money have been spent, not only by the State but also by the individual producer in his effort to bring his cow-sheds within the regulations and produce clean milk, we now find elaborate provisions in the Bill for the introduction of additional creamery <Col N="1712" /> milk to the city.  This milk is not produced on farms that are subject to the milk regulations.  For all we know, and for all the Minister knows, this milk may be produced in many cases under dirty and insanitary conditions. In other words, the Minister, in my opinion, deliberately torpedoed the clean milk regulations as they affect the City of Dublin for the purpose of rewarding those creameries which assisted him to deal with the milk strike.  I think that is the chief purpose of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister why are producers encouraged to spend considerable sums of money on modernising their cow-sheds and bringing them up to sanitary requirements if their efforts are ignored and their interests unprotected?  We must not forget that aspect of the case.  I suggest to Deputy Dillon, when we talk about a milk supply for the city, that we must not overlook the facts that the milk produced in the production area is produced under conditions altogether different from those which obtain in the case of milk produced in the creamery areas.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what has happened I need only mention that 32,412 gallons were delivered in the city by registered creameries in November, 1936, and that 111,424 gallons were delivered by creameries in November, 1940.  In addition, the Minister permitted three additional creameries to supply milk to Dublin.  They are sending an aggregate of 1,000 gallons daily.  This brings the aggregate for all the creameries up to 137,000 gallons as against 32,000 gallons in 1936.  Deputies will see from these figures that there is a steady drift of milk away from the butter-maker to supply the Dublin trade, with the inevitable result that the number of registered milk producers, producing milk under proper sanitary conditions for the Dublin area, has fallen from 1,800 registered producers in August, 1937, to 1,500 in 1940.  Is that situation in the best interests of the health of the people?  After all, the ideal way to produce milk for human consumption is the method by which it is produced in the Dublin production area.  That is what the Minister aimed at in laying down the conditions <Col N="1713" /> in the 1936 Act.  He has departed from that in the amending Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>The milk requirements of the city have been supplied for some years by three interests, namely, the association of milk producers, the Dublin cow-keepers, and the creameries.  The Dublin cow-keepers produce and retail milk direct to the consumers.  The milk producers sell to the trade who handle the distribution end of it.  Each group supplies its quota, in practice, although not bound to do so by law. As the requirements of the Dublin area have remained static for a long period, it is obvious that an increase in the quota of one group would entail an automatic decrease in the quota of the other groups.</P>
    <P>This in effect is what the Minister is doing by increasing the supply from the creamery areas.  He is automatically helping to reduce the quota of milk from those people who have equipped their cowsheds to produce milk under proper hygienic conditions. To my mind, there is but one way of dealing with the matter and that is to allow each group its share of the market, which is the actual supply under the Regulation of Supply and Prices Act of 1936, excluding of course the strike period of 1939.  This would give each group scope for an increase or decrease in the number of individual suppliers but would confine each group to the quota which represents its share in the Dublin market.  If there was an increase in milk consumption, each group would share in the increase but each group should definitely have to maintain its quota over the 12 months. The Minister has referred to this himself. The one group of people in particular who are suffering from the present system in operation are the country milk producers.  While they are able to market their maximum production during the winter and autumn periods, there is no market for their full production during the flush summer period.  What is actually happening is that the Dublin cowkeeper, whose production falls off during the high cost of production period, the winter period, is permitted to market <Col N="1714" /> his full production during the flush period, when it is cheap to produce milk.  If, as the Minister himself actually agreed, you had a contract operating over the whole year, that contract would protect the interests of the country producer.  I do not think it is fair to ask the man who is victimised during the flush period, when you can produce milk cheaply, to produce milk during the highest cost of production period, the winter period, and come in and supply that milk when the cowkeepers' production has fallen off.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is quite well aware of the many evils which flow from that situation.  I am sure they have been represented to him over and over again by those who are interested. For instance, those country producers sell to the wholesale trade, and the wholesalers may take a supply on Monday and Tuesday mornings but may simply pass the man's gate on Wednesday morning and not take up his cans, leaving him with a supply of milk which he normally expected would arrive in Dublin for consumption. Because he normally expected that milk to be consumed in the city he has not provided himself with any alternative means of disposing of it, and in a great many cases it simply has to be poured down the drain.  The Minister, apparently, has not taken cognisance of that fact at all, and has provided no method of dealing with it.  Although under the Act a man cannot buy under the fixed price, in effect a great many wholesalers are buying quantities of milk at less than the fixed price, because the producer, in order to avoid the possibility of having milk left on his hands one or two days a week, makes an arrangement with the wholesaler; at the end of the month, although he is paid the price fixed by law for the milk, there is &ldquo;a hand-back.&rdquo; That has definitely occurred in a great many cases.  The man who is honest enough to object to that sort of rotten system, and to fight against it at any cost, is the sufferer; an injustice is being done to him.</P>
    <P>There are other things from which this particular group suffers.  There is a certain amount of duress used by the <Col N="1715" /> wholesaler in an effort to execute contracts. In some cases I think it has been brought to the Minister's notice that there is intimidation used by certain wholesalers to compel producers to buy goods in return for the milk.  Again, the producer is at the mercy of the wholesaler.  The man who is prepared to enter into that arrangement will get his milk taken from him regularly, while the man who objects to it, and very rightly objects to it, will find that he is the loser, as his cans may be left behind on two or three days a week, or he may lose his contract.  I think the Minister himself has actually stated that he favours this idea of a central marketing agency.  He suggests that producers have the remedy in their own hands, that they can do their own marketing by forming a co-operative society.  I agree that that could be done, and that that is a way out, but it is rather a tall order for the type of individual who is engaged in the production of milk for the city.  I am afraid the interest as a whole is not sufficiently strong, and there is not sufficient co-operation between the various individuals.  Possibly, there is not sufficient capital.  They have no experience whatever of the distribution of milk in the city, and they are rather reluctant to face up to tackling the problem themselves.  A fixed price over the whole year and a central marketing agency would go a long way towards solving the many problems and grievances from which those people suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no attempt at rationalisation; the one right which remained with the various trade interests, namely the right to elect its members to the board that operated this scheme, is now taken away under Section 6.  The Minister has not told us the idea behind that section.  My interpretation of the section is that in future we have no guarantee that the board will not be the nominees of the Minister.  Under that section as it now stands, if the Minister so wishes. he can nominate the panel from which the registered producers would elect their board.  I do not know what is the intention behind that section.  I <Col N="1716" /> think it is only right and proper that they should nominate their own representatives and elect their own board without allowing any outsider to come in.</P>

I feel that he appreciates the many problems and hardships from which those producers suffer, particularly the country producers in North Kildare, County Meath and County Wicklow.  But he has not faced up to the problem, and he has not attempted to solve it.  Instead of introducing legislation designed to bring about a better order of things within the area, the Minister has brought in this Bill.  I think it is going to create greater chaos, and leaves those individuals with whom I am personally concerned absolutely unprotected.</P>

      <P>I was rather surprised when Deputy Hughes spoke that he did not deal with the greatest danger that faces the producers here and that is the danger that lies in the proposals made by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Hughes made no allusion to Deputy Dillon's move to wipe out the producers. So far as Deputy Dillon's very definite proposals to wipe them out are concerned, Deputy Hughes was silent on that point.  I wonder it Deputy Dillon were to bring in a motion embodying the ideas he put forward, would Deputy Hughes feel inclined to support it?  I do not see how the Minister could, except by the present method of prosecution, deal with people who are under-buying milk.  If <Col N="1717" /> there is want of co-operation among milk producers, that is their own look-out. We cannot go further here than to enact legislation determining a certain price.  If they are shabby enough to undercut one another by backhand methods, it is their own look-out.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was made that the milk should be purchased from the creameries, brought to Dublin and pasteurised and then everyone with a pint bottle and 2d. will get a bottle of milk.  I can see a lot of fur coats going to Deputy Dillon's shop for cheap milk. We will see the farmers of County Dublin and County Wicklow, in whom Deputy Hughes seems to be so interested&mdash;men who probably had to go to the bank to raise money to enable them to erect cow-sheds and to comply with the various regulations &mdash; with plenty of milk left on their hands if Deputy Dillon, who is Deputy Hughes's leader, has his way.  Are those Deputies going to disown their leader?  That would certainly be the position if Deputy Dillon had his way.</P>
      <P>Provision should be made, and I think rightly, for distributing cheap milk among those who cannot afford to pay a high price for it.  Let that provision be made by way of subsidy, just the same as provision was made for buying bread, which is as essential as milk, for the necessitous poor.  But because the bread belongs to an industrial class and the milk belongs to the old farmer, anything is good enough for the old farmer.  That is the policy of Deputy Dillon.  It has always been his policy and I was not surprised to hear it enunciated here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is making provision for the creameries.  The usual procedure adopted in other cases is to send the blackleg home, and I suggest <Col N="1718" /> that the blackleg in this case should also be sent home.  When the war is over and friendly relations are re-established, there should be no room for the milk sent in by these creameries that sent it in during the strike.  There actually was no room for that milk in Dublin at the time, and there is no room for it at the present moment.  The only purpose served is to push out somebody who went to great expense preparing stalls and sheds and fixing up buildings in accordance with the regulations in order to send milk to the City of Dublin.  I think it is unfair that milk that is regarded as surplus milk should be allowed into any city.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the difficulties that existed before legislation in connection with milk production was enacted. I am aware of the conditions that existed in Cork.  I can instance the case of a farmer who sent 40 gallons a day to Cork City.  Ten gallons were bought at 8d. a gallon and the remaining 30 gallons were bought at 3¼d. a gallon, at what they called butter-fat prices, and that cheaper milk was used to drive some of the other producers out of the market.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very necessary for the protection of the producers who supply towns and cities.  There was already a surplus of milk in Dublin, and there will be a much greater surplus if the creameries are permitted to get 1,000 gallons a day in.  I think the Minister, now that the war is over, should let the blacklegs stay at home.  I approve of the yearly contract system.  We have generally found that farmers who, under great difficulty, kept up their milk supplies throughout the winter, found themselves in the summer, when milk got plentiful, wiped out by some creamery with a licence&mdash;a creamery that had not a gallon of milk to send in during the winter.  In the County Limerick the cows are eight months milking and four months dry.</P>
    <P>The Bill might be amended in respect to the amount of milk to be sent in by the ordinary creamery.  That would come under Section 25, dealing with the greatest quantity of milk to be sent in during any standard year. Last summer was an extraordinary <Col N="1719" /> period so far as milk is concerned.  It was a particularly dry year and there was a great milk scarcity.  If you take the supplies of milk last year as a basis, then there is little use in having that section.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the attitude adopted by Deputy Hughes, who has fairly consistently looked after the ordinary farmers who are supplying milk to the city.  I am surprised that he allowed Deputy Dillon to get away with the proposals he made.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Corry I fail to see any great clash of opinion between the views expressed by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes.  I think Deputy Hughes very ably stated the case for the milk producers.  That case is based on the fact that milk producers have by legislation been compelled to expend large sums of money on the improvement of the cows' sheds, to bring their system of production into conformity with the requirements of the law.  Seeing that such high expenditure has been imposed upon them by legislation passed in this <Col N="1720" /> House, I consider they are entitled to protection to ensure that they will get a fair and a reasonable price for milk. That was the object of the original Act.  Deputy Dillon stated that it was urgently necessary that the poor should be able to obtain milk at a price that they could pay, and that it would be a tragedy if the children of the poor were allowed to die because they could not obtain milk.  There is a way to bring the two viewpoints into conformity. All along there has been too much power vested in the hands of wholesalers in the milk trade in Dublin. Great profits have been allowed to these people.  The only solution of the difficulty is to wipe out the wholesalers and to place the milk trade of the city in the hands of a public marketing body established on co-operative lines by legislation passed in this House. That was the only way in which a satisfactory solution could be found.  Such a central body could provide that those who could afford to pay an economic price for milk would be compelled to do so, and that an adequate supply of cheap milk would be provided for the poorer classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to the failure of producers to co-operate with one another for the protection of their interests.  The Minister and Deputy Corry must have short memories if they do not remember the vicious and drastic action that was taken by the Government against milk producers when they attempted to co-operate for their protection.  It should be remembered that extraordinary powers were resorted to by the Minister to break down and destroy co-operation between milk producers.  Even the powers of censorship, which were given to the Government for the special purpose of preserving our neutrality, were used to prevent producers co-operating.  The Minister does not forget that creameries were not only encouraged but compelled to supply milk in order to prevent milk producers co-operating in their own interests.  Now the Minister and Deputy Corry blame the producers for failing to co-operate.  Deputy Corry says that they should not supply milk under any circumstances except at fixed prices.  In justice to the milk <Col N="1721" /> producers, it should be stated that they have done their best to co-operate. The problem of distributing milk in Dublin is a big one and is not one, as the Minister suggests, that producers in rural areas could undertake.  That would require the co-operation of the State and of the Department, in the setting up of a central body to control the entire distribution of milk, and until that is done it is only wasting time to be passing Bills of this nature.</P>

      <P>I wish to protest against the introduction of this Bill.  In my constituency many people have spent large sums of money in improving their dairies and cowsheds.  If creameries are allowed to supply milk in the summer time that will mean, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, that a quantity of milk would be left with producers.  It is not fair that the Minister should allow creameries, even though they supplied milk during the strike, to come into the trade now.  As Deputy Corry suggested what happened during the strike should be forgotten.  The creameries have a method of dealing with surplus milk by making butter, while farmers have no such remedy.  I ask the Minister to amend the Bill and to confine the creameries to the making of butter.  Creameries have not to comply with the dairies and cowshed regulations and have not to spend large sums of money in improving their accommodation.</P>

      <P>As the representative of a large working class area in Dublin I feel it my duty to join with Deputy Dillon in asking the Minister not to do anything which might tend to reduce the already insufficient quantity of milk available for the children of working-class people.  If the Minister considers that milk producers must get a greater return to cover their expenses and to give them a fair profit, then I ask him to consider providing some other means than reducing the quantity available for kiddies in the slums.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's speech on this Bill indicated what is likely to happen.  It appears to me that Deputy Hughes and Deputy Fagan were speaking for a small section of the producers <Col N="1722" /> who were put to expense but it should be remembered that that expense will recoup itself.  In the past that section might, in my opinion, be described as a privileged class, as they had a complete monopoly of the milk trade.  I agree with Deputy Dillon's plea that milk should be provided for our cities and towns no matter from what source it came.  Farmers in Kerry, Cork and Limerick supplied milk to Dublin during the strike and if necessary may be asked to supply it now in the emergency, at a fair price, having due regard to the requirements of the poor. In any adjustment of the economic price to be paid to farmers I suggest that it could be so arranged that milk could be transferred to the cities and towns at a reasonable cost.  If there is to be a further reduction in the price to the poor, milk might be made available at the minimum cost by the Minister setting up machinery to deal with that aspect of the question, so that there would be a fair adjustment between producers and people who find it difficult to purchase milk.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but for one or two references to creameries.  Deputy Corry seemed to suggest that the creameries were going to dump surplus bad milk on the citizens of Dublin and Cork.  I resent any suggestion that supplies of milk sent to Dublin from creameries were not good.  Every precaution is taken to see that that milk is fit for human consumption. Thousands of people who do not indulge in milk to the extent that might be desired would be very glad to get enough of that good milk. Does anybody suggest that creameries should be put into the position that at one time they would be compelled by legislation or by order to supply milk to certain places, and that shortly afterwards, when the crisis was over, they should be debarred from doing so?  No Minister should be asked to do that.  The Minister should not be requested to do that, because it would be unjust and unfair.  Like Deputy Cogan I do not desire to injure milk producers who are supplying the cities. My interest is primarily in milk producers in the country who supply <Col N="1723" /> creameries.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, the position is that some small consumers cannot get sufficient milk to colour their tea.  If the milk supply is to be regulated all round, there must be some central body to ensure that a sufficiency of milk goes into every household.  That is more desirable now when butter production is not a very economic proposition.  Legislation has debarred creameries to a greater extent than any other business from providing milk for human consumption. I was at a meeting in Limerick City recently at which the Taoiseach was asked to express his views on the question of poor people having milk made available to them, and he was surprised when informed that creameries were debarred from selling milk even to the poor in their own districts.  I should like to see the Minister bringing into some other measure a provision enabling creameries to sell milk for human consumption in their districts.  One Deputy suggested that farmers should be compelled to wash the cows' udders.  I do not think that Deputy realised the restrictions that are imposed on farmers who bring milk to creameries. He would only have to undertake such work for a month to find his milk returned if it was not up to standard. The Department of Agriculture insists upon milk supplied to creameries being clean milk, and I resent any suggestion that milk sent to creameries was not in every way good milk and suitable for human consumption.  That would be a slander on farmers and milk producers. It would be an injury to the country to suggest that milk produced in creamery districts was not good milk. God send the poor people in Dublin, Cork and Limerick such good milk and enough of it.</P>

      <P>As I come from a milk-producing county, I should like to take part in this debate.  In this case, we have the city and town Deputy ranged against the country Deputy.  We, in the country, realise what it cost to build up this industry.  It cost more in labour, suffering and wages than it did to establish any other industry.  There are more restrictions under the Milk Acts than apply, perhaps, to any other industry. If farmers do not produce to the satisfaction of the different parties, they must go out of business.  To meet the requirements of the different Acts, our farmers have gone to enormous expense. If they do not get an economic price for their milk, they must go out of business, and that after building a huge debt which they may never be able to liquidate.  If an economic price be provided for the producer, it is bound to hit the poorer sections in the cities and towns.  It is the duty of the <Col N="1725" /> country to afford an economic price for the milk produced, and the gap which divides the producer from the poor consumer should be bridged by the State.  In fixing an economic price for the producer, we should, certainly, be hitting at the poor, but the State can overcome the difficulty by bridging the gap as I have suggested.</P>
      <P>One thing I am more or less against is that of allowing the creameries to retain the foothold which they obtained in Dublin when they stabbed the regular milk suppliers to the city in the back.  That arrangement, if we want to cure old sores, should be dropped, and that market should be given to those who have been in the habit of supplying Dublin with its milk.  It is not fair to see these people take over so large a part of the requirements of the city, and I ask the Minister not to allow it to continue.  I think that the Minister realises that one of the greatest sufferers by the foot-and-mouth plague is the milk producer from in and around Dublin.  Vast herds, consisting of some of the finest cows in Europe, have been wiped out because of this disease.  The men concerned will continue in the industry which they helped to build up if they are allowed to do so. After the huge loss they have suffered, I think we should endeavour to meet them by fixing an economic price for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not go far enough.  I know that it is almost impossible to bring in a Bill which will meet with the approval of producer and consumer.  At the same time, if the milk industry fails, it will be a calamity to our country.  It is next to our cattle industry&mdash;if it does not come before it. I ask the Minister to stimulate this industry by the means I have suggested, as milk is one of the first essentials of life, especially to poor people who are rearing young families. With goodwill on all sides now, the Minister should make an effort to stabilise this industry because, month after month, there are complaints about the way these petty restrictions are operated.  Small farmers who set up in this business a few years ago with overdrafts and bought eight or ten cows cannot get the price necessary <Col N="1726" /> to make the industry a paying proposition. They will be the rest of their lives paying back the money they borrowed to buy stock and to build cowsheds.</P>
    <P>This is one of the industries which need serious consideration.  Milk Bills are passed over too lightly in this House when we realise all the brain work that goes into the industry and all the employment which it affords. Now that there are hopes of getting agreement, I ask the Minister to bring in a decent Bill.  There is no use in trifling with these little remedies and having Deputies from the country saying that producers are not getting a chance and city men getting up and asking about the poor.  We are all concerned with the interests of the poor but it is the bounden duty of the House to afford every facility to those who are building up the industry.  No thanks would be due to the Minister for giving milk producers a fair crack of the whip.  We shall all stand behind the Minister if he decides to bridge the gap as I have advocated.</P>
    <P>We are not going far enough in meeting the producers.  They are a first-class type of people, industrious and business-like.  They pay good wages and, while most people are asleep in the mornings, they are out milking and getting their milk away to the city&mdash;at three, four, or five o'clock in the morning. This industry is typical of the other branches of agricultural effort.  A fair price is never forthcoming.  The producers are working from morning till night for very little profit or for no profit.  That is all because people do not realise that agricultural production is the basis of this State.  If the Government do not meet the reasonable requirements of the agriculturists, then it would be better for them to get out and let some other Government tackle the question.  Milk production is one of our main assets and, if the poor are in danger of being mulcted by an increase of price, then it is the duty of the State to provide the difference between what they can pay and what is an economic price.</P>

      <P>Most Deputies who have spoken gave the impression that this <Col N="1727" /> legislation and the previous Act&mdash;the Act regulating prices&mdash;were designed to compensate the farmers for expenditure under the Milk and Dairies Act, 1934.  That is a wrong impression.  This legislation was not brought in to compensate any section of farmers for bringing their dairies and cowsheds up to the standard which was considered necessary.  The original Act has justified itself.  The main reason for it was the chaos which existed in the Dublin milk supply area at certain periods&mdash;notably the four months in which we have most sunshine.  During the other eight months, there would be no difficulty in selling all the milk that would be normally supplied in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes does not think that this legislation will entirely get over the difficulty.  While it has been proved in the last five or six years that the Act has improved the condition of the Dublin milk supplier in the country very much, I cannot think of any legislation which the Minister might bring in that would provide for the summer period and the big increase in milk that most producers are able to supply during the summer period to the Dublin sales area as compared with the winter.  The producers, if you like, have it in their own hands to produce more in the winter, but we know the difficulties in connection with that.</P>

I can see his point of view. I can see the danger of legislation like this making the price of milk too dear for poor people, but, having some knowledge of the matter, I know what it meant to the producer who had put all he had into the business and who was <Col N="1728" /> made bankrupt owing to the conditions that existed in the City of Dublin during certain periods of the year.  It is very difficult to reconcile the two points of view.  When Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy speaks about the State bridging the gap we should remember where the State has to get the money.  It comes as much from the poor as from anyone else.  Many of the poor will have to subscribe to the pool. That is the trouble about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon and other Deputies have made clear what the difficulty is in legislating for this problem of the supply of milk to the cities and towns, namely, trying to please both the producer and the consumer, trying to provide for them both.  There is always the danger, as was pointed out, that if you try to buttress up, as Deputy Dillon put it, one section of the producers like this, it may inflict an undue hardship on some section of the consumers.  Deputy Dillon made a suggestion with regard to depôts where consumers would call <Col N="1729" /> for milk from creamery districts that could be sold at a comparatively low price.  As a matter of fact, that experiment was tried and it was not a great success for many reasons.  I do not think it was tried long enough to prove conclusively that it was a failure, but it did not succeed as well as might have been expected.</P>

The Government have under consideration at the moment various schemes for a subsidy on milk consumption, probably for certain classes, not for everybody.  If the Government can succeed in evolving a scheme of that kind, it might perhaps meet the difficulties that Deputy Dillon and other Deputies had in mind.  I think it will be admitted that consumers who have their milk delivered at the door can afford to pay the price that is being charged.</P>

      <P>Therefore, as Minister for Agriculture, I am taking a particular interest in that scheme.  I should like to point out, however, that this amending Bill does not in any way alter the price that will be paid for milk in the city or in Cork.  The price is discussed, first of all, by the Board.  I am talking now of the procedure under the Principal Act.  The Board come to a decision as to what they think would be a proper price.  As a matter of fact, they very seldom come to a decision, because there are usually three or four opinions on the Board.  I think on one or two occasions we had a unanimous decision, but that is a rare occurrence. The chairman of the Board then sends that report to me with his recommendation and I have then to make the final determination, that is, to fix the price.  That procedure, of course, is not changed in any way by this Bill, and therefore any discussion in regard to the price of milk does not really arise on this amending Bill, and discussion should be rather directed to the question of whether or not the Principal Act should be continued. Deputy Hughes stated that I was expecting too much when I wanted agreement amongst all concerned in order to get some sort of co-operative scheme working.  I did not want agreement amongst all concerned, but only amongst the producers.  There may, of course, be conflicting interests between the two classes of producers.</P>

      <P>Perhaps there are. Naturally, I did not expect to get agreement between retailers and wholesalers and producers; I only wanted agreement between all the producers. If that had been forthcoming, we might have been able to go further. Again, there is the big question of what might be called the rationalisation of the industry.  Rationalisation is under consideration.  I do not say that we will arrive at any conclusion on that matter immediately; it is a matter we had to put back for further consideration.  Some Deputies have stated, and I think myself that we will not satisfy the producers, the consumers, or anybody else until the whole question of the rationalisation, not only of production but of distribution and everything else, is settled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the cities, anyway.  I do not know about the whole country. Another point made was that we were allowing creamery milk to be consumed here and were not asking for the same conditions with regard to its production on the farm as we were demanding from the farmer who is supplying milk direct to the City of Dublin.  That is true, but, on the other hand, the creamery that is sending up that milk is registered under the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935.  It must see that the milk it sends up here is properly pasteurised.  In that way, the milk is perfectly healthy.  In fact, I think it could be said that it is safer even than the milk that comes from the farmer, because it is guaranteed to be free from disease.  There are many opinions about that.  I do not say that, on the whole, it is as wholesome as fresh milk that comes from the farm, and that is produced under the proper conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are medical officers of health in England who will not allow pasteurised milk into their cities, and other medical officers of health who will not allow anything but pasteurised milk into their cities.  It is really a matter of opinion.  Deputy Hughes suggested that a fair way out of this might be to give each group its share. What he had in mind, I think, was that if the cowkeepers had a certain percentage, if other producers had a certain percentage, and if the creameries had a certain percentage there should be an adjustment between them as regards supplies.  I do not think that would be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it would be desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be desirable, although I think that on the whole the creameries have the greatest grievance, since, under this Bill, we are going to say to them: &ldquo;You must not supply more than a certain quantity.&rdquo;  We are not saying that to any producer inside the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What standard are you taking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard year will be based on the years 1937, 1938 and 1939. Up to this, the creameries that were in could supply as much as they liked.  We are now putting in this limitation.  On the other hand, if the Board is short of supplies, as it has been on many occasions, it can go to those same creameries and say to them: &ldquo;Even though we have put a limit of 500 gallons a day on you, now, because we are short, we want you to give us 1,000 gallons a day.&rdquo;  There was no legal limitation on the creameries up to this. There was a sort of understanding, and I think the creameries have been very decent.  They have kept down to a certain level.  When the producers here had not milk, and when consumers wanted it, the creameries were willing to come forward and give more milk in order to fill the gap.  Therefore, I think they really have a greater grievance than any of the other groups in <Col N="1733" /> being limited in this way at certain times.  There is this, of course, to be said, that when there is a great flush of milk here, the creameries are not so interested, because the price is then much lower.  That applies to May, June and July.  The price is lower then, and it is more difficult than at other times for the creameries to transport the milk.  The margin of profit is low, since the price ruling about that time is not very much.  It is much more profitable for them to send up milk during the winter.  Luckily for all concerned, the business is more profitable for the creameries when milk is scarce.  I think all the groups fit fairly well together on that account.  It suits the creameries to send supplies at one time, and it suits other producers to send milk at another time.  As I have said, they are all working fairly well together, and so far the board have had very little trouble in trying to keep supplies up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes gave certain figures with the object of showing that the creameries sent up a good deal more milk in October, 1940, than they did in the same month of 1939.  I am quite sure the creameries did not do that of their own volition.  As a matter of fact, the board, during that time, was canvassing creameries to send more milk, and found it very difficult to get supplies. They had even to go to creameries not registered in this Dublin area and ask them to send milk over a certain period.  The board, of course, have power to bring in milk from a nonregistered person in a time of shortage like that.  They exercised that power last autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is correct to say that there has been a considerable falling-off in the number of producers in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The men I was speaking to assured me that, though they were getting the published price&mdash;there was <Col N="1734" /> not any question of a &ldquo;hand-back&rdquo; or anything like that&mdash;they would prefer to depend on some other class of farming than milk production: that is, when they took into consideration all the trouble involved in milk production, the expense of replacing cows, and so on.  Deputy Hughes said that a &ldquo;hand-back&rdquo; is taking place in many cases. It is impossible for the Department to do anything about that.  All we can do is to get a law passed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But that matter has been brought to the Minister's notice already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  As Deputy Allen has pointed out, I do not see what we can do in that matter except to prosecute if a case is brought to our notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if he were to fix a quota for each of the three groups, it would eliminate this practice of the &ldquo;hand-back.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the flush period it would be very difficult.  I did hear about the other matter that Deputy Hughes mentioned&mdash;of one wholesaler who adopted the practice of asking suppliers to buy certain commodities from him.  There is, if you like, a veiled threat in that&mdash;that the contracts would not be continued unless the supplier did what he was asked to do.  I had thought of dealing with that, but it is not a matter that could be dealt with in this Bill.  It belongs to another code altogether.  It would hardly be a matter for my Department. We are in touch with the legal Department to see if it can be dealt with.  It would probably be a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Whether that is so or not, we are in touch with the legal Department to see what can be done.  I think it is a thing that should be stopped if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter was raised by Deputy Bennett, who said that we should allow creameries to sell milk in their own districts for human consumption.  I agree absolutely with that, and have been pressing the Minister for Local Government to amend the Milk and <Col N="1735" /> Dairies Act in some way during this crisis, to permit milk being sold in that way, not only by creameries but by farmers.  I would be delighted if Deputy Bennett would help me with the Minister for Local Government in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make provision for free milk under a free milk scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think those are the principal points raised.  The debate was finished by Deputy Giles coming back to the point where Deputy Dillon started, namely, that though it is difficult we must try to reconcile the interests of producer and consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question.  He speaks of pressure on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to permit farmers and creameries in rural Ireland selling milk to the consumer. A Deputy put in a question as to whether they might also sell milk under the free milk scheme.  May I sound a note of caution there and suggest that, if local authorities are to buy milk to distribute it to the poor, a preliminary precaution should be taken by pasteurising the milk, if it is not Grade A quality, before distribution? Milk is the standard nourishment of the poor, who are peculiarly susceptible to infection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <P>Sa Mheastachán do 1940-41 bhí £37,000, agus i mbliana meastar go roinnfear £40,700 ar na h-oibrithe. Chífear ón méid sin go bhfuil méadú ana-mhór tagtha ar phágh na n-oibrithe ón bhliain 1935-36, agus gur mór an rud é do mhuinntir na Gaeltachta na Tionnscail Tuaithe sin bheith ar siubhal na laetheannta so.  Tá <Col N="1740" /> deacrachtaí móra ag baint le h-adhbhair dhéantóireachta fháil dos na tionnscail, ach táimíd ag déanamh ár ndíchill chun ná beadh orainn aon cheann des na tionnscail seanbhunuithe seo do dhúnadh cheal adhbhar déantóireachta.</P>
    <P>Tá cúntaisí trádála ullmhuithe dos na blianta ó 1935-36 go 1939-40. Leagadh na cunntaisí ó 1935-36 go 1937-38 ar Bhórd na Dála cheana.  Tá cuntaisí na mblianta 1938-39 agus 1939-40 dá n-iniúchadh fé láthair ag an Árd-Reachtaire Cuntas Ciste agus táthar ag súil leis nach ró-fhada go dtí go leagfar iad-san freisin ar Bhórd na Dála.</P>

Is féidir, do réir mar a tuigtear dhúinn fé láthair, go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó ceilpe agus feamna á díol againn, agus go mbeidh, dá bharr sin, breis airgid le fáil.  Má bhíonn, méadófar dá réir an méid a bhéas le n-íoc fé Mhírcheann E 3.  Tá margaí cinnte fachta againn don Cheilp agus don bhFeamain dá gcóirightear sa Mheastachán.</P>

Níl aon trácht sa Mheastachán ar thionnscal an ghnáth-chairrgín tráchtála, rud a fágtar fé dhaoine príobháideacha. Cuireann an Fhó-Roinn suim ann, ámhthach, agus ó am go h-am, gheibhtear tuarasgbhála i dtaobh na bpraghsanna a h-íoctar leis na bailitheoirí.

      <P>In this Estimate I notice that there is a decrease of £4,000 with regard to materials for the toy industry.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I would like <Col N="1741" /> him to give us some review as to the position of the toy industry.  He has referred to the new spinning factory. I take it that is at Kilcar.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary is it intended to complete the building this year and, secondly, is he sure that he will be able to get the machinery when the building is complete.  The only other item I wish to deal with on the accounts side is the question of kelp.  Very high costs are involved.  £6,050 is being given out to the burners of kelp and it is costing £4,158 to do that.  As a business transaction that does not strike one as being the kind one would like to see in a set of accounts.  It may be, of course, that on a limited production your overhead charges remain even if you do four or five times the amount of business, but certainly the fact that the cost should be £4,158 on £6,050 worth of material seems to me to be entirely out of proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have liked the Parliamentary Secretary to have said something more on the question of kelp, and particularly with regard to that branch of his Department for this year.  The House may take it for granted that so far as the agricultural industry of this country is concerned there is going to be a crisis in connection with fertilisers next year.  The crisis obtains even this year, and I think it will be agreed by anybody who is at all conversant with the sources from which fertilisers come that the crisis will be much more acute next year.  It may, perhaps, seem ridiculous to introduce the question of wheat into the Gaeltacht Services Vote, but of course one has to look at these things, and look at the country as a whole.  Land in the poorer districts has been producing wheat that normally would not be fit for wheat during the last five or six years.  In the desperate situation in which we now find ourselves, and in view of the crisis with which the country is faced, the attempt is being made to grow wheat on these lands, and it is vital to have fertilisers of some kind or of any kind that we can get our hands on. Certainly, it seems to me that the provision of £6,000 for the production of kelp is entirely inadequate.  In the statement that was issued, reference <Col N="1742" /> was made to the prices the farmers will be agreeable to pay.  The price being paid is £8 10s. a ton for fertilisers to-day.  I agree that these are composite fertilisers, but there will be no choice next year.  It is almost certain that there will be no choice whatever next year.  I think that there could be even a higher price; I think the Parliamentary Secretary could go as far as another £1 10s. or £2 a ton, because these fertilisers will have to be got if the farmers are to produce the crops, and it looks as if this emergency will not terminate for another year or two.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that here and now, since the season is just coming in, he should issue an advertisement to the seaweed gatherers on the coasts of Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Clare, with a view to inducing them to put forward their best efforts if the season is favourable; but whether the season is favourable or not he should ask them to collect all that they can collect and inform them that he will take it and pay for it.  I think he would be doing a great work for the agricultural industry of this country, and for the people as a whole, in the line of producing food.  I do not know how these figures are arrived at, but they seem to me to be grossly out of proportion. After all, there is no highly technical work or knowledge required in connection with kelp.  It is burned in a little stone rack and then there is just the question of transporting it to the station, and it seems to me that the amount spent in dealing with the quantity of material concerned is out of proportion.  There may be an explanation for it, but I cannot see it.  You have the same with regard to carrageen.  You have £240 going out for the purchase of carrageen, and it costs £410, between one thing and another, to do that.  Well, I am not going to comment on that.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Parliamentary Secretary says that some difficulty is being met with in the procuring of wool for the factories.  I quite appreciate that.  What I should like to know, however, is this.  What foresight was applied to this matter when the war broke out, and since, to build up <Col N="1743" /> at least a substantial store of wool of the basic colours that would hold good for all this period?  It would be a disaster if there were any diminution in the employment given in this industry, and particularly if that were due to lack of foresight during the last two years, and before that, with regard to the purchasing of materials.  I had what I consider a shocking experience myself in this connection.  It was concerned with a person who had a little factory in Donegal.  When the war broke out they asked me what was the probable duration of the war and what could be done about buying wool.  I immediately answered by telling them to buy four years' quantity of wool.  I did not know whether the party could afford that much capital or not, but I told her to make a survey of her position, apply for a licence, and send me a note when she had applied for the licence and I would back it up.  With considerable difficulty, I got a licence to import just half that quantity.  I wonder has this Department been held up in a similar manner, or has the Parliamentary Secretary been able to override a policy of that kind?  I shall not use language in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Now, I achieved a certain amount of notoriety for myself a year or two ago on the question of tweeds.  I am very glad that, as far as I can see, the quality of all the tweeds I see is conspicuously improved.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was here a month or two ago, in connection with a token Vote, I referred to the question of patterns in tweeds.  The patterns that are out this year are good, but they are too limited.  All the other makers of tweeds are turning out various kinds of checks, but so far as the Gaeltacht tweeds are concerned, I only see the ordinary small kind of check, about the size of a diamond, and the range of mixed grades is very limited.  The explanation of that may be that it is due to the variety of wool that can be procured, and that they are restricted to the production of these things.  I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Department for which he caters should go all out for purchasing, first, all the seaweed that can be procured, and secondly, with regard to the <Col N="1744" /> amount of wool he has now in stock he should strike out at once to get any supplies he can lay his hands on from any source and override any obstruction from any other Department, so that he may be able to make provision for the future.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Mongan is in the House, but I should like to hear whether any contact has been made with Messrs. MacDonagh of Galway. When the late Deputy MacDonagh was in this House he was a source of strength to this industry, and I wonder has the Parliamentary Secretary got into contact with the MacDonagh firm. I made no inquiry myself, and I overlooked asking Deputy Mongan, but contact should be made with these people and the technical knowledge and resources of that great firm should be availed of in view of the full mastery they have of this branch of the industry. The Parliamentary Secretary should let nothing stand in his way in getting into contact with them and making arrangements to bring all the resources that they possess into the furthering of this industry and putting the Gaeltacht areas into the way of earning money instead of having the people of these areas going around in the way they have been going for the last eight or nine years.  It was pathetic to watch these fine, brave people deteriorating year by year.  If Deputies will look through the Estimates for the last six or seven years, they will see the miserable amount of money that went out to these areas from the Department, where thousands of pounds used to go.  In a little fishing village along the seacoast you could see an old man, over 70 years of age, out with a rake putting in some little stocks of seeds.</P>
    <P>Talk about the deserted village, it was nothing compared to it.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary as a sensible man ought to tackle this question courageously. The scarcity of fertilisers gives him a golden opportunity and I would appeal to him to take full advantage of it.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene on this Estimate, only for a few brief <Col N="1745" /> moments, to speak on behalf of the seed potato growers in Athlone area. I had occasion to be present at a meeting when there were at least 30 of them present and they all more or less reiterated the suggestions made by the previous Deputy in regard to potash.  As I understand it, when a fertiliser such as potash becomes scarce, a farmer will pay a far higher price for it than he would consider possible in normal circumstances. There is a complete scarcity of potash in Athlone as in other areas.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he has any figures that he could give to the House as to the estimated cost of producing potash from burning kelp for delivery to a central area such as Athlone compared with the estimated cost of delivering unprepared kelp in such an area.  I should also like to know whether any representations have been made to him by the Department of Agriculture or by seed potato growers in general as to how much more farmers may be prepared to pay for potash, now that they are faced with the possibility of having no other fertilisers.  As I understand it, the price would be very much in excess of what would have been thought possible before the war started.  There is no question but that the high yield which is normally obtained in Athlone area will not be forthcoming unless potash can be procured.  It is a product which should provide a considerable amount of employment in its collection.  There are however, difficulties to be encountered in its delivery.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to let us know what information he has on the matter and whether he has made any recent inquiries as to the price people would be prepared to pay for this all-important commodity which is so essential in preserving the high yield of potatoes which has been the rule in many districts, particularly in Athlone.</P>

      <P>While the Estimates for Public Services in this country have been increasing year after year, until the figure has now reached £35,000,000, it is rather remarkable that, in spite of all the promises which have been made by the Government to relieve the poorer areas, this is the <Col N="1748" /> one Estimate which has been decreasing during the last three years.  We see that in 1938-39 the Estimate was for £100,000; in 1939-40 the amount was £96,000, and in the present Estimate the amount is £38,000.  I do not profess to know a great lot about the Gaeltacht, but, if the Government are really sincere in their desire to help those people, something more should be done.  If we look through the Estimate we will find that for each year the salaries and allowances for the service have increased.  I admit that a fair amount has been done for the Gaeltacht, but certainly something more should be done.  If we take one heading there, sub-head D (6), the buying of cloth, it will be seen that it has gone down from £70,000 to £61,500.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take his job seriously, and to see that those people get the assistance which they need.  We know the conditions under which they are living in the present year, and there is a serious lack of seed potatoes in the district.  I think a good deal more could be done by that Department.  In the Estimate one can see that the salaries and allowances of the officials are still up to a very high mark, and yet inside three years the Estimate has been reduced from £100,000 to £86,000.  I think that requires some explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers has asked the Parliamentary Secretary to give serious consideration to the utilisation of kelp. Some few months ago Deputy Mongan showed me some figures which were rather startling.  They had relation to the amount of potash that could be produced.  It was bought by firms in Galway and if that scheme was then a success, it should be much more successful now.  It was carried on for three or four years, and each year the amount paid in wages and the amount of potash produced noticeably increased. The scheme was carried on largely during the last Great War.  I cannot understand why a highly successful scheme should not be operated at the present time.  As Deputy Childers pointed out, people are prepared to pay more for their potash at the present time, but unfortunately <Col N="1749" /> it cannot be procured. There is little use in Ministers advising us to till more when we have not the necessary quantities of manures.  If the area of land ploughed at the present time was reduced by one-third, I believe you would have much more production, because you cannot have a proper cultivation of crops unless you have a sufficient quantity of some form of manure put on the land, and particularly on the poor land in the West and South of Eire.  That applies especially where people are continuously cropping the land.  There are small holdings in the Gaeltacht, some of them with a valuation of 7/6, 5/-, and some as low as 3/-, and how can you expect those people to produce an adequate supply of food?</P>
    <P>So far as seaweed is concerned, some 20 or 23 years ago it formed a very big business in the West.  It was carted from the shore, and I learned at the time that where people had small holdings along the seashore they were paying foreshore rents.  They were able to pay those rents then because there was a good trade in seaweed. The people were getting excellent results through using the seaweed.  It used to be carted a long distance.  I know of 30 farmers in one district who are anxious to get seaweed for the purpose of producing crops, but they have no method of transporting it from the seashore.  I should like to issue a warning to the Parliamentary Secretary. There is a lot of talk about essential services, and we are told that petrol can be used only for essential services.  I suggest that the most essential service is the production of food for the people, and every attention should be given to that matter. The Parliamentary Secretary should use his influence with the Minister for Supplies to see that some allowance is made for those people who are anxious to get seaweed for their land, and are prepared to pay well for it, but are prevented from getting it through lack of transport.  I appeal to him to have investigations made with regard to the production of potash, as suggested by Deputy Childers and Deputy Mongan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to say anything on the Estimate, but it is not easy to listen patiently to the position being painted as black as it possibly could be and much blacker than it really is. I am quite satisfied about one thing, that is, that the people in the Gaeltacht are certain that more has been done for them, not alone through this Department, which is very much handicapped as everybody knows, but in various other ways than was done for them previously.  With regard to kelp, it is very easy to quote the prices paid now and those paid during the last war.  During the last war, kelp went as high as £15 a ton, but we all know that there was a very big demand for iodine at that period, and that the other sources of iodine which have since become available were not then there, or were too far away.  While kelp was being burned to extract iodine as a primary product and potash merely as a by-product, it is obvious that the value of kelp then was much greater than now.  I cannot discuss with any degree of expert knowledge the economics of the production of potash from kelp, but I have been reliably informed that the burning of <Col N="1751" /> kelp for the extraction of potash is not nearly as economic a proposition as burning it for the production of iodine and potash.  I think that would be an obvious fact.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy, and I complain that undue emphasis is being laid on things that are not quite so essential.  I would not say they are non-essentials because kelp is a matter of first-class importance in the Gaeltacht areas, but if the Government are to be asked to pay a dole in the form of an extravagant price for kelp, I would say to them: &ldquo;If you want to pay a dole in that way, pay it decently, honestly and openly, and do not spoil a trade which will possibly get on its feet later on.&rdquo; The price of £5 and £5 10s. proposed to be paid is regarded by the kelpers in Connemara, at all events, as making it worth their while to gather kelp and burn it.  They have told me that themselves within the past month.  The only complaint I had in one place was that they were obliged to carry the kelp eight miles to store it, when there was storage available in their own locality, that is, in Renvyle, and I remind the Parliamentary Secretary of recent representations I made to him on that matter.</P>
      <P>I referred in Irish to the conflict of opinion on this question of the transportation of dry weed from the seashore to inland places.  Deputy Brodrick gives the impression that it is quite an easy matter to bring seaweed from the seashore to almost any inland point.  I was at a meeting of parish councils in Recess quite recently. There were delegates there from Recess, Cashel and other places and their views were freely discussed. The Cashel delegates mentioned the minimum figure at which it would pay them to collect the weed at Cashel, and the Recess delegates stated the maximum figure they could afford to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a big disparity between the two figures, and if there is that <Col N="1752" /> disparity between the minimum production cost and the maximum price which people, miles away, can afford to pay, it is obvious that there are big difficulties in the matter of the transportation of weed.  I do not wish to be understood as indicating that the Department ought not to try everything possible to surmount these difficulties. I do not say that very much can be done in the matter of making large supplies of seaweed available this season, but I have satisfied myself that every aspect of this question of marine products and everything of intimate concern to the Gaeltacht has received, and is receiving, the very close attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tweed industry, I am sorry that it does not concern us in Connemara quite so much as other parts of the Gaeltacht, but I am glad to know, in spite of the adverse criticism we have heard to-night&mdash;and I have information from people closely connected with the tweed business&mdash; that the tweed industry has been very much improved in recent years.  The designs and the output have been improved and Gaeltacht tweeds are products which now stand on their own merits.  The Gaeltacht is served as much by other Departments as by this in the matter of the spending of money, the main function of this Department, I take it, being to try to keep going the little industries which always existed there and which are peculiarly suited to the area.  There are many difficulties in doing that, and a great many of these industries probably cannot be kept going on an economic basis, but, in my opinion, the Department is justified in losing money in keeping them going in the hope that times may improve.</P>
    <P>While doing that, there is a limit beyond which the public purse will not allow them to go, but I am satisfied that wherever a reasonable proposition is put up, it receives the sympatnetic consideration of the Gaeltacht Services Department, which, if it has not written a glorious page, has at least done sufficient to justify its existence and it ought not to be scrapped until <Col N="1753" /> something with much greater promise can be put in its place.</P>
    <P>I rose, as I said in Irish, to endorse the remarks of Deputy Breslin in support of the Department and as a counter-blast to the jeremiads we have heard about it.  I read some speeches recently made at a meeting of parish councils in Maam Cross.  While Deputy Keane and myself were not invited to attend that meeting, we got the benefit of the statements made there in the local papers.  The statements made there as to the treatment of the Gaeltacht by the present Government, if the people were gullible enough to believe them, would be sufficient to create any amount of discontent amongst the poor, but the poor, I know, in the Gaeltacht areas do not believe these statements.  They know that the Government is sympathetic and doing as much as it can to help them.  At present, when nobody knows what the future holds, I am quite satisfied, from moving amongst the people, that they feel much more satisfied and secure on their small patches of land, with their potatoes and oats, their banks of turf and their little bit of fishing, than people living in any town in any part of Ireland.  In these backward areas, they feel also very much more secure in another way, that is, that if this country should be involved in the war, they will not be in the front line.</P>
    <P>They appreciate all these things and if we are looking for a permanent solution of the Gaeltacht problem, in my opinion, that solution cannot be found from resources within the Gaeltacht, no matter what body of men you bring together or what Department you put in charge of it.  Even if you develop all the possibilities, all the industries that are native to the place, the fishing, the bogs and all the other things, to their fullest capacity you will still have a very large number of people in those areas below the poverty line.  For that reason I have always held, and my opinion is shared very widely by people who have considered this problem thoroughly, that while you have a large number of holdings in the congested areas, the <Col N="1754" /> problem will always remain.  That brings us back again to the fundamental solution, that is, a considerable reduction in the number of these holdings and the migration of as many people as possible to the good lands while there are still any good lands available.  The Land Commission has been dividing land at a fairly rapid rate, and I appeal to this Department to do whatever it can, in conjunction with the major section of the Department, the Land Commission, to ensure that the question of migration is never allowed to be lost sight of.  When the maximum amount of migration has been carried out, and not until then, all these Gaeltacht industries will have their full effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question, but I can assure the Deputy that the extraction of iodine was the major purpose for which the kelp was burned, and not for manurial purposes. The potash in those days, according to my information, was a by-product.  At all events, there was a double purpose served&mdash;the extraction of iodine and the production of potash.  Now I understand it has to be burned for the production of potash alone and obviously the price cannot be as high as when two products were being got from it.</P>

      <P>The last Deputy who spoke said he is satisfied with the amount provided in this Estimate, but I wonder if the people of the Gaeltacht in general are satisfied to see the amount down by practically £12,000 from two years ago?  It is a great pity to find at this time the Estimate reduced. To my mind, this is the one Estimate out of the 72 in the Book in which there should not be a reduction. I criticise expenditure in many of the other Estimates, but this is an Estimate on which, in existing conditions, there should be increased expenditure, and it is a great pity that, now when the opportunity offers, there should be a decrease in it.  Take, for instance, the item to which Deputy McMenamin referred, the toy industry.  That is an industry that could be developed.  We got toys from Japan and from Central Europe, and these will not now come in.  Our kiddies will want the toys, and the toy industry is one which could be developed, and which would bring in a lot of money to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal matter to which I want to refer, and which has been referred to by every Deputy, is the matter of kelp and seaweed.  When there is an absolute famine in artificial manures, when we are trying to produce food, when we have appeals from all quarters to produce food, and an endeavour being made by everybody to produce as much as possible&mdash;we do not feel the need for it so much this year because we have a certain quantity of manure on hands, but we shall have no phosphatic manures next year, and neither will we have any nitrogenous manures next year, and the only thing we can fall back on is potash, of which we have thousands of tons along our seaboard, and we have our people idle along our <Col N="1756" /> seaboard&mdash;why, in the name of God, when there is such a demand for it, when it is absolutely necessary that we should have potash in some shape or form for the production of a good quality eating potato, for the production of suitable wheat for milling, for the production of sugar beet, or the production of any crop, do we not use the potash available in the kelp and seaweed combination?  There is in seaweed a complete manure, and it is going to waste along our seaboard, while our people there are idle.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum in connection with this Estimate sets out that provision is made for the purchase of 800 tons of kelp this year.  How far will 800 tons go?  What employment will it give?  Reference was made by the Deputy for Galway to a meeting held in that county.  I happen to have seen the report of that meeting, and it is extraordinary that the men who will bear the brunt of this, who will have to go out to sea in the cold and wet, and face all sorts of weather, will get only about 2/- a day for their work. I am satisfied that they are not very far out in the statement that these men will have to work for about 2/- a day, while those on the sheltered side, the storage, grinding, screening and bagging will get the most of the £10,000 allowed.  They will get the lion's share of it, while the poor fellows who go out to sea will get 2/- a day.  It would not give them &ldquo;scratch cabbage&rdquo; for their dinner, and I suppose everybody knows what &ldquo;scratch cabbage&rdquo; is.  It is ridiculous, at this time of stress and strain, with the stuff available at our doors and with the people willing and anxious to do their bit, that the Government would not step in and do everything to encourage the production of food for next year by providing the wherewithal in the shape of potassic manure.</P>
    <P>I see in this explanatory statement that provision is made for the purchase only of 800 tons of kelp, but it is stated that it is understood that all kelp available will be bought.  I wonder what is meant by that.  Is it that if there are more than 800 tons produced money will be provided to buy <Col N="1757" /> it?  If that is so, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to stress it, so that publicity would be given to the fact that if more kelp than the 800 tons is available it will be bought, irrespective of the amount.  It is important that that should receive full publicity because there are people who would be very anxious to gather seaweed and burn it for kelp if they were sure it would be bought.  I put a question to the Minister for Agriculture about a month ago about the encouragement of the kelp industry and about trying to commence the seaweed harvest in this month and the month of May&mdash;the two months in which the weed is at its best.  He said that, if there were no extraction of iodine, the harvesting of seaweed for kelp would be an uneconomic proposition.  I think he said that kelp would be selling at 8/- or 9/- a cwt.  The Department of Agriculture are at present advertising supplies of muriate of potash for flax-growers at £1 per cwt.  I would guarantee that there would be as much potash in the kelp we would manufacture as there is in that muriate of potash advertised at £1 per cwt.  If farmers were sure of getting their share of kelp they would be prepared to pay a little extra for the advantage. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will stress that point&mdash;that all the kelp harvested and burned this year will be bought.</P>
    <P>My next point is as regards carrageen. The incidental expenses are very high.  There is very little left for the actual workers after the costs of handling are deducted.  Some people get all the advantage, and the people who have to go out on the rocks and collect the carrageen get nothing out of it.  Ten or 12 years ago, the Government of the day advertised the food value of carrageen.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should encourage the use of carrageen by advertising in the same fashion as is done in connection with potatoes, wheat, beet, oats and barley.  Carrageen should be better advertised, and I believe there would be little difficulty in getting a good export market if the matter were properly handled.  There are hundreds of tons of carrageen <Col N="1758" /> available for the gathering if the Parliamentary Secretary would take his courage in his hands and tackle the problem.  It is a pity that these things, which may be small in their way, are not properly developed because they could give help to people who are badly in need of it, and would set money circulating amongst the sections where it is most desirable it should circulate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Brennan, I know that McDonagh's, of Galway, during the last war extracted no iodine from the seaweed.  It was used solely for the production of potash as manure.  Why should anybody, then, put up the excuse that if iodine is not extracted the production of kelp will be uneconomic? I do not remember the price paid for kelp during the last war.  I know that prices for manures and everything else soared higher than they did during this war, but I do not think that the price of kelp was at all as high as the price advertised for muriate of potash for flax-growers to-day. This matter is of the utmost importance to the country.  Both the gathering and the transport of the weed are of importance.  It should be regarded as one of the essential services, and petrol should be made available for transport so that the weed can be brought inland wherever it is required.  The Parliamentary Secretary will, in the course of the year, bring in a Supplementary Estimate. I hope that when the main Estimate comes before us next year we shall have the satisfaction of saying that we had sufficient potash to grow all the crops we wanted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Parliamentary Secretary will not be in a position to carry out a seaweed scheme on as wide a basis as really ought to be done, because, after all, his jurisdiction extends only over the Gaeltacht area as far as this particular service is concerned, while everybody knows that there is as much seaweed on the shores of the rest of Ireland as there is in that area.  My suggestion is that this is a matter that could not be dealt with solely by this Department, and that the best day's work, so far as the supplying of fertilisers is concerned, <Col N="1761" /> the Parliamentary Secretary could do is, in co-ordination with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Supplies, to adopt a general scheme for the whole country.  Of course, in the Gaeltacht areas there are possibly more people available for employment at that work than in some of the other areas; but in all the coastal areas there are a number of people available for it.  If the scheme is to be worth while it will have to be carried out on a big scale.  There is very little use in tackling it in such a way that manure will only be available in small quantities in some areas and not available at all in others.  The inland areas will be as much in need of manure as the seaboard areas.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Supplies to co-operate in getting the material and delivering it to the central areas.  My experience is that, owing to the shortage of artificial manure, people have dropped certain types of crops and put in other crops, and very often it is the most necessary crops, such as seed potatoes and sugar beet, that are dropped, because it is necessary to have artificial manure for these.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary could do a really good job if he got in touch with the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Supplies and tried to have a scheme adopted whereby every available ton of seaweed will be got this year and made available for next year.</P>
      <P>So far as transport is concerned, there may be difficulties in getting petrol, but to my mind the providing of transport for such a scheme would be just as necessary as for the delivery of turf, because I believe that next year we will be facing a situation in which, in the central areas, people who want to sow crops like seed potatoes, wheat and beet will have no possibility of getting any manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the manure is there on our seaboard, such a scheme would be just as valuable, to my mind, as the turf production scheme.  There will be people <Col N="1762" /> available for work, and we should get co-operation from everybody.  If the people on the seaboard and within reasonable distance of it try to get delivery as best they can with horses and carts, it should be very easy to provide for the delivery inland by making arrangements for transport.</P>
    <P>As to the toy industry, the only thing I know about it is that I heard people say last Christmas that toys were very dear.  As to the truth of that I do not know.  As far as the retail shops in the cities are concerned, everyone I heard speak about the matter said that ridiculously high prices were charged for toys.  I have been shown small toys in which there was not very much material for which very high prices were charged.  Whether that is the responsibility of this Department or not I do not know.  I should also like to know whether there is any particular mark on the toys made in the Gaeltacht factories by which they could be identified.</P>
    <P>I asked a number of people who had bought small wooden and other toys if they knew whether they were made in the Gaeltacht.  They said that they looked at a number of articles in the shop but could not find anything on them by which to identify them.  They agreed, however, that they were very dear.  So far as I know, even in the smaller shops in the country where dearer toys would not generally be sold, the cheaper toys that they would normally sell around Christmas were not available this year.  I am giving that information for what it is worth and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to refer to is one which I have mentioned on other occasions, and that is the necessity for a campaign for the increased sale of our own tweeds inside the country.  I believe the ladies are doing their part and buying Gaeltacht tweeds in a far greater proportion than the men.  I am afraid that until we get over the mentality that exists, particularly in the rural areas and small country towns, with regard to a conservative type of clothes for men, <Col N="1763" /> we will not get very much extra sale for Gaeltacht tweeds there.  In these areas they stick rigidly to the &ldquo;Sunday blue&rdquo; and no attempt is made to popularise Gaeltacht tweeds for men.</P>
    <P>So far as the ladies are concerned, they will be in the fashion, but men and boys in comparatively poor circumstances pay extremely high prices for blue serge suits, when for the same money they could buy a very good suit of Gaeltacht tweed.  I think the main reason is that young fellows do not want to be too different from their neighbours and will not break out into a new style in their own small townlands. A little bit of encouragement by way of advertising might help a lot in this matter.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say if there is much demand from traders in small country towns for these tweeds?  I do not think that they push the sale of Irish tweeds in these country towns.  The tendency is to carry on as their fathers and grandfathers did before them.  I think an intensified campaign of publicity in the rural areas would help a lot in this matter.  If the men did as much, from the point of view of buying them, as the ladies are doing, the Department would probably sell a lot more of these Gaeltacht tweeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy make an appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to scrap the Gaeltacht services.  Things must be very bad indeed with these services when such an appeal comes from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I find that the amount of wages disbursed each year in connection with these services has progressively increased since 1935.  In 1935-36 the amount disbursed was £9,802; in 1936-37, £12,768; in 1937-38, £14,680; in 1938-39, £18,766; in 1939-40, £26,301.  The amount estimated for 1940-41 was £37,000, and this year's Estimate is £40,700.  It will be seen from these figures how important it is for the people of the Gaeltacht that those industries should be kept going, particularly at the present time.  I am in thorough agreement with those who say they should be kept going.  I wonder, however, are <Col N="1764" /> we getting value for the money voted? On Saturday last the Taoiseach addressed a meeting of represenatives of parish councils in the County Mayo at Castlebar.  That meeting was representative of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  In the course of his address he promised that employment was going to be given for 70,000 people on the bogs and in tilling the arable land of the area.  In spite of that, two days later&mdash;yesterday&mdash; 900 young men left the County Mayo for work in England, practically all of them from the Gaeltacht districts. That fact, in itself, is proof that they are not satisfied with present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the people in the Gaeltacht have no confidence in the present Government.  About £6,000 worth of kelp was produced there last year and about £250 worth of carrageen was purchased.  These figures indicate that the sooner some little industries are started in the Gaeltacht to help the people the better.  Reference has been made to migration from the Gaeltacht, I would appeal to the Government to see that that work is speeded up. Despite the fact that these migration schemes have been in operation for the last nine or ten years, very little in that direction has been done by the present Government.  They have migrated about 90 families from the County Mayo, or on an average, ten families every year over the last ten years.  In my opinion the country is not getting value for the money that is being spent on this Department.  I believe it is the opinion of members in every part of the House that everything possible should be done to increase the production of kelp and of potash from kelp.  The increase that has taken place as regards carrageen has been very small.  In view of the scarcity of fertilisers and of the possibility, in fact one might almost say the certainty, of this country not being able to obtain supplies from outside for some time in the future, the Parliamentary Secretary should, in my opinion, do everything in his power to increase the production of kelp and of potash from it.  We all have to deplore present conditions, but in view <Col N="1765" /> of them I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will respond to the appeal that I have made to him in connection with the production of kelp.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to many of the Deputies on the Opposition Benches that, in future, they should examine the Estimates more closely before committing themselves to such statements as we have had from them this evening.  Listening to them one would imagine that there is a reduction in the amount of money that is being spent in the Gaeltacht. That is not so.  In past years Deputy Dockrell used to criticise the manner in which the accounts of the Departments were presented to the House. I am sorry the Deputy is not here tonight. If he were I think he would be agreeably surprised to know the reason why a reduced Estimate is being brought in this year, the reason being that as our sales here have increased we do not need to ask for as much money as in former years.  Contrary to views expressed by Deputies on the Opposition Benches, the amount of money that is being spent in the Gaeltacht by this Department, and other Departments, has been increasing year by year.  For instance, there has been an increase in the sales of tweeds.  Deputy McMenamin seems to claim credit for that, following the adverse criticism which we heard from him in previous years on the Estimate. In my opinion, the credit belongs to the expert technicians employed by the Department.  They have improved the designs for these tweeds to such an extent that even Deputy Dillon was constrained to pay a tribute to them, telling us that they can hold their own with the products of any other mill or factory, not only here but elsewhere. The sale of these tweeds has increased by 58 per cent. during the past year.  In view of present conditions, and of the difficulties that we have to contend with, I should like to know if there is any other manufacturing concern in this country that can boast of a similar increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching this problem of the Gaeltacht, many people forget that there one is dealing with land that has <Col N="1766" /> not been blessed by Providence, or with many of the things that go to enrich a people.  Most of the land there, if one may call it land, is of very poor quality.  These districts are densely populated.  We have tried, time and again, to induce outside manufacturers to go into the Gaeltacht, but for very obvious reasons they are reluctant to do so.  It is much easier for a manufacturer to commence business in a city like Dublin, a great centre for the sale and distribution of his wares, than to go into some remote and backward place in the Gaeltacht where, for one thing, he will be handicapped by extra transport charges.  Every day of every month this problem is being examined in the Department and with a certain amount of success.  Our sales have increased.  We are hopeful that they will continue to increase, and that it may be possible to create more new industries in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley, I think, more or less anticipated my own statement and left me very little to reply to, but there remain some points with which I should like to deal.  Deputy McMenamin was the first speaker who referred to the decrease in the provision for materials, but the reason for that is not the one which the Deputy would seem to convey. It is due to the foresight of the officers of my Department in providing the wherewithal to carry on these particular industries, by making provision for yarns during the past few years and in anticipating the difficulties which we are now experiencing when it is extremely difficult to provide yarns or anything else or to import anything from outside.  That is why it is not necessary in this year to make the same increased provision which we had to make in previous years.  Far from being reproached on the subject, I think the officers of my Department deserve every credit for having had foresight in dealing with this matter. Other spokesmen on the Opposition side dealt with the question of kelp production and of seaweed.  We have not been oblivious of the existence of kelp, but as a source of fertiliser it has its limitations.  Its comparison with muriate of potash has been made here, <Col N="1767" /> and the suggestion has been made that both have the same content of potash. I understand, however, that the potash content of muriate of potash is 60 per cent. and the potash content of kelp is 16 to 18 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, three cwt. of kelp next year would do as much as the one cwt. of muriate of potash that we will not get?</P>

Immediately after the outbreak of war I personally convened a meeting&mdash;an inter-Departmental conference &mdash;to deal with this very special subject of the production of potash. Representatives were there from the various Departments concerned and we went very fully into this matter. I then discovered, to my surprise, that the cost of potash made from kelp would work out at approximately £25 per ton.</P>

      <P>Much play has been made about events of ten or 20 years ago at a time when iodine was being manufactured from kelp, when the price of iodine was 16/9 per lb.  To-day the price is 8/3: hence the difference. We have made arrangements with the firm mentioned.  While in business they found it profitable to pay £15 or £20 a ton ten or 20 years ago and there is no difficulty preventing them from doing so now.  Apart from that, we have also entered into an arrangement with two other firms in the West. These have undertaken to purchase seaweed, which is being used for another purpose.  These two firms have come into the business in recent years and every help which my Department can give to them and to the other firms previously referred to is being given.  I believe it is the better policy to induce firms like that to go into this or any other business in the Gaeltacht than for any Department of State to undertake the work directly.</P>
      <P>I believe it was Deputy Linehan who referred to the price of toys.  I should like to correct the Deputy in that respect.  In my opinion the toys are not dear.  That is also the opinion of people in the trade who know a considerable amount about toys.  The course I would like to pursue is to increase the price of toys and to pay an even higher wage to the workers than obtains at present.  The price is based on the cost of production&mdash;on the wages paid, the cost of materials and a certain allowance for overheads. After all, toys&mdash;especially good toys&mdash;are more or less a luxury article, and I believe the people engaged in the manufacture of luxury articles should be paid a fairly good wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> Some Deputies seemed to be under the impression that we were making inadequate provision for the continuation of the toy industry this year.  That is not so.  The sales of toys last year &mdash;I am sure many people will be interested to know&mdash;was almost £26,000.  I consider that that is a fairly decent turnover for an industry recently established.  As a matter of fact, it was only in recent days that the new factory was completed and in process of taking over at Elly Bay. Unfortunately, the previous building there was burned down and the Department had to take over the place and with their own men rebuild that factory.  They have made a fairly decent job of it in a reasonably short space of time, and that is a bit unusual where Government Departments are concerned.  Personally, I am very pleased with the progress made in the <Col N="1770" /> toy industry and with the erection of that toy factory.</P>
    <P>In connection with another factory at Kilcar, we have been experiencing some difficulties with the establishment of the spinning mill, firstly, in securing the advice of a proper technician. Having secured a suitable technician, some considerable time was lost in negotiating as to the lay-out of the factory and the different machines which would be necessary.  However, that matter also is being pursued and no time will be lost.  We hope to go ahead with the erection of the factory as speedily as possible.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. till Thursday, 24th April, at 3 p.m.</P>
