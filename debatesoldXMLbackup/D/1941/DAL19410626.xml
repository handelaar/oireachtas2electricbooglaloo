    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he will lay on the Table of the Dáil the agreements which he has made with the boot manufacturers and woollen textile manufacturers whereunder they agreed not to raise the prices of their products during the last 12 or 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>No agreement of the kind mentioned in the question was made.  For some months past the price of goods produced by these manufacturers has been the subject of a special investigation and, as I have explained to the Dáil (Vol. 83, Col. 2066), arrangements were made with the manufacturers individually as to prices.  These arrangements vary with the circumstances of each case and are not of a nature which could be tabled in the Dáil.  It can be said, however, that the effect <Col N="324" /> of the arrangements is a general reduction in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Dues the Minister recall stating in Dáil Éireann, at column 2354 of volume 83.  No. 7, on the 19th June, that the prices of boots and shoes were generally lower than they were this time last year and, at column 2355 of the same volume, that an arrangement had been made with the boot manufacturers under which their prices were reduced as compared with the prices prevailing last year?  Is he further aware that boot No. 478 cost 18/6 in January, 1939; 21/- in October, 1939, and 22/6 in November, 1940?  Is he further aware that boot No. 1921 cost 16/4 in May, 1939; 17/6 in December, 1939; 20/9 in October, 1940, and 21/3 in November, 1940 f In view of these facts, does he still adhere to his statement that the prices of boots are substantially lower than or the same&mdash;they were last year and that he has an agreement with the boot manufacturers to that end?  Has the Minister any reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take a speech to reply to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the facts not true that the price of boot's has gone up 20 per cent. and that the Minister has had wool pulled over his eyes or is attempting to pull wool over the eyes of Dáil Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely stated facts, that arrangements were made.  If the Deputy will read the reference which I have given in my reply he will find set out there, not merely the experience of my Department in the matter of price control in respect of manufacturers' products, but also the procedure now being adopted which involves, not the making of price arrangements in respect of commodities generally, but arrangements with individual manufacturers.  That change in the procedure has resulted in a general reduction in the prices of these commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I am giving him one of several <Col N="325" /> numbers from the ranges of two of the principal boot manufacturers in this country which represent an increase of 20 per cent. in their prices?  How does he reconcile that with the statement I have quoted from his speech at column 2355 in which he says that the prices of boot manufacturers were reduced as compared with the prices prevailing last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make it quite clear that I did not state at any time that the prices now prevailing were lower than or equal to the prices which prevailed before the war?  That could not have been expected.  What I did state was that during the course of last year, as a result of these individual arrangements with manufacturers, a lowering of prices generally was effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy may not quote the same words three times in supplementary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting the same words.  The Minister says he did not allege that boots were cheaper now than before the war.  I am drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that in December, 1939, after the war began, the price was 17/6; in October, 1940, 12 months after the war began, the price was 20/9, and a month later, in November, 1940, the price had gone up to 21/3.  Either the Minister is being deceived or else he is trying to deceive the House.  That should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these suggestions that I am trying to deceive the House should not be permitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is not permissible to allege that a Minister has deliberately deceived the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to state to the House, is it true <Col N="326" /> that he has been deceived or, knowing the facts, has he sought to deceive us? If he has been deceived, why does he not take steps to ensure that he will not be deceived in future?</P>

      <P>Statements as to loans guaranteed under the provisions of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1924-1934 and 1939, and accounts of the total sums which have been issued out of the Central Fund and of the total sums which have been paid into the Exchequer in repayment of sums so issued are furnished to the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act of 1924 and Section 11 of the Act of 1939.  Statements and accounts covering the periods ended 22nd April, 1941, and 31st March, 1941, respectively, have been laid on the Tables of the Dáil and the Seanad and are available in the official Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business on the Order Paper in the following order:&mdash; Nos. 3, 4 and 2; Nos. 7 and 1 (Vote 41) 10 be taken at 7 o'clock.  When Nos. 7 and 1 (Vote 41) are completed, the interrupted business will be resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper in the names of Deputies of this Party relating to the annulment of Emergency Powers Order No. 83.  That order may be annulled within 21 days after its issue.  The 21 days will expire to-morrow.  I can hardly imagine it is the policy of the Government to burke discussion of this order, which has such widespread ramifications so far as the masses of the workers of this country are concerned. <Col N="327" /> Would the Tánaiste, therefore, indicate when it is proposed to make time available for the discussion of this motion, so that we may have an opportunity in Parliament of reviewing the operations of that order, and of directing the attention of the House to its unfavourable repercussions on the workers?  It must be done by to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very unworthy suggestion from the Deputy that the Government has any intention of burking discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I could scarcely believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the suggestion behind the Deputy's statement, that the Government wanted to burke discussion, when, at the Deputy's own request, after a day was fixed for it at the Deputy's own request, the discussion was adjourned.  Is not that a fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked that the discussion should not take place on the date that was fixed. Therefore, I think the Deputy's suggestion is an unworthy one.  I would like, and the Government would like, to facilitate the Deputies and the House in having a discussion on this matter, but I do not see, as the business now stands, how it is going to be done.  We would like to do it.  If there is any way in which time could be arranged for it, I would be very happy; so would the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is apparently unaware of the circumstances surrounding the case.  A discussion took, place between the Trade Union Congress and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the question of the Trade Union Bill and of Emergency Powers Order No. 83.  It was arranged at that discussion that a further conference between the parties concerned would take place.  The Trade Union Congress at that stage hoped that, as a result <Col N="328" /> of the further discussions, and as a result of the instances of hardship which they quoted at the discussion, the Government might see fit to alter their policy in respect of this particular order.  At the request of the Trade Union Congress we agreed, therefore, not to have a discussion on Emergency Powers Order No. 83, in the hope that on further consideration of the matter the Government wouldalter its policy.  It was in those circumstances, because that discussion was pending and because we thought some fruitful results would flow from it, that we agreed to the postponement of the discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That you asked for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Asked&rdquo; if you like. While the matter was still undecided between the Trade Union Congress&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That had nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Minister may think it had nothing to do with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We know now that the Government were just as obdurate in the end as they were in the beginning, but we thought that the Government might consider the wisdom of abandoning that policy.  In order to give them an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Trade Union Congress, therefore, we asked that the matter should be allowed to remain over pending that discussion, but we did not assume that that would automatically strangle our right to have this matter raised in the Dáil.  There is no difficulty in providing time for the discussion of this motion.  We are dealing with a Trade Union Bill which nobody wants, and which nobody has asked for.  Not a single member on the Government Benches has been allowed to speak on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue the Bill at all.  I will do that in its <Col N="329" /> own good time.  We are discussing a Trade Union Bill on which not a single member of the Government Party has any view, or, if he has any view, he has not been allowed to express it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope we will hear the Deputy this evening, and we hope we will hear Deputy Meaney too. Nobody wants this Bill at all.  What is the difficulty in leaving over this Trade Union Bill until next week?  It does not matter when it is passed. Nobody wants it.  What is the difficulty in proceeding to discuss Emergency Powers Order No. 83 let us say this evening at some agreed time?  We will agree to any reasonable time limit on the discussion, but we certainly ought not to be deprived of an opportunity of discussing this Emergency Powers Order.  The Tánaiste mentioned that we asked for a postponement in those circumstances.  Might I remind him that the Minister's Department was also anxious that there should be a postponement and agreed that we would have time to discuss it this week?  Are we now going to get that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it will not be argued that this Emergency Powers, Order should have irrevocable legislative effect without giving the Dáil an opportunity of discussing it, if discussion is wanted?  I think time ought to be provided this evening at whatever cost, because it is a very grave thing to let an order become irrevocable without a discussion in Dáil Éireann, if somebody wants to discuss it.  I submit that the Tánaiste ought to give time this evening, and that, if he does not give time, this Emergency <Col N="330" /> Powers Order ought to be cancelled and a fresh order made, with time provided for discussion of it on Tuesday next.  Something of that kind ought to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste lays great stress on the fact that we asked for a postponement.  Has he been made aware of the point to which Deputy Norton referred in passing?  I had been discussing this matter with the Whips. A fortnight ago, the Private Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce came down to me, after I had been discussing the matter with Deputy Smith, asking that it be postponed to this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>He asked whether I would be agreeable to have the motion postponed until this week, as it was hoped to have further conversations with the Trade Union Congress delegation. I said that, provided it fell within the 21 days, there was no objection. We agreed to that.  On checking up, we find that to-morrow is the last day.  The Tánaiste objects to the particular phrase used by Deputy <Col N="331" /> Norton, but I think Deputy Norton prefaced that by saying he was amazed on learning the position.  I have been told to-day by the Parliamentary Secretary that we will not get this until the Trade Union Bill has been cleared out of the way.  I could give no guarantee as to what time that would happen and he could give no guarantee as to an extension of the 21 days provided by parliamentary practice.  I think the question is whether or not we ought to get time this evening to enable us to get the minimum of four hours for this discussion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), page 7, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  If any trade union required to send a statement under this section fails so to do or sends a statement which, to the knowledge of such trade union, is false, such trade union shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of determining the amount of the deposit to be lodged by an authorised trade union.  Section 14 provides that within one month after every third anniversary of the date upon which the deposit under Section 7 of this Bill has been made, the trade union concerned will send to the Minister a statement of the number of its members on every such anniversary. The section further provides that, if it is necessary to increase or reduce such <Col N="334" /> deposit by any amount in order to make it equal to the appropriate sum, such trade union shall, not later than two months after such anniversary, increase such deposit by such amount or apply for the return out of such deposit of such amount (as the case may require).  The Bill as introduced contains no sanction against a breach of that requirement.  This amendment provides, accordingly, that if any trade union required to send a statement under this section fails to do so or sends a statement which, to the knowledge of such trade union, is false, such trade union shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>

Such an organisation cannot be prosecuted as an organisation &mdash; the only way would be to discover the people re-sponsible for this misfeasance, and in that way get the names and then prosecute. It is intended, apparently, not to prosecute the individuals, but to prosecute the union as a corporate body: but as it has no corporate existence will the Minister withdraw the amendment until he gives it more consideration?</P>

      <P>The House will remember that, under a previous section, we asked the House that authorised trade unions not registered in this country should name a person who will accept service and also provided that the deposit may be availed of for the payment of judgment debts. So, from the practical point of view, if we can ensure that the service will be properly made on the agent of the authorised but not registered trade union in this country, then, with the further machinery which we have under Section 15 I think we can make the penalty effective even against a body which has not been registered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing like making whoopee with other people's money.  That is what we are doing in this amendment.  By its terms, it regards as similar offences failure to send a statement and sending a false statement That seems to be rather curious reasoning.  One can understand that failure to send a return might be due to some kind of inadvertence or some kind of pleasure of business causing delay, or it might mean that the necessity for making a statement was overlooked.  That is one type of offence, which nobody ever regards <Col N="336" /> as very criminal The Department every day in the week reminds people that returns that they ought to have in on Midi a date are still outstanding and ought to be sent in.  Departments themselves, even in their relations with other Departments, are not too prompt in furnishing returns of that kind.  That is one type of offence.  That is the kind of thing that happens when you are dealing with human beings; it is just an expression of human frailty.  This section, however, also deals with sending in false returns, which is an entirely different type of offence.  Obviously, it ought to be made &ldquo;knowingly false.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the amendment: &ldquo;false to the knowledge of the person making it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  There are two types of offence here punishable by a fine not exceeding £100.  One is failure to send in a return which, as I say, may be due to inadvertence, to pressure of business, or to the fact that the matter was completely overlooked. Even Ministers can sometimes forget things and overlook things.  But there is another type of offence scheduled with failure to submit a return, and that is knowingly making a false return. How, by any process of reasoning, can you group these two offences together and say both are of equal gravity?  Surely, knowingly making a false return is a different type of offence from failing to send in a return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income tax authorities, for instance, send out reminders to folk who do not send in their income tax return in time.  It is not an uncommon thing for a potential taxpayer under the income tax code to get two, three, or four notices to send in a return.  The income tax authorities do not treat that in the same kind of way as the making of a false return for income tax purposes. Here, when you have got the money of the trade unions, and the money is safely deposited in the High Courts, it is proposed to make &ldquo;whoopee&rdquo; with the money and to fine a trade union £100 for failing to put in a return, and we treat that offence as if the union <Col N="337" /> had deliberately made a false return. How can the Minister justify that kind of equality between the two kinds of offence under the section?  I cannot see how the Minister can say that failing to send in a statement is of equal gravity with making a deliberately false statement.  In this section they are treated as similar types of offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in the section does not say any one of the things ascribed to him by Deputy Norton, because the Minister does not purport to adjudicate on the gravity of the offence. Certainly failure to send in a return may be a very serious offence, if it arises from wilful refusal to obey the law.  It may be a minor offence if it arises out of circumstances not fully within the control of the person who fails to make the return, or if it arises simply because of a minor dereliction of duty on the part of some officer of the union.  But the proper body to determine the gravity of each particular offence is the court.  All we are doing in this section is to say that, no matter how grave the offence may be, the penalty shall not exceed £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Or how trivial it may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Or how trivial it may be.  But we rely, as I suppose the House does and as I suppose the community in general does, upon the fact that under the law justice is done in this country as between persons, and that people are not drastically punished for trivial offences.  That is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, this fine can only be recovered after a summary conviction.  Government Departments are reasonable in these matters, and if it can be shown that the failure to make a return has been due to pressure of business, or overwork, or to a minor dereliction of duty on the part of some officer of the union, then I am sure proceedings would not be taken, and, if proceedings were taken in these circumstances, I am sure they would be scouted out of court by the tribunal. There is nothing in the point which the Deputy made.  We are not trying to <Col N="338" /> equate one class of offence with another; but we are trying to say in relation to both these offences &mdash; the failure to make a return, and the making of a false return &mdash; that, no matter how grave they are, the maximum penalty that can be imposed is £100.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to overlook the fact that this House is putting two offences on the same basis and intimating, through this piece of legislation, to the courts that the Legislature's intention was that it should be looked upon as equally serious whether it is merely an omission to send in a return or making a false return.  If an official of a trade union does not send in the return until a day beyond the time allowed according to this section, that is an offence so serious as to merit a penalty up to £100.  No court could look upon that as being a trivial offence in view of what is set out in the section.  No matter what the Minister may say, actually what we are doing is to provide the same penalty for deliberately putting in a false return and for the case of an official of a trade union who, instead of sending in the return within one month, allows one or two days over that time to elapse.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could also tell us about another small point in his proposed amendment: &ldquo;which to the knowledge of such trade union is false&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;to the knowledge of such trade union&rdquo; mean in that sense?  Does it mean to the knowledge of the secretary or of the executive committee, or of the trade union as a whole?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That again may be the Minister's opinion; but what we have to ask ourselves, before we pass a section like this, is how this will be read by the courts.  &ldquo;To the knowledge of such trade union&rdquo; seems to be an extraordinarily wide term to put into a section.</P>

    <Col N="339" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed under this section to impose a penalty up to £100 if, to the knowledge of a trade union, some statement found to be false is submitted in accordance with the requirements of the section.  I am not surprised at Deputy Norton laughing at the Minister's definition of those who represent a trade union.  The Minister says the committee of management will be the responsible authority in a case of this kind.  The more we discuss this Bill, the more we learn of the Minister's lack of knowledge of the contents of his own measure.  Will the Minister now give us a definition of what he means by a trade union, so far as responsibility for compliance with the law is concerned, in this particular amendment?</P>
      <P>If the Minister studies the rules of the different trade unions that may be concerned in a case of this kind he will find that the responsible people would not always fit into that phrase, &ldquo;committee of management.&rdquo; Would it be the president, would it be the president and the secretary combined, would it be the trustees, or would it be the executive elected annually by the members?  What party would be likely to be held responsible for the failure of the trade union to comply with a ridiculous requirement of this kind?  The offence, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, could be regarded, even by the Minister or by a judge or any impartial person deciding the question, as a very trivial offence, but, whether trivial or serious, the fine is going to be £100.  It is just the same as the Minister expecting that £2,000 will be handed to him by some of the organised bodies that have been in existence in this country for 150 years. If they do not fork out the £2,000, they disappear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a footy point. This sub-section concerns only the trade union as a corporate entity, if it complies with the requirements of Section 7, is registered under the Trade Union Acts of this country, has lodged the deposit and is the holder of a negotiation licence.  We do not mind whom the trade union holds responsible for failure to make a return, or for making a false return; we are not concerned with that, because it is a matter for the internal discipline, and organisation of the trade union.  All we are concerned with is that the holder of a negotiation licence, which can only be a trade union and not an officer of a trade union, shall make this return. Our concern is that whoever is the responsible agent will make the return. If the return is not made to the knowledge of the trade union, to the knowledge of the responsible officer, the officer deputed by the trade union to discharge that duty on its behalf, then the trade union is going to be liable.</P>
      <P>There is no question here of levying fines upon individual members of the trade union.  There is no question here of making officers of the trade union responsible.  We are making the trade union as a corporate body, itself responsible under the law for the act of its own officers, and if those officers fail to make the return, or make a false return, then the union must deal with them and we do not enter into the matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there was anything in the point made by Deputy Morrissey either.  He said that we are proposing to impose a fine of £100, irrespective <Col N="341" /> of the gravity of the offence, upon a person who makes a false return or tails to make a return.  That cannot possibly be read into the section.  The Deputy suggests that in all cases, irrespective of the circumstances, the trade union will be tilled £100.  What we are saying is that, before a fine can lie imposed, we must take proceedings before a court of law in this country and the judge on the bench will have an opportunity of considering the offence alleged and all the circumstances connected with it and of assessing for himself the seriousness or the trivality of the offence and imposing a fine accordingly.</P>
    <P>We are only saying in this section that no matter how grave the offence may be, the fine shall not exceed £100. It is entirely within the competence of the court to decide that the offence is of such a trivial nature that no fine will be imposed.  The judge on the bench may even rebuke the Minister and say the proceedings should never have been brought.  We are not, in this section, prescribing, as the Deputy suggests, that irrespective of the gravity of the offence or the circumstances connected with it the trade union will have to bear a fine of £100.</P>

Surely, we ought to make it as clear as possible to the courts, and it is not too much to expect that we should use ordinary intelligence in the drafting of amendments.  The Minister must know very little of the way in which trade unions carry out their business or he would not have said what he has said. Trade unions make returns of one kind or another, some of them routine returns relating to affairs of management, to income, to expenditure, to affiliation with other bodies, and to payments made on the basis of that affiliation.  That is all purely office routine.  Those returns may be signed by a member of the staff or an officer of the union, but to imagine that a whole executive council would be gathered from the four provinces to examine the statement that was being submitted, and to go back over the detailed work which the office staff in a trade union would do, in order to find out if they had miscalculated in regard to one member, would be equal to taking leave of one's senses.  That sort of thing never happens.</P>

    <P>The Minister suggests that the committee of management are to be responsible. What seems to be implied is this &mdash; that it the Minister wants a <Col N="343" /> return to be made, the committee of management are to be brought together and they are to be asked to check up on the entire membership of the union in order to see that the actual membership is represented by the figure compiled by the office staff or by an officer of the union.</P>
    <P>Does anybody imagine that to be a practical proposition?  Some unions might have an executive of 20 people, and they are asked to furnish returns of membership.  Are these 20 members to get at the register or card index and check them to ascertain whether in fact the figure proposed to be furnished is the correct figure?  No one in his senses would propose that an executive of a trade union should do that, and yet, according to the Minister, they would be guilty if they knowingly made a false statement.  The wording seems to imply that all on the committee of management must check the register of membership.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of one trade union with 40,000 or 50,000 members, and try to bring a little practical experience to the working of such a large organisation.  The entire executive, according to the Minister, is responsible for ensuring that the return is not knowingly false.  Does that impose on each of the members of the executive the obligation of counting the membership? In other words, counting 40,000 names to see if that is the correct membership.  In the course of a wearying task of that kind one member might discover 39,500, and another, owing to fatigue and exhaustion, discover 39,600 and others varying figures.  Is not that what they would have to do if they wanted to arrive at some measure of agreement, in order to discharge the obligation placed upon them, that the return should be knowingly true, in view of the penalties for submitting a knowingly false statement? It is clear to me that no thought has been given to such circumstances when a careless amendment of this type was tabled.  If the Minister only knew a little more about the manner in which returns of this kind were furnished, he would realise that <Col N="344" /> it is impracticable to impose a requirement of this kind on members of the executive of a union.  Yet, if the statement is knowingly false, the union will be punished, because the members of the executive, according to his requirement, are required to check the records individually so as to satisfy their consciences and so that, in relation to the unions, they may discharge their responsibilities conscientiously by making a correct return.</P>
    <P>The mentality revealed in Section 14 is entirely different from the mentality revealed in Sections 11 and 12.  In Section 11 the union and officers of the union are made responsible, but in this case the entire executive is made responsible. The Minister talked about unions fixing responsibility as to who was to make the return.  That is not legislation. We are supposed to be passing legislation.  The unions may decline to fix any responsibility.  I think the amendment discloses gross carelessness and inexperience.  The word &ldquo;gross&rdquo; does not even describe the position.  On the point made by Deputy Morrissey, it is perfectly true to say, in relation to this amendment, that we are classifying failure to make a return as an offence comparable with knowingly making a false statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not say all that in the amendment?  What is the purpose of keeping that in the recess of your mind.  Could not the courts be told that is what the legislature had in mind?  Why is not that put into the amendment so that the courts could be guided in ascertaining the nature of the offence before having to impose a fine.  In the amendment it is clearly indicated that by failing to make a return within the prescribed period, which may be due to an accidental omission on the part of a union, an offence can be committed &mdash; if, for instance, a union sends in a return a day late.  In that case it would be possible to sue a union and it minht be liable to a fine not <Col N="345" /> exceeding £100.  I cannot understand by what process of reasoning the Minister and his advisers came to the conclusion that failure to make a return, which might be due to inadvertence, was in the same category as knowingly making a false return.  The Minister said that the courts would have power to equate the punishment to the gravity of the offence.  In this section we are telling the courts that, as far as the Legislature is concerned, failure to make a return has the same significance as knowingly making a false return.  We all know of cases in the courts in which judges expressed the opinion that they would like to act in a certain way, but the legislation was there and they had no power to amend and must decide the law as laid down.  Judges have frequently commented on the fact that they were obliged to do certain things under Acts of Parliament and that it was a matter for the Legislature to amend the Acts.</P>
      <P>This is providing another piece of that type of ambiguity, and gives another opportunity for judges to say, as far as the Legislature is concerned, that failure to send a return is, in the viewpoint of the Legislature, an offence comparable with the offence of knowingly making a false return.  The Minister ought to take back the amendment and replace it with one which would have some sense.  If he wants to have any amendment he might have one which would not impose on members of the executive of a union the obligation of counting the membership records, numbering perhaps 40,000 and in some cases 20,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is up against a really serious difficulty. <Col N="346" /> I made the point already that as an unregistered unauthorised trade union is no longer an entity it cannot be guilty of an offence.  If the Minister looks into that matter I think my statement will be borne out.  A point also arises regarding authorised registered trade unions.  If there has to be a conviction, some person or some organisation must be before the courts capable of being convicted.  Now, that was apparently present to the minds of the framers of the Trades Unions Act of 1871. I refer the Minister to that particular Act as a guide in dealing with this matter, because Section 19 of it actually deals with legal proceedings.  That section states the courts in which offences may be prosecuted and fines recovered.  That supposes that offences were created by that particular Act. They were, in fact, created in one case under Section 12, but Section 12 did not deal with the creation of the offences of a particular trade union, but dealt with the officers of a trade union.  Section 12 of the Trades Unions Act of 1871 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If any officer, member or other person being or representing himself to be a member of a trade union registered under this Act...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were dealing there with trade unions that were registered under the Act, and, therefore, I submit to the Minister that there is even a doubt that a registered trade union can be guilty of an offence.  I think a very serious point arises in connection with this matter.  In answer to the powers which the Minister would have under Section 15 of recovering from the deposit, perhaps I may be permitted to refer to that section in connection with this particular point since the Minister has already mentioned it.  The Minister would have power to recover from a deposit in the courts under a judgment, but the judgment would have to be obtained in the case of an unregistered trade union against certain individuals in persons who would be amenable.  Therefore, I think that, as regards a registered and a non-registered trade union, this difficulty about <Col N="347" /> the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; arises.  That difficulty exists wherever the word is mentioned in this Bill.  I submit to the Minister that it is a very serious point, affecting a number of sections and affecting the procedure of the whole machinery which the Minister had in mind in dealing with offences for breach of the liabilities imposed on trade unions under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Esmonde has replied very fully to the Miniater's suggestion that the points raised by Deputy Morrissey, and further elaborated by Deputy Davin, were nonsensical and meaningless.  From the beginning, it was apparent to anybody reading the Bill that there was no philosophy behind it.  Since discussion opened on the Bill, it has been quite apparent that there is no plan behind it.  The minor amendments now before the House show that the incongruities in this Bill are of a kind that must inevitably arise where there is neither a philosophy nor a plan.  As in this case, where the amendments have come along as afterthoughts, these incongruities have become more and more marked.  The Minister has indicated that the crimes that may be committed by commission or omission under Section 14 may be very serious indeed.  But, it was only as an afterthought, that he considered it necessary to apply the term &ldquo;crime&rdquo; to those matters that now loom so large in his mind.  Can we have any explanation as to why this afterthought has now turned up, by reason of which it is proposed to ask for power to inflict a penalty up to £100 in a case that is brought into court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister proposes in respect to this section, but it is well to point out that in the original print of the Bill, there did not appear to be any necessity at all for prescribing punishment of any kind.  As the Minister has now come to the conclusion that it is necessary to provide for a fine of £100, would he tell us how he arrived at that figure?  May I refer back to Section 12, and to what is required in the case of a recorded trade <Col N="348" /> union?  Under sub-section (1) of that section, paragraph (f) such a trade union is required to give notice in writing to the Minister of every change in its rules and constitution, of every change in its committee of management or other controlling authority, of every change in its trustees, and of every change of its secretary or other principal officer, and if it fails to do any of these things it renders itself liable to a fine not exceeding £5, and in the case of a continuing offence to a fine not exceeding £1 for every day, and so on.  But under Section 14, a trade union which fails to send in a statement of the number of its members within one month after every third anniversary of the making of a deposit, shall render itself liable to a fine of £100.  Under Section 12 a fine of £5 is provided for failure to do the things set out.  In the case of Section 14 no penalty at all was provided when the Bill was introduced, but now under this amendment it is proposed to provide for a penalty of £100 for crimes that could not have been seen when the Bill was being drafted.  I think we should have some explanation from the Minister on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy wants that point to be treated seriously or not.  Quite obviously, Section 14 relates to offences in which it is clear £10,000 may be involved. It would be a serious matter in such cases to understate, perhaps by some thousands, the membership of a trade union, and accordingly the penalty is fixed at what I think is the moderate sum of £100.</P>

      <P>It can be convicted under this Act.  There is nothing in this which states that a trade union cannot be convicted, and nothing in the law anywhere, so far as I know, except for certain things, none of which arise under this Act.  It is true that a court cannot entertain legal proceedings concerning an agreement between members of a trade union, or an agreement for the payment by any person of any subscription or penalty to a trade union, or any agreement for the application of the funds of a trade union to provide benefits to members or to furnish contributions to any employer or workman or to discharge any fine imposed upon any person by sentence of a court of justice, or any agreement between one trade union and another, or any bond to secure the performance of any such agreements.  These are the only things in respect of which the law prescribes that proceedings cannot be taken against a trade union.  In respect of all other matters which may affect a trade union, so far as I can see and so far as I am aware, there is no prohibition. In any event, the amendment we are proposing would enable proceedings to be taken against a trade union for recovery of a penalty.</P>

      <P>I should like to come back to the speech made by Deputy Norton.  If I were to accept Deputy Norton's speech as accurately describing the conditions which exist in the Irish trade union movement, I should have to regard the administration of that movement as appalling.  I do nothing of the sort.  Deputy Norton's speech reflects very discreditably upon the whole Irish trade union movement. What has he told us?  We know that, under the law, trade unions have already to furnish returns as to their membership and to lodge accounts with <Col N="351" /> the Registrar of Friendly Societies, which accounts are supposed to be duly audited.  Yet, the implication running through the whole of Deputy Norton's speech was that the responsible officers &mdash;the committees of management or executive committees or whatever they may be called &mdash; of the trade unions do not take any trouble whatsoever &mdash; the Deputy thought it would be too much trouble if they were to be summoned together to consider what steps should be taken in this regard to ensure that the returns which the unions are already bound under the law to furnish are true returns.  That was the sum and substance of Deputy Norton's speech, though I do not repeat his remarks at as great length as they were made.</P>
      <P>I was asked who were supposed to have knowledge of a trade union's affairs, and I said the officers and committee of management of the trade union.  I ask those people who are really concerned for the reputation of Irish trade unions to note Deputy Norton's remarks. Deputy Norton, speaking as Leader of the Labour Party, as secretary of one Irish trade union, and as a person enjoying the confidence of the Irish Trades Union Congress, told us that it is too much to ask that, in relation to a union which may have as many as 40,000 or 50,000 members, and which may have property the value of which runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds, the officers and committee of management should have any knowledge of the union's affairs, and should be in a position to make regulations for the control of their employees which would ensure that returns would be put in at the proper time, and that when put in they would not, at least, be knowingly false.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the sum and substance of Deputy Norton's speech was that, in the case of a trade union with a membership of 40,000 or 50,000 and holding property to the <Col N="352" /> value of £100,000, it would be too much to ask the officers and the committee of management to take steps to ensure that their employees, when called upon to furnish returns under the law, would furnish those returns in due time and would, at least, take care not to furnish returns which were knowingly false. That is the picture which Deputy Norton wishes to believe, that is the representation of the conditions in Irish trade unionism which Deputy Norton wants to give to the House and to the country.  I am beginning to wonder whether much of the opposition to this Bill does not arise from the fact that there are certain people who want that condition of affairs in Irish trade unionism &mdash; if such a condition exists&mdash; to continue.  This section does not provide, as Deputy Norton alleges, that the officers and committee and management of a union must make returns which they have personally checked or which, to their knowledge, are true and exact.  It merely means that they will not make themselves a party to a fraud on the State, that returns will be prepared with due care and in accordance with the regulations made by the union for the control of its officers and that, if they are satisfied that they have been so prepared with due care, they will not then deliberately falsify them and send in inaccurate returns. That is the sum and substance of the proposal contained in this amendment.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if the Minister is going to &ldquo;try it on&rdquo; with the trade unionists of this country.  The Minister when asked in the beginning for an explanation as to what was meant by the words &ldquo;to the knowledge of such trade union,&rdquo; stated that in his opinion it was the committee of management.  He later went back on that and said it was the trustees of the society.  Then he comes along and says it is the corporate body, meaning the whole membership of the trade union.  Will he study the rules &mdash; I am sure he has not done so &mdash; of any one of the trade unions affiliated to the Trade Union Congress which is likely to receive a negotiation licence under the Bill as it now stands?  If he does, he will find that the management of a trade union is provided for in the rules and that the responsibility for doing the work is delegated by the union to a working committee or executive and the executive provides certain officers or sub-committees of the executive. That is why those who know something about the internal organisation of the trade union movement are anxious to find out from the Minister what he means by the words &ldquo;to the knowledge of such trade union.&rdquo; We are anxious to find out so that when this Bill finally passes, if it ever does, civil servants who will be called upon to administer this measure &mdash; God help them &mdash; will know who are the persons who are responsible for giving effect to the requirements of the various sections of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The latest contribution of the Minister to this discussion is characteristic of his other contributions and may well be dubbed a &ldquo;MacEnteeism.&rdquo; Instead of making any attempt to answer the reasonable request to explain the vague and obscure phrasing of the section, and the reasons for the difference in the provisions dealing with penalties, in cases of failure by the trade unions to fulfil the requirements of the section, the Minister in reply to the various speakers from these benches and from the Fine Gael Benches, launches into a further attack on Deputy Norton. He has put certain words into the mouth of Deputy Norton and has suggested that an attack has been made by the Deputy on the Irish trade union movement.  Nobody but the Minister would have dared to make such a deduction from the speech of the Deputy.  Deputy Norton has said right through this debate that trade unions are being run in an efficient manner and that they administer their affairs better than the Minister administers his office.  He has invited the Minister and his officials to go to any trade union office to see how business is administered there.  Yet the Minister in one of his usual ebullitions of <Col N="356" /> bad temper sought to misrepresent the statement made by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the Minister's contribution to this discussion and his contribution was as valuaable as his contributions usually are. He studiously sidetracked the position with an attack on another Deputy but his implications and his deductions will carry as much conviction as did his diatribe in the Press to-day when he told the public about the bold, bad boys in Dáil Eireann who had not sufficient respect for the institutions of Parliament.  Whatever bad habits anybody in this House may have contracted, were learned from the Minister. I do not see any hope of getting any explanation from the Minister of the matters raised on this amendment because he does not seem to know anything about them and it is futile to ask him.  It is futile to ask him as to why there should be this differentiation between Section 14 and Section 12. The Minister sees nothing wrong in having the same serious penalty for an offence which may be due to a slip or due to a certain laxity in not posting certain notifications of an alteration in membership to the Minister's office and for a deliberate offence of altering the membership by increasing or decreasing the numbers.  That offence is put on the same par as a trivial offence due to an oversight.  The Minister sees nothing wrong in asking the House to pass legislation of that kind.  It is only when somebody has suffered this heavy penalty and when the courts are asked to interpret these sections that the necessity for amending legislation will become apparent.  Yet when somebody asks for a clarification of these sections we are treated to the tirade which we have just heard from the Minister on this matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to impress on the Minister for the last time the necessity for reasonable clarity in connection with the question of conviction for an offence.  The Minister <Col N="357" /> has quoted Section 9 of the Trade Union Act of 1871 as being part of the laws that would assist him or the State in taking any prosecution that might be necessary against a trade union.  If the Minister is advised that that section which he has quoted empowers him to bring proceedings for a penalty against the trustees of the union&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I have nothing further to say, but I submit that the Minister ought to put that point up to his legal advisers, because in my humble opinion Section 9 deals only with civil matters, and does not empower any criminal proceedings to be brought.  I do not venture to give any legal opinion; I venture to make only a submission to the Minister.  If he is satisfied that this Section 9 will come to his assistance for the purpose of implementing this amendment, well and good.  I have nothing further to say in that case, but I submit that, in the interests of what the Minister intends, he should ask his advisers to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>I should like to make my position quite clear.  Deputy Esmonde, during the course of this debate, has made some very valuable suggestions which I am prepared to consider, but the fact that I do attach some importance to his opinion does not at all imply that I agree that 'his suggestions are well-founded, and certainly does not give the right to a body of lay lawyers in the House to proceed to accept them as if they were judicial decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the fact that the Deputy has behind him years of experience as a trained lawyer counts for nothing against the Minister's opinion.  The Minister was quite careful <Col N="358" /> not to say that he had been advised that the point raised by Deputy Esmonde was not valid.  He said: &ldquo;I am satisfied, so far as I can see.&rdquo; The Minister's opinion on a matter of legal interpretation is about as valuable as mine, and that has not very much value.  This section, like every other section of this Bill, is very important, and we have pointed out matters in this section and in the amendment which we think are of the gravest importance. We are doing our best in our very limited way &mdash; if that phrase will please the Minister &mdash; to put before him the fears of people outside who will be directly affected by the Bill and the Minister's answer on every conceivable occasion, whether to Deputy Norton, Deputy Esmonde or any other Deputy, is that it is all nonsense, that it is a foolish point or that it is piffle. I suggest that is not the way in which the Minister should deal with the matter, and it is not the way in which he ought to speak to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that, when we, finding it impossible to extract from the Minister the information we seek, persist in asking for further information in order to get an answer, we are accused of obstruction.  The Minister goes to a great deal more trouble to build up a letter for the newspapers than he is prepared to go to in order to give that information to the representatives of the nation dealing with the Bill here.  I have tried from the very beginning, from the First Stage of the Bill, to tell the Minister &mdash; I know that the Minister has not very much use for my opinion, nor apparently for anybody's opinion but his own, but the fact is that we are entitled, and not only entitled, but it is our duty, so long as we are members of the House, to give our opinions on every section of every Bill &mdash; how terribly serious this matter is.  I have tried to be helpful and I went to the trouble of framing a reasoned amendment for the very first discussion of the Bill we could possibly have, but the Minister, instead of answering the points made on Section 14 and on the amendment he has put forward, beyond dismissing them as the merest nonsense <Col N="359" /> and piffle, proceeds to attack Deputy Norton for making a statement which Deputy Norton never made.  I am not concerned with that.  Deputy Norton is well able to look after himself, but what I do object to is the Minister's taking that line, instead of trying to meet seriously the points made by Deputy Esmonde, Deputy Davin, Deputy Norton and other Deputies.</P>
    <P>The trouble with the Minister is apparently that he thinks that, in relation to this section dealing with the preparation of returns and fines to be inflicted, he knows far more about the internal administration and control of a trade union than Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin, and apparently far more about what is likely to be the legal interpretation of the section than men trained in the business and engaged in it all their lives.  To say the least of it, that line of approach to argument put up is not very helpful. So far as I know, there is no member of the House who, either on this section or any of the following sections, <Col N="360" /> has any desire whatever to obstruct. We are opposed to this Bill but we know that we cannot prevent its passage into law.  We are opposed to the section and to the fine set out in it, and the only thing we can do, when we cannot prevent its passage finally into law, is to try to make it as innocuous as possible, to try to make it less dangerous and less harmful, and we do not want the House, in ignorance of what it is doing, to pass an amendment to empower the courts to impose very heavy and substantial fines, when, as has already been pointed out by Deputy Mulcahy, the very idea of this amendment came into the Minister's mind long after the Bill had been introduced and discussed by the House. If I were to follow the Minister's line of thought, I could make suggestions, which would perhaps be dubbed unworthy, as to why this amendment is brought in.  I could make those suggestions, and I probably would not be very much wrong, but I refrain from making them.</P>

The Minister's attitude was that my point was frivolous, that I could not understand this, that under Section 12, fines to the extent of thousands of pounds, which might run up to £10,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  £100 is set down here as an afterthought, as the extent to which a fine can be levied on a trade union which does not on or within one month after every third year supply a list stating the number <Col N="364" /> of its members.  I asked the Minister what was the necessity foe fixing a fine as high as that figure and I asked him why the difference in the size of the crime should be so marked between failure to send in that list every third year and the failure of a recorded trade union to send in to the Minister changes in its rules and constitution. The Minister's answer was that it was frivolous and fantastic.  I cannot hope to extract a reasonable, answer from the Minister because I am forced to recognise that he has not a reasonable answer to give, but what I want to say is this: Section 14 provides that, under certain circumstances, up to £100 of the funds lodged with the High Court by a trade union may be &ldquo;pinched&rdquo; by the State.  We all must recognise that one of the primary functions of the State is to act as a policeman and to prevent the property of any person being taken improperly or immorally by any other person, to protect people in the possession of their goods and property.  Every penny that is the property of the trade unions to-day has been subscribed in small amounts by workers who earn their money by the sweat of their brow.  Trade union funds represent savings out of money provided for the upkeep of their families and put into these funds for the improvement, not only of their own condition but, he has been readily recognised, particularly in the development of modern Catholic doctrine on the State, for the betterment of society generally.  If, under this Bill, the State is going to require that certain of their funds shall be put into pawn, it is up to Parliament, at any rate, to see that they cannot be lightly frittered away and cannot be lightly seized.  I think when the Minister, who first drafted Section 14 without any penal clause, now comes before the House and says he wants a penal clause in that section and wants a fine put into that Section up to £100, he should give some kind of explanation.  I do not know that any explanation would warrant the putting in of that penal fine against trade unionists and their funds.  I think the fine should be much smaller, if any fine is wanted, but I want to protest against the Minister <Col N="365" /> asking Parliament, for whatever reason &mdash;particularly for reasons not given&mdash; to so turn its back on its duties that these accumulated funds which, as I say, have been built up from the savings of working men for the betterment of themselves and for the betterment of the State, could by any process be lightly robbed.  That is the protest I make against this section as it now appears, and I would like the Minister to become as voluble in dealing with the matter directly as he was prepared to become in trying to prevent me saying what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 14 (1), it seems to me there is a rather unusual type of provision.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  On or within one month after every third anniversary of the making by an authorised trade union of a deposit under this Part of this Act, such trade union shall send to the Minister a statement of the number of its members on such anniversary and, if it is necessary to increase or reduce such deposit by any amount in order to make it equal to the appropriate sum, such trade union shall, not later than two months after such anniversary, increase such deposit by such amount or apply for the return out of such deposit of such amount (as the case may require).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were dealing with any ordinary type of legislation, instead of with this Bill, one might understand that, where a reasonable requirement was imposed that a deposit should be kept at a given figure, it was necessary in a reasonable period of time to ensure that the deposit was in fact kept to that figure. I do not of course agree with the deposit scheme in this Bill at all, nor with the Bill at all.  It seems to me that if a union which was required to make a deposit of, say, £4,000, found after a lapse of time that its membership had so fallen that it was required to make a deposit of only £2,000, it therefore had to its credit a sum in excess of that prescribed by this Bill, but it seems to me that, unless the union <Col N="366" /> made application for the refund of that sum within two months, it could not get it back.  It could not get it back, if it applied within three months, because according to the terms of this section it is mandatory on the organisation to make application to have its own money sent back to it within two months.  I do not think it matters very much when the union makes application.  The money belongs to the union.  It can leave it there if it likes.  If a union which should have lodged £2,000 has in fact lodged £4,000 who is upset by that? The courts should not be; the Minister cannot be.  If the unions say: &ldquo;well and good, we will leave it so; we do not want to get that returned to us,&rdquo; why should we compel the union to make application for its return within two months, and compel it, presumably, to forfeit the amount due for return unless in fact it makes application within two months?  I do not understand why it is necessary.  Of course, I hope the unions will not make any deposits at all, and that this section will be largely dead timber, but assuming that anybody would make a deposit under this section it does not seem to me to be reasonable that they should have to make their application within two months or run the risk of forfeiting the excess amount.</P>
    <P>I have a similar view to Deputy Mulcahy in respect of the punishment to be imposed on unions for not making the return provided for in this section.  Under Section 14 (2) as amended, the unions are to be liable to a fine not exceeding £100 in certain circumstances.  I think £100 is a savage punishment for omission to send a return. It may be that, if the union is two or three days over its time, and, for instance, the Minister does not like the union or does not like its officers &mdash;and that is quite a probability &mdash; an action could be instituted against the union; you would have summary jurisdiction in the action, and the judge would be told he could impose a fine up to £100.  That does not seem to me to be a fine which is justified by the offence of failure to submit a return. In other sections we deal with other types of offences, and the maximum <Col N="367" /> fine is £5.  In this case, under this hasty amendment, which was not thought of when the Bill was introduced, and which was slapped in, in a clumsy way, after the Bill had been circulated, we are providing for a fine of £100.  What is the purpose of requiring payment of a fine of that amount when in other sections dealing with what one might describe as comparable offences, it they could be described as offences at all, the maximum fine provided for is £5?  Would the Minister tell us why it is necessary to be so savage in Section 14, when the same type of savagery and ferocity is not carried into the other sections?</P>

      <P>There is a point here which strikes me as rather peculiar. Let us assume that a trade union had lodged a sum of £4,000, and that it discovered on the anniversary in question that its membership was so reduced that it was entitled to get £2,000 back.  If they were lazy enough or negligent enough not to send in a return which showed the reduced membership, and which would enable them to get back £2,000, they would be liable to a fine of £100.  They would be liable to that fine because they did not do something which would benefit themselves.</P>

      <P>There is one point in regard to this section as amended which strikes me as being rather strange.  I take it that, as the Bill now stands, a trade union would be liable to a fine of £100 if it does not send in its return, but it does not become liable to a fine if it does not increase its deposit.  Now, I should imagine that the increase in the deposit would be rather the more important of the two.  What is the Minister's method of dealing with it?</P>

A point has been made here, for which I really cannot see any foundation at all in the text of the Bill. It has been suggested, I think, by Deputy Norton, that, if a trade union fails to apply within two months for a refund of the deposit which it had made that might be in excess of the appropriate sum, it is liable to be fined £100.  I cannot see anything of the sort in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Even Deputy Linehan owns up to it, yet the Minister, though corrected on that point, goes on to misrepresent me.  I will pass over that kind of nonsense, as I am too familiar with it from the Minister.  If the Minister were only as good at understanding that this is an unwanted Bill which he insists on bringing in and dissipating the time of the House in discussing, as he is at misrepresenting people, it would be very much better for the country.  In Section 14 (1) it seems to me that the union must make an application for a refund of any surplus deposited with the courts within two months after the third anniversary upon which it made the deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for instance, a union makes a deposit with the courts on the 1st January, 1942, then on the 1st January, 1945, it must decide whether, on the 1st January or within a month of the 1st January, it will make an application for a refund of, say, a surplus of £2,000 which may be standing to its credit in the courts.  If it does not make that application within two months, it seems to me that it cannot be made until a further three years have elapsed.  It is triennially, apparently, that applications are made. Must the union wait for another three years before getting a refund?  Why not make the application possible after three, six or 12 months?  Apparently, this is only reviewable triennially, but what is the idea in insisting on a trade union making application within two or three months?  Why should it not be allowed to make a choice as to when it will make the application?  If the <Col N="371" /> money is there, it belongs to the union; and if it is surplus it should be possible to get it back.  Surely we are entitled to an explanation for the insistence on this?</P>

    <P>(3)  Whenever the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, in pursuance of an order made by a Court under this section, pays any money out of a deposit maintained with him under this Part of this Act, he shall forthwith determine the balance remaining of such deposit (investments being calculated at their current market value) and, if such balance falls short of the full proper amount of such deposit, he shall give to the trade union concerned notice in writing of such deficiency and of the amount thereof.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that where a court makes an order for the payment of money by a trade union, which is the holder of a negotiation licence, the High Court, on the application of the person in whose favour the order has been made, may order such money, with or without the costs of the application, to be paid out of the deposit maintained by the trade union under this part of the Act.  An order, decree or judgment given against such a trade union will not be payable from the deposit unless formal application is made to the High Court for this to be done and the High Court considers it is desirable that the amount should be paid out of the deposit.  There are a number of amendments down in my name to the section &mdash; amendments Nos. 34, 35, and 37 &mdash; and all these are consequential upon amendments to Sections 7 and 13 <Col N="374" /> which have been adopted by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the reason for moving to delete sub-section (2) is that the person, having got an order in the form of a decree or judgment for the payment of money by a trade union, it is the desire of the courts that, before this money is paid out, the person in whose favour it is given should go back and ask the court to make an order requiring that the money be paid out of the deposit? Is the person to go to the court for redress and, having got redress in the form of some monetary benefit, does the person, if the subjection is deleted, go back and ask the court to have the money paid out of the deposit?  Is that the case the Minister is making?</P>

      <P>The purport of that is to make it possible for the High Court to make an order, but it also provides that the High Court will only make it upon a second application.</P>

      <P>What is clear from that?  If the intention of the amendment to delete sub-section (2) is only made clear by the clarity of sub-section (1), then we will have to ask the Minister to deal with the section itself, particularly sub-section (1).  What are the circumstances in which the court will make any order, decree or judgment, or that money will be paid by a trade union?  What are the circumstances in which any such order will be made? What are the limits to the amount of money included in any such order?  We are asked to contemplate that some <Col N="375" /> court may make an order for a certain payment of money by a trade union, and the House should be told what are the kind of circumstances in which the court would make such an order when it would eat into a trade union's funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, it is quite dear that the Deputy is not dealing with the matter seriously.  When the court, in exercise of its jurisdiction, makes an order, decree, or judgment for the payment of money by a trade union, which is the holder of a negotiation licence, I presume that it will be satisfied that the person has rightfully established a claim against the funds of the trade union, and the court has the further power, if the person can show that there is no other means of securing the damages or the amount which the court has awarded to him, to allow him to recover that money out of the deposit which is already in the custody of the courts.  It seems to me that that is a perfectly reasonable section.  I am not going to say to the court when it may or may not make such an order, because, after all, the court is the judge on the merits of each case, and, if it is satisfied that a person can get justice against a trade union in no other way except by securing some part of the deposit which the trade union has made, I certainly am not going to try to bind the hands of the court in that regard.</P>

      <P>When I hear about the deposit of the trade union, my mind turns to the position of the insurance company which is required to make a deposit with the High Court for the secuiity of its policyholders.  I take it the deposit which the trade union is required to make with the registering <Col N="376" /> authority is designed as security for its members.  Let us assume the deposit in some given case is £10,000.  Suppose a person recovered £8,000 in a suit against that trade union and did not find it convenient to levy on the trade union premises or such other assets as the trade union might possess, does the Minister wish to give the court discretion to release £8,000 from the deposit which he stipulated the union should make as a condition precedent to registering the union as a negotiating body, or does the Minister say to the House: &ldquo;I propose to let the court do that, but if I find myself confronted with a situation in which a union which I required to lodge £10,000 had suffered its deposit to be reduced to £2,000, I would immediately consider the question of cancelling that union's registration licence?&rdquo; If the Minister makes it a condition precedent that the union must have £10,000 on deposit, it is scarcely credible that he would rest at ease if that were reduced in any way. I assume he would say to the trade union: &ldquo;I will wipe you out if you do not restore the deposit to the original amount.&rdquo; That is what the Minister has in mind?</P>

      <P>I suggest that the reason the Minister is agreeing to delete the sub-section is in order to prevent a discussion on its dangers, what it intended when orginally drafted.  What was really in their minds was, that they wanted to confiscate trade union funds. That is what it would have amounted to.  The Minister discovered in time, through his advisers, that an attack could be made on them as this clause would mean confiscating trade union funds.  Even the next sub-section leaves that danger there.  It is known that very big damages were got against a trade union by an individual some years ago, although it might have appeared at the time laughable.  Supposing a trade union had a deposit account with the Government equivalent to the amount of the damages secured against it, under this clause the person getting the damages could apply to be paid out of the deposit or out of investments lodged as security for the deposit.  If you notice, the sub-section sets out &ldquo;shall forthwith determine the balance remaining of such deposit (investments being calculated at their current market value).&rdquo; A trade union might have deposits worth £20,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to hinge on it my argument on the sub-section that is being eliminated.  If this sub-section goes and the other one remains it means that the funds of the society, all their investments, can be sold at current market value.  They may be reduced in value from £20,000 to £10,000.  The Minister will be giving some claimant an opportunity of requesting the court to make an order against deposits that at one time were valued at £20,000 and at the date of the application they might be valued at only £10,000.  I was involved in a case quite recently in which a sale took place of securities valued at thousands and they were forced to sell them at half their value.  A claimant may get a judgment against a trade union, no <Col N="378" /> matter how ridiculous the case may seem, and that claimant can get the court to make an order to sell the deposits or investments at current market value.  Those two sub-sections should go, and indeed the whole Bill should go, because it is rotten.</P>

      <P>Where a trade union gets fined, is it contemplated that the prosecuting authority would proceed against the funds by seeking an order from the court to release sufficient of the deposit moneys to pay the fine, if it could not get at the funds in any other way?  Is that what is in the mind of the Minister?  A trade union is not liable for tort in certain circumstances. It is scarcely likely that it is going to make itself liable for rent.  There could only be proceedings against the trade union, as such, on contract over a criminal offence.  Does the Minister intend to protect a person in contractual relations with a trade union or does he mean to make effective the penalties provided for in the code?</P>

      <P>You cannot delete this sub-section light-heartedly, because we must see what portion of the plank is left after sawing off part of it.  I am prepared to agree to the deletion of sub-section (2), but I want to see how much of the plank is still left.  I should like the Minister to tell us, on sub-section (1) &mdash; sub-sections (1) and (2) hang together &mdash; what kind of person should be able to get a decree against a trade union.  Deputy Dillon and others appropriately asked, can the landlord of a trade union premises go to court and say: &ldquo;The union is in arrears with its rent and is taking no <Col N="379" /> notice of my letters asking for payment, and therefore I have decided that, as the High Court holds £20,000 as the deposit of that union, I should be permitted to garnishee portion of that deposit&rdquo;?  Will he go to the ordinary court and explain that it is a contract debt and that he is suing for payment of what is due?  Is the landlord provided with two remedies, first to take a chance in the ordinary court of recovering what is due, and secondly, can he go to the High Court and ask for payment out of the £20,000 lodged there belonging to the union?  Is that the type of person contemplated to get after trade onion deposits, or are these deposits to be kept solely for the payment of fines imposed under Sections 11 and 12, and the still heavier fine which can be imposed under Section 14 as amended?  Will the Minister clear up that position?</P>

      <P>I wish to put another case to the Minister.  There was a dispute here some years ago between one of the largest unions and one of its most prominent members which resulted in very costly and long-drawn-out litigation.  That litigation was undertaken, notwithstanding the fact that the members of the union were absolutely opposed to it.  So much were they opposed that a special conference of all the delegates of the union was called in Dublin in order to safeguard funds which had been subscribed, and every effort was made to prevent the case going to the courts.  Deputy Hickey and myself were amongst four delegates appointed from that conference to negotiate with both sides in an attempt to stop the litigation.  Notwithstanding our efforts the case went to court and a decision was ultimately given, but it so happened that it was not the members of the union but the <Col N="380" /> individual on the opposite side that suffered.  The decision might as well have been against the union as the damages and costs amounted to thousands of pounds.  If a similar case were to arise to-morrow, would a person awarded damages and costs be able to satisfy them under this section? It seems to me that he would, and if that is so it is very unfair to the members of the union.</P>

      <P>I do not appreciate the point of view of the Deputy.  If it is admitted that a court may make an order for the payment of a decree against the trade union, surely it would be putting the court in an entirely ridiculous position if, having under this Bill substantial funds belonging to that union, it could not make an order for payment to a person in a position to prove &mdash; as I presume he would have to prove &mdash; that in no other way could he secure the satisfaction which the court adjudged him to be entitled to, than by getting possession of some of the funds which the court, under this Bill, had in its possession.  I think if we agree that in certain circumstances, a trade union may be liable to an action for damages it would be a ridiculous position for the court to be put in relation to litigants or people seeking justice at its hands that, though there was held up in front of them a substantial sum of money belonging to the person whom the court had adjudged to have damaged them in some way, the court was to be precluded from giving satisfaction to those who came before it seeking satisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear. There has to be an application to the High Court for the specific purpose of getting an order to pay out the money. First of all the person has to get a decree or judgment from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and having got that &mdash; and I presume having tried to satisfy that order in the ordinary way &mdash; he has to go to the High Court for an order that the money shall be paid to him out of the funds of the trade union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were in that position, and went to the High Court, and said that he had been given a decree against a union, and that he now wanted an order that the amount should be paid out of the deposit, does he not think that the High Court would think twice about it?  Would he not be asked what steps had been taken to satisfy the decree, seeing the deposit was there for a certain purpose? As long as it is retained here, it entitles the holder of it to a negotiation licence.  It would be a very <Col N="382" /> serious matter if that negotiation licence were to be withdrawn, and, therefore, would not the court say: before we give an order &mdash; I assume this is the line the court would take&mdash; we must be satisfied that you, the applicant, have taken every reasonable step to secure satisfaction out of the other assets of the trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be all right if the Minister were the judge, but we are not writing into this Bill any instructions to the judge to reason in the way the Minister has done.  As Deputy Linehan has said, it would seem that if a person gets a decree in, the circuit court or the district court he can apply to the High Court and say: &ldquo;I got this decree at the last district court and I want the decree met now out of the deposit which this union has under your control.&rdquo; It will be no function of a judge under this Act to reason in the way the Minister has done.  The judge can make an order to meet that judgment out of the funds at the disposal of the court.  He is not obliged to say to the person who holds the judgment: &ldquo;If you proceed to take the money out of this £2,000 deposit you will imperil the negotiation licence of this trade union.&rdquo; The judge is only concerned with the fact that here is some person who turns up with a decree for £10 or for £1,000.  Having got that decree, that person is in a position to reduce the amount of the deposit held under the court's control and to imperil the negotiation licence of the trade union, if it has one.  Is it intended that this deposit should be attachable for ordinary shop debts, or should it be reserved for any of the offences which may be committed under this Bill?  Can a landlord, for instance, go in and sue for his rent out of the deposit; can a trade union employee go in and sue for his wages out of it, or can any of the traders who do business with trade unions from time to time and who may get a decree in court against some particular trade union go to the High Court to get satisfaction for their debt?  I did not think it was contemplated making these deposits attachable for ordinary debts.  This is the first time that we <Col N="383" /> have been able to set that from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill continues for another year the provisions of the Housing Acts as regards grants to persons in rural areas, grants to public utility societies in rural areas and to philanthropic societies and municipal authorities in certain circumstances.  It also applies to reconstruction grants. So far as these matters are concerned, it is exactly similar to the Bill which was introduced last year extending for a year the duration of these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opportunity has been taken on the occasion of the introduction of the Bill to include two other matters, viz., the amendment of the definition of the expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; and the guaranteeing of sums borrowed by building societies.  As regards the former, the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; was first defined in the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, in a somewhat narrow sense but in the sense in which the occupation is usually understood.  It was widened in the Labourers Act, 1885, the Irish Land Act, 1903, and the Labourers Acts of 1919 and 1936, but in certain circumstances it is still found to be unduly restrictive.  The amendment is proposed to enable boards of health to let cottages, provided under the Labourers Acts, just outside the boundaries of urban areas to persons who may work for hire at non-agricultural work within the urban area.  Such cases will not, it is expected, be very numerous, <Col N="387" /> but under the existing law some hardship is created especially in regard to the county boroughs.  Under existing law, it is possible that a person may be quite eligible on his appointment as tenant and during the course of his tenancy he finds himself employed wholly within the urban area.  Strictly speaking, he should no longer be allowed to remain in the cottage.  The amendment will get over this difficulty.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 3 &mdash; the guaranteeing by certain local authorities of sums borrowed by building societies &mdash; there has been a movement for the past few years by those interested in the building industry to secure the provision of funds to enable people to purchase their houses.  Various suggestions have been put forward and examined.  These suggestions took various forms &mdash; the formation of a new building society or mortgage corporation with guarantees by the State, an extension of the activities of existing building societies and the provision of funds for the making of advances by local authorities under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  So far as the area outside Dublin is concerned, facilities exist under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, but in Dublin the operation of these Acts has had to be suspended for the past few years owing to what are regarded as the more pressing needs &mdash; the erection of houses for the working classes, to the extent to which moneys can be made available.  Accordingly, the scope of the proposal is limited to Dublin City and County.</P>
    <P>Conferences took place with representatives of banks and building societies, and it was felt that existing building societies could deal with the situation if moneys could be made available to them, and the law in regard to building societies amended as respects the proportion of the amount secured by mortgage which may be accepted by the societies in the form of deposits on loans.  The amendment of the Building Societies Acts is being dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The proposal for guaranteeing loans, as set out in Section 3 of the Bill, is not altogether <Col N="388" /> the establishment of a new principle. A somewhat similar provision in regard to public utility societies is to be found in Section 14 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919.  It is not intended to make formal regulations concerning the guarantees, but rather to deal with the proposals which may come forward, in the light of the circumstances of each case.  The representatives of the banks have indicated the willingness of the banks to co-operate, but it will be open to a building society to approach insurance companies or other institutions granting loans.  It is expected that the proposal will do much to encourage the development of house purchase through building societies.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has gone some little way to help to define, by Section 2, the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;.  The only regret I have is that he did not go far enough, because even with this amendment there will be many cases of definite hardship.  The real trouble, whatever may be in his mind or in the minds of the officials of the Department, is that local authorities do not seem to have the faintest idea of what is the correct definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;.  In order to show how hardship may arise, I might relate a personal experience.  On one occasion before the North Cork Board of Health there were two applicants for a cottage and the whole position turned on the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;. One of the applicants was a man who had two hackney cars and a threshing machine.  The other was a married woman whose husband, a farm labourer, was confined in a mental hospital.  A very strong case was made for that woman before the board and the case was made that the other man was not an agricultural labourer within the meaning of the Act.  I was there on that occasion and the board were in favour of giving the cottage to the man with the two cars and the threshing machine.  I asked the chairman of the board would he define what was meant by the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;A person who does work for farmers.&rdquo; If that is the definition it runs right through the principle of all these Acts.  I then put <Col N="389" /> the question to the chairman: &ldquo;If I apply for the next cottage that is vacant in the Millstreet area, will you give it to me?&rdquo; He laughed, but I said to him: &ldquo;I have been all my life working for farmers, therefore I come within the definition of an agricultural labourer.&rdquo; The position is, whatever the Minister may intend, that a very loose definition of the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; has been adopted by these boards.  Whatever relief may be afforded by Section 2 of this Bill, it will not be half as much as would be afforded if boards were not allowed to adopt such a loose definition of the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; as they have been adopting up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Section 3 there is just one point that I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I see that the Minister is extending the benefit of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to the Dublin area.  I wonder would the Minister look into the question of title as it affects applicants for loans under these Acts?  We were advised in County Cork that one could not get a loan, even in the case of fee simple property, unless the title was registered under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act.  I pointed out that if a person had a fee simple property and wanted to get a loan under the Acts, he was offering the best possible title, that it was putting such persons to needless expense to compel them to apply for first registration, and that it did not improve their title.  If they went into the bank they would get the very same advance on their property as if they were registered under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act.  It costs about £8 to get first registration under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act.  I mentioned the matter to the Minister last year, and I think the Minister was satisfied that if a person had a fee simple title, it should be quite enough to secure him an advance under the Act, and that he should not be put to the expense of registering under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act.  I should be glad to hear it the Minister has since come to any decision in the matter, because I think a great number of people would take advantage of these Acts if they <Col N="390" /> had not to go to the expense of applying for a first registration.</P>

      <P>My remarks on this Bill apply more to Dublin and Dublin County than to other areas.  As far as the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is concerned, I am afraid the supply of houses has given out, but I should like to point out to the Minister that in the past the complaint always was that there were no funds available for the acquisition of small dwellings, and that when certain amounts were made available they were simply gobbled up. There were so many applications lodged with the Dublin Corporation that the supplies lasted only a few weeks.  As far as speculative building is concerned, it does not seem to have reached a comprehensive basis to supply the needs of such applicants.  The Minister's predecessor, I think, asked some of the people connected with the business whether they would prefer the subsidy or some comprehensive scheme to assist house purchase.</P>
      <P>Some people connected with the industry then said that they really felt that the most serious problem was not the question of price; it was more a question of the purchaser being able to purchase a house on a deferred basis. The Minister's predecessor, on the strength of that, I think, did away with the subsidy but he never provided the funds to enable people to purchase houses on a deferred basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to suggest that there is some kind of a conflict as between houses for the working classes and providing houses for people who really only want to be assisted in the purchase of their houses.  I should like to submit that there is not any conflict between these two classes.  As far as housing of the working classes is concerned, I think the Government never caught up with the need in Dublin.  I think it would be correct to say that Dublin is falling more quickly than it is being rebuilt.</P>

      <P>The Housing Bill introduced by the Minister is really only a joke and what I am concerned to show is that this Bill does not meet the problem.  I do not know whether even the Minister suggests that it does, but I am mentioning some of the things which have happened in the past, while not trying to go back on the Minister's Vote.  On a Housing Bill, however, surely it is proper to point out that it does not meet the problem, either of the housing of the working classes or of the housing of those other people catered for by the Small Dwellings Act?  As I have previously said, when we had supplies, no grants were available, and now, presumably, when <Col N="392" /> grants are available, we have no supplies.  With regard to building societies, under an alteration of the law governing these societies, they are enabled to make further advances. That is a help, but it affects only a very small part of the problem and will go only a very short distance towards solving it.</P>

      <P>I should like to advert for a moment to the question of the classes of persons who are deemed eligible for labourers' cottages in rural Ireland.  Labourers' cottages are heavily subsidised from the rates and the subsidy in the part of the country from which I come is borne by very small farmers in the rates levied on their land.  I know a row of 24 labourers' cottages in which there are two labourers who live and work on the land.  The remaining 22 occupants are industrial workers, workers in commercial avocations, railway workers and men who ought to be drawing a fair rate of wages, and by that I mean a rate out of which a man could keep a wife and family, and pay an economic rent.  All these men are living in houses for which they pay about 3/- a week because these houses have been subsidised out of the pockets of the small farmers who live in the neighbourhood, no single one of whom enjoys a weekly income approximating to that of the tenants of these cottages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 proposes not only to sanction the existing arrangements, but still further to widen the scope of the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;.  I have no desire to prevent these people from getting houses.  On the contrary, I think it is excellent that decent, clean houses should be provided for this class of person.  All I suggest is that where a man is an industrial worker and is entitled to demand from his industrial employer a living wage, that man should be required to pay an economic rent for a house built under the Housing Acts, because if he is not so required, what we are doing is relieving his employer of the obligation to pay him an <Col N="393" /> adequate wage, and subsidising that employer's wage bill out of the pockets of the small farmers of the district in which he operates.  I do not think that fair, and never did think it fair.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the genesis of the Labourers' Cottages Act, because it was always regarded by the old Irish Party as one of the great benefits they secured from the British Government for rural Ireland, but their purpose was to provide cottages at rents which could be paid out of the wages which agriculture was in a, position to afford. They deliberately intended to subsidise the farmers by relieving the farmer of that part of the wages which he ought to pay a labourer, if the labourer was to be enabled to live in a decent house. With our eyes wide open, we were concerned indirectly to subsidise the employers of agricultural labour in order to make it possible for them to hire labour at all.  What we are now doing, instead of subsidising farmers who employ labour, is subsidising industries which we have protected, and subsidising them not at the expense of the Exchequer to which they contribute, but at the expense of the ratepayers of the particular districts in which their factories happen to be located, which I do not think is fair.  It is made doubly inequitable by the fact that, in the large majority of these cottages, there are one or two lodgers, each of whom is paying for one room more than the entire rent of the cottage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad enough to get the small farmers of the west of Ireland to subsidise the housing of industrial workers, in that area, but it seems to me tone even more grossly unjust to ask the small farmers of the country to pay half the rent of a cottage for an industrial worker who entertains a lodger who pays him more than the entire rent of the cottage in rent for one room.  I know of one cottage where there are two lodgers, both of whom are paying the tenant more than the entire rent of the cottage.  He has on the cottage per week a surplus income of 9/-, less what it costs to give his lodgers a cup of tea when they come in at night.  I know that for anyone in public <Col N="394" /> life to mention a matter of this kind is to leave himself open to the charge of being concerned to stop all housing in Ireland, of being the enemy of the poor and seeking to drive the people back into the tenements and basements. That is all &ldquo;codology&rdquo;, and anyone who wants to indulge in it is very welcome to do so.  I am concerned with the fact, as I have frequently reiterated here, that we are the trustees of the people, and it is our job to see that &ldquo;quick ones&rdquo; are not put over on sections of our people who cannot see the deception that is being practised upon them.  I do not think the small farmers of this country realise the way in which the housing code has been strained in order to compel poor men living on the land to subsidise, weekly, the housing of comparatively prosperous industrial workers.  Instead of subsidising the rent of these industrial workers in this way, I think that if we are not satisfied that the industrial workers are already, through their wages, in a position to pay an economic rent, it is their employers that we should call on and require them to pay their industrial employees a living wage.  We should not require neighbours of these people, who are worse off than they are, to subsidise their housing.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no use in finding fault with an existing abuse unless you are prepared to make a constructive proposal for its solution, and I do now make such a proposal.  I say that a man who is employed in agriculture&mdash; an agricultural worker in the narrow definition of that word, that is, a person working for a farmer &mdash; is entitled to get his house on the subsidised terms envisaged in this code, but that an agricultural labourer, as defined under the Act, who is not working on the land, might still be regarded as eligible for a house, the only condition being that he was prepared to pay an economic rent.  Now, that would mean that where a man was truly an agricultural labourer &mdash; in fact, such a man as is not required to pay unemployment insurance &mdash; he would be entitled to get a house at the subsidised rent, but that any man stamping an unemployment insurance card would be required to <Col N="395" /> pay an economic rent, which would be about 5/- for the cottage for which he is now paying 3/-.  Surely, that is a fair proposal?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell has touched on the situation with regard to housing in Dublin, and we are warned that we are not to open the whole question of housing policy.  Very well, but I think it is legitimate to say this.  I have been watching the attempts that were made to grapple with that problem for the last 15 years, and I cannot too often remind this House that one of my first excursions in publicity in this city was to read a paper on the slums at the King's Inns Debating Society 14 or 15 years ago.  On that occasion, I  asked a question which I respectfully propose to ask again.  If you ever approach housing authorities they will tell you that one of the reasons why they cannot eliminate the slums is that the people are living in the slums and, if they pull down these slums, they cannot provide accommodation for the displaced tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister introduced this amending Bill because, undoubtedly, we had extreme difficulty recently in Cork in this connection, and I am sorry that the Bill was not introduced some two or three years earlier. As for the definition of a farm labourer given by Deputy Dillon, the 1919 Act was brought in by the British House of Commons, and I understand that the Irish Party were there in 1919.  That was the Act which broadened the definition of an agricultural labourer&mdash; it was not broadened here &mdash; and that Act defined an agricultural labourer as any man working for hire in a rural area.  That is putting it bluntly.  I am glad, however, that the Department of Local Government and Public Health have extended their views very much in this matter during the past few years.  I remember the case of an unfortunate man who was endeavouring to get a grant some time ago to repair his house.  He was a rural blacksmith, and he wrote up to the Department asking for a grant.  He got back a very curt letter to the effect that he was not eligible for a grant under the Act, since he was not a man earning his livelihood in the pursuit of agriculture.  He wrote back saying that if any Minister or any official of the Department had spent as much time as he had spent, down on one knee putting shoes on farmers' horses, and trying to get the money from the farmers afterwards, they would realise that he surely had spent his life in the pursuit of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular point I wish to deal with, however, is that 174 houses were built recently in the suburbs of Cork&mdash; outside Cork City &mdash; for, more or less, artisan labourers, and the Department's ruling in regard to those houses was that any man working in Cork City was not entitled to a house.  Now, that placed us in the position that, whilst the houses were built to replace condemned houses in the area, the occupants of these condemned houses could not get a house because a large number of them were working inside the borough boundaries of Cork.  So, despite the ruling of the county medical <Col N="397" /> officer of health and others, those people were absolutely cut out before the county medical officer of health could consider the cases.  The county medical officer of health has to consider the cases of those who are the worst off, but these cases had to be cut out first.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Dillon is coming at in connection with railway workers and industrial workers living in cottages.  Does he mean that the cottages were built in the original case for agricultural labourers?  Does he mean that if a cottage was built for an agricultural labourer and if that agricultural labourer got married and reared a family that that family should always continue to be agricultural labourers and that none of them should ever rise above the state of agricultural labourer &mdash; that if one of them, who occupied a cottage, became a railway worker he was to lose the cottage? I may say 90 per cent. of the cases where labourers' cottages are held today by non-agricultural labourers are cases where the cottage was built for the father, when the father died it was transferred to the son and the son succeeded in getting something higher than an agricultural labourer's job.</P>

      <P>The definition of agricultural labourer is anyone working for agriculture and it does not matter what way he is working.  I regret the farmers in North Cork are so foolish that Deputy Linehan succeeds in getting nearly all his money out of them. He gets some out of the townsmen, too. He is not working all the time for the farmer.  I honestly believe this amending Bill is required if it was only to remedy the injustice which I have pointed out now where, although those cottages were built to replace condemned houses, the people who were in the condemned houses could not get them because they happened to be working outside the borough boundaries. In regard to the lodgers that <Col N="398" /> Deputy Dillon referred to, I do not know whether Deputy Dillon is aware that a cottier cannot sub-let, according to law.</P>

I do not think Deputy Dillon would go so far as to ask a board of health to evict a labourer out of a cottage just because he happened to be a railway worker who had got the cottage from his father who was an agricultural worker.  Surely the labourer ought to have some rights and if a labourer has paid for his cottage for the past 25 or 30 years he surely ought to have the right of handing that cottage over to his son, in the same way that a farmer hands over his farm to his son.</P>

If an outside body says: &ldquo;We will lend a certain body £500,000 for housing if the Government will secure it in the event of the borrowers not paying at the proper time,&rdquo; will the Government give a guarantee?

      <P>I quite agree.  At the moment, I think Deputy Dockrell will agree with me, there is hardly a timber merchant in the country who has any red deal or red pine.  Most of it has been commandeered by the military in this country.  I do think white deal would have done the Department of Defence just as well, because they are building temporary structures which, perhaps, will be pulled down again in four or five years' time, and white deal would do just as well to make sashes and door frames, whereas in the building of houses you require red deal and red pine.  Undoubtedly, some representations ought to be made through the Housing Board with a view to asking the military to lessen their grip on this particularly good kind of timber which is required for the building of houses. I do not believe this Bill is going to do any good in so far as the building of houses is concerned, because there is at the moment no timber in the country suitable for building houses. You will be told, of course, in so far as sashes are concerned, to get steel sashes.  These are all manufactured in Dublin, and surely the country carpenter wants some work to do.  There <Col N="400" /> is a good number of carpenters idle all over the country at the present time, and they would be very glad to be making sashes for houses in various parts of the country.  We have a scheme in Wexford Corporation at the moment for a number of houses, and, as a result of there being no red pine in Wexford, we had to get steel sashes made in Dublin.  I submit that when the Department of Local Government set out on a house building campaign they had in mind both the giving of employment and the procuring of houses.  I would ask the Minister to do something in this connection, because I know that the military have a good deal of this red pine and red deal stored up, and, perhaps, rotting in some of their places, while people are waiting to build houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Corry, I do not agree with Section 2 of this Bill, amending Section 3 of the Labourers Act, 1936, widening the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;. I think it is very serious for the farm workers of the country.  In my area, in North Cork, we are completing a scheme of 500 houses.  We have let 487 of them up to date and, as a member of that board, I can say that 100 per cent. of those houses have been let to purely agricultural workers.  It was for those people they were built and the farmers and people of North Cork are paying to the tune of, I think, 5d. in the £ per annum, subsidising the rents and the initial cost of that scheme. Now that the definition of agricultural labourer is being widened under this Bill, if we are to have a further Scheme &mdash; as I hope we will &mdash; a man working for his hire at other work besides agriculture will be entitled to apply and to become a tenant of one of those houses.  There is also the danger in regard to the existing houses that have been built that when they become vacant they could be let to a school teacher, in fact, or to a man working in a lather comfortable job other than an agricultural worker.</P>

      <P>But the Deputy must remember and the House must remember that the Minister made an order when this scheme was going through, to be carried out in the letting of these cottages by the local authorities, that there was no one entitled to become a tenant of these houses except a person living in a condemned house.  There were certain other clauses in that order.  The local authority had very little to say in the letting of those new houses.  That order was carried out in regard to the 487 houses.  They were let under the Minister's instructions so that the board had very little to do with the letting of them.  But I am glad to say, as a member of that board, that we have agricultural labourers living in them and the men who came before the inquiry were all agricultural labourers and nobody but an agricultural labourer, as far as I know, was ever appointed a tenant of a cottage by the North Cork Board of Health.  That is why I am opposed to the widening of the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and the Government want to provide houses for people other than agricultural labourers &mdash; and when I say an agricultural labourer I say the definition should be strictly a man working on land for a farmer&mdash; then let them have a separate housing scheme, but do not ask the ratepayers of the country to provide houses for people who should be able to pay an economic rent.</P>

      <P>That is right, Sir.  The ratepayers of the country should not be asked to provide houses for people who are able to pay an economic rent. I know we have let those 500 houses at an uneconomic rent.  We have let a house with a quarter of ground for 1/3 a week.  The ratepayers of North Cork <Col N="402" /> are paying something like 2/6 or 2/9 per week to subsidise the building of that house.  We have let a house with half an acre of ground for 1/5 per week, and a house with an acre of ground at 1/7 per week.  That is about the rent which the agricultural labourer is able to pay.  I am opposed to the widening of the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;, and I say that, if the Minister and Government want to provide houses for people other than those, then they should bring in a separate scheme, and not ask the people of the country to build houses and subsidise them for people who should be able to pay an economic rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the extension arises at the moment in this way.  The first case of hardship that came to my notice&mdash;although there were individual cases&mdash;was when a scheme was put forward out in Finglas. In the case of the people who were mainly instrumental in getting those houses built, and getting that scheme put into operation, people whose families had been living for generations in the little village of Finglas, it was found, when the houses were to be allocated, that under the laws as they existed they could not get houses because they happened to be grave diggers in Glasnevin.  I found from the county medical officer of health that a similar situation arose in Dundrum.  It is mainly in the county boroughs that the difficulties arose; we have not had any difficulty in the urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty those unfortunate people would be in is this: that they could not get a cottage in the rural area where they reside, and they could not get a cottage in the borough area because they would have to be resident, there for two years.  Those unfortunate people would find themselves between <Col N="404" /> two stools.  That was really the reason for putting in this amendment.  I have nothing in mind about industrial workers at all.  I think industrial workers should be made pay for their houses.  I think that people who can afford to pay should be made pay for them.  I did consider that in cases like Finglas, cases in Cork, and this case in Dundrum, where that position obtained.</P>
    <P>Again, it is a matter for the board of health, who have the allocation of those cottages, on the advice of tee county medical officer of health.  I do not think they would be very agreeable &mdash;certainly not if they had much regard for their respftnsibility&mdash;to letting houses to people who are in a position to pay for them, while other people who are not so well able to pay are deprived of them.  Certainly, that is not my intention.  It is to meet that difficulty that I brought in this amendment. Deputy Linehan raised a question about the title.  That is a difficult matter.  We have been in communication with the registrar of title on other matters apart from the matter raised by Deputy Linehan.  I should be very grateful if Deputy Linehan would give me some idea of the difficulties with which he has been confronted, because we have not had representation to any extent&mdash;a few cases have arisen &mdash;in that matter.  I should be glad it he would give us some particulars which we might take up with the registrar of title, and do something perhaps to simplify the thing or make it more easily workable.</P>
    <P>As regards this third section, I do hope that a great deal can be done by the building societies, such as the Civil Service Permanent Building Society and a number of others in this city, I believe a good deal could be done with the guarantee of the local authorities. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is amending the Building Societies Act so that that two-thirds can be increased to three-fourths, that is that they will be enabled to take deposits to the extent of three-fourths of the mortgages they have out.  When they get that money in, they can arrange further mortgages.  Any one building society could increase the <Col N="405" /> money available for this purpose to the extent of £100,000.  There are four or five of them in Dublin, and the banks are agreeable that there should be some arrangement come to, provided there is a guarantee by the local authorities.  The local authority would be agreeable to do that, because they would be safeguarded by the rules and conditions that are laid down.</P>

      <P>That the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, 1941, tabled on May 8th, 1941, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>The object of this motion is to convince the House that it was unwise economics and bad national policy for the Government to make this Emergency Powers Order.  At the outset, it may be desirable to correct a prevailing misconception as to the purpose of the order.  It has been referred to by Ministers and by the Press as a standstill order but, of course, it has none of the characteristics of a standstill order.  For instance, it does not prevent a reduction of wages, it does not prevent large sections of workers being put on half-time, it does not guarantee that workers will hold the jobs which they had on 7th May, 1941.  It does none of these things; it merely keeps wage's low, and keeps low wages below the subsistence level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be thought, reference to the wages paid to certain classes of workers in employment, that we generally have a high wage-level in this <Col N="408" /> country, but an examination of industrial classifications will disprove any such erroneous contention.  For instance, if we take as an example the engineering industry and examine its wages bill we find that in 1939 the average wage for male workers in that industry was 54/1 per week.  If we take the linen, cotton and jute industry as another example&mdash;and these are average samples of wage scales industries&mdash;the average wage in 1939 was 45/7 per week.  If we go to industries which are monopolised in a large measure by women and ascertain their wage levels, we find that, spread over the year. these industries are rarely capable of providing an average wage of 30/- a week to the operatives engaged therein. If we take the Census of Production&mdash;produced officially&mdash;and examine the wage scales of industrial workers, we find that the proportion earning more than 60/- per week over a year or over a period of years is negligible, compared with the large number of workers, male and female, who are earning on an average substantially less than that figure.</P>
    <P>This order takes no cognisance whatever of the wage scales in any particular industry.  If it finds workers sweated in an industry then it says, by implication, that the sweating is to continue.  If it finds workers in an industry where wages are higher but still unsatisfactory, it preserves that condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>In respect of a large number of occupations covered by the order, in no case does it provide for any increase whatever over the scale of wages paid on 7th May, 1941.  For instance, in any particular town or in any particular section of industry, if there should happen to be a single employer who is regarded generally by other employers as paying a low rate of wages and who on that account is taking an unfair advantage of his own colleagues in that industry, this order described as a stabilisation order piovides that that bad employer, notwithstanding objections by his own colleagues, notwithstanding the efforts of trade unions to raise the wages, can still continue to pay the low rate of wages and it is made an offence for him to increase <Col N="409" /> them even if he now desires to do so.</P>
    <P>In other words, if in a particular town there are two factories, one paying a recognised trade union rate of wages and the other paying less than that, and if the unions want the nonunion factory to pay rates comparable to the union factory, and if the employers in the union factory desire that their competitors also should be required to pay wages equal to those in the union factory, this order prevents the bad employer being compelled, either by force of public opinion, by the efforts of trade unions or by the influence of his fellow employer, to raise his rate of wages above the low level in operation on 7th May, 1941.  This order does everything possible&mdash;and does it very efficiently and effectively&mdash;to give every security to the bad employer.  It protects him against the force of public opinion, and against trade union action.</P>
    <P>Any of these new industrialists who came into this country in recent years from any part of the world&mdash;some of whom never were anxious to recognise the necessity to pay trade union rates of wages&mdash;and who may have succeeded up to the 7th May this year in avoiding their responsibilities in that connection, can continue to avoid them during the currency of this order.  It protects them against any demand for an increase in wages in respect of their lowly-paid employees.</P>
    <P>An order of this kind would be difficult to justify in any circumstances, because it represents a complete reversal of the normal process of improvement of the standard of living and an effort to reverse the whole social tendency towards a better standard of life.  But the order takes on a new viciousness when we find it made operative in a period when prices have risen and continue to rise with such alarming rapidity.  If we take the cost-of-living index figure for July, 1914, as 100, the official cost-of-living index figure in August, 1939, was 173.  If we trace the movement of the index figure from August, 1939, to February, 1941, we find that the figure moved from 173 in August, 1939, to 218 in February, 1941, an increase of 26 per cent.  No <Col N="410" /> group of workers in this country have received in that period a wage increase of anything approaching 26 per cent. In fact, I would say that the general level of such wage increases as took place between those two periods was on an average not more than about 5 per cent.  So that, while workers' wages have in some instances increased by 5 per cent., according to the Government's official figures the cost-of-living index figure, which represents the movement in the price of commodities, has risen by 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>During that period we have, of course, seen the most ineffective methods applied to dealing with price movements.  Away back in September, 1939, we had a grandiose declaration by the Minister for Supplies with regard to what was described as a standstill order in respect of prices, and pegging down prices to the level in operation in the last days of August, 1939.  But since then we have seen one commodity after another removed from the scope of the prices standstill order, and, so far have some of them been removed from the scope of that order that the price of these commodities in many instances has increased by 50, 80, and in some instances 100 per cent.  No effective steps have been taken to control prices in this country.</P>
    <P>No effective measures have been taken against hoarders who exploited the shortage of commodities and then try to charge the fancy prices which are being charged for those scarce commodities to-day.  Tea is still being offered to the public at 6/- and 7/- per lb.  You can get almost any price for white flour, owing to the activities of certain racketeers who appear to enjoy Ministerial benediction in this country. Petrol is being offered to the public at 10/- a gallon, and some people in certain areas are looking for 70/- for a ton of turf.  All that is happening; Deputies know it is happening; members of the public know it is happening. The only people who do not know it is happening are the people we pay and expect to know it is happening, and expect to deal with the situation.  Any effort effectively to control prices has long since been abandoned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies seems to <Col N="411" /> have resigned himself to complete inability to take any effective steps to control prices.  The Minister does not seem to know on what commodity tlie next increase in price is likely to take place.  The Minister is presented with demands for increases in prices and, in the most baby-like fashion, he authorises the increases.  That is why the cost of living has risen by no less than 26 per cent. in a period of 15 months.  If one is to judge by indications, and if one is to reflect on the incompetent methods employed for controlling prices, one may be sure that during the next 15 months there will be a still greater increase in prices than during the past 15 months.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Justice was asked in this House to introduce legislation to control the rents of houses.  Wages are prevented from rising under this order; house rents may still rise notwithstanding this order or any order.  Of course there is now only a small number of houses within the scope of the Rent Restriction Acts.  Although the Government made an order of this kind keeping wages low, the Minister for Justice the other day refused to make an order to keep rents even at their pre-war level; so that anybody who cares to speculate in house purchase or in the letting of houses in tenements or in the conversion of those houses into what are described as self-contained flats has the full permission of the Government, and the Minister for Justice in particular, to charge any rent he likes.  Not only is he not prevented by any section of this order from doing so, but we have not a single order in operation which prevents a racketeer of that kind exacting any rent he can from those who, in present circumstances, have perforce to resort to the tenancy of houses owned by such people.</P>
    <P>It is clear to anybody who knows the position that this country is the Mecca of profiteers.  No country in the world treats them with such kindliness and such tenderness.  If you ask the Minister to deal with profiteering, it would seem as if the profiteer was a kind of national apostle; the Minister gets indignant usually, gets vituperafive, <Col N="412" /> and proceeds to denounce anyone who suggests that this kind of national hammerheaded shark ought to be asked to yield up any portion of his ill-gotten gains in a crisis such as that through which we are now passing.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the real purpose of this order.  I am bewildered by the explanations given by different Ministers from time to time.  I should like to get some authoritative declaration from the Government as to what the purpose of the order is.  We are told by one Minister that the object is to prevent inflation.  The person who talks of an order of this kind preventing inflation has not yet reached the kindergarten stage of economics.  It is a well-established fact that you cannot have inflation where yon have unused national resources.  This country abounds in unused national resources, which, if labour were applied to them, would give us new sources of wealth and new national assets.  So long as we have unused resources of that kind, unused labour power, and instruments of production, it is sheer economic heresy to talk of the possibility of inflation. We can only get inflation when we have used up our national resources and cannot create new wealth against the new money put into circulation.  I suspect that the purpose of the order is frankly and avowedly, to keep prices. &mdash;wages down.</P>

      <P>Surely, we are not going to have any more of this cackling from the Minister?  No wonder things are in such a mess when that is the kind of contribution we get from the Minister. The purpose of this order, as declared on its face, is to keep prices down&mdash; wages down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the manner in which that is done, there is not the slightest regard for the type of wages kept down.  This order prevents an apprentice, in an industry to which the Apprenticeship Act applies, getting an increase in wages.  Even a lowly-paid apprentice cannot get an increase under <Col N="413" /> the scope of this Emergency Powers Order.  In order to make this order effective we had to tear up the Wages Agreement Register establislied under the Conditions of Employment Act; we had to scrap the trade union clause as made applicable in the Housing Acts, and the Wages Board establislied under the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act had similarly to be jettisoned in order to give effect to this order which, in its operation, takes no cognisance of the wage scales which it wants to keep down.</P>
      <P>One would imagine that in their approach to the problem the Government might have observed some definite scale in the matter of wages.  One might even understand this reasoning, if one did not agree with it, that, in respect to wages not over a certain level, no effort will be made to peg these down to the level of the 7th May, 1941.  One might understand the Government saying, in respect to low wages: &ldquo;We will permit these to rise within certain limits.&rdquo;  But the Government did not do that.  They said to the man in receipt of indefensibly low wages: &ldquo;You will not get an increase in wages and neither will a person who has four or ten times as much.&rdquo;  What is the purpose, and where are the moral ethics, of an order of that kind, which takes no cognisance of the varying wage scales and treats the underpaid worker in the same way as a much better-off worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this order in relation to employment and in relation to production generally will be obvious after it has been in operation for a short period.  With prices rising as rapidly as they are, there will be less money to spend on goods.  Money wages will now be less than formerly and money wages will, therefore, buy an ever-dwindling quantity of goods and, as every wage envelope is a demand on industry to deliver up goods to the value of the contents of the wages envelope, then the less the contents of the envelope will buy the less goods it will be necessary for us to produce and the less value we give wages&mdash;and we are giving them a diminishing value by our willingness to allow prices to rise&mdash; then the less goods it will be necessary <Col N="414" /> to produce to satisf that wage demand, because the wages will not be capable of purchasing the same quantity of goods as formerly.  In turn, that will result in a contraction of employment in industry and a contraction of the demand for goods and services. In the sphere of agriculture it will result in a demand for less milk, butter, meat, eggs, for less of all those commodities which were formerly purchasable when wages were capable of purchasing more goods than the shrunken value of wages can buy to-day.</P>
    <P>Why was it found necessary to make. an order of this kind?  This order seems to me to be vicious both in its conception and in its application.  One might understand the making of such an order if there had been any unreasonable demands made by workers for wage increases.  But there have been no such unreasonable demands made by any section of workers and, if it is alleged that such demands led to the making of this order, then the Minister ought to tell us what demands were made, what was the extent of the demands and by whom they were made.  Even if any such unreasonable demands were made&mdash;and I deny that they were&mdash;it surely was possible to. deal with a situation of that kind without resort to the making of an order of the type we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that in a democratic country which sought to resolve its problems by the impact of reason on reason, and which sought peaceful evolutionary progress by reliance on similar methods, there would have been a discussion between, let us say, the Government and representatives of the employers and workers with a view to endeavouring to regulate wage movements in some kind of ordered fashion during this emergency and at the same time regulate price movements and fix a price control as well.  Nobody desires to see the products of industry sold at bankrupt prices.  I stand for the fixing of a fair level of prices for every commodity and for the fixing of a fair level of wages because, just as I think it unfair to exploit a worker and pay him a low wage, so do I think in respect to <Col N="415" /> industry or agriculture that it is unfair to compel the producer of goods to sell his commodities at a price that does not give a fair return for the capital invested therein.  It seems to me, however, that no consideration was given by the Government to the question of finding a remedy, if it were necessary to find a, remedy, for any unreasonable demands made by workers in any type of industry.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if such a problem were extant it was always possible for the Government to approach a solution of it by methods other than those employed in the Emergency Powers Order.  The Government might have considered the question of establishing a tribunal to deal with demands by workers for wage increases.  In our largest industry, the railway industry, there has been in operation for many years a piece of machinery which has been a valuable medium for adjusting disputes in that industry.</P>
    <P>The Railway Wages Board is an organisation which deals with applications by railway unions and railway companies for increases or reductions, as the case may be, in wages.  The tribunal, by reason of its personnel, is capable of pronouncing impartially and yet authoritatively on demands which are submitted to it and the findings of that tribunal have, in practically all cases, been accepted by the unions and the railway companies.  It is because of that fact that in our largest industry we have had a period of industrial peace.  There has been no dislocation of our railway industry, but there has been a general recognition, both by the unions and by the railway companies, of the beneficial effects of that piece of machinery in relation to that industry.</P>
    <P>Why could the Government not have considered the adoption of methods such as that as a means of regulating wage demands and adjusting wage movements?  It ought to be possible for the Government to have consulted with employers' organisations and workers' organisations for the purpose of ascertaining whether machinery of that kind could not be devised in respect <Col N="416" /> of all industries and services, so as to provide for a fair and equitable regulation of wages during the period of emergency.  Of course, the Government wore too big and too dictatorial to rely on the wisdom of anyone but themselves.  Instead they make an order, such as Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, completely regardless of the consequences of that order in its relation to workers affected by it. Apart from the defects that I indicated, this order shows a most muddled conception of the purpose and use of money.  It seems to render obeisance to money and to the form of money that existed in the last century.  We seem to be the one country in the world left to render worshipful allegiance to a system of currency and credit that has been long discarded by other enlightened countries.  Here we continue to worship a Victorian conception of money and money values, and in our worship of that conception of money we completely lose our sense of human values and our sense of moral values, in order that we can continue to worship what the rest of the world has found to be a palpable delusion.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that sound economic thinking would have induced the Government here as a remedy for some of the intensified evils which the emergency situation might well bring upon us, to put people into employment, believing that the most wasteful form of national expenditure is the keeping of people in a state of involuntary idleness.  Every citizen is fed out of a common national pool, but if a person contributes nothing to that pool, while still taking from it, that person can only continue to do so at the price of debasing the standard of living of all those who contribute to the pool.  We have still very large numbers unemployed, notwithstanding the flight of thousands across the Border, notwithstanding the fact that we have more than doubled our Army, notwithstanding the artificial employment available this year in the form of the increased production of turf, and notwithstanding the increased acreage under cultivation.  You cannot sow and <Col N="417" /> garner crops for ever; you cannot cut turf the whole year round; and when the harvest is in, we will be approaching a period during which it will not be possible to produce turf or to find employment to the same extent in agriculture, so that an already serious unemployment problem will become more intensified.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the Government would have approached whatever economic difficulties exist by putting additional workers into employment in every sphere of national activity, in which the utilisation of their energies would have created new capital assets or enriched the national estate.  One would imagine that in a country where productivity is so low&mdash; and it is appallingly low because we are too lazy to plan to increase it&mdash;the Governmynt would recognise that production must be intensified and national development accelerated in every possible way.  Here, however, we continue to plod along in the same old Micawber fashion, doing things in 1941 because they were done that way in 1921, although other countries have long since abandoned the methods upon which we rely to-day.  If, in peace time our lazy and inefficient methods gave such appallingly poor results, how much poorer are these results likely to be when we try to apply peace-time methods to a rapidly worsening war-time situation?  It seems to me that there is an undue saturation into the minds of many people in public life of the belief that all that has to be done is to keep wages low, and then automatically that will be a passport to permanent prosperity. If low wages could ever make a country prosperous, China would be one of the greatest and most prosperous countries, and it would probably have close competition in Abyssinia or Liberia.  Low wages have not made these countries great or prosperous. On the contrary, in countries where wages are high there has been built up a system of industrial and commercial greatness which is the envy of other countries.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a high standard of living builds up a people with character, independence and stability, and makes <Col N="418" /> more useful citizens in our common world than those destined unfortunately to live in countries where low wages are worshipped in the manner that they are worshipped here.  New Zealand is a small country and in many respects resembles our own.  It provides an example of what can be done. The population of New Zealand is about half the population of this country and it is not situated as close to a great market as we are.  In New Zealand during the past 21 months wages have been raised, until agricultural workers now enjoy a wage of £3 12s. 6d. for a 48-hour week, while the average wage of industrial workers is 2/4 an hour for a 40-hour week.  Men working in Government employment are paid 18/- a day for an eight-hour day and a five-day week.  Yet, the cost-of-living index in New Zealand in August, 1940, was only 4 per cent. higher than in August, 1939.  In Eire, between August, 1939, and August, 1940, the cost of living increased by 17 per cent.  Our workers would think people were mad if they were offered wages comparable to those in operation in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>What seems to me to be most vicious about this order is the manner in which it was made.  In 1939 this House passed the Emergency Powers Act for the purpose of giving the Government power to deal with the then threatening international situation. The Government asked for these powers so that they might utilise them to defend the nation and defend the homes of our people, but we find that in making this order the powers of the Act have been used, not to defend the nation but to attack the homes of the workers who, in turn, are expected to defend the nation.</P>
    <P>There never was a greater prostitution of governmental power than that revealed in the promulgation of Emergency Powers Order No. 83.  An Act which was got by the Government under false pretences, the pretence of defending the nation against aggression and of preserving its liberties and independence, is being used to make a savage attack on the standard of living of the workers.  That attack is being made at a time when the Government confess, by their own action, their complete <Col N="419" /> inability to control the prices of essential commodities in the State. This order has, in my view, one purpose, and that is to debase the standard of living of the workers.  So far as this country is concerned, if this order is continued, the effect on the workers will be gradually to drive them down to a very much lower standard of living than that which, after years of toil and sacrifice, they had managed to attain.</P>
    <P>I think the Government have shown a complete lack of economic sense in promulgating an order of this kind. They have shown that they have very little regard for those higher purposes which ought to animate a Government in this State to-day.  By the making of it, the Government have sown, and soWn thickly, the seeds of discontent and disunity, and appear, even in this crisis, to be quite unconcerned with the consequences of their action.</P>
    <P>Both disunity and discontent have been made manifest by the promnlgation of this order.  The discontent is intensified by the efforts which are being made by the Government to strangle the only piece of protection the workers have&mdash;their trade unions. The Government, in these circumstances, cannot afford to ignore the current of public opinion.  There is a widespread demand for the withdrawal of this order, and widespread indignation at the unfair character of it. If the Government were wise and concerned with the preservation of national unity, they would take immediate steps to withdraw it, and allow workers their legitimate right to claim compensation for the increase in prices that has taken place.  I suggest to the Government that, even now, although harm has been done, it is not yet too late to repair the harm: that even now they might withdraw the order and, instead, arrange for a discussion with employers and workers with a view to the regulation of wages and price movements.  In that way I think we would be much more likely to beget stable conditions in industry and agriculture during the present emergency than we are by reliance on an order of this kind which has no <Col N="420" /> economic justification, which is devoid of all moral foundation and which, in its operation, can only inflict untold hardships on many thousands of lowly-paid workers in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Deputy Norton has fairly fully covered the grounds as to why the order should be annulled.  One is temptad to ask what motives can have prompted serious-minded men, entrusted with the government of this State, to make such an order and to inflict it on the country. The Emergency Powers Art was given to the Government to enable it to deal with an emergency of a national character.  That Act had the support of all Parties in the House.  I am sure that no member of the House, not even tncse sitting on the Government Benches, ever thought that the Government would, in such a short time, turn around and, without consultation with anyone, use the powers given them under that Act against the workers of the country.</P>
      <P>That is what they have done by pro mulgating this order.  I make no pretensions to legal knowledge, but I feel fairly confident that this order would not stand the test of the courts if an appeal were made to the courts, and that it would be held the Government had over-reached themselves in making it; that they had, in fact, abused the powers given to them by all Parties in the House to enable them to deal with a national emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An order of this kind is, in my opinion, calculated to damage the interests of the nation as a whole.  We find the basis for it, I think, in the statement made by the Minister for Finance when introducing the emergency Budget in December, 1939.  On that occasion he said that the Government had set their faces against anybody in this country increasing their wages and salaries at the expense of the State, irrespective of any increase that would take place in the cost of living.  He confessed there, as he had to, that increases in the cost of living were inevitable, notwithstanding all that a Government might do to counteract them.  The war situation, however, was such that no Government <Col N="421" /> could keep prices to the level which obtained in September, 1939.  We allege that the Government could have been more active since then in trying to keep down and control prices.  It must be agreed, however, that no matter how active or assiduous they might be in their efforts, certain increases were bound to take place.  As Deputy Norton has pointed out, since the outbreak of the war the cost of living here, whether through the Government's negligence or otherwise, has increased by 26 per cent.  That figure is taken from Government statistics.  We must take it, therefore, that the framers of this Emergency Powers Order No. 83 assumed that the people of this country, rural and industrial, were in such a happy, comfortable position before the outbreak of the war that they could afford to bear, without any compensating increase in their wages or salaries, a 26 per cent. increase in the cost of living, a figure that may go still higher while the emergency lasts, despite the Government's best efforts.  I think that what I have said may be taken as a fair reading of the mentality of the people who framed this order.  I challenge the Minister to deny that when he is replying. He has already denied it to me personally.</P>
    <P>In making an order of this kind, there is one factor that no body of sensible or serious-minded men could afford to ignore, and that is the standard of living of the people on whom they were going to impose this standstill order.  It should also occur to their minds what section of the country they were going to serve by it.  The Minister for Finance, in his recent financial statement, said that the order was intended to be complementary to the proposals in regard to income-tax and corporation profits tax, and to prevent inequalities in purchasing power, due to a general increase in prices, accomlunied by increased wages in certain industries and decreased wages or unemployment in certain other industries which, through a lessening in production due to a lack of essential commodities, could not provide increased wages even by passing on the increase <Col N="422" /> to the consumer.  That, as far as I know, is the only printed record we have to indicate the Government's reasons for making the order.  The Government, apparently, believe that in making this order they are performing a national service.  I want to suggest that in adopting that kind of reasoning in the present emergency they are not worthy to be trusted with control of the nation's affairs.  Workers' wages were not of such a character that they could afford to bear the vast increase in the cost of living that has taken place since the outbreak of war.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke of the railway industry.  I happen to have been closely connected with that industry for very many years.  It performs a very important function in this State.  It is the biggest employer in the country. Deputy Norton has indicated that, in recent years in connection with that industry, machinery known as the Railway Wages Board was set up. That was done without any order of this character.  The board has been functioning for a number of years, and is respected both by employers and employees.  During the period of its existence, reductions have taken place in the wages of employees according as conditions in the industry were held to justify or warrant them, or were alleged to warrant them.  The reductions took place, the workers being asked to tighten their belts.</P>
    <P>The statement which I shall make now is an amazing one but it can be substantiated and proved.  It is that, under the machinery of trade unions operating through the wages board, the railwaymen have contributed back to the industry no less than £9,500,000 as their contribution to keeping it going &mdash; that is from the time when they were in receipt of peak wages. In 1921, which was the peak period, the wages of a railway porter were 66/6 a week.  From that date until now, those railwaymen&mdash;approximately 8,000 in number&mdash;have contributed bacK in reductions, owing to the difficulties of the industly, no less than £9,500,000.  That is a case in point. There was no necessity for a standstill order in that case.  It was really a retreating order and the railwaymen <Col N="423" /> retreated in the best order they could, recognising their duty as citizens, striving as best they could to maintain their families but appreciating that the industry was not able to pay the wages which they had previously been receiving. The scales for railway porters have now been reduced to 41/- a week town and 30/6 a week in the country respectively.  Does the Minister consider that these men are so well placed that they can maintain their families and perform their functions as citizens, with a 26 per cent. increase in the cost of living imposed upon them?</P>
    <P>These men and other workers are not alone contributing to the maintenance of their families but, as is well known and as will scarcely be denied by the Minister, they have been contributing to the maintenance of widows and orphans whose treatment by the present Government and the past Government was a positive disgrace. As the Minister knows, nobody is so charitable as the poor, and these men have been making their contributions to relieve the necessities of others.  Widows and orphans have had legislation in their favour introduced by the present Government and passed.  To the extent to which that legislation has been placed on the Statute book we are grateful to the Government, but the levels established under the Act are deplorable from the point of view of a Christian Government. The pensions allowed&mdash;7/6 in the town and 5/- in the country&mdash;are not reasonable.  I know that workers have been contributing from their scanty wages to the maintenance of widowed mothers, mothers-in-law and other relatives in addition to keeping their own homes going.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Norton said, this is not a standstill order, because all the reductions that are desired can be effected under it.  The Minister would call it instead a &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order.  This is an instruction to the trade unions to cease their activities.  I contend that any organisation which has a definite objective or function, and which is robbed of that objective or function, will, by non-utilisation of its machinery in that direction, cease to be of effect. The primary function of a trade union <Col N="424" /> is, surely, to improve the standard of living of its members.  By this order, the Minister makes it impossible for any trade union to secure a 1d. increase for any employee in any part of the country so long as the order operates. The order goes further than that.  It makes it impossible for any employer, no matter how well-intentioned he may be, to grant increases to his employees. Since the war emergency period, increases have been given, through the intervention of trade unions in some cases, but, in many other cases, voluntarily, by employers to their employees. I can produce evidence to show that, without any request from employees, employers recognised that the increased cost of living had placed an unfair burden on their workers, who were carrying out their duties fairly and satisfactorily, and they voluntarily granted increases to these workers. That is made impossible by the Government under this order.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the unions have no further function.  They cannot look for an increase of 1/- or 1d. for their members. Who is going to benefit by this procedure it is difficult to say.  Deputy Norton has dealt with the economic side of the question.  The old, outworn idea that you cannot take more out of a pool than is in it seems to have weighed with the Government.  We have heard the argument that you cannot take more out of a pint pot than is in it.  But the Government found that there was no bottom to that pint pot when they delved into it and brought up pensions for people who were alleged to be entitled to them, but in respect of whom no provision had been made for pensions.  When it comes to the case of the worker, you &ldquo;cannot take more out of the pint pot than is in it&rdquo;.  Deputy Norton has pointed out the real extent of this pool.  He explained that we were allowing workers to stagnate in idleness, and failing to avail of the potentialities offered by this undeveloped country at the present time.  There could be no justification for the introduction of this prohibiting order at any time but a time when the co-operation, support and help of all sections of citizens, with a view to their working <Col N="425" /> in harmony, is being sought, is surely not the time for the introduction of such an order.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government have expressed surprise at the indignation and resentment shown on the Labour Benches recently, but they do not seem to realise that they have sown deeply the seeds of distrust in the homes and hearts of the people by their action in connection with this order and the Trade Union Bill.  The Labour movement has a good historic record.  It has no reason to be ashamed of that record.  It has done nothing to justify this, treatment by people whom they assisted to power.  If the Government were wise, this order would never have seen the light of day.  Whoever is engineering matters behind the scenes must be aiming at the destruction and ruin of the Government.  &ldquo;Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first drive mad.&rdquo;  That is the only explanation of the introduction of this order. In common sense, there is no defence for it.  The Government seek to bind the workers down to a fixed limit which was admitted to be uneconomic even before the war increases in the cost of living came about.  They do this instead of putting their shoulder to the wheel and helping to devise schemes of employment at reasonably good scales of pay which would put money in circulation amongst shopkeepers and the community in general.  It is recognised that a reasonably well-paid working class is the best possible spending medium.  Wise spending is what we want, not holding on to what we really have not.  All our boasted wealth may go up in smoke one of these days.  Instead of trying to hold on to that sum of £300,000,000, we should concentrate on developing what we have.  We have a potential national asset in the idle people who are being shipped day after day in hundreds and thousands to Britain and elsewhere to escape the unemployment and misery which have been created under the present régime.</P>
    <P>Order 83 is a fair sample of what has come from that régime.  I should say rather that it is an outstanding example of criminality.  With Deputy Norton, I say that if there is any vestige of commonsense left in the <Col N="426" /> minds of the Government, they will reapply themselves to this question and withdraw Order 83.  It will not, and cannot, serve any useful purpose.  It will produce disastrous and chaotic consequences in the minds of the people and it will destroy that unity the preservation of which is the desire of others as well as the Government. If the Government are as anxious as they lead people to believe for the preservation of that unity, they should not throw these balls of discord amongst the people and they should not set them in conflict when the call to unity is sounded.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the points that have been made and to realise that he cannot serve any useful purpose by this order.  He would be doing a good day's work tor the future economically, nationally and socially by withdrawing the order and forgetting that it was ever introduced.</P>

      <P>If this order were to have the effect which Deputy Keyes mentioned&mdash;the effect of destroying this Government&mdash;then there would, at least, be something to be said in its favour.  There is nothing to be said in favour of it.  I invite any Deputy sitting behind the Minister to get up and make one point in favour of this order.  If Deputies feel they are not free to get up to make one point here in this House, I invite them to follow the very good example of one of their colleagues and write a letter about it to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  This order is a bad one.  It is an unjust order and it is made more contemptible still by the excuses which are offered in an attempt to justify its introduction, excuses which are offered not merely by certain Ministers and certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;not in the House but down the country&mdash;but in a leading article in the Government organ this morning.  This order, we are told, is brought in to save the workers themselves and, in particular, to save the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton very rightly said that people should not fall into the mistake of calling it a standstill order. <Col N="427" /> It is not a standstill order for the worker; it is a very definite moving back.  For the profiteer, if it does not help him forward towards far greater gains, it certainly does not put any shackles on him.  If there was to be any justification whatever for an order such as this, it could only be that, side by side with it, it was within the power of this Government and of this House to make another order, keeping the prices of commodities that have to be bought by wage-earners at the same figure as when the workers' wages were fixed.  I Put it to any fair-minded Deputy in this House that when you fix wages at a certain figure, beyond which you will not allow them to rise and when, you do not at the same time, whether it is because you are unable or because you are unwilling, fix prices, it is not a standstill order you are making.  When you keep wages at a certain level, and allow prices to increase, you are reducing wages because you are reducing the purchasing power of these wages.  What is the use of telling anybody that the purchasing power of a man who has 30/- a week to-day and who had 30/- a week two years ago, is not far less to-day, or that he is not in the unfortunate position that he can buy far less for his 30/- to-day than he could two years ago?</P>
    <P>Most Deputies in this House are purchasers of various commodities.  I want to put this question to them: Is there any Deputy in this House who can buy coal, meat, flour, clothes, boots, tea, or 101 other items I could mention at the same price as he could two years ago or even at the same price he could six months ago?  Let me take one item. The average working man two years ago or eighteen months ago could purchase a cwt. of coal at 2/6.  The price to-day is 4/8 to 5/6, if he can get it. That is just one item, and that represents a very important increase to a man with 25/- or 30/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could mention a great many other commodities.  Is it not a fact that the people to-day, particularly <Col N="428" /> the poor, cannot secure sufficient supplies of what to them are absolute necessities unless they are prepared to pay 100 to 150 per cent. over the price which these commodities cost two years ago, 12 months ago or even six mouths ago?  Let me take another item.  Take the poorest people in the country, the people who because of their poverty and low standard of living have been constrained to exist on tea, practically three times a day. They cannot get enough tea to-day, but they could get enough if they were prepared to pay 7/- a lb. for tea that cost 2/6 or 3/- a lb. 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>This is an order, we are told, to keep prices down.  Did anyone ever hear such a humbugging statement inside or outside the House?  Will the Minister mention one single article, the price of which this order is going to be effective in keeping down?  I shall go further and say that in existing circumstances &mdash;not only in existing circumstances but far more in the circumstances that are likely to arise in the future so far as anybody can see&mdash;it is beyond the power of this Government to keep prices down so far as a great many commodities are concerned.  Even with the best will in the world they are not in a position to do it, but they are going to take jolly good care that they will force the unfortunate underdog to accept the old scale of wages.  If he has to pay more for a certain commodity he has to grin and bear it and do with half the quantity he was able to purchase before.</P>

    <P>I think we ought to get our minds clear in relation to this matter, to cut out all the humbug, the cant and the excuses, and get down to the reality of the situation.  The Minister got these extraordinary powers from this House for the purpose of maintaining peace and order in this country.  That was the reason the House gave the Government very extnsive powers.  Very many members of the House were reluctant to give them these powers and very many people outside in the country thought that the House was not wise in giving them such powers.  They were given, as I have said, to preserve peace and order in the country.  Does anybody <Col N="429" /> suggest for one moment, that inflicting such grave injustice as this order inflicts on such a great number of our population, the poorest section of our population, is a step making for peace and order in the country?  I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>This order taken by itself is bad enough.  The Trade Union Bill taken by itself is bad enough, but the Trade Union Bill and this order taken together!  Talk about sitting on top of dynamite, it would be a comparatively safe place compared with the situation which will exist when the full effects of this order and the Trade Union Bill begin to be felt in the country.  Look at the powers the Minister is taking.  There are certain sections of workers in this country who have been consoling themselves with the thought that their occupations are not in the Schedule and that this order does not apply to them.  Let us see the security they have.  Let us refer to Article 3 sub-section (2) of the order:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, whenever and so often he thinks fit, by order under this paragraph, declare that any employment defined in such manner and by reference to such things as he thinks fit, shall be a scheduled employment for the purpose of this part of this order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the security with which some classes of workers are inclined to console themselves.  Talk about having a paper wall between yourself and hell! Let me take another paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this part of the order, the word &lsquo;employees&rsquo; means any person of the age of 14 years or upwards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us assume that this emergency will last for three or four years, that this order remains in force and that an employer of the class we have heard about so often here has a boy of 14 years of age in his employment at 5/-a week.  That boy goes on until he reaches 15, 16, 17 or, perhaps, 18 years of age.  Under this order as it stands, he goes on working for his 5/- a week. justice!</P>
    <P>We are told that this is designed to prevent the vicious circle, but does it? I have demonstrated already very clearly, I think, apart from what <Col N="430" /> was demonstrated by other speakers perhaps still more clearly, that it does no such thing.  Here we are talking about controlling prices and keeping prices at certain levels in an attempt to justify this order, while the fact is that the cost of living in this State, a State at peace and neutral in this war, is, so far as the food group of articles is concerned, 25 points higher than in Great Britain or the Six Counties, a country and a part of a country which are belligerent and up to their necks in war.  Notwithstanding that fact, and the fact that the British Government arc subsidising foodstuffs, there is no effort to make an order like this in England or Northern Ireland.  But we get it here.  This is a very serious matter in respect of which we are unfortunately confined, owing to certain circumstances, to three and a half hours' debate, when we have often spent three and a half days, and perhaps three and a half weeks, on matters of far less importance and matters which certainly had far fewer direct and bitter consequences for our people.  The consequences of this order will bring a good deal of misery&mdash; perhaps I should put it the other way and say will bring a greater measure of misery&mdash;into many thousands of homes in this country.</P>
    <P>The only way in which any Government could he justified in bringing an order like this before Parliament would be if they were in a position to say and to carry their statement into effect: &ldquo;We are going to stop wages increasing but, at the same time, we are going to stop prices increasing.&rdquo;  The old gag used to be that when prices went up; wages went up, that prices went up further and wages went up again, and that the old vicious circle, as people were pleased to call it, went on and on.  Now we are to have a position in which wages stand still under this order but, in reality, it is not a standstill order because it means a very definite and continuing reduction in the purchasing power of the workers' wages, while the profiteer can go on gaily, with no effective steps taken against him.  The Minister, I have not a shadow of doubt, will tell the House, in his best style, that another part of the order refers to dividends, to directors <Col N="431" /> of companies and to employers, but that is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  There are many other Deputies who wish to speak on this motion and, as the time for discussion has been limited by agreement, I do not desire to say any more on the matter.  I have tried to put what I had to say as clearly and concisely as I could, and I want to bring my remarks to a close with the expression of the hope that the Minister will rise as soon as possible and try to give to the House and the country some reason, if there is any, for introducing this ocder at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request made to the Minister to withdraw this standstill order.  I do so because of the fact that when it was first introduced we were told it would leave things as they were&mdash;foodstuffs were to remain at the same price and the person with a moderate wage was to get the same value for his money&mdash;but the Minister and his followers know that that is not true.  The cost of living has gone up much higher since then.  The cost of vegetables and every article of food has increased.  A few days ago I saw a crowd around a shop which used to sell tea to the working classes at 3/-a pound.  I asked what the trouble was and was told that there was plenty of tea there at 6/- a pound.  The 6/- tea, although we hear a good deal about rationing, was taken trom the people who were allowed half an ounce per week because, as they had not the money to pay for it, they could not get any additional supply, no matter what conditions they lived under or what goods they were able to buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey has referred to the fact that in the City of Dublin tea, bread and margarine were the essentials of many of our unfortunate tenement dwellers&mdash;not very nourishing, I agree, but it kept them, as a Minister said some time ago, from starvation. On that occasion, when the Minister was asked if that was all he would give them to save them from starvation, he said that it was not, that he would give them a gold chain.  I was at a function a few days ago at which a very eminent doctor of this city spoke to a body of ladies interested in child <Col N="432" /> welfare.  That doctor&mdash;Dr. Shanley, who is well known to every member of the House&mdash;said that malnutrition and starvation were widespread in this rity.  Other speakers followed him, and we gathered that it was due to the fact that the increase in the cost of living was depriving them of the nutrition he thought they should get.</P>
    <P>This order has had another effect which has not been touched upon.  I was speaking recently to a North Wall worker who lost his position because of the reduction in exports and imports. He had a son who was engaged in another industry, and the industry was doing well.  He told me that his son, although working in a good industry temporarily, was not entitled to get an increase in his wages to help the unemployed members of his family&mdash;seven of them, of whom four were of the age for employment.</P>
    <P>I think this standstill order is one of the worst orders ever introduced by any Government.  Taking it together with the Trade Union Bill&mdash;both of them being discussed on the one day&mdash; I say that they are the two worst measures ever proposed by my Minister in any Assembly such as this, and I ask the Minister, and the other members who have spoken or who will speak, to consider the seriousness of the situation and withdraw the order. It has not had the effect which he originally thought it would have, that is that the wages of the day would buy the same quality and the same quantity of goods for the workers at the same price.  Foodstuffs have gone up in price, while the wages were small, and workers who were in the habit of paying certain prices have to do without these commodities now.</P>
    <P>One Deputy made a reference to coal.  I do not think the question of coal need worry him very seriously because, in Parnell Street yesterday, I was told that there was no coal at any price.  A few doors away from Parnell Street I met a person who used to sell coal by the stone, and that person is going on poor law relief next week. Even those who used to engage in the business of selling coal in lots of a stone or two stones, in order to help the poor&mdash;and it is the poor who help <Col N="433" /> the poor&mdash;cannot get a sufficient amount of coal to enable them to go around with a donkey and cart selling it.  As a result, customers are deprived of their coal, and the person to whom I have referred asked me to recommend her to the local relieving officer so that she could get relief.  You have all these things in Dublin&mdash;high rents, low wages, and continued unemployment&mdash; and then you have this order which prevents one member of a family, if there happen to be six or seven working, from getting a slight increase in his wages.  I hope that every member of the House will speak on this matter, even if only for two or three minutes, in order to show the Minister what their views are.</P>
    <P>Dublin is in a bad way at the moment.  I have seen people sitting on doorsteps at about half-past eleven at night in the tenement quarters in various parts of this city, waiting to get a blow of fresh air, and as you pass they ask you: &ldquo;Have you any tea, because we got none to-day?&rdquo;  That may sound like a joke to a person passing by, but the fact is that in streets such as Gloucester Street, Summerhill, York Street or the Coombe, you will meet a class of person&mdash;shall I say, almost the best class of person in the city&mdash;poor, simple, motherly people who have been depriving themselves of their half-ounce of tea so that their children might be able to get a little extra.</P>

      <P>I submit that we have got to choose now between the inflationary spiral, in which some people do not believe, and survival, and I think that the inflationary spiral is a real danger.  I do not think there is any danger to me, because I have got enough of the world's goods to indurate myself against its effects, but the person who is going to suffer in that inflationary spiral is the poor person. So far as those who are well circumstanced in this country are concerned, that inflationary spiral is something that we ought to pray for, but so far as the poor are concerned, if we are the trustees of the poor it ought to be our solicitude to prevent that spiral developing.  That is as certain as we are here in this House, and those who <Col N="434" /> will not face it are sticking their heads in the sand.  Will this order prevent the development of the inflationary spiral?  It certainly will not, if it stands alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Minister knows that just as well as I do.  The principle underlying this order is a sound principle if it is accompanied by the proper safeguards, and it is our job to ask ourselves now, what are those safeguards?  The safeguards with which it ought to be accompanied are: controlled prices, subsidised essentials of life, and family allowances.  It may be true that we foresee that the spiral of inflation will destroy the poor in the long run.  It is no remedy for that for us, by statutory order, to destroy the poor in advance.</P>
      <P>If we fix a level of wages and allow prices to run riot it simply means that we bring the poor wage earners up against starvation sooner than they otherwise would be up against it.  If we allow the inflationary spiral to follow out to the end of its dialectics, we know that the poor people in this country will starve.  That is certain. This order, standing alone, is going to bring them to starvation sooner than if the spiral were allowed to operate, and in times such as these we ought to have a sufficient sense of responsibility to face that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is making pious speeches about the appalling circumstances with which we are to be confronted next winter, and each one, having made the pious speech, sits down and prays to God that something will turn up to prevent that happening.  God helps those who help themselves, and unless we take vigorous measures now&mdash; to-night&mdash;to prepare for next winter. we shall meet with a catastrophe which will make us the by-word of the world and, mind you, may create political dangers for us infinitely worse than any deficiency in our military defences.  I put it to the Minister that no economic argument can conceivably justify a precept to the poor of this country to let their children go hungry, so long as he and I, and a great many more of us in this House have comparatively <Col N="435" /> comfortable surroundings.  The first charge on the national income of this country is to ensure that every individual in the State will get sufficient food to maintain a modest standard of comfort, and that goes, first, for the children of the poor.  I say that in older to do that&mdash;if we have made up our minds that that has to be done&mdash; we have got to ask ourselves, how are we going to do it?</P>
    <P>I put it, first, that in order to ensure that modest, basic ration for our people, we must try to avoid constituting it from imported articles, for fear we cannot import these articles or for fear that they may be sunk by Hitler.  Therefore, we should try to get them from the products of our own land&mdash;potatoes, milk, oatmeal and such other foodstuffs as we can control here within the island&mdash;in the knowledge that we have them here, that they cannot be taken from us and that nobody can reach them.  Secondly, we should offer these commodities at prices which the income of the poorest among us will be able to reach upon; and, thirdly, we should try to ensure that every individual head of a family living in this country will have an income sufficient to guarantee his ability to buy, bring home, and cook the necessary ration to maintain himself and his family.  I know of no way in which that can be done except by the deliberate subsidisation of certain selected articles of diet and the provision for every family in this country with children to rear of a family allowance sufficient to ensure that, if the parents are prepared to do their God-given duty, their children will never go hungry.  Will anybody else in this House get up and, instead of slating the Government and wiping the Minister for Industry and Commerce's nose in the Trade Union Bill and the standstill order, tell me of any other plan that will meet the situation we are going to be confronted with next November? Will anyone in this House get up and plainly and bluntly advocate taking the lid off and letting prices go sky-high on the one hand and letting wages go sky-high on the other hand? That is the issue.  And is there anyone <Col N="436" /> on the Labour Benches, our Benches or the Fianna Fáil Benches who will advocate that?</P>

      <P>Very well.  I think we can reach agreement.  We are agreed that there must be control of wages if there is to be control of prices, but that, if there is control of wages, there must be effective control of prices to ensure that any increase in cost is not going into the dividend receiver's pocket or the director's pocket if it is not allowed to go into the wage-earner's pocket.</P>

That is fair.  That is a basis upon which universal assent can be got in this House, and if that is the basis on which we are all prepared to agree, it is a fair basis, and I do not think there is anybody in the House&mdash;I do not think there is anybody over there who will argue&mdash;the Minister will not argue&mdash; that we ought to clamp down on wages and take the lid off profits.</P>

In fact, I think he will get unanimous support for it.  It is up to him to intervene and tell us has he a plan to do that and, if he has not, let him seek the co-operation of those who are prepared to help him to find such a plan and, pending the production of an effective method of achieving these three ends at the same time, let us hear no more of this order which is designed to achieve only one of three things which must march together or should, not march at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon in his closing remarks made an appeal for co-operation. Co-operation on what?  We have had bitter experience of alleged co-operation here for the past two years.  We know all the co-operation is expected from one side and, as a result of the co-operation, we are here to-night criticising a Minister for his attack upon the poor section of the community.  Deputy Dillon may be worried now for the moneyed class.  So well he may.  It is they, not the poor, who may have to tighten their belts. This Emergency Order, as I will prove here to-night, has been aimed solely at the poor.  Where the well-paid official is concerned the Government will evade the order so that the official may receive increased remuneration.  I will cite an example for the Minister.  The Wicklow County Council, 18 months ago, passed a small increase of wages of 2/6 a week for road workers.  For men employed on the roads, whose wages were only 30/- a week, 2/6 per week was not a large increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government threatened that if the county council agreed to give the increase he would withhold the grants.  What do we find afterwards?  While the poor section of the community was not allowed to <Col N="438" /> receive any increase in wages, two well-paid officials are to receive increased remuneration, notwithstanding the standstill order, notwithstanding the statement of the Minister for Supplies that we are regulating the wages of workers in sheltered industries. Did the Minister mean that the order only applied to the lowest paid worker?  He apparently had not in mind that it should apply to the highly paid official.  Notwithstanding the Minister's order of the 7th May, a letter was sent to the county council in Wicklow by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, dated the 17th May, ordering that county council to increase the salaries of two engineers by £266 each, but we do not call it an increase of wages; we call it a personal allowance.  We will get around the standstill order.  Here is the sheltered position for the privileged class.  For the past five years every act of this Government has been in the interests of the wealthy people. So well may Deputy Dillon shed crocodile tears here to-night on behalf of the people with money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has his share of the wealth of this country.  Let him have it, but he may not have it for long.  The poor people are going to demand their share now and I, for one, will oppose any co-operation from this Party with the Government because no agreement is binding with the present Government and no one will accept their word in this Party, if I have any say in the matter.  We have had bitter experience. In their letter of the 17th May, the Department of Local Government, in connection with two well-paid officials in receipt of salaries of four figures, approve of their appointment to permanent positions with a personal allowance of over £266 per annum.</P>

      <P>I will hand it over to the Minister.  It is dated 17th May, 1941, and addressed from the Department of Local Government and Public Health, Custom House, Dublin.  The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to previous correspondence regarding the reorganisation <Col N="439" /> of the engineering services in County Wicklow, I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to state that he approves of the proposal of the county council to appoint two assistant county surveyors, ...  These officers when appointed will carry out all council work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>These were two new men.  It does not apply to the former official, Mr. O'Byrne.  The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These officers when appointed will carry out all council work in the areas to which they are assigned under the direction and supervision of the county engineer.  The scale salary for the posts proposed by the county council is agreed to, subject to the maximum being fixed at £400....</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the meeting of the board of health on the 28th October last, it was agreed that the board's engineers be allowed until 1st April, 1941, to complete all schemes in course of progress....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;That is 15 per cent. of housing schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards the two assistant surveyors&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;mentioning the two men's name&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the scale of salary already approved will apply, but in order to meet as far as possible the views of the county council and board of health, consideration will be given to the payment of additional remuneration....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>£150 personal allowance is sanctioned with a maximum salary of £400 a year. One man's previous salary from the board of health and the county council was £344.  Under the Minister's arrangement his salary was to be a maximum of £400 with a personal allowance of £l50.  Travelling expenses and other allowances bring the total to £740.</P>

      <P>He was a part-time officer and as the housing schemes are finished now there is no chance of his earning even £800 a year on housing schemes.  As the Minister knows very well, the housing schemes have been completed, but now that the housing schemes have been completed we go and put him on a permanent salary of £800 a year, while the road workers would not be allowed half-a-crown a week of an increase.  The Minister's Department calls it a personal allowance in that case.  It is immaterial to the men who work on the roads what you call that 2/6 a week, but you refuse to give it to them.  Then members of the Government stand up and point out that they are the poor man's Government.  But this order affects only the poorer sections of the community. I am sure that members of the Minister's Party who are members of public boards will admit that certain officials of those boards, although they are whole-time officials for pension purposes, do not devote a quarter of their time to the business of the public boards.  Here, seven days after this standstill order was issued, you have this instruction sent down to the county council to increase the salaries of those two men.  The Minister may not be aware of that, but he is a member of the Government which put that order into operation, and that order at the present time is being used solely against the poorer sections of the community. There was no standstill order in September, 1940, when the Government refused to allow public bodies to increase the wages of their unfortunate road men.  The Minister's Department, even in the case of men engaged in turf production, refused to pay more than 32/6, and before they got the extra tea allowance those men had to bring Oxo cubes with them, and that was their food for the whole day.  We have the Government attacking the public boards for paying those men for wet days when they were unable to be employed on the bogs, and were waiting for the lorry to take them back to their <Col N="441" /> destinations.  We have the Government devoting its whole time to inflicting keener hardship on the poorer sections of the community.  Then we are appealed to by Deputy Dillon for co-operation. I think the Labour Party has got sufficient of that kind of co-operation. The Minister will really be sorry as a result of any of the things which have taken place this week.  I am making no threats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not worrying about it.  I have my own views in connection with it, and I will not ask anybody to do things which I am not prepared to do myself.  I am not going to talk about what may happen.  I know that in regard to the Trade Union Bill the Minister has been misled; I know that people have given him wrong impressions, but I think the Minister ought to realise the serious position which the country is in.  He must realise it, if he goes around among the poor people, and if he does realise it, I am certain that he will give up wasting the time of the House on that Bill or on this order.  If the Minister wants unity, that is the only way in which he can achieve it.  Neither this Bill nor this order will be any help towards avoiding friction.  How can friction be avoided when we have well-paid part-time officials being made whole-time and pensionable, and given an increase of £266 a year, while unfortunate men working on the roads are refused a miserable pittance of 2/6 a week? How can you have unity while that state of affairs exists?  Coal has been mentioned.  Coal has been scarce in, Wicklow town for the past eight months.  Not a cargo of coal came in for 12 months.  Four or five lorries of coal came from another village to supply the people in the town.  In any case, the poor people cannot afford to Day for it.  No wonder we have agents in Wicklow town canvassing the young men to go across to England at a guaranteed wage of £4 13s. Od. for a six-day week.  No wonder we have special trains each week taking them from Wicklow and Arklow and the country areas.  The Minister must be <Col N="442" /> aware that a large number left this week, and to-morrow or Saturday the agents will be in the town again, taking the younger men from the agricultural areas, so that there will be none left for the harvest.  They are getting a guaranteed wage for a six-day week, with extra pay if they work after 2 o'clock on Saturday.  Their expenses are paid from the time they get into the train.  I say it is no wonder that is happening.  When the engineer of the county asked those men to work, he was told that they had got a good offer of a job now.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from the Trade Union Bill and from this order, there is distress throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We have those vicious circles which we heard so much about in the Dublin area, where people with wealth are not confined to rations, while the poor people cannot even purchase the miserable rations that are allowed.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister tries to defend this order. In the case of well-paid officials, an increase is called &ldquo;a personal allowance&rdquo;, but that does not make any difference to the people who receive it. Deputy Dillon tells us that we want unity.  How can we expect unity when 100 or 150 men are deprived of 2/6 a week increase, while they see officials getting £266 a year of an increase for driving around in their cars?  I hope the public representatives on the Government Back Benches will agree with me when I protest against the various instructions the public boards have received from the Government to increase the wages of officials, while sanction of a miserable pittance to the lowest-paid workers is refused.  We had the case of a poor invalid who was awarded only £17 a year pension.  If her card had been stamped she would have been entitled to receive 7/6 a week, but as her card had not been stamped the public body sanctioned only £l7.  Then we have appeals for unity, when we see this order being used solely against the poorer sections of the community.  I do not think there will be a response to the appeal for unity in this instance.  If the Minister refuses to withdraw it, let the trade unions deal with this measure, and we will see what will be the result of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I think that neither the Minister's order, nor Deputy Everett's rather strange misunderstanding of Deputy Dillon's appeal, nor Deputy Everett's attack on unify, is going to improve the position. Without referring to the merits of the order at all, I have one strong fundamental objection to it, and it is that in my opinion the Emergency Powers Act should never have been used for the bringing in of an order such as this.  When I voted for those powers&mdash;I voted for them with a certain amount of misgivings which have been amply justified since&mdash;I do not believe even the Minister himself imagined that he would be introducing an order of this nature by virtue of the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
      <P>If this were necessary at all, there was one way to bring it in and that was by a Bill, so that it could be discussed in the ordinary way and go through the ordinary procedure and become law.  The Government were able to make a law in the ordinary way, where it would be discussed, not as this is being discussed, as something which definitely will happen.  We are in the position of a prisoner who is appealing for a reprieve, knowing perfectly well that the court of appeal has already decided that he will be hanged whether his appeal is successful or not. The case for the annulment of this order is that it shows&mdash;and it was necessary that it should be shown&mdash; that the Emergency Powers Act was not handed over to the Government so that they could do anything whatsoever they wished by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is tragic and wrong that an action of this kind should be done in this way.  First of all, it affects the livelihood and interests of hundreds of thousands of people in this country, yet it is done as if it were an order for the establishment of a public holiday. It is ridiculous, then, to talk about the preservation of neutrality, the preservation of freedom and the preservation of democracy.  If this is democratic government, I say: &ldquo;May the Lord save us from democratic government.&rdquo; I am becoming remarkably doubtful of the values of democracy and doubtful of the meaning of the word &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo;<Col N="444" /> If I were a party to giving the Government the powers that they have under the Emergency Powers Act, I am sorry I had any hand, act or part in doing it, if it was intended to introduce legislation in this manner.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the spiral and the vicious circle of prices.  I suppose it is an impossibility, and I do not see how you can have a circle with only one side or a spiral with only one side, or have a spiral staircase with only one step, but that is what is happening in this country.  Ever since this order was made there has been attempt after attempt by various Government Deputies, in the House and outside it, to justify the Government's action towards the poorer section of the community.  Their one attempt to justify it is to say that the people who oppose these orders or legislation of this kind are not representatives of the workers.  So far as I am concerned, I do not care whether I am a representative of the workers or not, and I do not care whether my colleague Deputies who claim to be representatives of the workers got more workers' votes than I did.  I am against this.  In so far as the earning of the worker is concerned, he is being dealt with by the Government of this country in a manner that gives neither him nor his representatives any right to say anything.</P>
    <P>So long as I am in this House&mdash; whether I represent the majority of the workers or not&mdash;I maintain I have a right to air my views in their defence. The discussion on this annulment order is not properly a discussion, for the worker knows that the case has already been tried, that the verdict has been prejudged and that the case is absolutely finished so far as be is concerned. Even if I were satisfied that this was the best order ever introduced into this House, even if I were satisfied that we would get all the co-operation and unity we needed and hoped for through an order like this, I still would vote for the annulment of the order, as I do not believe anyone in this House ever intended the Emergency Powers Act to be used to deal with matters of this kind.  If it is the Government's intention to use their powers under <Col N="445" /> the Emergency Powers Act to deal with matters like this in future, the quicker a motion is put down to repeal that Act the better.  Then we can have matters thrashed out properly here.  I am not concerned as to whether people want to unite with the Government or do not, or whether they dislike this action or that action.  I do not think that that affects the point at all.</P>
    <P>There are two points: whether it is being brought in in a proper manner at all&mdash;I say that it is being brought in in a dictatorial manner&mdash;and, secondly, the relation it has to its ultimate results.  I am not concerned about its results so far as the resentment of people to it goes, but I am concerned about its results if we are to have only half of a vicious circle going on for ever.  Bad as a vicious circle of prices and wages may be&mdash;just like the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, a vicious circle is accepted as being something terrible and bad enough as it is&mdash;it is much better than to have a vicious circle of rising prices only.  Purely from the point of view of Parliamentary values, if the Government ever again have any notion of looking for powers to deal with a serious matter, the quicker they forget adopting the powers that they got from the Dáil the better.  Deputies &mdash;and even the Minister&mdash;have criticised the attitude and antics of people in this House and have suggested that it has been holding Parliamentary government up to disrepute.</P>
    <P>If there is any way to bring Parliamentary government into disrepute, it is by having a Dáil here which can only deal with an order affecting the lives and livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people, by putting down an annulment motion that must be dealt with within 21 days.  Even then the Government have to be implored, on the 20th day, to give time to discuss it.  I do not think that is a proper method.  This should be done by legislation or not at all.  If it were done by a Bill in the ordinary way.  Deputies would have some way of dealing with the matter, of airing their views and of expressing the views of their constituents. We are now in the position of the prisoner under sentence of death who goes to the court of appeal <Col N="446" /> knowing that the judges already have decided that he is to be hanged.</P>

      <P>In September, 1939, this Parliament was called together in order that curtain powers should be given to the Ministry&mdash;powers that they thought it necessary to have in order to protect our liberties.  These were powers that enabled them to take any action in the event of our being attacked by any of the belligerents.  We were asked to visualise a certain situation in which we might be invaded by any of the belligerents and thus dragged into this war almost unconsciously. We were told it was necessary for them to have these powers so that they could deal with any situation that might arise.  Nobody ever thought, on that day, that the powers given to the Government then would be used, not for the purpose of defending our country, but for the purpose of invading the homes of the working class and the homes of the very poor. Deputy Dillon made certain references which might lead people to believe that we in this Party had an utter disregard or indifference for the very poor. He seemed to think that we were not concerned at all with the very poor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, he did.  As far as this Party is concerned, we are satisfied that something should be done in order to secure that the very poor with no protection shall not be left unprovided for.  We are satisfied that the time has arrived to hold a conference of various interests in this State to prevent anything like that occurring here.  We have a situation created by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="447" /> in which numbers of the working class are prevented from seeking an increase in wages in order to try to cope with the cost of living, which has risen considerably since the war began, and which the Government have made no serious attempt to deal with.</P>
      <P>In this order, when it was promulgated, shall I say, first, there was some reference to profiteering.  Some effort was also made to collect some taxation from people who the Government thought were profiteering by means of the excess profits tax, but to a great extent that has now been abandoned. We know quite well, and the Minister knows quite well, that profiteering is rampant at present and no serious effort is being made by the Government to deal with it.  If something were done on the lines suggested by Deputy Dillon, one could understand an order of some kind being made with regard to wages.  No attempt was made by the Ministry in an order of this kind to prescribe a minimum wage. There are men working in some towns and cities to-day whose wages are as low as £l per week.  There are men who were taken on a few months or perhaps a few weeks before this order came into operation.  These men may have been taken on trial, and perhaps they were brought in at 15/-or £l a week.  It does not matter how competent or efficient they may have become in the meantime, under this order an employer is prevented from giving them any increase.  Surely the Minister will agree that there is something wrong when this order has an effect like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hand in hand with this order we have the Trade Union Bill.  That Bill handcuffs the working classes; it disarms the working classes; it prevents trade unions from using the machinery which they had been using for years back to do something in the interests of the people they represent.  This order has been erroneously referred to as a standstill order.  It is anything at all but a standstill order.  It is only a standstill order so far as it concerns an increase in wages.  There is nothing in the order to prevent wages from <Col N="448" /> being reduced or to prevent an employer from discharging a man who has a certain wage and, after a week or so, taking on another man or the same man again at half the wages that man was paid before.  In view of this, surely it should not be called a standstill order?</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Norton, I forget which, referred to the situation which may prevail in certain areas.  We may have two or three establishments in a town carrying on the same class of business.  One employer may not be paying the same wages as the other.  Is it fair that this bad employer, who is competing with those who are paying good wages, should be protected by the Government? Is it fair that a trade union should be prevented from securing that that man should pay the same wages as the other employers in the same business?</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what action he proposes to take to control the cost of foodstuffs.  As has been pointed out, the prices of foodstuffs have risen considerably; I think the figure of 26 per cent. was mentioned.  Very few increases have been granted to workers since this war started.  Certainly they got plenty of reason for applying for an increase in wages, but very few wage movements have taken place since the beginning of the war.  I know that in a certain town a large number of men were on strike for 13 weeks prior to the 7th May in an endeavour to secure a decent wage.  The moment the Minister's standstill order came into operation these men had to go back to work, although, as far as I can ascertain, the employer was about to concede the increase of wages.  These men had lost a considerable amount by being on strike, but, because of the Minister's action, they had to go back again without gaining anything after all they had lost.</P>
    <P>So far as wages are concerned, I think it will be conceded by everybody that, in consequence of the fact that the Government have made no serious effort to control prices, instead of getting an increase, the workers have had <Col N="449" /> a reduction in their wages in almost every industry since the war began. Deputy Linehan referred to the fact that he did not think, when the Dáil was voting to give the Government these far-reaching emergency powers, they would be used in such a manner as this.  The members of this Party at that time asked the Taoiseach to give a guarantee that these powers would not be used in a matter of this kind.  That guarantee was given, but the Taoiseach apparently changed his mind, and we now find ourselves in the position that emergency powers, given to the Government to protect this country and to prevent it from being invaded, are being used to prevent the workers securing a living wage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett has referred to an increase for road workers which was agreed to by local authorities, I think, in September, 1940.  The Minister for Local Government at that time refused to sanction this increase.  Indeed, he went further, and said that if any county council conceded the increase which they had agreed to, he would withdraw any grants given to the council, and would not give any further grants.  I think that was a peculiar attitude for the Minister to take up.  These road workers only get about three or four months' work in the year, and are idle for the greater part of the year.  The Minister, by refusing to sanction the increase that had been agreed upon, treated them very badly. That was the headline set by the Minister, and it prevented other workers from getting increases.</P>
    <P>We in this Party are fully alive to the situation so far as the poorer classes of the community are concerned. We know quite well that what the Minister puts forward as a reason for what he is pleased to call a standstill order is not a reason but an excuse.  It is merely a handy man's way of doing it, and will not have the effect that the Minister claimed for it. It is to be hoped that the Minister, even at this late hour, will reconsider the situation and, instead of making a one-sided order of this kind, he will take some steps to secure that the cost <Col N="450" /> of foodstuffs will be kept in line with the amount of money that men earn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The views expressed by the members of the Labour Party on this order represent, I think, not only the views of organised labour, but the views of every fair-minded person in the country.  I do not think any order made under the Emergency Powers Act has caused such widespread dissatisfaction as the one which Deputy Norton's motion seeks to annul. It is inherently bad, but when considered in conjunction with the legislation which is now under way in the House, it takes on a very much worse aspect and reveals itself straight away as a further instrument of oppression against the workers.</P>
      <P>I object to this order on the same ground that I object to the Trade Union Bill.  I regard it as a further demonstration of the drift of Government policy towards Fascism.  The effect of this order will be, not merely to preclude any working-class family from improving its standard of living, but it would even prevent that family from maintaining its present standard. It must definitely mean a lowering of the standard of living of workers.  I have no doubt that the Minister will use the stereotyped argument that has been used against any demand for increased wages.  In support of this order he will use the argument about the vicious spiral and inflation, though I do not believe that it is within the power of our Government to prevent inflation on account of the very nature of our monetary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This order must inevitably have the same effect in the country as the introduction of the Trade Union Bill.  It will tend to destroy the spirit of unity which exists.  It will bring about disorganisation in some of the services which are of vital importance to the country in this emergency.  I appeal to Deputies on all sides of the House to vote against the continuance of this order.  I recognise it is almost futile to make such an appeal because, under the present system.  Deputies, particularly on the Government Party, are voting not only against their judgment but against their very consciences. That is a deplorable state of affairs <Col N="451" /> and I hope that some day we may be able to anticipate, with some little prospect, that one or two members of that Party will take their courage in their hands and vote as they should vote.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hannigan is quite right.  We are engaged in a very futile performance here.  This is not an occasion upon which the Minister is called upon to reply to a debate. This is an occasion when, in order properly to discuss the matter, the Minister is called upon at an early stage in the debate to explain the details of this order, the intention of it and its likely effect, so that a very serious, important and far-reaching action on the part of the Minister may properly be considered here.  This order has been made by the Minister, but the Dáil has not heard one word of its likely effects. Eight Deputies have addressed the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the protection of the Chair in order to be allowed to make a very short statement on this matter.  Eight Deputies have spoken and the Minister was invited specifically by Deputy Dillon to intervene and he made no effort to assist the House.  It is quite right to say that we are engaged in a futile performance here.  We are, in the first place, conducting the discussion in the atmosphere created by the Minister's attitude to this order.  In that atmosphere we tend to discuss the matter in a manner in which we are likely to misunderstand one another.  It would be quite impossible for Deputy Corish or Deputy Everett to misunderstand Deputy Dillon if we were discussing this matter in a normal atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the difficult atmosphere created by the way in which the Government are carrying out their work, in the first place, and, in the second place, we are here within walls built by the Ministerial hand through the operation of the censorship.  Perhaps <Col N="452" /> there are officials in Leinster House telephoning reminders to the papers that anything that is said here that might be likely to affect public opinion must not be recorded in the papers tomorrow. Do the Government think that by interning, as it were, the Parliament, they can prevent their actions giving rise to reactions outside?</P>
    <P>We are here utterly powerless to do anything that even the combined wisdom of the various Parties could decide upon, simply because, no matter what our wisdom is and no matter what agreement we come to, we require machinery to carry out our decisions and the machinery composed by the present Government is machinery that is incapable of carrying out anything. The Government approach everything they have to do in a most incompetent and tactless fashion.  They bring to the carrying out of any work they do face a character and an ability marked by a long history of deceit and misrepresentation. That is the position in which we find ourselves at a very serious time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's suggestion was that if Deputies would consider the present situation and the true nature of the emergency, they would be likely to agree to a standstill of prices and wages and the making of arrangements of a supplementary character so that there would be sufficient allowance made from State funds to ensure that no family would starve.  His suggestion was that every section in the House should agree that a scheme like that would be worth trying in order to meet the conditions arising out of the emergency. I believe that scheme would be worth trying.  But if you arrive at an agreement like that, you want the capacity and the desire to have it carried out.  If we are to judge Ministers by their actions and their words, they seem to be more concerned with preventing the various Parties in the Dáil coming to grips with realities, getting into any kind of close communion with one another, or taking clear decisions so that something may be done.</P>
    <P>There is about as much unity on what are the main economic things to be done in this country in the present emergency as there is on any definite <Col N="453" /> proposals, and perhaps even a lot more. In the early days of the emergency we went to the Government and pointed out that the economic situation was the really urgent problem that would create an emergency, and we asked that outside the Government, and outside the administrative machine, a few detached minds would be got, competent to look at the situation, competent to advise, and competent to watch, and that in the light of the information given by competent and careful observers who were detached in order to see in what way we might be helped, and led by a light that, as it were, was outside of mere Party, outside of mere officialdom, led by men of practical experience, with no axe to grind, the Oireachtas as a whole might then proceed along proper lines, so that these lines could be expressed in a uniform and co-ordinating way.  Here we find ourselves to-day, as many Deputies pointed out, stabilising wages, while the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in one of his litanies, said prices were being kept to what they were some time ago, and were even lowered, but Deputy Dillon was able to quote facts and figures of the way in which important articles in use by the people were rising, and how any comparison between food prices here at the present time and before the war, or between here and England would show how hard it was for ordinary people, particularly those with low wages, to carry on.</P>
    <P>The present situation cannot continue. The futility of this House cannot go on in the manner in which it is going.  The situation is not going to avoid development simply because this House is interned.  This is a discussion, on which one would like to bring forward a number of facts and figures, and to make a number of comparisons, but no facts or figures or comparisons that we could exchange amongst ourselves, are going to be of any use until we get some kind of assurance or some gesture from the Government that they are as anxious as we are to help in this situation.  We read in yesterday's Press the opinion expressed by some coal merchant that we were going to get no more coal except for gas <Col N="454" /> or electricity undertakings.  Deputy Byrne spoke about the difficulty with regard to coal in Dublin, and Deputy Everett spoke about the same difficulty in Wicklow.  What is our industrial position going to come to, if that is the situation, apart altogether from our domestic position?  What are Ministers trying to do about it?</P>
    <P>In the debate on supplies the Minister for Supplies charged us with criticising them, and criticising himself particularly, although he said he had given us the facts.  I do not know of any item in which facts were given to anybody by the Minister for Supplies, except to myself, and that was in respect to petrol, and for that purpose he put it up to me that there was no use in putting down questions about petrol supplies.  I was asked to visit his Department and I was told certain things.  I was not without criticism of the Minister then.  I did not put down my question because it was said that it would not be helpful, but I told the Department that they had more files than petrol, and that I did not know how Ministers, with responsibility in relation to the petrol situation and the employment situation, could sit down in offices in Dublin without having inter-Ministerial, face to face conferences with Ministers in Great Britain. I say the same with regard to coal.  I say the same with regard to our agricultural products, the export of which is falling.  We are talking about what we can do to prevent this order being put into operation.  An order may be passed, but, actually at present, with the order in force there are conscientious employers in Dublin who are side-stepping it, because if I know of anything that is troubling employers it is how they are going to keep their employees at work, and how they are going to mitigate the hardship of employees with families.</P>
    <P>There is no use talking about the order if the other side of things that should go with this order is not going to be tackled by Ministers because there is not competency there to tackle them.  They have got themselves into an attitude with regard to this Parliament that is absolutely impossible to understand, and in relation to those big <Col N="455" /> things that affect in a big way the maintenance of industrial production and agricultural well-being.  Not a single Minister is standing up to the main things that ought to be done to maintain our industrial production and our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>For months past we have been asking that people who are dependent on unemployment assistance particularly, and on unemployment insurance would be assisted, by increased grants in view of the increase in the cost of living. Very slowly, appeals which Ministers have now got from every part of the House are fructifying.  I do not think that people in receipt of unemployment assistance are yet getting any of the increases that were promised, even as recently as the Budget debate.  We are coming near the end of the second year of the war, and while everything on the economic side that was likely to happen here was fairly well foreseen and brought to the notice of Ministers, we find them as completely lacking in co-ordination of their efforts as they are lacking in any competency to face up to any of the things they have to do, and as completely lacking in any capacity to handle and to use Parliament as they were at the beginning. Every offer of assistance and every advice that could be given was offered them.  They have got all possible assistance they could get on the defence side and they were offered all possible assistance on the economic side.  Our economic position is such as was suggested by Deputy Dillon, and the Parliamentary atmosphere that has been created by Ministers and by the Government generally is such that, when Deputy Dillon spoke in the way that he did to-day, even two members of the Labour Party found it impossible to understand him.  I do not think it was difficult to understand him.  The only thing I would like to add to Deputy Dillon's speech is this: for goodness' sake give us, sitting on the Front Benches and at the head of the various Departments of administration, men who will bring good will and some capacity to an attempt to put into force the view of the consolidated mind of this House, because <Col N="456" /> there is no difference in the minds of ordinary Deputies as to the things that ought to be done to help the country, and particularly the poorer classes, through the present economic emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this order was introduced I have often asked myself this question: at whose instigation was this class legislation introduced? Whose hand is behind this Emergency Powers Order No. 83?  As one who has had experience in dealing with employers over a long period of years, I want to say that since the outbreak of this war not as much as one hour has been lost in Cork City or district by a stoppage of work.  We have in the City of Cork a negotiating committee composed of employers and trade union representatives in the shipping industry, coal trade and general work of the city, and we have not had a dispute since 1923.  We have numbers of workers in Cork City to-day who have not got any increase in wages since the war started.  They made application for increases, but did not receive them because of the economic position in the industry in which they are employed, and hence have decided to withhold their demands for the present.  We have a number of workers employed in public institutions which cater for Cork City and County.  As far back as November last they were given increases which ranged from 2/- to 4/- per week.  Their wages are £2 3s. or £2 5s. per week, while some female workers receive only 30/- a week.  Although the board concerned is far from sympathetic in its attitude towards lowly-paid workers, it agreed to give these small increases of 2/-, 2/6, and 3/-, but up to date the Government have refused to sanction them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when speaking on Resolution No. 26 dealing with this Emergency Powers Order, quoted the case of certain classes of workers who, since the war started, have got increases of 12/- or 13/- a week.  These are the cement workers in the country. He went on to state that these increases were reflected immediately in the price of cement, in the cost of housing, in the rents charged to workers and in the rates that have to <Col N="457" /> be paid to the local authorities.  What are the fasts concerning the workers who received the marvellous increases spoken of by the Minister?  He was not able to quote any other class of worker that has got an increase since the war started.</P>
    <P>These cement workers started at 48/- a week.  They accepted that wage at the request of the directors of the cement factories because, at the time, they were not skilled men.  After 12 months or so they got an increase of 6/-, bringing their wages up to 54/- a week.  Since then they have got a war bonus of 6/-, making their wages 60/-. That is the minimum rate for cement workers in Limerick to-day, with 1d. per hour increase for quarry men, and 3d. per hour increase for men in the crushing plant and washing mill.  I would ask the back benchers in the Fianna Fáil Party who are here representing working-class people, just as I am, to try to visualise what a wage of 60/- a week means for men employed in a cement factory.  They are working in an atmosphere in which they are swallowing dust from morning till night, and have to work a 48 hour week for this 60/-.  There is a three-shift scheme operating in the factories.  The men have to work on Sundays and bank holidays.  Other classes of industrial workers are able to enjoy the bank holiday and still get their week's wages.  But the cement workers only get half a day's wages when they work on a Sunday or bank holiday, while other classes of workers get an extra day's pay.  Neither do these cement workers get any special allowance for night work.  All other classes of industrial workers ordinarily engaged on it get an allowance of 1/- per night.</P>
    <P>On last Monday week I read an advertisement in the newspapers which stated that the price of cement had been increased by 4/9 per ton.  In spite of that the Minister says that these workers must not receive as much as 1d. increase in their wages.  Apart from the question of Party discipline, I should like to know if the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who, as I have said, are here representing working-class people, just as I am, are prepared to accept that, position?  Surely <Col N="458" /> they also have an obligation to the working-class people of the country. The Minister quoted the case of the cement workers as his justification for bringing in this order.  We all know that the conditions in a cement factory have an awful effect on the workers' clothes and boots.  Yet the Minister thought it well to quote their case as one of the reasons for making this standstill order.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of boots. Deputy Dillon addressed a question to the Minister for Supplies about the price of boots to-day.  I know that during the past 12 months, even as late as March last, the workers engaged in the boot and shoe industry sought an increase in wages.  The employers met them to discuss the matter, and while so engaged a letter was received from the Department to say that their wages were not to be increased&mdash;that the Government would not allow any increase to be passed on to the consumers of boots with the result that these workers have received no increase. I ask the Minister to refute this statement if it is incorrect: that the percentage cost of wages for operatives in the boot and shoe industry was the same in 1939-40 as in 1926.  Yet while that is so, the workers in that industry are to be prevented by the operation of this order from seeking any increase in their wages.</P>
    <P>We have a firm in this country engaged in the manufacture of worsted yarn.  Its balance sheet for last year showed a net profit of £28,000.  Allowing for the income-tax rate, the firm must have made a gross profit of over £42,000.  I understand that over 3,000,000 yards of worsted yarn are manufactured here.  While the firm was able to make a profit of 2d. per lb. on the yarn manufactured, the workers in the industry are denied an increase in their wages.  The Government intimated that an increase should not be granted.  If the workers' demand for an increase were conceded it would mean 1d. a lb. on the quantity of yarn manufactured.  They were denied an increase, but the firm is allowed to make a profit of 2d. per lb.  In spite of all that we have the Minister saying that this standstill order is necessary. <Col N="459" /> It has been said by members of the Government that this standstill order aims at equality of sacrifice.  When we talk about equality we do not mean the political equality which is nullified by social and economic principles.  We know from statistics published by the Government in the last four or five years that we have in this country 2,500 persons who, after paying income-tax, surtax and super-tax amounting to over £500,000, have a nett annual income between them of £8,500,000.  I think that is an unfair and an immoral state of affairs while you have, at the same time, unemployed men who are expected to keep a child from one year to 14 years of age on 1/- a week, now raised to 2/6.  When Resolution No. 26 was under discussion we had certain statements made by Deputy Dillon.  We had a speech from him to-day.  The kind of sob-stuff that he throws out does not appeal to me.  He said in this House on 8th May last that it he had his way he would confirm the allowances for the unemployed at a level sufficient to keep a single man from destitution.  He went on to say that nobody will ever start a revolution in this country because &ldquo;able-bodied lumps of fellows&rdquo; are unemployed when, in fact, they could join the Army Construction Corps.  Is that the conception we have of men in this country &mdash;&ldquo;able-bodied lumps of fellows&rdquo;? These men have souls and minds as well as Deputy Dillon and other members of the House.  That is the sort of conception of life that is going to bring turmoil and strife in this country.  The standstill order which the Minister has brought in is going to add to that, and I can see only trouble and strife.</P>
    <P>We have had other Deputies arguing against a tax on excess profits and saying it was wrong and unfair.  Some Deputies urged that instead of choosing two of the best years immediately prior to 1939 for the purpose of this tax, it should be based on two of the best six years prior to 1939.  Looking at the Government's own figures, we find that, for the seven years ended March, 1940, the Government have received in income-tax, excess profits tax, <Col N="460" /> corporation profits tax, and super tax an average of £6,241,000 per year.  That is a sure indication that this country is being run by a small group who have been dictating the policy of this Government for a good many years since they came into power; I am afraid the same thing happened in the case of those who went before.  We have also lectures-almost sermons&mdash; from some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies. We had a statement here from Deputy Meaney and we had another lecture in this morning's paper.</P>

      <P>Of course, we had not it here.  If Deputy Meaney is here, he may be interested in a document issued by the Sugar Company at Mallow to any man looking for employment.  He will not get employment unless he signs a document stating:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I............. of ........... hereby accept the offer of employment from the Sugar Company on the following conditions....  With regard to the termination of such contract, the company shall be at liberty to terminate my contract of employment on giving me not less than one hour's notice of termination, the circumstances to be in the sole discretion of the said company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the conditions in which men will be employed in the Mallow Beet Factory, which is financed by the State and which is situate in Deputy Meaney's constituency.  I should like to know from Deputy Meaney whether, with that great national outlook which he claims to have, he would accept employment in a firm which lays down those conditions.  When I started to work for a week's wages, the fellow I worked for made it a condition that he should take 1/- off my wages until a £5 deposit was reached.  I had to sign an agreement not to belong to any organisation.  If I were known to belong to any organisation I should be dismissed the service and I would forfeit the amount of money in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister and to every Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches that their class legislation is not one bit better than the tyranny exercised <Col N="461" /> when I started many years ago to work for a week's wages.  I say to the Minister, not as a Deputy occupying a place on these benches but as one responsible to the people: &ldquo;You demanded a clear majority to save the country&mdash;a clear majority over all Parties.  I listened to you in the City of Cork on the night before the poll was taken and you told the people of the danger of voting Hickey into the Dáil.  What you wanted was a clear majority to save the country and help the workers.&rdquo;  I am not saying that in any Party spirit.  I say to the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party that that standstill order is immoral.  It is not in keeping with the doctrines contained in the Encyclicals or with the teaching of our Church, and I ask you in all sincerity to annul it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke a short time ago about the need for giving family allowances to poor people.  We have advocated that for a number of years. I am afraid that not alone the members of the House but the mass of the people outside have a very light idea of what poverty means in this country. Some time ago I put down a question as to how many men were receiving 14/- a week unemployment assistance in Cork city and county.  I was informed that 191 fathers of families were receiving 14/- a week.  To get 14/- they should at least have five children. That means that there were seven members of the family.  I allowed 2/6 per week for rent, which is very low&mdash; a great many of these people pay more &mdash;and it worked out that, after deducting rent, there was £109 17s. Od. per week for 1,337 persons, or 1/8 per week per person, or 2¾d. per day.  I also asked how many fathers of families were in receipt of 13/- in Cork city and county and I was informed that there were 152.  If you allow 2/- per week rent, which everybody will admit is too low, there was £83 12s. Od. per week for 912 persons, which works out at 1/10 per person per week, or 3d. per day, or 1d. per meal.  These are not fictitious figures.  A man will not get 13/- unless he has a dependent wife and three or four children.  He will not get 14/-, even within a mile of Cork city, unless he has five children.  These <Col N="462" /> people are compelled to live on 2¾d. per day, or 1d. per meal.</P>
    <P>This is the time that is chosen by the Government to issue a standstill order for the working classes to prevent them from obtaining any increase in wages.  The economic system under which we are compelled to live was shown by the last world crisis and this war to be the greatest pretentious fraud that could be imposed on humanity.  Yet, this is the system which this country is trying to maintain. It has robbed humanity of the gifts which science and invention provided for the good of all mankind.  We have to ask a Christian Government, a Government which claims to have a better national outlook than anybody else, to annul an order which prevents men from getting any increase in wages.  A number of workers in this country have received no increase since the outbreak of war.  Some workers have received the big increase of 2/6 since 1938.  Is the Minister, and are the back benchers of his Party going to stand for an order which will prevent workers from obtaining another increase, even of 2/6?  This order is immoral, unjust, and contrary to Christian principles.  In all fairness, I ask the Minister to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped, if time permitted, to have dealt with the case made against this order by Deputy Linehan, and to show that the order is not <i>ultra vires</i> the Emergency Powers Act, that it is an order that can properly be made under the Emergency Powers Act, and that it was only by proceeding under the Emergency Powers Act that it was possible to deal with the situation with which we are faced and not by introducing a Bill, for the introduction of a Bill would have precipitated the calamity which we are striving to avert.  I should like also to deal with the allegation made by Deputy Everett, because that allegation, if not answered, would imply that I was prepared to acquiesce in what is virtually an accusation of bad faith on the part of the Government and of deliberate victimisation of workers as against professional men.  The circumstances  <Col N="463" /> of that case are very simple and very clear.</P>
      <P>There is one gentleman, according to what Deputy Everett said there may have been two gentlemen, in the part-time service of the Wicklow County Council.  They are paid a retaining fee, or a salary, of £200 per annum, plus fees.  They are, as I have said, part-time employees and they carry out not only the work of the county council but they engage in private practice as well.  For a very long time the Department of Local Government has been trying to bring that position to an end.  The Wicklow County Council itself has recognised how disadvantageous it is to the county council and they have been trying to bring it to an end also.  So advantageous to the gentlemen concerned was this arrangement that, over a considerable number of years, in addition to this fixed salary of £200 they have drawn fees running into four figures.  In order to bring that situation to an end, it has been necessary to put it up to them that they must become whole-time servants of the county council in a subordinate position.  Quite obviously, you are not going to get gentlemen, who are in the advantageous position which I have recounted, to abandon that position at a sacrifice, at what might be described as an enormous sacrifice.  You are not going to get gentlemen who have each drawn a salary of £200 plus fees running into four figures to take a position at £400 a year.</P>
      <P>Ultimately it was decided by the Local Government Department to offer one of these gentlemen&mdash;as I say there may have been two involved&mdash;an appointment as whole-time assistant surveyor.  He had been, remember, a part-time assistant surveyor, drawing a salary of £200 plus fees running into four figures.  The Department offered him a salary as assistant surveyor of £400 a year and a grant, in lieu of fees, of an allowance of £150.  Therefore, a sum of £550 was the total which this gentleman would receive in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who has spoken is a member of the county council.  One would have thought that that agreement <Col N="464" /> was advantageous from the point of view of the county council but it did not satisfy the county council because they thought, not that it was not sufficiently advantageous to the Wicklow County Council, not because they thought it was advantageous to them, but not sufficiently advantageous to the gentleman concerned.  Nothing has been decided in the matter so far because a request has been made to the Department of Local Government to increase the amount, but it is quite clear that what has been done has not been to increase the remuneration of these professional men employed by the county council but to reduce it very drastically.</P>

      <P>This order has been commonly referred to as a standstill order.  I think that it was more correctly described by Deputy Keyes, who referred to it as a cease-fire order. That is what it is intended to be&mdash;an order which asks members of the community as a whole, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, to cease firing upon one another, which asks that those amongst the most highly paid elements in the community should cease fire upon those who are lowly paid and upon those who are in receipt of no payment at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his remarks Deputy Norton referred to the fact that low wages mean a low demand for certain essentials of life.  Developing that argument, one might say that high wages mean a high demand for commodities which are necessary to maintain life and that increasing wages would mean increasing demands upon these commodities.  All these demands, whether high or low, might be satisfied in normal circumstances without doing any great injustice to any other section of the community, but in the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day, in which there is likely to be a decreasing output of commodities for the common consumption of the nation, it is quite clear that these increasing demands upon that diminishing pool <Col N="465" /> can only be met at the expense of those persons who are not in a position to command high wages, who are in fact in a position in which they cannot command any wages at all.  That is to say, if we were to permit those who are in secure positions, and who are drawing high wages because they are in secure positions, to continue to make these demands upon the community in general, the result would have been to hive greatly worsened and depressed, even to a greater degree than when they first became unemployed, the standard of living of those who are unfortunate enough to be without jobs.</P>
    <P>To be without a job is not going to be in the circumstances which will confront the nation, in so far as we can foresee them, an uncommon position in this country. Unfortunately, no matter what Deputy Norton may say about putting more people to work upon schemes which would develop the natural resources of this country, the fact remains that a considerable amount of unemployment is inevitable in the country.  In so far as we can foresee the future, in so far as the present situation, in which we are virtually shut off from all commercial intercourse with the world outside Great Britain, continues, it is clear that there is going to be a very large number of persons who have been engaged in specialised occupations in this country, thrown out of employment. There is no use in saying to me that you can send out to the countryside a person who has been engaged in the textile industry, a cotton operative, say, who has been thrown out of employment because there is a shortage of cotton yarn, and because supplies of cotton yarn cannot be secured, and that you can put that person to work planting trees, draining bogs, or making roads, be that person man or woman, because this unemployment is naturally not going to be confined to males.  There will be unemployed all sorts and conditions of people, people who, as I have said, have been tradesmen, who have been in skilled occupations, who have been in clerical occupations, who have been rendering professional services of <Col N="466" /> one sort or another to the community, are going to face unemployment, and there is no use in Deputy Norton getting up and making the glib remark: &ldquo;Why does the Government not set all these people to develop the natural resources of the country?&rdquo;  Some of them could not do the work.  They have not got the physique to do any sort of manual labour.  Others have been trained in specialised avocations, and there is no use sending a man who has been trained as a boot and shoe operative, a cotton operative, a tailor or a garment worker out, as we have tried to do, to do work, and particularly heavy manual work, to which he ie completely and wholly unaccustomed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the position of the very lowly-paid workers.  I am quite prepared to say that there are many anomalies in connection with this order, but the order is a blanketing order, designed to stabilise the position for the time being in order to see what we can do to deal with it and to prevent its deteriorating further.  It is all very well to say that the workers in many occupations have exercised an admirable self-restraint and nobody is prepared to admit that more readily than I or to pay a greater tribute to it, but not all the workers have been self-restrained. A short time ago, I was confronted with the position in which those engaged in an industry which supplies a vital commodity to the people were making demands and had already threatened to strike.  Fortunately, the strike was averted and another course taken, but the case was made to me&mdash; in connection with the demands which these workers were making and which, if they had been conceded, would have been reflected in an increase in the cost of living of every person in the City of Dublin, and in the areas supplied from Dublin by this particular industry&mdash;in the discussions I had with the representatives of these workers that they were entitled to an increase because <Col N="467" /> the cost of living had gone up for them. They pointed out that the cost of boots had gone up, that the cost of gas had gone up, that the cost of commodities like meat and butter had gone up, and they said: &ldquo;Because these have gone up, we have to increase the price of bread, because we have to get an increase in wages, to enable us to live as we are accustomed, too.&rdquo;  I saw that there had been increases conceded to other groups of workers, that there had been increases to gas workers and other elements in the community, all of which increases in wage costs had been reflected in the cost of living.  Was I to say to these men, who were making a ease based on the fact that other people had got increases of wages and that these increases had resulted in an increase in the cost of living for them: &ldquo;Very well, you go ahead and take your increase.  Send up the price of bread, if you like, to every man in the City of Dublin,&rdquo; and was I to say subsequently to everybody who came to me looking for an increase in his remuneration because the price of bread had gone up: &ldquo;No, you cannot get it. Although we have allowed the bakers to increase your cost of living, we are not going to allow you to compensate yourself for that increase at the cost not only of them but of every other element in the community&rdquo;?  That is the position which was developing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be quite clear about it again. I must say that, in relation to the situation as it has existed for the past 12 months, since conditions in this country really became critical, that the general mass of the workers have behaved with admirable restraint in that regard and I have never for a moment suggested otherwise, but that restraint has not been universal.  On the contrary, there have been certain sections who have not behaved with such restraint. There are those who were in secure employment, those whose future was not being rendered uncertain by reason of diminishing supplies, those who were in the position of these workers to whom I have referred who knew that bread would have to be baked, gas supplied and other commodities <Col N="468" /> obtained, who, because these things were forthcoming in very large measure, never anticipated that there would be unemployment in their trades and who, because they were in key industries, were inclined to endeavour to preserve their ordinary standards, and naturally so. because, when we find that the amount of money we have to spend on this or that commodity is reduced, we are all. inclined to try to get more money so as to maintain our former standards.  And what was going to happen in the end?  We are going to have what Deputy Dillon has rightly described as this vicious spiral and we were going to have the wages of an ever-diminishing number going up at an ever-increasing rate, while, at the other end of the scale, we were going to have men being pushed out of employment day after day to swell the ranks of the unemployed, the ranks of those living on what is, admittedly, the miserable pittance of unemployment assistance, but which is, in the circumstances of this community, the utmost we can afford.  Therefore, so far from this standstill order being a refusal to look after the under-dog, as Deputy Morrissey proclaimed, it is really an earnest attempt to look after the under-dog and to safeguard his interests.</P>

      <P>I want, Sir, to continue this speech, because I want to say one or two other things of some importance, too.  I am quite prepared to admit that the case of the lowly paid worker has been of very grave concern to us.  A case has been made here in regard to the man getting 35/- a week. Deputy Corish instanced the case of the man getting 15/- a week, and other Deputies have spoken of the man with 20/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the case of the man drawing 35/- or 40/- a week was mentioned when I met a deputation from the Trade Union Congress. I do not want to defend these low wages, but I want the House to <Col N="469" /> remember that, very often, in the case of a man with a job here in the city at 35/- or 40/- a week, there may be an element of compassion in his employment, and I do not think that, even if I were to exempt that man from the operation of the order, his position would be bettered. It does not, however, appear to me to be right that these particularly hard cases should be caught in the order and I have been trying, in the interviews I have had with the representatives of the Trade Union Congress and the Dublin Trades Council, to get from them some constructive suggestion that would enable me to deal with that situation and with one or two other anomalies which exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton suggested that this order would not have been so bad if we had exempted certain low scales of wages from its operation, and I agree with him, but supposing we had done that: supposing I had said that in certain districts, provided the wages do not exceed 40/- or somewhere about that figure, then the order does not apply or that, in certain other districts, provided the wages do not exceed a certain higher amount, the order will not apply, what would be the criticism?  It would be alleged that the Government was fixing these amounts as a standard rate of wages. Now that is the one thing that the Government do not want to do, because if we fixed that wage, perhaps there might be an attempt on the part of some people to convert this order, not into a &ldquo;cease-fire&rdquo; order, as someone suggested, but into an instrument for the reduction of wages, and they might have done that if we had mentioned figures.  If, however, we cannot find some way of dealing with these anomalies I feel that we are bound to make some such order, even though it may be wrongly alleged that we are keeping wages low.  Because I have to take into consideration not merely the position of the men drawing a low wage, but that of the employer who may not be able to pay his workmen any higher wage, I cannot take upon myself the responsibility of fixing a high figure in present circumstances when as has been said here&mdash;as has been admitted hy one of the Deputies <Col N="470" /> who spoke from the benches opposite, Deputy Mulcahy, I think&mdash;one of the difficulties is going to be that there are many employers in Dublin who are keeping men in employment whom, in normal times, they would get rid of. In fixing any figure under this order I do not want to impose what might be regarded by employers as the last straw.  I want to keep as many men as possible in employment&mdash;in well-paid employment, if we can, but in lowly paid rather than in no employment at all, if we must.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the tribunal, I do not think I shall have time to deal with the tribunal except briefly, because I know that Deputy Davin is going to wind up the debate, and I do not want to encroach on his time.</P>

      <P>With regard to the tribunal, first of all I want to say this: It has been alleged that I am in favour of compulsory arbitration because of something that I said somewhere&mdash;in the Seanad, I think.  I think it was being urged on me there that we should establish some form of tribunal of this sort, and I said that we had thought all that out, and that the person who suggested it had not thought it out, because, if he had, he would have realised that, in view of all the factors that would have to be taken into consideration, it would be setting that tribunal, in present circumstances, an almost impossible task. Such a tribunal, in present circumstances, could not deal with wage claims coming before it, in view of all the factors that would have to be considered, such as the effect on the cost of living, the effect upon prices, the effect upon the economic life of the country generally, the effect upon the efficiency of industry, and so on.  It could not possibly deal with all these factors in respect of every wage application that would come before it to-day, and accordingly it would be impossible for that tribunal to function, and it wou1d be alleged that we were setting up that tribunal merely to prevent any decisions, being come to upon these applications.</P>

      <P>No.  I suggested that the Government might discuss with employers and employees, or their representatives, a wages policy and a prices policy with a view to arriving at a method of adjusting the one to the other.</P>

      <P>I may have taken the Deputy up wrongly, but I understood him to say that the right way to deal with the matter would be for employers and employees to come together, under Government auspices if yon wish, and try to deal with the dangers in the present situation.  I was going to say that it is a suggestion well worth considering, but it is a suggestion that has not been made so far by those representing either the workers or the employers.  If that suggestion does come from a body competent to speak for the workers on the one hand, and for the employers on the other hand, I am prepared to consider it very sympathetically with a view to seeing whether, in so far as the purpose of this order can be secured, we can control the only controllable factors making for an increasing cost of living.  The purpose of this order is to control the only controllable cost factors in this country.  We cannot control the prices of raw materials imported from outside the country, We cannot control, for instance, the price of coal.  We have to take it at any price at which we can get it.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputies Hickey and Morrissey would like to <Col N="472" /> send an army of occupation over to Wales to occupy the Welsh coal mines, but we cannot do that.  As I say, so far as imported commodities are concerned, it is impossible for us to control their prices.  In the present circumstances, we have, virtually, to take these imported commodities at whatever price is asked for them.  The only two factors that we can control, in relation to costs here, are wages and profits, and we are endeavouring to control both.</P>

      <P>We are trying to do both.  We are controlling profits directly, through the Prices Commission, and we are controlling wages through this order, and in so far as these controls are not effective we are controlling the distribution of profits, and over and above that, in so far as there are any excess profits made, we are taking them from the person who has made them, by means of the Excess Profits Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this measure, under cover of Budget requirements, is, in my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues, a breach of the understanding under which this Government received the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Order. This measure, I think, can be properly described as a brother-in-law of the Trade Union Bill which the Minister introduced and baptised at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, under the powers sought by him in connection with the Trade Union Bill, proposes to reorganise the trade unions of this country and, having done so, to make use of the drastic powers contained in this measure to prevent the reorganised unions from exercising their normal functions.  The 300,000 industrial and other workers who know they are going to be affected by the contents of that Bill do not require a lecture as to what it means.  I know of no measure or measures introduced during my membership of this House that have caused more commotion and consternation in the ranks of the workers of this country than the Trade Union Bill <Col N="473" /> coupled with this Emergency Powers Order.  When the members of this group here, representing over 100,000 of the electors of this country, gave the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Order to the Government, they knew they were giving these powers to a Government that was a Party-minded Government, a Government that had made use of the machinery of Government for Party purposes over a long period.  Notwithstanding that, we gave them these powers after the Taoiseach, in this House, had given certain undertakings that they would not be used for certain purposes.  The introduction of this order, without any previous consultation with the representatives of any other Party in this House, under cover of a Budget requirement, is a breach, as I say, of the spirit that prevailed at that particular period.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, this particular order was introduced under the cloak of secrecy, and the copy of the order which was coupled with the General Budget Resolution was not supplied to members of this House until several days after it was mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech.  That is certainly a breach of the procedure that is normally carried out in this House by Ministers, apart from the breach of the understanding that existed at the time in connection with the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Order.  The Minister for Supplies has a record in the political life of this country for telling many stories which do not always relate to the facts.  The Minister for Supplies, speaking to a selected audience of less than 30 persons&mdash;I am reliably informed there were less than 30 people present&mdash;at a meeting called for, I suppose, a political purpose, in the Central Hotel, a couple of weeks ago, said this measure was introduced for the purpose of protecting the interests of the workers as well as the workless.</P>
    <P>This is a measure which the Minister must know puts an end to the function of trade unions in regard to questions a Seeking demands for increased wages and interferes with the normal practice of employers and workers regarding the method of dealing with applications <Col N="474" /> for increases in wages, whether during normal times or during a period of emergency.  I know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and most of the Deputies in his own Party know&mdash;glories in talking about the runtents of the Papal Encyclicals, and that he takes great pride, whenever he gets an opportunity, of talking about tho lovely language contained in our written Constitution regarding the rights to organise and the rights of citizens generally.  I wonder did he ever read paragraph 34 of the Papal Encyclical which says: &ldquo;Let the working man and the employer make their agreements and, in particular, let them agree freely as to wages.&rdquo;  That particular section of the Papal Encyclicals will go by the board as a result of the contents of this drastic Emergency Powers Order introduced here under false pretences.</P>
    <P>The Minister on one famous occasion in this House&mdash;and outside the House &mdash;made a most uncalled-for attack upon the monetary policy of one of the Commonwealth Governments and, in concluding the statement he made on that particular occasion, he prophesied that the Government concerned would collapse in the very near future as a result of pursuing a certain financial policy.  The Government of the country concerned, that is, the New Zealand Government, has raised the rates of wages of every one of its workers during the past 21 months, and the latest information about the wages of the lowest paid sections of the workers in New Zealand is that the agricultural worker in New Zealand is in receipt of a weekly wage of £3 12s. 6d. a week for a 48-hour week. The Minister made that statement at the time, believing it to be true, that the wage policy and monetary policy pursued by the New Zealand Government would lead to collapse for the same reasons as he has advanced here to-night in connection with the justification or attempted justification for the maintenance of this particular standstill, or what I would like to call starvation, order.  In New Zealand, notwithstanding the fact that the wages of all classes of workers have been raided during the past 21 months, <Col N="475" /> that every man fit for work in New Zealand is in a job and in receipt of high wages, the increase in the cost of living there between August, 1939, and August, 1940, is only 4 per cent. compared with the increase in the cost of living here of 17 per cent., under this glorious economic and financial policy of our Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I could, perhaps, as I said when speaking here on the general Budget Resolution, attempt to justify the introduction of a policy of this kind if it was very closely related to an order making provision for a standstill in prices.  I am amazed, therefore, to learn from the concluding portion of the Minister's reply that it appears no attempt will he made to bring in effective machinery for the control of the necessaries of life.  There can be no acceptance of the principle or the terms of the existing order, so far as we are concerned, unless it is closely related to a standstill order on prices and profits.  I know of a number of cases where this order is going to hit very hard some of the lowest-paid sections of workers in this country and some of them who are supposed to be in what the Minister calls sheltered occupations.  I have here a letter written to me on behalf of 500 workers employed on Clonsast Bog, where the lowest-paid section, a very large section, of the workers employed there have been, for a considerable time, in receipt of a wage of 8d. per hour or, for full-time work of a 48-hour week, 32/- per week.  The writer of this document, I am reliably informed, was, in the last election, one of the strongest supporters of the Fianna Fáil Government in that area.  He has written to me at the request of 500 organised workers, protesting against the introduction of this Emergency Powers Order.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We view with alarm the laws and Bills imposed on us by the present Government.  We think the Government have become a proper dictator. They told us a few years ago Ireland was a land flowing with milk and honey and if they were put in power they would develop the country and give a proper living to all workers. <Col N="476" /> What the workers really want is a week's wage for a week'a work.  No man could live or exist on the wages paid here in this industry.  If the situation is not overhauled it will develop to something like Russia 20 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would also try to bring the Minister's mind back to the workers employed in the so-called sheltered industry, namely, the railway industry.  Is he aware that in this so-called sheltered industry, the railway service, there has been no dividend paid to the ordinary and preference shareholders in the past 12 or 14 years?  That under the terms of the Emergency Powers Order the railway company, that has not paid a dividend to its ordinary shareholders for 12 years, can now pay a dividend up to 6 per cent. to its shareholders, while at the same time the Emergency Powers Order will compel railway workers living in this city to continue to try to survive on a miserable wage of £2 2s. 9d. a week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that railway workers are employed at that miserable wage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy tell me where the railway company is going to get the 6 per cent. dividend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, under the Emergency Powers Order, is prepared to allow the companies, which have not paid a dividend for that period, to pay up to 6 per cent. and, at the same time, keep the workers down to the starvation wage of £2 2s. 9d. a week. We are determined, whether the Minister agrees to annul this order or not, to carry this campaign out to the workers of this country and to tell them what the meaning of the Government's financial and economic policy is as far as they are concerned and to carry on that agitation until we teach the Minister for Industry and Commerce some kind of commonsense which will compel him to withdraw this order.</P>
