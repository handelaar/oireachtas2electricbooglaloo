      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the prevalence of unemployment the diminished incomes of large sections of the people and the constantly mounting prices of commodities he will state the proposals of the Government for restricting rent increases in respect of all classes of houses and for protecting people whose incomes have decreased against the loss of their houses; and, further, whether he will indicate if it is his intention in existing circumstances to introduce proposals for a moratorium in respect of obligations contracted by people who, through loss of employment or a substantial fall in their incomes due to the war situation, are unable to meet their obligations in regard to rent, house purchase agreements, hire-purchase buying and insurance policies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>I have made inquiries with regard to the first part of the Deputy's question and I am not aware that the position has materially changed since the Minister for Justice replied on the 8th June last to a somewhat similar question by Deputy Keyes.  Consequently, the Government do not at present find it necessary to consider any proposals designed to supplement the existing Rent Restrictions Acts or to protect persons against the loss of their houses.  The situation will, however, be kept under review.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I am not aware of any circumstances which would cause me to modify the reply given to a question by Deputy Norton on the 19th March last when I stated that it was not my intention to introduce proposals for a moratorium of the kind suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the reason given by the banks for increasing their charges to the public by a possible three thousand per cent. is based on the allegation that they have to pay their staffs higher salaries and will he <Col N="2432" /> have inquiries made into this matter so as to ascertain (1) if the settlement with their staffs recently made by arbitration was not more favourable to the banks than the conditions previously prevailing, and (2) if the resources and reserves held by the banks are sufficiently strong to enable them to go through the present crisis without imposing this increased burden on a public at present so financially enfeebled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will say whether the Irish banks before increasing their charges for keeping accounts consulted him in the matter; whether he anticipates a considerable reduction in revenue from stamps due to the increase in the number of cash payments, and if it is his intention to take any action to ensure that a more equitable adjustment in the charge will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 together.  I was not consulted before the decision was taken by the Irish Banks' Standing Committee to increase their charges to customers for keeping accounts, but since the announcement was made I have been in correspondence with the committee and have received a deputation from them.  The matter is rather complicated and can hardly be dealt with in the scope of parliamentary question and answer, but I may state that my discussions <Col N="2433" /> with the Banks' Standing Committee are continuing.  What the outcome of these is likely to be I cannot at the moment venture to say.  Deputies may rest assured that the question of the public interest will not be lost to sight, as I recognise that these changes come at a time of exceeding difficulty for the trading community and for others affected by them.</P>
      <P>As to the loss in revenue from stamps, due to possible increase in the number of cash payments, Deputies will understand that I also derive revenue from any increase in note circulation and the effect on Exchequer finances so far as I can estimate at the moment will not be considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it conceivable that this Government will enforce the provisions of Emergency Order 83 against persons who are earning 30/- a week, and at the same time allow the joint stock banks of this country to increase their revenues by the proposed imposition of which they have notified their customers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Emergency Powers Act has been invoked against the workers to prevent them securing any increase in wages, notwithstanding a very substantial increase in prices, will the Minister give the House an assurance that it is the intention of the Government to invoke the Act also against the bankers, or are they going to be allowed to get away with the swag while the workers will be allowed to suffer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I may assure the House that all the relevant matters connected with the points raised will be borne in mind, and the question of public interest in the matter will not be lost sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister will be prepared to go somewhat further than he has gone.  Here is a proposal in flagrant defiance of Government policy to restrict increased profits or a raising of charges, a proposal to raise charges in some cases by several hundred per cent., a proposal by the banks <Col N="2434" /> to burden individual customers with a charge of as high as 30 guineas per annum, while at the same time the Government prohibits an increase of wages in the case of a man with 32/-a week.  Surely the Government will go further than the extremely reserved statement of the Minister to-day, and reassure the public that this outrage will not be permitted, no matter how influential the persons behind this proposed prepetration may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the detailed consideration of the matter by the Government, will the Minister assure the House&mdash;because it may not be in session when this increase is put into operation&mdash;that the Emergency Powers Act will be operated to prevent the banks increasing charges until such time as the Government have considered the matter, and the House has had an opportunity of hearing a statement of Government policy on the subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I have asked the Minister if he is aware that the excuse given by the banks for the increased charge is that the new arrangement with their staffs compels them to pay higher salaries.  I understand that the contrary is the case, and that from the point of view of remuneration the staffs will not be any better off; in fact, they will be worse off under the new arrangement arrived at following the arbitration than they were before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy O'Neill, it is true that the salaries of the bank officials will not be raised as a result of the arbitration, but it is also true that arising out of the recent arbitration, and the arbitration of 1920, certain heavy additional charges have to be borne by the banks in respect of salaries and pensions.  This year the heavy additional charges will be close on £200,000, while next year the additional charges will be over £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point about the stand-still order, I am at present negotiating with the banks and I regard the matter as <i>sub judice</i> at the moment. <Col N="2435" /> I should like to have an opportunity of examining the matter fully and hearing all sides, because the Minister has to act in these matters in a kind of judicial capacity.  I would like to give the banks an opportunity of having their case put to me in full.  I have heard the other case by way of letter and resolution.  I would like to hear both sides before coming to any conclusion or arriving at any decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the statement that these charges are rendered necessary by extra payments to bank clerks may be disposed of in view of the fact that the surplus profits of the banks are abundantly ample to pay any increased charges that may arise&mdash; whether such increased charges have materialised or not.  It might be well to remember that hundreds of people in this country have had to meet increased charges and they have gladly done so because they believed they were doing something to help the State in a time of unprecedented difficulty. It would not be unreasonable to ask the banks to adopt a similar attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks have been able to maintain a dividend of 12 and 14 per cent., and I do not think it is desirable that they should be allowed to maintain that dividend while at the same time increasing charges to their customers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible, at this stage, to make a comprehensive statement of the kind the Deputy asks for. Since the commencement of the turf-cutting season efforts have been concentrated on winning and saving in the turf areas the maximum amount of turf possible, both by encouraging private producers and by the active agency of the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2440" /> The total amount produced by county councils, other local bodies and parish councils is estimated at 1,500,000 tons, on the basis of ten cubic yards of raw turf to one ton of dried fuel. Whether in fact that estimate will turn out to be correct it is not at the moment possible to say but I am giving the House the basis on which all the figures have previously been given. In addition, it is known that private producers have cut substantial quantities of extra turf.  A census of this privately-produced turf is now being taken.  Large supplies of turf surplus to the requirements of the scheduled areas have been prepared for the non-turf areas, and all available transport is now being used to bring these supplies to Dublin and other places in the non-turf areas.  The reserves which have been accumulated are being held for the present against a time of greater need, and the question of their distribution at the proper time under a scheme of rationing in conjunction with coal is now under active consideration.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the detailed information asked for by the Deputy has been and is being collected and the necessary segregation as between counties will be undertaken as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is grave public perturbation at the insufficient stocks of turf in the non-turf areas, and the scarcity of coal in these areas as well, and will he indicate when he hopes to be able to make, for the information of the public, a comprehensive statement indicating the precise fuel position, because many people are gravely concerned about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am gravely concerned about it, and the question is, when we shall be able to give that specific and definite information.  The Deputy himself has indicated one of the difficulties already to-day in a supplementary question when he protested against the attempt to get certain fuel out of the turf areas into the non-turf areas.  Questions of that kind, and the difficulty of deciding how <Col N="2441" /> far one would go in that respect, are at the root of these difficulties.  At the moment, there is a great deal of information which we still do not know. There are, roughly speaking, 1,000,000 tons of national turf and there are probably another 500,000 tons of turf saved by auxiliary bodies.  Only a proportion of that turf is yet sufficiently saved to be put on the roads.  The thoroughly bad August we had hampered operations, and altered very considerably our estimate of the time schedule of availability of that turf for transport, and even, in some cases, of the possibility of its transport.  The improved weather conditions in September have now improved the position again.  I am putting to the House the difficulties there are in giving any definite figures.  I do not know the figure at the moment, but as soon as I can when I have that information in the greatest possible detail, and with the greatest possible accuracy, I shall take the House into my confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <P>One of the difficulties of the position is that Deputies put one question down on the Order Paper and then apparently think that information will be available on every other possible question which has any relation to it.  It is not easy to answer the Deputy's question, but the question has been answered on the specific basis of rationing in relation to one particular city, the City of Dublin and Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  It would be possible to make an estimate on a similar basis in relation to any particular town, but it certainly is not an estimate which anyone could give without notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that the available supplies of raw materials used in the manufacture of candles will not generally permit of a higher distribution than on a basis of 33? per cent. of normal pre-war deliveries, for the next three or four months.  I am in constant touch with the manufacturers on the question of their getting supplies of raw materials from the U.S.A. and some small quantities are actually on their way to this country.  The rationing of candles has not so far been found practicable and in view of the nature of the demand as well as of the circumstances connected with it, I am afraid that it may not be possible to <Col N="2443" /> evolve any workable or satisfactory scheme for the rationing of candles. The matter of the retail price of candles is under consideration but this is also a matter of great difficulty owing to the wide disparity between the prices at which candles of similar quality are at present available to distributors.</P>
      <P>As regards the rationing of tea, sugar, petrol and paraffin, I would refer the Deputy to the various orders restricting the distribution of these commodities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to explain to the House that the question of fixing a price for candles is under investigation. It is a matter of great difficulty. There are available candles manufactured from materials obtained in Great Britain; there are available candles which were imported manufactured from Great Britain; there are available candles manufactured from materials imported from the United States of America; and there will be, possibly, also candles imported as such from the United States of America. The candles in each class, although of the same quality, are available at widely different prices.  One candle might be available at half the price of another.  In these circumstances, the fixing of a maximum price is obviously one of great difficulty.  If we were to fix a price at the highest price which would be fair to those who are paying the most for them, it would allow exceptional profits to those who can produce at a lower price, while if we were to fix a lower price it would dry up by more than 50 per cent. the <Col N="2445" /> present supply.  We are investigating the possibility of making some arrangement with regard to prices, but it would not have been practicable to fix maximum prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider linking up the rationing of paraffin with the rationing of candles so that the person who presents a coupon for a half pint or pint of paraffin, or a half gallon of paraffin, will also be entitled to get a packet or a half packet of candles from the same supplier at the same time?  Let that person then use his quota of candles and paraffin to illuminate his house as best he may, at least in rural Ireland, apart from whatever may be the most acceptable form of rationing for Dublin.  Is the Minister aware that while there is profiteering going on in the sale of paraffin wax candles at 6d. apiece, there is a perfectly legitimate trade being prosecuted in selling Mass candles, or 65 per cent.  beeswax candles, to domestic users for 6d. apiece, and that 65 per cent.  candles at 6d. apiece are not excessively dear? Will the Minister take steps to differentiate clearly between the honest trader who is selling Mass candles to the country person for 6d., and the dishonest racketeer who is selling paraffin wax candles to the consumer for 6d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It must not be assumed that because some candles of similar quality are available at a much higher price than others that the trader who is selling the dearer candle is profiteering.  An investigation shows quite clearly that candles of similar quality imported into this country can only be sold without loss at prices substantially higher than some candles produced by other manufacturers who have been more fortunate or have had greater advantages in the matter of obtaining supplies of materials.  There are supplies of materials for the manufacture of candles coming from America.  When they arrive here candles manufactured from them will be available at still higher prices than the price of some of the candles which are now available. There is comparatively less difficulty in the rationing of paraffin because the <Col N="2446" /> distribution of it is controlled here. Paraffin is imported by one organisation and is distributed by that organisation under our supervision.  That is not the position in regard to candles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that half the candles distributed in the country are distributed by the oil lorries to the paraffin dealer?  I think it is true to say that a great part of the wax candles distributed here are delivered by the oil lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the oil companies are themselves manufacturers of candles, but I think that more than half the candles at present available are imported as candles from outside, and not through any channels that are under our control.  I have given considerable thought to the possibility of devising a rationing system for candles, but I must confess that I have not yet discovered one that will work satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A partial solution of the difficulty might be to do what I have suggested&mdash;to notify the oil companies which deliver candles and paraffin to the small shops through the country that each holder of a paraffin coupon will be entitled to get a packet or a half packet of candles.  That would ensure that householders in rural Ireland will have the maximum amount of light that the Minister is in a position to place at their disposal at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware of the fact that certain firms are unable to supply customers with sugar on the basis of one pound per head, and what steps he proposes to take to remedy the difficulties which have already been experienced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Nos. 22 and 23 together.  A comparatively small number of complaints have been received from householders as to inability to obtain the maximum weekly sugar ration.  I am satisfied that these complaints arose mainly from the difficulties which are inherent in the initial stages of any rationing scheme.  These difficulties would appear to be due in particular to the acceptance by some retailers of the registration of householders who did not usually purchase sugar from them, with the result that such retailers are unable to supply the maximum ration from the supplies made available to them through their <Col N="2450" /> wholesale suppliers.  All such complaints investigated have been readily adjusted.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that very large traders in the city of Dublin have intimated to their customers that they are in a position to supply only ½ lb. of sugar per week per head, and that this is causing very great hardship in the case of families in which there are a number of young children.  Has the Minister taken any steps to deal with the matter so as to ensure that the provisions of the orders which he has made will be complied with by traders, and that sufficient sugar will be available for this purpose?</P>

      <P>Many retailers have not a pound of sugar to give to any customers.  Many small retailers who took out licences have been continually writing to the Minister's Department and they are still without sugar for their customers.  Even retailers with big numbers of customers are without sugar.  I just wonder if there is a pound of sugar per person available at all.  If there is, why allow a month to pass without replying to a complaint to the Minister's Department from a <Col N="2451" /> shopkeeper that he cannot get any sugar because his wholesaler would not pay the £5 for the licence and has ceased to wholesale sugar?  The name of the firm was given to the Minister's Department and there was no reply from the Minister's Department for a month.</P>

      <P>Is not the Minister's answer to the question grossly misleading? Is he not aware that every retailer is entitled to get 80 per cent. of his drawings of last year, but deducted from that in the current month is the excess which he drew in the months of April, May and June of this year compared with what he drew last year, with the result that certain retailers are not receiving a half-pound of sugar or even six ounces in respect of each customer.  From the lb. per customer allocated to retailers, or 80 per cent. of last year's drawings, is deducted the surplus which they drew on the recommendation of the Minister's Department last April, May and June.</P>

      <P>I shall take steps to ensure that <i>bona fide</i> difficulties in the administration of the rationing scheme will be removed, but I ask Deputies not to accept, without examination or question, every story told by traders. It is an advantage to a trader to get more sugar than he is entitled to get either in relation to his registered customers or his previous supplies, and efforts are being made to create a situation in which traders will get more sugar than they are entitled to get.  All the stories which Deputies hear are not correct, but a number of cases of difficulty have to be rectified, and will be rectified in due course.</P>

      <P>The total stocks of coal held by importers and merchants are considered to be sufficient to last for over a month on the basis of normal consumption, but it will be borne in mind that practically all this coal is of very inferior quality.  It is not possible to state the quantities of coal on order, <Col N="2458" /> but this point is irrelevant, as our supplies are dependent on the exports permitted from week to week by the United Kingdom authorities.  It is quite impossible to forecast with any degree of confidence what deliveries of imported coal may be anticipated over the next six months.  As the Deputy is aware, a rationing scheme is in operation with a view to the equitable distribution of whatever supplies of coal and turf are available from time to time.  It is not possible to distinguish between stocks of household and steam coal.  For a considerable time past all the coal imported, other than gas coal, is of low volatility.  The supplies of coal in urban areas will be supplemented by turf and firewood, and stocks are being accumulated in the principal towns of the non-turf areas. Unless, however, the situation should change considerably for the better, it is unlikely that the supply of all classes of fuel will be adequate to prevent difficulties of an exceptional character being experienced during the coming winter.  The prices of all kinds of fuel are constantly under review in my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken to provide fuel and light for the homes of the people in the parts of Dublin where there is neither electricity, gas nor paraffin available for the purpose; if sufficient quantities of turf will be made available for distribution by coal bellmen to their former customers, especially to those who purchased in small quantities such as by bag or in smaller lots.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Householders in Dublin in whose premises neither electricity nor gas are installed will be entitled <Col N="2459" /> to purchase from the licensed retailers with whom they are registered a ration of paraffin which has been fixed at a quantity not exceeding half a gallon for the month of September.  Such householders, in common with all householders in the non-turf areas, will also be entitled to purchase from the fuel merchants with whom they are registered a quantity of coal or turf which for the two-monthly period of September-October will not exceed the amount of the ration, which has been fixed at quarter ton of coal or half ton of turf or a quantity of coal and turf so composed that the weight of coal plus half the weight of turf will not exceed quarter ton.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to secure for the non-turf areas the greatest possible amount of turf, which will be distributed through the normal trade channels in conjunction with coal.  I have reason to hope that the total quantities of coal and turf which will be available for distribution during the ration period will be sufficient to enable each householder in the area to procure the prescribed ration in one fuel or the other, but it is improbable that the quantity of turf available will suffice to enable all householders to avail of the ration allowance in the form of turf only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take questions Nos. 31, 32 and 33 together.  The quantity of paraffin oil available for all purposes is strictly limited and very far short of the country's requirements. The policy adopted in distributing paraffin oil is to give priority to the needs of food production, that is for tractors and other machinery required for tillage, harvesting and so forth. The balance of the paraffin oil supplies must be spread over all other classes of consumers.  I am endeavouring to give the largest possible quantity for lighting where no other means of lighting are available and at the moment I am having information collected from licensed retailers in order to determine the amount which may be purchased in future months by each domestic consumer. So far as can be foreseen at present, I fear it will not be possible to consider applications for extra allowances for lighting purposes.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on licensed retailers to distribute their supplies equally amongst all their registered customers.  It may happen in some cases that a retailer's supplies do not permit of each customer obtaining the maximum amount, namely a half gallon per month.  In such cases the retailer should proportionately reduce his deliveries to each registered customer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that substantial quantities of flour and wholemeal have been fed to live stock during the last three months, and whether he will strictly ration flour hereafter to consumers, thus enabling the supply of 85 per cent. extraction flour and limited supplies of bran and pollard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some complaints have been received in my Department alleging the feeding of flour to live stock in certain areas.  Such a practice would be illegal, and all such complaints are investigated by the Gárdaí, but it has not been found possible to secure any evidence that the practice prevails in these areas.  The adoption of an 85 per cent. extraction of flour, as suggested by the Deputy, would, on the basis of the estimated supplies of wheat available, mean a reduction in normal deliveries of flour of 17 per cent., together with a substantial increase in the price of flour.  I do not consider it would be advisable in existing circumstances to alter the present basis as, apart from the cost of administration involved in the adoption of any scheme of flour rationing, and the impossibility of devising a really equitable scheme, it would impose too great a hardship on certain classes of consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the present acute scarcity of flour in this country is due, at least in part, to the feeding of wholemeal and flour to pigs and cattle?  In face of that fact, does he propose to do anything to prevent the continuance of that practice?  If he does propose to do something, what else can he do except ensure that if a man feeds flour to his cattle it will be his own family's food he feeds to them, and not that of his neighbour's?  Is the Minister aware that what is happening at present is that a man who has ready cash goes round from shop to shop and takes <Col N="2467" /> whatever flour he can get?  Having provided his own family with bread he feeds the surplus to pigs and cattle, whereas the poor person who has to buy on credit very frequently finds that his supplier has no flour to give him, because he has already sold it to the cash customer to feed his pigs.  If the Minister is not aware of these facts he is being badly served by his information service.  I beg him to take steps at once to deal with this matter; otherwise we may soon be faced with a very serious crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is probably correct that flour is being fed to animals.  That is an offence against the law.  We have not yet succeeded in prosecuting anybody for that offence because people will not give us evidence which would enable us to start a prosecution but in due course I hope that there will be a change in the public attitude on this question.  I hope the public will realise that it is in their interests to furnish evidence of the commission of such an offence which will enable the offenders to be prosecuted. I do not think you are going to prevent such abuses by any system of rationing.  At any rate, a system of rationing will not prevent hardship.  I have discussed this matter before and I do not think it is a matter which we should discuss by means of question and answer.  In my opinion, the importance of bread in the dietary of different classes of people varies so considerably that no successful scheme of rationing of bread could be devised. Any rationing scheme must of necessity involve distribution upon the basis of a flat-rate allowance, and that in the case of flour and bread would be unfair. There is of course always a larger consumption of flour at this season of the year than at other seasons.  It happens in this year that it is a season in which the supply is most restricted. That situation will have remedied itself in a couple of weeks, and from that on until the end of the year I hope there will be no difficulty in maintaining throughout all parts of the country an adequate supply of flour to meet all needs.</P>

Now, if public opinion has not stopped that abominable practice so far, although the people know that their poorer neighbours sometimes have to go without bread, surely the Minister must do something to ensure that the poor will get some flour?  If he has any better scheme than rationing, I have no objection to it.  But, pending the evolution of a better scheme to ensure that the poor will get some flour, will the Minister not place in the hands of everybody a rationing book or card which will entitle them to demand as of right from the retail distributor of flour whatever share of flour their ration entitles them to?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he has <Col N="2469" /> received a report from the Parish Council of Adrigole, Bantry, County Cork, to the effect that flour is only delivered to the district once weekly, and that on the 28th August, 1941, when a consignment of 108 stones of flour arrived 180 persons awaited its distribution; that in the situation which resulted members of the Gárda Síochána were asked to take over distribution; that when such distribution finished a dozen persons were left unprovided for and only received a very small quantity of flour, when the sergeant of the Gárda Síochána appealed to the parties who had received flour to share with those who had not, and whether he proposes to take any steps to ensure that a situation of this kind does not arise in Adrigole in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that flour is delivered by steamer once in each week to Adrigole as stated in the question.  I have received a report on the incident mentioned by the Deputy, and find that the Deputy's information is incorrect both as to the quantity of flour delivered to the merchants in the area and in other respects.  The quantity was 230 stones, and not 108 stones.  Some difficulty apparently arose in connection with the distribution of one trader's supplies, and the intervention of the local Gárdaí resulted in each householder receiving an equitable share of the flour, which was in excess of the normal pre-war consumption per head of the population. Traders are expected to distribute the flour fairly amongst their former customers, and there should be no undue shortage in any area if traders carried out this arrangement.  I am having further investigations made into the position in the Adrigole area with a view to seeing if any steps are necessary to maintain an equitable distribution of flour to customers.</P>

      <P>The number of complaints received by my Department during the two-year period 3rd September, 1939, to 31st August, 1941, concerning alleged excessive prices charged to the public was 2,992.  In 32 per cent. of the cases reported the information <Col N="2471" /> given was insufficient to allow for investigation to be made, and although the complainants were requested to furnish further particulars they failed to do so.  Of the number investigated the prices were found reasonable in 70 per cent. of the cases, and in the remaining 30 per cent. the prices were found to be unreasonably high, and were adjusted at the instance of my Department.  The Deputy should understand that these complaints related to a wide variety of commodities, only a few of which are the subject of price orders.  It is in respect of breaches of price orders that any question of prosecution arises.  The number of cases of overcharging in respect of goods subject to price orders, where the evidence available was such as, in the opinion of my Department, to support a prosecution was 13.  Proceedings were instituted in respect of these cases.  Convictions were obtained in 10 of these cases, and two cases were adjourned.  The fines varied from 1/- to £1, and totalled £6 8s. 6d.</P>

      <P>A number of complaints has been received in my Department alleging that prices are being charged by traders in excess of those fixed by order.  These complaints are at present under investigation with a view to the institution of legal proceedings.  Prosecutions have already been instituted for contraventions of price orders in a number of cases, and further prosecutions in a greater number of cases are pending.  From the point of view of the enforcement of price orders I must emphasise that the co-operation of consumers generally is of the greatest importance. If instances of overcharging are properly reported, and if consumers are prepared to provide the necessary evidence on which to institute legal proceedings, there will be a greater observance of the price orders made <Col N="2472" /> by me and a lesser tendency on the part of certain traders to contravene these orders.  A special Enforcement Section has been established in my Department, and this section has been provided with a number of inspectors throughout the country, to ensure the enforcement of all orders made in my Department, including price orders.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will observe from the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941, that licences are not required for the purchase of petrol for State purposes.  Consequently, the petrol used for such services is not allocated by my Department.  Certain allowances were, however, made to the Army authorities for the use of individual officers, Local Defence force, and certain other purposes which in the aggregate amounted to about 0.9 per cent. of the imports for the seven months ended 31st July, 1941.  Allowances were also made to the Gárda authorities for the use of officers, Local Security Force, and for certain other purposes, amounting to about 0.7 per cent. of the imports in the same period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 43, 44, and 45 together. The share capital of Irish Shipping Limited, amounting to £200,000, has been subscribed in full.  Under the Emergency Powers (No. 72) Order, 1941, the Minister for Finance has taken up 101,997 shares, and has indicated to the company's bankers his readiness to guarantee advances to the company to the extent of £2,000,000. I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served by publishing particulars of the ships in the possession of Irish Shipping Limited at any particular time, or their cost; in fact, information as to the number of ships or as to their tonnage is of very little <Col N="2476" /> value in view of the time which in certain cases inevitably elapses before the vessel can be put into service, and the uncertainty in existing conditions as to the number of voyages which it may be able to make in any given period. The company has since its establishment been exploring, and continues to explore, every possibility of acquiring ships and, in considering any particular ship, the board naturally takes into account the repairs, if any, which may be required and the repair facilities available or likely to be available. I may say in this connection that the possibility of re-opening Rushbrook Dock has for some time been engaging the active attention of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies.  Crews are not recruited by Irish Shipping Limited; they are employed by, and on the responsibility of, the companies which manage the vessels on behalf of the owning company.</P>

      <P>As regards the amounts claimed to be still due, it is understood that prospective liabilities would bring the total expenditure to approximately £101,000. In addition, a special claim of £12,820 was submitted to the board on 2nd September by the building contractor.</P>
      <P>The date originally fixed for completion of the work was 20th July, 1938. A penalty clause was included in the contract, but there is no information as to whether it is proposed by the board to take action under that clause.</P>

On the other two holdings, namely, those in the occupation of Patrick Dwyer, Breanshamore, Tipperary, and Edward Lacy, Foxfort, Bansha, direct cultivation was undertaken on my behalf, and on these lands 16 acres, 2 roods and 8 acres, 3 roods, respectively, were cropped with oats.  I am not in a position to give particulars of the cost of ploughing, etc., in respect of the areas cultivated in conacre.

Prosecution was resorted to in 23 cases in County Meath and 18 cases in County Westmeath, in which I was satisfied no reasonable effort towards compliance with the order's requirements had been made, and in which there were apparently no extenuating circumstances.</P>
      <P>In 1941, although the area required to be tilled was greater than in 1940, the number of cases of default was reduced to 260 in County Meath and 161 in County Westmeath.  Action by way of entry on the lands has been taken in respect of four holdings in County Meath and 18 holdings in County Westmeath. While at present it is not possible to say in how many of these cases legal proceedings will be taken, I intend to take a much stricter view of the obligations of land owners under the order.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, with regard to the licences issued to buyers of wheat, that people who were in the business last year, say down in the west, are capable of storing the amount of wheat now grown in that district?  My experience is that they are not.  In some cases, people have applied for licences and have been refused, and people in the locality who had licences last year are not able to deal with the amount of corn coming into the market.  We have no barley buyers in our county, and we have quite a lot of barley.</P>

      <P>That is not my experience. It is quite different down in Roscommon. There is only one person there who had a licence last year.  That one person is not at all capable of dealing with the amount of wheat coming into the market.  People who have ample accommodation should get licences.  I do not at all agree that the Minister should licence only barley purchasers in a big way, because barley has been grown pretty extensively, and there have been no buyers in our part of the country up to now.  We require them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of barley licences, we have issued licences to people in new areas who never bought before.  In the case of wheat licences, wherever the applicant had good storage accommodation, especially if he had drying accommodation as well, he got a licence, and people who purchased wheat in the past got licences as well.  In cases where there were appeals I think I saw practically every one of them personally; I looked at the storage mentioned on the application forms, the drying facilities, and so on.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say what is the purpose behind this order? One can appreciate the necessity for restricting dealers say in seed, and providing that they should have proper storage and cleaning accommodation and all that, but you should not unduly interfere with the normal trade in grain.  Does not the Minister appreciate that when you give a monopoly to one particular firm to operate in a big district&mdash;I can give the name of the firm if necessary&mdash;it means that that firm can buy all barley as feeding barley, and sell portion of that as malting barley, netting a profit of 2/- to which it is not entitled at all?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of teachers of Irish are employed by the County Cork Vocational Education Committee on a part-time basis; their employment on this basis is necessary because there are not sufficient Irish classes to provide full-time employment for them and they do not possess qualifications to teach other subjects.  It is not correct to suggest that these part-time teachers are at the whole-time disposal of the committee, and are thus unable to follow any other calling.</P>
      <P>One of the essential conditions for the appointment of a teacher on a whole-time basis by a vocational education committee is that he should be employed in teaching for a certain minimum number of hours per week throughout the year.  Since it is not possible to provide such full-time employment for the teachers in question, the proposal to appoint them to the status of whole-time teachers cannot be approved.  Moreover, the funds of the County Cork Vocational Education Committee are at present unable to bear the additional cost which this proposal would involve.</P>

      <P>The information which the Deputy desires is not available.  The Land Commission have not found it practicable in present circumstances to undertake complete investigation by counties of the usership by allottees of their holdings and the houses thereon.  In cases where the Land Commission have ascertained that dwelling houses are unoccupied by the allottees, steps are taken to compel the proper occupation of the houses, or, in default, to recover <Col N="2513" /> possession.  The Land Commission inspectors have instructions to report all cases of houses unoccupied by allottees which come under their notice, and the allottees are warned that unless they enter into proper occupation within a specified period the Land Commission will take back the houses and lands. These warnings are frequently effective without necessity for further action, but the Land Commission are determined to enforce them if need be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Vacancies in the Army Nursing Service have not been advertised because the number of applicants on the waiting list kept in the Department has been at all times more than sufficient to fill the vacancies which have arisen. Vacancies which have arisen since the emergency arose have not been filled from a pre-emergency waiting list.  The list, which has been compiled in my Department, includes the names of all eligible applicants irrespective of the date of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No question of private nomination has ever arisen and, having regard to the large number of applicants for appointment, I do not propose to advertise vacancies as I cannot see that such action would serve any useful purpose. When vacancies arise applicants are called for medical examination and, if they satisfy medical requirements, for subsequent interview by an interview board.  The board, which normally consists of a senior officer of the Army Medical Service and a matron or staff sister, recommends candidates for appointment and I make the appointments <Col N="2517" /> from amongst the candidates so recommended.

      <P>We got an assurance when the House last sat that, on representations being made by any responsible group that the Dáil should be convened to discuss a matter of public importance, the request would be acceded to.  Since the Dáil last sat, a request in these terms was communicated to the Government and we had a somersaulting type of reply by the Taoiseach, endeavouring to give reasons why the Dáil should not be convened.  To-day, we find 91 questions on the Order Paper, indicating that, so far as Deputies are concerned, they were anxious to address queries to the Government to ascertain the position in respect of a wide variety of subjects. It is now proposed to adjourn the Dáil until the 29th October and, presumably, if a request is addressed to the Government in the meantime to convene the House, that request will be <Col N="2523" /> treated with the same contumely as was the request recently addressed by the Labour Party to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I want to protest against that outrageous breach of a solemn and honourable undertaking, that the Dáil would be convened on the request of any responsible group.  We got a definite promise from the Government that such a request would be acceded to, and we saw the Taoiseach completely disregarding the undertaking given by the Tánaiste on his own behalf and on behalf of the Government.  It is now proposed that the Dáil should adjourn for six or seven weeks&mdash;very critical weeks if we are to judge by the replies given to questions to-day and, particularly, by the unsatisfactory replies given on the subject of fuel and the variety of foggy replies on other subjects. The Dáil should insist that the House meet at least once a day per fortnight to deal with matters of public importance.  The large number of questions down for to-day indicates that Deputies are restive, and that the country is restive and anxious to get information which cannot be got from the occasional announcements made by the Government.  It is highly undesirable that the House should go into recess for seven weeks, and that the people be denied an opportunity of learning the viewpoint of the Government in that period.  I think the House should adjourn to this day fortnight and meet every fortnight until the 29th October when, perhaps, there will be sufficient business to keep the House in session for two or three days per week.  It is very undesirable that the House should adjourn for seven weeks. It will have a very bad effect on the people both in the country and in the cities&mdash;that the Dáil should simply go asleep and do nothing during a period of crisis and danger.  If we adjourn to-day, as proposed, the people of the country will know that there will be no re-assembly until 29th October because the Government will treat any request for re-assembly in the same way as it treated the request of this Party recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it right to refer <Col N="2524" /> briefly to the matter to which Deputy Norton has referred.  There is no doubt that, when the Dáil was adjourned last July, the Tánaiste, on behalf of the Government, gave his word that, on representations being made by the leader of the Opposition or the leader of the Labour Party or any responsible group of Deputies, the Taoiseach would approach the Ceann Comhairle and ask to have the Dáil recalled.  I did not, personally, agree with the Labour Party in their request for a meeting of the Dáil when they asked for it, but, whether we agree with the Labour Party or not as regards the prudence of their request, I think it was very deplorable that the Government should repudiate the word of the Tánaiste.  Human relations become absolutely impossible if you cannot accept a man's word.  If every time we ask the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste for an undertaking we have to follow it up with a demand for guarantees and countersigns, public relations will become impossible.  I must say that, in my experience of ten years in this House, when a Minister passed his word it was never necessary to pursue the matter.  Here was a case where, unquestionably, the leader of the Labour Party was well within his right in making the request he did, having regard to the undertaking which the Tánaiste had solemnly given.  The Deputy's request was refused.  I appreciate that there were grave difficulties in meeting Deputy Norton's request, but I think that the Tánaiste and the Government should not have gone back on their plighted word.  I do not see how in future any person in the position of Opposition leader can accept the Government's word on such a matter, because, unless the request meets with the convenience of the Government, the Government will consider itself justified on going back on the undertaking given.  In the circumstances I think it would have been infinitely better to call the Dáil at Deputy Norton's request even if the summons were to be belated owing to the difficulties.  I think it was most unfortunate that the word of the Tánaiste was broken by his colleagues in the Government and I sincerely trust that an incident of that kind will <Col N="2525" /> never recur because, if it does, it will make Parliamentary relations extremely difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The undertaking to summon this House, on representations from the leader or representatives of a group in this House, was given to the House over a year ago by the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a specific undertaking given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and not, as Deputy Dillon seems to think, on the 25th or 26th of July.  When the House was summoned on the 15th or 16th January, at the request of Deputy Cosgrave, no member of this group got up here and said that he did not agree with the request that was made by Deputy Cosgrave, but I would refer the Tánaiste to his own assurance, which was a repetition of the assurance given by the Taoiseach, both publicly and privately&mdash;publicly to the members of this House assembled, and privately to members of the Parties&mdash;that the House would be summoned on receipt of a request from any group inside the House.  The request to summon the House for the 3rd September was made by myself and Deputy Keyes on behalf of the Labour Party, after we had consultations with the representatives of our Party from all parts of the country and after we had listened to their accounts of the serious state of affairs which they alleged existed in the country.  It was not a Party manæuvre, as described by the leader writer in the Government Party organ, and I am very glad that the Taoiseach, in the reply he sent to us, did not suggest that it was a Party manæuvre, but he made one suggestion, in the letter which I have before me, which is not correct.  He said: &ldquo;It has already been agreed that the Dáil should meet on the 17th September.&rdquo;  That is quite so, but the Tánaiste, before that, gave the House the assurance that the House would be summoned on receipt of a request from any group in the House, and I am certain he is not going to deny that to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2526" /> Now, apart altogether from the question of the merits of the request which was made then, the time that has been taken up here to-day in answering questions on the Order Paper is clear proof that there was a justification for that request, and I think it would be very unfair on the part of the Government, who have a clear majority in this House, if they were to deprive Deputies on the Opposition Benches, or their own Deputies, of the right to have some discussion, on the adjournment, of matters arising out of the information, or lack of information, which was given by Ministers in the answers to the Parliamentary Questions here to-day.  If the Dáil were meeting in a normal period it would not, and should not&mdash;it hardly ever did&mdash;take any more than an hour to answer Parliamentary Questions. Now, apart altogether from these two reasons, this country, or the lives of the citizens of this State, have been regulated for a considerable time past by a volume of Emergency Orders that are being issued.  These orders are dictated by civil servants, signed by Ministers and issued to Deputies, in some cases, three months after the orders are made.  I received a bundle of such orders within the last week and I took the trouble to look up the dates of the orders.  Out of about a dozen orders received by me and other Deputies of the House I find that one of them, Statutory Order No. 272 of 1941, was signed by the Minister for Supplies on 9th June, 1941; that Order No. 375 was signed by the Taoiseach on 8th August, 1941; and that another order, No. 379, was signed on 15th August, 1941.  Here we have Deputies of this House, who are responsible to the people of the country for the good government of the country&mdash;the Government itself, of course, is primarily responsible in that matter&mdash;not knowing what was in an order, signed by the Minister for Supplies on the 9th June, until some day this week, three months afterwards.  Is there anybody on the opposite benches who will get up here and say that that is efficient government or the right way to conduct the business of a democratic assembly or what is supposed to be democratic government?  This is the <Col N="2527" /> kind of thing which is going to kill the confidence of the people of the country in the kind of Government which is in existence here to-day.  I am not prepared to swallow everything that is contained in an order, signed by a Minister on the 9th June, when I do not know its actual contents or its meaning until I receive it on some day in September, three months afterwards. Yet we are to be deprived of the opportunity of discussing at reasonable periods the contents of these orders, when we ask for that opportunity to be given us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that Deputies should be summoned here for a meeting every week if the Government&mdash;and it is their responsibility&mdash; cannot produce business for their discussion or consideration.  I do suggest, however, that there is enough of both public and private business on the Order Paper at the present time for a two-day sitting.  We have four Bills for Second Reading&mdash;or four Bills that will be down for Second Reading after the First Reading is passed to-day. There is also a Supplementary Estimate which, in the ordinary course, should take a couple of hours for discussion, if discussion is to be invited. There are four private members' motions, which are entitled to 12 hours' discussion, and there is also a private members' Bill which would be entitled to the same time.  I suggest that here and now we have business for a two days' session, apart from the time that we are entitled to get on the adjournment to discuss the serious matters that were raised in this House to-day.  The country is being confused on some of these questions by some of the Ministers who go down the country and do not tell the truth.  We had a speech of a most extraordinary nature delivered by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs during the last week or so, and published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 16th September.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been no serious breach of the political truce, although a great deal of severe criticism of the Government has been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2528" /> He goes on further and makes this statement&mdash;which I do not understand at any rate, and I do not know that any other members of this Party can understand it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil,&rdquo; said Mr. Little, &ldquo;seemed to be becoming more social and less aggressive in public life owing to the present understanding which existed among the Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an understanding that existed between the Parties on the day previous to the adjournment, in connection with the rights of the Opposition in this House, and it is dishonoured shortly after it was made here in this House.  If we are to have a discussion on the motion for the adjournment I hope the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will get up here and elaborate on the so-called political truce and about the social sense of the Fianna Fáil Government and Deputies, and tell us the reason why they are not so aggressive as, I presume he intended to say, they had been in the past.  I would advise his colleagues, who sit on the Front Bench and those who sit on the Back Bench, to look up the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 16th September.  It is in the Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of great importance in what paper it is published, but the printed words show that the editor is actually quoting the words used by the Minister.  If there is a political truce, I know nothing about it, except the political truce that exists in matters affecting the defence of the country.  There is national unity on the question of defending this country, but apart from that, I am not acquainted with what is the meaning of the Minister's statement so far as a truce on any other question of major importance to the people of this country is concerned.  It is not a matter of great importance to me either whether the people of the Minister's constituency will swallow that kind of statement, <Col N="2529" /> but at any rate there is a clear case&mdash; and I submit that I am not making it from a Party point of view&mdash;for a discussion on the motion for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of dealing with matters arising out of replies to questions that were given by Ministers to-day.  There is also a good case for an early meeting of the Dáil &mdash;not later than two weeks from now&mdash; for the purpose of discussing the two days' business which appears to me to be there, so as to give an opportunity to members of the House to discuss matters in a proper Parliamentary manner.</P>
      <P>For goodness' sake, let us at any rate make an effort to show that this is a Parliament, that the members of this Dáil are in control of the political destinies of the people of this country and not give the impression that is being created throughout the country &mdash;I have heard it repeatedly expressed in my own constituency&mdash;that the Government is being let down by a lot of civil servants.  It is quite true that the civil servants are the people who are manufacturing emergency powers orders faster than the printers can print them and send them out to us. When we held the balance of power here three or four years ago, some members of the Government Party went down the country and said that the Labour Party were responsible for holding up the work of Parliament. Now you are telling the people&mdash;at least it has been said by some people in my constituency&mdash;that it is the civil servants who are letting you down.  I am not prepared to surrender my rights to any civil servant, especially my right as a member of the Opposition to demand that this Dáil should meet at reasonable intervals during this critical period in the history of the country to help the Government to do the business of the people in a better way than it has been done for the past three or four months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word in reply to Deputy Norton and Deputy Dillon.  I did state, when asked by Deputy Norton what the date of the re-assembly was, that the Dáil was adjourning to 29th October.  It was intimated <Col N="2530" /> to me before I made that announcement that the date had been notified to the Whips of the different Parties in the House and that there had been no objection to it.  At least, that was my understanding of the position.  Then Deputy Mulcahy, supported by Deputy Dillon, raised the point that we should have an earlier meeting and I think Deputy Norton chimed in and agreed with them.  A discussion arose as to the meeting to be held to deal with amendments to certain Bills coming from the Seanad. After I thought we had got agreement as to the date of adjournment, I did give an assurance that in view of the long adjournment, the Dáil would be summoned at any time if representations were made from responsible quarters.  I certainly gave that definite assurance in my own name and the name of the Government.</P>
      <P>Then a discussion arose as to the date of the earlier meeting.  The Opposition Parties were not satisfied evidently that the Dáil should adjourn until 29th October without some arrangement for an earlier meeting. The 10th and the 17th of September were suggested, and I reminded the House that Ministers would be engaged in the Seanad for some time after the Dáil adjourned.  They were actually engaged for three successive weeks in the Seanad after the Dáil adjourned. There would be very little time for vacation either for Ministers or staffs if the Dáil were to meet on the 10th September.  It was agreed then, on the suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy, that the meeting should be held on the 17th September.  Deputy Norton then asked if, even before the 17th September, any matter of urgency arose and representations were made to the Government, would the Dáil be summoned, and I said that was understood.  I submit that no matter of urgency arose.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2531" /> Mr. Norton: May I take it that if the House is not likely to sit in order to deal with Bills from the Seanad, the fixing of 17th September would not prevent the House being called earlier by request if any matter of urgency arose?</P>

When we last met, the implication in the Tánaiste's reply to me was that if the Government received a request from any Opposition group in this House to convene <Col N="2534" /> the Dáil, the Dáil would be duly convened.  Whenever such a request was previously made to the Government, it was honoured.  On this occasion, when we submitted to the Government reasons why in our opinion the Dáil should meet on the 3rd September we were told by the Taoiseach in a letter why in his opinion it was not necessary for the Dáil to meet.  Then the Government Party organ apparently thought that the Taoiseach could not make a sufficiently convincing reply to us.  It had to be instructed to write a leading article under the caption &ldquo;A Party Manæuvre&rdquo;, showing quite clearly the Government's whole approach to the request for the assembly of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>On that occasion we were given clearly to understand that if we made a request that the Dáil should be convened the request would be acceded to. But now we get from the Tánaiste this most amazing confession, that whenever any Party asks for the Dáil to be convened as a matter of urgency the Government are the sole judges of the urgency.  The Tánaiste can very well see that he can make that promise, and keep that promise and yet not convene the Dáil so long as he is permitted to be the judge of the urgency.  Surely the Tánaiste must concede to opposition groups in this House their right to attach importance to a matter to which the Government do not attach the same importance.  If the Fine Gael or the Labour Party say that in their view it is very urgent, they should get an opportunity of discussing the particular matter.  Surely the Tánaiste will concede that those other Parties are not obliged to accept his view of urgency, because they may see the matter from an entirely different angle.  I might give reasons to-day why the House should sit to-morrow to indict the manner in which some member of the Government performs or neglects to perform his duty.  The member of the Government concerned might not see the matter as one of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looked at from our standpoint, we might think a matter should be debated <Col N="2535" /> as one of urgency and one for which the Dáil ought to be convened with expedition.  If the Tánaiste says now that when the Government are asked to convene the Dáil they are to judge whether it is to be convened or not and to judge of the urgency, I hope the Tánaiste and the Government will make no more promises&mdash;no more promises to the Labour Party at all events, because I would not accept any promise made by the Government if that is the way in which they interpret the promise and if that is the way in which they conceive the promise they made.  If that is the spirit underlying the promises, the promises are just worthless, worse than the permits issued for the purchase of coal which could not be got, and Heaven knows that was bad enough.</P>
    <P>The House is now asked to adjourn until the 29th October.  If we had peaceful conditions here that would be an abnormally long period.  What must the country think of an adjournment for a further seven weeks at a time when tens of thousands of our people are fleeing to England and across the Border; at a time when Ministers cannot tell us how much turf is being cut and what supplies of turf will be available for people in the non-turf areas; at a time when the Minister for Supplies cannot guarantee half a gallon of paraffin per month, according to the statement made to-day; at a time when the Government tell us that the stock of coal on hands will only last one month; at a time when, in the experience of everybody who has any contact with the masses of the people, they are going to face a very trying time from the standpoint of their ability to provide sustenance and clothing for themselves during the coming winter months?  Faced with a crisis of that type, faced with a set of circumstances threatening to engulf the masses of the people in poverty and destitution, the Government propose in the most leisurely way possible to adjourn Parliament, the only body whose opinions are not yet censored, so far as the official reports are concerned, for a period of seven weeks.</P>
    <P>We can only conclude, if that is the object of the Government and of the <Col N="2536" /> Government motion to-day, that lying behind the adjournment is a desire to burke criticism, a desire to avoid discussion, a desire to prevent people being told the true facts of the economic, the fuel, and the food situation which is facing them to-day.  I am not going to ask the Government to agree that the Dáil should meet in a fortnight.  I am not going to waste time asking the Government to agree that the Dáil should meet at the request of any Party group.  I am satisfied to vote against the motion that the Dáil should adjourn for seven weeks at a time when the people expect the Dáil to do something more than merely go into a seven weeks' leisurely retirement.</P>

      <P>I hope the Government will reconsider this question. The 29th October brings us into winter, perhaps into a winter that people will have to face not merely threatened with but with an almost certain shortage of light and fuel.  We have had a number of questions addressed particularly to the Minister for Supplies to-day.  I wonder whether the members of the Government themselves are satisfied with the nature of the answers given to Deputies on these questions.  But imagine the country facing a winter such as threatens the ordinary inhabitants particularly in the country districts; a winter in which they are very likely to be without light and in some cases without heat.  And yet the Government can calmly propose that the Dáil, which is supposed to exercise a certain amount of influence on the Government&mdash;I am afraid the Government are impervious to any reasoned arguments put forward, but after all that is the function of the Dáil&mdash;they propose that the Dáil should adjourn without an opportunity being given to the members to put the views of the country on these important matters before the Government.  The Government themselves must see from the number of questions, if from nothing else, on the Order Paper to-day the amount of uneasiness that there is in the country in reference to these matters.  The country wants further clarification and enlightenment on all these things. <Col N="2537" /> Yet the proposal is that we should wait until the winter is on us before an opportunity will be given.  Surely there is nothing&mdash;even the tremendous business that the Government pretend to be doing or are doing&mdash;to prevent the Dáil meeting before then.  They are really not merely flouting the Dáil, but they are flouting the country.  I speak of light and fuel, but every kind of supplies seems in a highly critical position.</P>
      <P>I do not like to look forward to the possibility of the whole countryside being plunged into darkness.  It would have a bad effect on the people's nerves already tried by various threatenings, war and so on.  I think that will be greatly increased and their nerves will be less able to bear it when they see the Government apparently callous to any representations made to them, and when they see the Government deliberately going out of their way to prevent any representations being made to them in public.  In the interests of some kind of reasonable government in this country, I ask the Tánaiste to reconsider the date, six weeks from now, on the very eve of winter, practically in winter, to which he proposes to adjourn the Dáil.  We are no longer in summer.  The various crises, painted in gloomy pictures by the Ministers themselves, will be all ready to burst on the country.  Yet, so far as these sorely-tried people in the country are concerned&mdash;we need not now go into the question of how far the Government are responsible for their being so sorely tried&mdash;they see their representatives and the Government apparently quite indifferent to their opinions, determined to give no opportunity for discussion of their needs and of their fears.  In the interests of decent government or an attempt at decent government, I ask the Minister to reconsider the question of adjourning until October 29th: it is much too late and suggests irresponsibility on the part of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the representative of farmers I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the serious position that would arise if the House adjourned until October 29th.  We are now on the <Col N="2538" /> threshold of a new cereal year.  During the next few weeks the tillage policy for the coming year must be undertaken, and the plans of the Government to promote that policy must be carefully developed.  Accordingly, it is only right and proper that the duly elected representatives of the people should assemble here to discuss in detail plans for the provision of food for the people. If we adjourn until October 29th the House will be adjourned during the most vital period, in which all plans for increasing the area under tillage will be carried through.  The function then of the elected representatives would be simply to hold a <i>post mortem</i> on plans that the Government had decided upon in regard to agricultural operations for next year.  Probably the most important work in regard to increasing food supplies will be undertaken during the next month.  The supply of artificial manures is almost non-existent and if we are to have adequate food supplies, particularly of wheat, grown next year it is essential that all pasture land should be put into cultivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is to be done with best results it should be ploughed during the coming month.  If there is to be a substantial increase in food production it is of the utmost importance that the Government should now announce their tillage policy, the prices to be paid for cereals, as well as the acreage of tillage required.  It would be altogether wrong, while such questions are being decided by the Government, that the elected representatives should not assemble here.  There is also the question of fuel supplies.  That is a problem that will have to be dealt with before October 29th.  It is not right that the representatives of the people should remain away from this House while such a serious question was being determined.  As Deputies are aware, people cannot at present get fuel while, at the same time, enormous quantities of turf that are stored in the bogs are in serious danger of being destroyed if they cannot be removed. That is the result of conflicting Government Orders.  Why should not the representatives of the people have an opportunity of meeting to discuss <Col N="2539" /> these questions and to bring their grievances before the Government?  It will certainly be too late to solve the fuel question on October 29th.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to protest most vehemently against an adjournment until October 29th, and to protest particularly against the flagrant manner in which the Tánaiste has violated the interpretation of a promise that he made previously.  I suggest that nobody could interpret the promise he gave at the last meeting in the way he has attempted to interpret it to-day.  It is breaking all precedents established in this House, when the Leader of the Government, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste gives a promise to have the Dáil assembled in response to the request of a responsible section in the House, to have underlying that the special reference that it should be proved, to the satisfaction of the Minister concerned, that there was a necessity for it.  Previously the responsible elements in the House were treated as if they had sufficient responsibility, and would not ask for a meeting if there was not a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>We are now given to understand that the determination of what was a matter of urgency lay with the Taoiseach or with the Tánaiste.  With that implication lying behind the promise, the Minister was perfectly safe in making it when there was no intention of honouring it.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste say that there was no matter of urgency to justify a meeting of the Dáil.  That has been reinforced by to-day's decision moving the adjournment until October 29th.  A sitting of the Dáil even for one day would not be agreed to, to deal with matters adverted to on August 3rd.  Even after answering 91 questions, the Tánaiste is not satisfied that there is any urgency now.  There is only one implication to be drawn from that, and that is that the Government does not want the Dáil coming here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been generously treated by the Dáil in getting emergency powers.  The day that they got these powers we were told by Front Bench speakers that they would not <Col N="2540" /> be abused by the Government; that they would be treated with respect, and that the House would meet regularly when required.  Every other day shows that there is a drift further away from the respect with which Parliamentary institutions should be treated.  If the Dáil is to be treated with contumely and contempt by the Government, what respect can we expect for the Dáil from the people?  That is what the Government is achieving.  I think the purpose of Ministers has been a very sad and sorry one, and that it will have very serious reactions on the country.  Ministers cannot see that there is an emergency although it has been indicated in various ways.  At the same time, the Government is prostituting the labour exchanges to export tens of thousands of our people to other countries to obtain work that they cannot get here.  They do not want to be told that story here.  They do not want to be told of the muddling of the turf situation whereby the second crop has been ruined by the meddling of officials.  The Parliamentary Secretary was not in a position to tell us how the position stood.  Later on he may be able to tell us but, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, it will be too late to do that on October 29th.  The Parliamentary Secretary must know that if a second crop of turf was prevented from being cut, it was because the first crop had not been disposed of.  In various ways the Government should be aware of the muddle they have made of matters that are vital to the country.  They do not want to let the representatives of the people meet to tell them the truth, so the Dáil must adjourn until October 29th; but orders will still be ground out, and when they have become operative the elected representatives will know all about them.</P>
    <P>That is the desire, at least of the Government.  The Tánaiste showed that contempt to-day in a very effective fashion when he stated that he would allow the Dáil to re-assemble on the request of any responsible section, having behind that a mental reserve of his own that the interpretation must lie with him as to whether or not there was urgency enough to justify such a meeting.  That is the <Col N="2541" /> respect for Opposition Parties that he shows, making the way for a clear dictatorship. I must flatly protest not only against the adjournment but against the method of adjournment. The language used by the Tánaiste in explaining away how he broke his promise was of the worst type, as far as respect for democratic institutions is concerned.  It shows clearly where we are drifting to.  The Government should seriously examine their consciences, for they are treading a very dangerous path.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that appeals to me in considering this matter is that there certainly would be no object in having the Dáil assembled here if there were nothing for it to do.  Let me apply the analogy of a business institution to this Dáil and look at it in that way.  At the present time, as far as one can see, there is at least a fortnight's work on the Order Paper.  I would not advocate that the Dáil be kept sitting here if there were nothing for it to do.  A business concern with a large number of orders on its books would not suggest that it should close down early. That is the position of the Dáil in a time like the present.  We ought to clear everything that stands on the books to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other matters that also ought to be considered.  All sorts of rumours float about the country and, when the Dáil is sitting, it gives people an opportunity to ask questions. You had to appeal to-day to the members not to put supplementary questions, as the answering of the questions then would be unduly prolonged.  They took two and a half hours to answer, even though there were very few supplementary questions.  I would just mention one of the rumours that I heard to-day, in order to give the Tánaiste an opportunity to deny it&mdash; as I am sure he will.  As everybody knows, we are passing through a period of an acute shortage of oil.  It is rumoured that there was a tanker for disposal here and that it could not be accommodated owing to the tanks of the oil companies being full.  If that <Col N="2542" /> is true, it is absolutely monstrous; if it is not true, it should be denied right away.  Most people feel that this country is in an impossible position, and that we are drifting towards a state in which some change of policy must be made.</P>
    <P>It has been brought out here to-day that the export of people from this country has risen to 7,000 per month. If it gets to 70,000 a month, what will we do?  Is any effort being made by the Government to reach some accommodation or some change of plan? Early this year, I think, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he was looking into that matter, to see whether a number of industrial concerns could not be found work which, if not exactly war work, would at least be acceptable as work that could be turned out and for which materials would be obtained from the other side. I never heard whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce ever reached any conclusion on that point, or whether his deliberations have finished; but, undoubtedly, most people feel that practically all the industrial concerns here are running on existing stocks, and that nobody is bringing in materials as fast as they are sending them out.  A state of crisis will arise.  I am not a prophet and will not attempt to foretell whether that will be before the 29th October or not, but certainly before that date the industrial position will have been exacerbated to a very considerable extent.  I would appeal to the Government to do what an ordinary business concern would do&mdash;to clear all the work that is before this Assembly and then, if there is nothing for them to do, they can send the members home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clearly undesirable and most unreasonable of the Minister to persist in this decision not to convene the House until the 29th October.  It seems to be a very wide departure from the promise given by him some weeks ago here and from the undertaking given by the Taoiseach about a year ago, when he had so much to say about the co-operation and goodwill that should exist amongst the various Parties.  By way of explaining <Col N="2543" /> away the promise that he gave us very definitely on the last occasion on which the House met, it is very easy for the Tánaiste to turn round and say here that there is no matter of urgent public importance which would justify calling the House together.  I do not know exactly what the Minister would consider a matter of urgent public importance, but it would seem to me that he and his colleagues are so much out of touch with the people and with the happenings in the country that they are probably incapable of judging what is a matter of urgent public importance. The cessation in the production of margarine is a matter of urgent public importance as far as a very large section of the community is concerned, but I am sure it is a matter of absolutely no importance to the Minister or his colleagues.</P>
      <P>A very simple request was made by Deputy Norton that the House should meet to-morrow.  Surely it is apparent that, unless that request is acceded to, little or no opportunity&mdash;and certainly no adequate opportunity&mdash;will be given for a discussion on the various facts, fictions and evasions which we had to listen to by way of Ministerial replies to the various questions on the Order Paper to-day.  It seems to me, and it must be apparent to everybody, that if the Government refuses to agree to call the House together at least once a fortnight and if they refuse to give us an opportunity to meet to-morrow, they are either afraid or ashamed to face the representatives of the people here, on account of the bungling of the Government, which may be revealed to an even greater extent to the people generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Tánaiste should take into account the various representations which have been made to him in connection with the adjournment. An adjournment from now to the 29th October involves some seven or eight weeks.  I suggest for his consideration postponement of the Estimate for this Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Bill until the 1st or 8th of October.  The Bill has been improved very much in the Seanad.  It could be <Col N="2544" /> improved still further and, if the intervening period were utilised by the Minister in examining some of the special steps that were taken in 1922 in that connection, it might be of some use.  For example, while the Bill has been considerably improved, there is one particular hiatus in it.  Compensation may be awarded of an amount insufficient to carry out building reconstruction. On the last occasion, in 1924, a Bill was passed enabling the corporation to advance money to any person who would be rebuilding and the rate of interest charged was only 10/- over the rate at which the corporation was able to borrow the money. The length of the loan was the same as the loan that the corporation had been able to negotiate, out of which the money was advanced.  During the last few weeks very many people have been representing to various members of the Oireachtas concerning the shortage of oil, tea and other commodities which are necessary in the national economy at the moment. Ventilating these matters in the Dáil may not improve the supply but, at any rate, it would be advisable that public explanation should be made of the reason for the interruption of business occasioned by the shortage.  Ministers ought to realise that members of the Dáil are available at almost all moments to their constituents and other persons who represent to them the privations caused by the shortage of certain materials.  It would certainly tend towards restoring public confidence to some extent to have the Dáil meeting and to have these matters discussed here.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I have not been here for portion of this debate but the suggestion has been made that, somehow or other, the Government broke its word in regard to summoning the Dáil.  I received a letter from Deputy Keyes and Deputy Davin and I think that the reasons which were given in my reply to that letter were quite sufficient to indicate what the position was.  I think it will shorten time if I read my reply.  It is dated 23rd August and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A Cháirde, I have received your letter of the 21st instant requesting <Col N="2545" /> that Dáil Eireann be summoned to meet on Wednesday, September 3rd, for the purpose of discussing the supply and distribution of essential items of food and fuel, etc.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As you are aware, it has already been agreed that the Dáil should meet on the 17th September.  At this meeting the Bills from the Seanad will be taken and questions can be asked about any matter on which it is desired to secure information.  The Seanad has only just risen so that the interval when one or other House of the Oireachtas will not be sitting will be short.  Arrangements with staffs, etc., have already been made generally on the basis that the Dáil will not meet until the 17th proximo and to summon it now for an earlier date would cause very considerable inconvenience.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Moreover, in the short period of time which has elapsed since the Dáil rose on the 24th ult. there has not been any significant change in the general position nor have any new factors emerged which, in the opinion of the Government, would justify calling the Dáil together earlier than the date already arranged.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As you know, the economic position of the country as affected by the war situation has been the subject of discussion on many recent occasions in Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann both in its general and specific aspects and numerous statements have been made by the responsible Ministers in the course of these discussions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to some of the matters referred to in the enclosure to your letter, <i>e.g.,</i> turf and crops, the position at the moment has not developed sufficiently to enable any more detailed or reliable information to be furnished than that already made available.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the circumstances I trust you will agree that the date fixed on the adjournment will suit your purpose equally well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely members of this House are aware of the fact that there are staffs <Col N="2546" /> and others who must get some period of holiday and that public business has to be arranged so as to enable people to get the amount of rest that will enable them to face another strenuous year.  It would be quite different if there had been a long period from the time in which one of the Houses was in session but it was only a period, roughly, of a little over a fortnight and surely, if the position was urgent, I would have expected that I would have a reply back.  I got no reply whatever and I took it, quite naturally, that, whatever point they might want to make about it, the case that had been put to them was such as commanded the assent of their reason.</P>
    <P>The suggestion, I believe, has been made that the time that has been proposed is rather long.  I would like to point out to members of the House that the present situation demands from the Ministers much more personal and detailed attention than is required in ordinary times, and if a large portion of their time is to be taken up here attending the Dáil, that time, of necessity, is taken away from the administrative work.  With respect to some of the items that have been mentioned, namely, fuel and some of the other matters, they were matters which the members of the Government ought directly and immediately to deal with if the situation were to be remedied.  What we have to ask ourselves is, is it better that that remedy should be obtained or that we should simply talk about them?</P>
    <P>I will admit that it is desirable&mdash;I have always said so&mdash;that Deputies should have an opportunity of explaining how they find things in the country.  That is one of the great advantages of an institution like this. But there is the other matter that has to be attended to, that there is administrative work falling to be done by members of the Government and that is particularly heavy at the present time.  I think that there is no just ground for complaint in the fact that the Dáil did not meet on the 3rd September, when it was meeting a fortnight afterwards and when the House had met only a short time before.  It <Col N="2547" /> has been usual in ordinary times to have a fairly long period of adjournment at this time of the year.  One of the things that has to be done during that period is the preparation of Bills for the coming period.</P>
    <P>The time that is usually most valuable from a legislative point of view, from the point of view of passing Bills, is the period from the time the Dáil meets&mdash;it used to be at the end of October&mdash;until the March session, because once the March session begins, the rest of the period is taken up almost entirely with financial business, Estimates and so on, and it is extremely difficult, if there are to be any legislative proposals at all, to make the necessary preparation and get the necessary time in the Dáil after that. Therefore the time in which the preparatory work for the Dáil is usually done is this period.  The Oireachtas staffs are allowed to take the necessary holidays during that time, and the other staffs are preparing any proposals that the Government may have for legislation.  I ask members of the House to be reasonable in this thing, and not to expect that you can have continuous session all the time. If it was something new that had to be dealt with, if there was something of particular, special urgency that had cropped up for the first time, then a case could be made for it.</P>
    <P>The adjournment to the 29th October I think has been suggested.  That was mentioned to the Whips, and there was no objection made to it.  I do not know myself whether anything may occur in the meantime which would make it desirable from the Government point of view to bring the Dáil together. If that did happen, naturally the Government would ask the Ceann Comhairle to summon the Dáil in special session.  I believe, at any rate, that a reasonable period of time for preparatory work is required if the Dáil is to be properly served during the coming year, and I ask the Deputies on that account to be reasonable, and, if there is not some special advantage to be gained by meeting, to leave that time that is so valuable from the point of view of preparation to the Ministers and the Departments.  I <Col N="2548" /> leave it to the good sense of the House.</P>

      <P>On this general discussion, despite what the Taoiseach has said, I regard it as most unfortunate, when the Tánaiste passed his word in this House that a certain thing would be done that that thing was not done. I said before, and I now repeat, that personally I did not sympathise with the Labour Party's request that the Dáil should be summoned on the date named by them, because I felt that the meeting to-day would probably meet the situation; but when the leader of the Labour Party, acting on the Tánaiste's pledged word, saw fit to ask for that meeting, he should have got it, whatever other arrangements were made thereafter.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer, and it is a matter in referring to which I take no pleasure, because I have to refer to a man with whom I never had anything but relations characterised by courtesy and civility whenever I had any dealings with him.  I refer to the late Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I and members of my Party and members of the Government went around this country during the last nine months, and we said to young fellows who had jobs that we felt this country was in such danger and such difficulties that we were justified in asking them to give up their safe permanent employment and join the Army.  I know lots of boys who came to me and said: &ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Dillon, that we ought to give up our jobs and join the Army?&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;That is advice which I hate to be asked to give, because it is an awful thing to ask another man to make heavy sacrifices for the State.&rdquo;</P>

My job is to accept the ruling, whatever it is.  It is a matter to which I shall return on another occasion.  All I do want to say is this: I said it before to-day, but I am glad of the opportunity of saying it while the Taoiseach is here.  Heretofore, when we passed our word to one another across the floor of this House it was taken without question, and I never had any reason to complain of its being broken.  If that tradition is to be departed from on any grounds, the conduct of Parliamentary affairs in this country will become virtually impossible. I understood that on this matter of the adjournment a general debate was permissible.  Am I to take it that, this evening, that is not the case?</P>

      <P>As I understood it, we are meeting here to-day to deal with certain points.  The moment those were dealt with, it was likely that there would be some proposal for an adjournment debate.  I had hoped that the business for which we met here would be concluded fairly early, and that there would still be time, perhaps two or three hours, for an adjournment debate in the ordinary way, but I do not know what the position has developed into now.  We are having a semi-adjournment debate on this question, which is really an order-of-business question in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of order, merely, a Chinn Comhairle, we have first of all to settle when the Dáil is to re-assemble.  That has to be settled.  Then there is the question of this particular session.  My own view is that, when Deputies are brought up here from the country, if there are questions that are to be discussed they should be discussed then, rather than put off for a longer period.  Within reason, it is desirable that Deputies should be given an opportunity when they come up here for a meeting like this or for any other meeting, of dealing with matters which they regard as urgent and important.  I think that is very much more desirable than that we should be meeting and not getting things done, meeting, going away and meeting again.  You cannot order business on that basis.  I suggest that we should decide on the date when we will reassemble.  If there is an amendment to the proposal before the House, let us deal with it.  The 29th October is proposed.  If there is time to-night <Col N="2553" /> we can have an adjournment debate, and if there is a strong desire amongst Deputies to continue the discussion to-morrow, though it would be extremely inconvenient from the point of view of other arrangements that have been made, nevertheless these other arrangements will have to go by the board and we can have a continuation of the debate to-morrow.  To start with, perhaps we can decide whether the 29th October will suit.</P>

If the Taoiseach's submission meets with your approval, surely it is open to me to move that the Dáil do meet 14 days from to-day inasmuch as I regard the action of the Government in releasing the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to take up a job at £4,000 a year as evidence that they are not acting responsibly in the absence of the Dáil.

My feeling that the Government are so acting has been gravely shaken by the incident to which I already referred and that was that having permitted us, and gone themselves to the country, to urge young men to throw up their jobs in order to join the Army, to jeopardise their immediate futures, which they did in thousands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To which my amendment rejoins: &ldquo;We do not want to give you a long recess. We want to give you 14 days.&rdquo;  The House may ask: &ldquo;Why do you want to give them 14 days?&rdquo; and my reason for granting the Government a recess for only 14 days is that I am not satisfied they are acting with a due sense of responsibility; that the Dáil is in recess and things are occurring which require to be called in question at an early date.  I am entitled to say to the House that while we were in recess a very large number&mdash;I am not going to give any number&mdash;of young men in this country took up arms, having given up their normal jobs.</P>

In reply to the Taoiseach, I want to say that, on 20th August, the Labour Party met here and considered the reports they had received as to the fuel position especially and the growing danger there was of the fuel position being left in a very chaotic state.  They had also before them the position with regard to unemployment and the numbers of men who were fleeing across to Britain, and they had further before them various questions which had been raised in their different constituencies to which they had no opportunity of getting a reply.  I had one matter particularly with regard to Irish Shipping Limited, on which I tried to elicit information to-day.  Bearing all these facts in mind and remembering the promise of <Col N="2558" /> the Tánaiste on the adjournment, they decided to ask for a meeting of the Dáil on 3rd September, in all good faith.  There was nobody more astonished than I when I read the Taoiseach's refusal to call that meeting. The position in the country is changing so rapidly from day to day, it is worsening so rapidly from day to day, that it is necessary for this House to meet at least once a fortnight, and the Labour Party did decide to request that the House should meet, at the very latest, on 1st October. With your permission, I want to put that amendment to the new motion by the Taoiseach.</P>

I do not wish to elaborate on that amendment which I now move.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move an amendment, a copy of which I have handed to you, Sir, and I recommend that amendment to Dáil Eireann on these grounds.  The Government is entitled to demand that it will be given adequate time to prepare a schedule of the business which it proposes to lay before Dáil Eireann, and that was a request to which I was prepared to agree, until my confidence in their discretion was completely shattered by an incident which took place since we last met here.  The Taoiseach, at an early stage in the present emergency which affects the world, summoned all Parties to him and told them of his grave anxiety as to the state of the country. Without going into the confidential communications which he then made to the Leaders of the various Parties on that date, he satisfied us all that there was a grave emergency, that there was a situation of very great danger and that it was a situation in which we would be entitled to go out <Col N="2559" /> to our people and say: &ldquo;Whatever your political convictions may be, whatever you think of the Government in office at present, one thing is certain: every citizen should place his services, without reservation, at the disposal of the legitimate Government of the country to do whatever job he is given, however difficult, in the defence and protection of the country which is our common heritage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have said, hundreds of young fellows came to me and said: &ldquo;Does that advice mean, Mr. Dillon, that you expect us to give up our jobs and to go into the Army?  We are earning £3, £4, or £4 10s. a week and it means having 2/- a day,&rdquo; and I said to them: &ldquo;It is an advice which no man cares to give to his neighbour, but if you ask me directly if I mean that, I am obliged to reply that I do.  It is a very material sacrifice, I know, and it is a sacrifice which only public-spirited men would undertake, but it is undoubtedly the right thing to do,&rdquo; and I know fellows who gave up permanent jobs, with the prospect of advancement, and who went into the Army and who are to-day receiving 2/- a day for the extremely arduous and difficult work that Army life entails for the average civilian, not to speak of the perils of which we have had so terrible an instance in the course of the last 24 hours.  It has not only been a matter for these boys of giving up their normal livelihood, of undertaking tedious and difficult work, but of actually putting their lives in daily jeopardy, without any of the glory of battle and simply in the ordinary course of duty, which carries with it no accolade or admiration whatever. But the fact that there was no praise, that there was no enthusiasm for these arduous duties, in no way mitigated the tragedy of the deaths of some of the finest young men in this country in the course of their duties yesterday. Compare that with a Minister, who is a member of the supreme Executive of this State, charged with immense responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let me say this, that I put forward this amendment in the profound belief that there are grave reasons why the Government should not be allowed to carry out its executive functions divorced from the supervision of Dáil Eireann.  I believe there are reasons which are not only a standing danger to the State but a standing danger to something even more than the fabric of the State, and that is the morale of our people, and their confidence in their representatives. I believe that the safety of the nation depends on the people's confidence in the purity and rectitude of the public men who represent them, and I submit that if anything should occur which causes our people seriously to doubt that such qualities reside in the legislators of this State, our people will lose confidence not only in a particular Government, but may begin to lose confidence in Parliamentary institutions as well.</P>

      <P>By certain Deputies of the House.  Far from desiring to disobey the ruling of the Chair, I am attempting to conform to it.  My reasons are well known, and in my submission they are potent and even irresistible. In the interests of the institutions of this State I suggest to the Taoiseach that even at this eleventh hour he should change his mind and realise that the vigilance of this House is necessary to keep the Executive of this State straight, and that the sooner he avails of it the better it will be for all of us.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has stated that he has no confidence in the Government <Col N="2563" /> to look after the country. Since this crisis started Deputy Dillon has gone on very definite lines here. One of the reasons apparently why he has no confidence in this Government is because this Government has insisted that this country should produce food enough for our people.  That is directly opposed to the policy of Deputy Dillon which is that we should grow no wheat but should try to get it in here.  In that case we would have to pay the price that Deputy Dillon has in the back of his head for the food that we got&mdash;the price that he outlined here &mdash;but on that his own Party repudiated him here during the last session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is wrong with Deputy Dillon&mdash;that we here are insisting on the policy of this Government being carried out.  Deputy Dillon's new policy, as outlined here to-night, is a policy of sabotage.  He has failed to bring down the Government by direct means.  His own Party repudiated him on that, but he is now endeavouring to bring it down by whispering, back-door muttered views. Deputy Dillon spoke of men who gave up jobs here, there and elsewhere.  In 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920 we had young men working down at Haulbowline who were earning £10 a week.  Deputy Dillon was then an able-bodied young man. Those young men gave up their jobs and fought for this country.  I wonder where was Deputy Dillon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating my remarks to the motion that the Dáil should not meet earlier than the date appointed. Those young men I have referred to were driven out of this country like mad dogs by a clique in 1923.  If one <Col N="2564" /> were to look for them now he would have to go to America or elsewhere. Some might be found here, but whatever jobs they had they gave them up to serve their country.  Deputy Dillon comes along to-day and talks about a few highly-paid gentlemen who gave up some little jobs they had.  I object to any member of this House being allowed to sabotage, or to endeavour to pull down, this State&mdash;I do not care what name he bears&mdash;but that has been the attitude of Deputy Dillon here as long as I know him.</P>

      <P>There are 26 amendments from the Seanad, all of which I propose to accept.  The majority of them, as set out on the Order Paper, are either drafting amendments or amendments consequential on several important changes that I agreed to make in the Bill as it passed through the Seanad. I might say that the important amendments <Col N="2567" /> are numbers 5, 9, 12, 13, 15 and 17.  These, or one or two of them at any rate, are fundamental changes. The other amendments, as I say, are either drafting or consequential amendments.

      <P>I should like to know whether the Minister has given any consideration to a new development that has arisen in connection with damage to property, and that is through engineers discovering or apparently discovering, when roofs and ceilings are taken down, that there was damage already existing in the houses before the bombing took place. The result is that they are not offering any compensation and not completing the repairs in the case of such alleged damage, which might not have been discovered for another 40 or fifty years were it not for the bombing.  These people who had damage done to their roofs and ceilings, and where the girders were afterwards found to have been defective, are now left practically homeless and are not able to find the money to repair the damage.  For instance, I have a letter here from a resident in the North Circular Road. This woman has got an estimate for £480 to repair a house which the engineer declares was in a bad condition before the bombing took place, but the bombing completed the damage and left such houses in the condition in which they now are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister propose to deal in any way fairly and adequately with such persons who own property which has suffered damage?  In this case the property was let in flats to lodgers, and the original owner has now lost her means of living as a result of the damage.  I think that something ought to be done in the case of damage which the engineer alleges he cannot repair because of the conditions laid down.  I hold that the repair of that damage <Col N="2568" /> ought to be undertaken by the Government. I understand that a Minister and another Government have accepted full responsibility in such cases, and I think that these people who have no money to repair their houses ought to be better treated by the Government.</P>

    <P>(b)  the aggregate amount of the compensation awarded or payable in respect of watches, jewellery and articles of personal ornament (other than any such articles which were kept by the owner as part of his stock-in-trade or were, when the injury occurred, specifically insured against loss by at least one of the following, viz:&mdash;fire, burglary, and theft, whether such insurance did or did not apply to the injury) injured in any one injury <Col N="2573" /> shall not exceed five per cent. of the total amount of compensation under this Act awarded in respect of property (other than buildings and other than chattels to which either this paragraph or the next following paragraph of this section applies) injured by that injury;</P>
    <P>(c)  the aggregate amount of the compensation awarded or payable in respect of coins, legal tender and other Government notes, bank notes, and other currency of this or any other country (other than any such articles which were, when the injury occurred, expressly insured against loss by at least one of the following, viz:&mdash;fire, burglary, and theft, whether such insurance did or did not apply to the injury) shall not exceed five per cent. of the total amount of compensation under this Act awarded in respect of property (other than buildings and other than chattels to which either this paragraph or the next preceding paragraph of this section applies) injured by that injury or the sum of twenty-five pounds, whichever is the lesser;</P>
    <P>(d)  the amount of compensation in respect of any chattel which is excluded from either of the two next preceding paragraphs of this section by reason of its being insured in the manner mentioned in that paragraph shall not exceed the sum for which it is so insured;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that this matter was debated at length in this House.  We originally excluded payment for watches, jewellery, coins, banknotes, etc.  In the case of watches, etc., the measure of the compensation, except in the case of specific insurance, will be a maximum of 5 per cent. of what is awarded in respect of the applicant's property (other than the building), exclusive of the chattels now made eligible for the payment of compensation. The measure of compensation in the case of coins, banknotes, etc., is the same, but with an overriding maximum of £25.  Where there is specific or express insurance the limit of compensation will be the sum insured.  The Dáil <Col N="2574" /> will appreciate that losses of this type are incapable, normally, of satisfactory proof, and for this reason it is essential that overriding maxima be laid down. Generally, in this matter, on the advice and at the suggestions of certain Senators, I consulted leading insurance authorities to ascertain what was done by insurance companies in similar cases and I am following in this matter the procedure usually adopted by such companies.</P>

      <P>Section 10.  Before sub-section (2), page 8, a new sub-section inserted as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a building has sustained an injury to which this Act applies, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  compensation under this Act may be awarded to a person who carried on a trade, profession, or business in the said building in respect of his loss of earnings from the said trade, profession, or business where by reason of the said injury it is, during any period, impossible or impracticable to carry on the said trade, profession, or business, but such compensation shall not exceed 15 per cent. of the annual rate of the earnings of such person from the said trade, profession, or business as carried on in the said building during the 12 consecutive months or the period during which the said trade, profession <Col N="2575" /> or business was so carried on (whichever is the lesser) next preceding the date on which the said injury occurred or the sum of £150, whichever is the lesser;</P>
    <P>(b)  compensation under this Act in respect of loss of employment may be awarded to an individual who was, immediately before the said injury, employed in a trade, profession, or business carried on in the said building and has, by reason of the said injury, lost his said employment either permanently or temporarily, but such compensation shall not exceed 15 per cent. of the annual rate of his earnings in that employment during the 12 consecutive months or the period during which he was in the said employment (whichever is the lesser) next preceding the date of the said injury or the sum of £150, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>This is one of the principal amendments made in the Seanad.  It broadens very considerably the definition of consequential losses for which compensation may be claimed.  The effect of the amendment is to allow compensation for loss of earnings resulting from damage to a building up to 15 per cent. of the annual amount subject to an overriding maximum of £150 for any one claim.  Deputies will recall that when Section 10 was previously discussed in this House it was severely criticised and, in response to the representations then made, I inserted a provision in the Bill covering removal expenses and alternative accommodation with a maximum of £50. This met the more immediate and serious forms of consequential loss, and it was considered, I think, that it represented a substantial advance on the Bill as introduced.</P>
    <P>When, however, the Bill in its amended form came before the Seanad, Section 10 was again attacked on the score that it covered only this limited category of consequential loss and that even within the restricted category compensation was subject to the maximum of £50.  On the Committee Stage, <Col N="2576" /> I was induced to agree to drop the money limit altogether and to pay compensation without limit in respect of such expenditure as I was satisfied was reasonably incurred.  At a later stage I was pressed to allow compensation for other classes of consequential loss, particular stress being laid on trade losses and loss of employment and also losses sustained by persons taking in lodgers or letting houses or rooms.  I could not in any circumstances agree to bring in consequential loss generally, without restriction as to category or amount, but I was impressed by the case made for providing compensation for people whose livelihood is adversely affected and the amendment now before the Dáil is the result.  It enables compensation up to, roughly, two months' wages to be paid to a worker who loses his employment as a result of his employer's business premises being destroyed or damaged; similarly, something like two months' earnings may be paid to the trader himself.  This gives the parties concerned time to look round and meets the cases that were represented to me as most typical and frequent; all the poorer cases at any rate, and cases in which real hardships might arise are covered.</P>
    <P>The amendment leaves the final decision in the hands of the court, as in the case of other claims under the Bill. This I consider preferable&mdash;both from the administrative angle and in view of the amount of money that may be involved&mdash;to retaining complete discretion in my own hands.  Having regard to the concessions I made in bringing in these new categories of consequential loss, I felt I must retain the existing limit of £50 for removal expenses and alternative accommodation.  Accordingly, I did not proceed with an amendment I had tabled in the Seanad in fulfilment of my earlier promise to cut out the limitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment certainly effects an improvement on the Bill as it was when it left this House. There is one point in connection with this amendment which is of some importance to people affected.  The longer the delay that takes place before compensation is paid, the less the value of <Col N="2577" /> the compensation relatively to the person concerned.  If, for example, it takes 12 months from the date of the passing of the Bill to assess compensation and then 12 months to rebuild, the compensation is really 7½ per cent. on two years' trading.  Arising out of that, can any facilities be afforded to get reconstruction under way at an early date?  The compensation in that case will be far bigger relatively than if it were to take two years.</P>

      <P>This is the only amendment which affords me an opportunity of raising the question I put earlier in connection with the Dublin Reconstruction Act.  That Act contained two very useful sections.  One provided that a person was not liable for rates from 1922 to 1926 unless there was a temporary structure erected on the site.  The second provided in respect of restored property that the person would not be liable to have his rates assessed on a higher valuation than was in force in 1922.  The Minister desires that reconstruction should take place as soon as possible.  One way of making reconstruction attractive would be to indicate at an early date that it was proposed for a period, let us say of ten years&mdash;whatever the period was in the Dublin Reconstruction Act&mdash;the rates assessable on the property would be the same as they were on the date of the damage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2583" /> The position under the Bill as it left the Dáil was that where a local authority came to the rescue and incurred expenditure&mdash;say, in a cash advance for furniture or clothing, or on repairs carried out by themselves, or in recouping the cost of repairs carried out by the owner's own contractor&mdash; the amount of such expenditure as might be determined by the Minister fell to be deducted from the compensation awarded by the court; the court was required not to have regard to such expenditure or make any allowance or deduction in respect thereof. It was felt, however, on further consideration, that where a claim goes to the Circuit Court the court should finally determine&mdash;subject, of course, to any appeal to a higher court&mdash;all relevant matters and fix the net compensation payable, and that the Minister should have no discretionary functions in regard to deductions in respect of expenditure by the local authority. Accordingly, this amendment was introduced to ensure that the matter would be left entirely to the court.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £50,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for Compensation and other Payments in connection with Injuries to Property due to the dropping of bombs by foreign aircraft and kindred incidents while the State is not engaged in war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote is required to meet expenditure during the current year under the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Bill. Section 13 of the Bill, which is the main expenses section, provides for the payment out of voted monies of the compensation and costs awarded by the Minister or the court and administration expenses.  The other charges to be met out of the Vote arise under Sections 15, 18, 19 and 20 of the Bill.  The expenditure covered by Section 15 is contingent on the recovery of compensation from an external government or authority, and would include payments to people who were awarded less under the Bill for injuries than the amounts recovered from abroad in respect of them, or who receive no compensation at all for one reason or another, such as not having applied in time, or because the injuries by their nature were excluded from compensation and who nevertheless prove that they suffered loss owing to the injuries.  The expenditure under Section 18 and 19 represents payments to local authorities and Government departments respectively in recoupment of money spent by them on the repair of injured buildings, or by way <Col N="2588" /> of grants for clothes or furniture. Expenditure under Section 20 will arise where land comprising injured buildings is acquired by a district planning authority.  In these cases the difference between the value of the land immediately before and after the injury is payable to the planning authority out of voted moneys, and no compensation is payable under the Bill in respect of the injury.</P>
    <P>The £50,000 provided for in the Estimate is a tentative figure and it is not possible at this stage to say whether it will suffice or not to meet all the payments that fall to be made between now and the 31st March next as this will depend on how quickly claims are received and settled.  Furthermore the inclusion of certain elements of consequential loss makes it difficult to forecast the amount which may be payable until we have some experience of the claims to be lodged.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the notes on the face of the Estimate the expenditure out of the Vote will be offset to the extent of any compensation recovered from external Governments or authorities which will be brought to credit as Exchequer extra receipts.  I am unable as yet to form any opinion as to the amount which may be recovered in this way.</P>

I believe that the City Manager and the officials did their job reasonably well.  There might be individual cases where they did not do it as rapidly or as satisfactorily as some people thought they should, but the City Manager has definitely repudiated the suggestion that people were obliged to lie on floors.

The amendment provides that an alderman in a borough electoral area, which has not been contested shall be chosen from members elected for that particular borough electoral area, and not from members of the council as a whole.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 43.  A new sub-section as follows added to the section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A candidate for election as a lord mayor or mayor of a county or other borough, or as the chairman of any local authority shall not be deemed to have a pecuniary interest <Col N="2591" /> in such election by reason of the fact that a salary attaches to the office of such lord mayor, mayor, or chairman, and accordingly such candidate may vote and take part in the proceedings at such election.</P>
    <P>Under the Municipal Corporation Act, 1842, a member is prohibited from taking part in a discussion in which he has a pecuniary interest.  I understand that in the case of all the mayors and the chairmanship of at least one borough council, there is a salary attached to the office.  It would be possible, therefore, simply by nominating a member for the position of mayor or chairman to prevent him from taking part in discussions, and this amendment is designed to make it clear that a person proposed as mayor, who may be said to have a pecuniary interest by his office, nevertheless shall not be debarred from taking part in the proceedings.</P>

      <P>(3)  Where a hereditament in respect of which sub-section (1) or (2) of this section is applicable includes agricultural land, the power of apportionment under the said sub-section shall include a power to apportion the valuation of such agricultural land, and the said sub-section shall have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The purpose of the section is to allow a provisional valuation to be made where a hereditament has been actually divided, but still appears as an undivided one on the valuation list. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that agricultural land in hereditament may be dealt with in the same way.</P>

      <P>New section.  In Part IX, immediately after Section 89, page 40, a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  As soon as may be after the commencement of this section, the appointment under Section 4 of the County Management Act, 1940 (No. 12 of 1940), of the first county manager for every county (other than the county of Dublin) or each of every two grouped counties shall be proceeded with and completed, notwithstanding that that Act has not then come into force, but the day appointed by the Minister under sub-section (2) of the said Section 4 as the day as on and from which any such appointment takes effect shall not be earlier than the day on which the said County Management Act, 1940, comes into operation.</P>
      <P>(2)  Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the County Management Act, 1940 (No. 12 of 1940), shall not apply or have effect in relation to a county in respect of which the appointment of the first county manager takes effect on the day on which that Act comes into operation.</P>

    <P>(3)  As soon as may be after the commencement of this section, the first appointments of persons to fill the several offices to which Section 12 of the County Management Act, 1940 (No. 12 of 1940), applies shall be proceeded with and completed under that Act notwithstanding that the said Act has not then come into operation, but the day appointed by the Minister under paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) of the said Section 12 <Col N="2593" /> as the day as on and from which any such appointment takes effect shall not be earlier than the day on which the said County Management Act, 1940, comes into operation.</P>
    <P>It was hoped to put the County Management Act into operation early next year, and the object of this new section is to have the selection of county managers and assistant managers proceed, so that appointments will be made in time for the first managers to take up their duties when the Act comes into operation.</P>

      <P>Section 6.  Before sub-section (8), in page 4, a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(8)  Nothing in this section shall render it unlawful for any person or group of persons to mediate in a trade dispute or to bring together the parties in a trade dispute with a view to reaching an amicable settlement.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that this amendment was introduced in deference to the views expressed in the Seanad that a situation may arise in which persons, actually engaged on strike and not being members of any trade union or excepted body, might find it difficult to meet the other parties to the dispute and that, accordingly, some arrangement should be made whereby persons of goodwill might intervene to bring such parties together.  A great deal of consideration was given to this in the Department and in the Seanad, to find a way of dealing with that position without opening too wide a loophole in the Bill, and this amendment has been drafted in an endeavour to secure that.  When I was accepting the amendment in the Seanad, I expressed the opinion that I was rather uneasy as to what the consequences of it might be, but we are going to give it a trial, with the understanding that, if it is found that this opens too wide the door, amending legislation will be introduced.</P>

      <P>(4) Whenever a negotiation licence to which sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of this section applies is revoked the Minister shall take such steps as he considers adequate by the publication of notices in the public Press or otherwise to make known to persons likely to be affected by such revocation that the said negotiation licences have been revoked.</P>
      <P>The terms of this amendment appear to be self-explanatory.  Sub-sections (2) and (3) of this section provide that a determination of the tribunal shall be revoked if the negotiation licence of the trade union favoured by the determination becomes revoked.  The amendment, which was proposed by the Labour Senators, provides that whenever such a negotiation licence becomes revoked the Minister shall announce the fact in the public Press or otherwise.

    <P>It was pointed out that Section 35 as originally drafted might make it mandatory upon a trade union to refuse to admit to membership a person whom they regarded as a bad character or who had been expelled from the trade union for habitual breaches of the rules. The purpose of this amendment is to give the trade unions a discretion in the matter and to allow them to decide whether or not they shall accept for membership a person against whom such allegations might be made.  It is presumed, of course, that before admitting such a person to membership of their union they would first of all assure themselves that he had reformed, that whatever blots there may have been on his reputation prior to that he had purged in some way or that he had given them some assurance that he would conform to the rules of the organisation.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that when the allegation is made against a lady that she is a bad character, it is about the worst one could make against her.  Similarly, with regard to a man.  It depends very much upon what particular syllable in the word is lengthened or dominant as to what the interpretation of it is.  Would the Minister not consider making it: &ldquo;who is not a good character,&rdquo; which is not objectionable in any way?  In the form in which it appears at present it is open to implying a very great slur, beyond what was intended.  The intention is character in respect of matters connected with trade unionism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the main thing.  The other thing is not concerned. In any case, &ldquo;not having a good character&rdquo; would cover it, and would not be so objectionable as it is in this form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the section is as objectionable as the Deputy suggests.  What we are providing is that where one trade union has been given the sole right to organise any body of persons, that trade union will admit to membership every <i>bona fide</i> applicant who is a person of good character or who is a person whose reputation is not so questionable that ordinary citizens would prefer not to associate with him or who has not been previously expelled from that union for continuous breach of the rules.  The only thing that this proviso is intended to secure is that the trade union will not be compelled to admit to membership, against the considered opinion of the majority of the members or of those who are responsible for the management of the trade union, a person of known bad character, and it makes that reservation in regard to the general right which it confers upon people to secure admission to trade unions which have been given the sole right to organise bodies of citizens, in this case, more particularly bodies of workers.  The section as drafted originally seemed to make it mandatory upon a trade union, if a person of <Col N="2603" /> known bad character applied for admission, to refuse to admit him.  It was suggested that many people fall, and a good many of those who fall reform, and that it would not be right to deprive the trade union of normal discretion in the matter in regard to the people whom it would admit even if their character appeared not to be above reproach.  All we are doing here is that we are ensuring that unless the trade union can convince a district justice that a person is of bad character or has been guilty of habitual breaches of the rules of the organisation, the union must admit him to membership. It does not cast any slur on the general body of persons.  The only thing it does is that it still reserves to members of the union the right to decide for themselves where they will draw the line in regard to the reputation of an individual.</P>

      <P>Why not put that in? I heard of a very estimable gentleman, who was a friend of mine, on one occasion being refused admittance into a pious society because some person in that society said: &ldquo;This man does not keep peace with his fellow-men.&rdquo;  The man had an excellent character.  What you want is to include persons of good character.  The Minister's job is not exclusion; it is to ensure that persons of good character get in.  A person may have a bad character in respect of what might be described as the particular rules of a society, and nevertheless have a good character otherwise. I am not trying to get in persons who have done anything objectionable to trade unions, but I want to ensure that a man who has a good character will <Col N="2604" /> get in.  If it is reserved to persons of good character, the persons of bad character cannot enter.  We do not want a person to be branded.  I think this is expressed in an unfortunate way here, and it does not effect the purpose. The purpose is to ensure that persons will get in, assuming that they have a good character.</P>

      <P>The Minister could consult with the Ceann Comhairle and see whether or not that is a better expression.  There is some such power as that in connection with this matter. When it appears in the vernacular, it is quite possible that it will be put in the form I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy is suggesting is that those persons should be tried by court martial, that is to say that they would be called upon to prove that they are persons of good character.  As the Bill stands, the onus is on the trade union, if it refuses to admit a person, to prove in court if necessary that he is a person of bad character.  For instance, in the case of a trade union catering for locksmiths, if a person who was reputed to be a burglar came along I assume that we would not deny to the trade union the right to refuse to admit the burglar, but I think it would be easier for the trade union to show to the satisfaction of the district justice that this locksmith was a bad character, by reason of the fact that he had been on a number of occasions convicted of burglary, than it might be for another person, who had only been suspected of having committed a burglary, to show that he is a person of good character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might term his observations in that form <i>tu quoque</i> in connection with this argument. If a man of good character <Col N="2605" /> comes before the trade union, he should be empowered to get in.  That is all I ask.  He is entitled to have that right. It is very easy to destroy a man's character.  It is most unlikely that a man of bad character will get in, but I want to ensure that a person of good character will get in.</P>
