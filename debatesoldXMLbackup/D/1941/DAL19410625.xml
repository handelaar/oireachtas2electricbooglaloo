    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of winning turf is at present progressive, but the total to be produced is dependent on weather and other indeterminate factors.  The answer to the second part of the question is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if the present rate of winning turf is sufficient to provide the country with fuel for the forthcoming winter, and I submit, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has not answered that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that Solomon could, not answer that question. It is a most indeterminate question, and I have done the very best I could to meet the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not posing as Solomon either, but I should like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the needs of the country are <Col N="170" /> known so far as coal is concerned, and that a rough and ready way of comparing coal with turf is, I take it, two to one.  There are only so many months during which the turf can be got out of the bogs.  Is it being got out at anything approaching the quantity that would enable the needs of the country to be supplied?  That is the answer I am looking for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government has as yet considered the Drainage Commission Report with a view to action; (b) when he expects the urgent work referred to in the Brick and Cashen catchment area to start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the second part I am aware of the views expressed in the report of the Drainage Commission as to the Brick and Cashen area but I cannot undertake at this stage to indicate when work may be started in any particular catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, perhaps, take into account that the longer he or the Government postpones dealing with the matter the greater the expense will be?  For two <Col N="172" /> reasons: one, because the damage will he cumulative, and, secondly, because the costs will go up.  Further, is he aware that a great deal of damage is done every car in that particular district? Would he or the Goverment not consider favourably the possibility, at all events, of immediately under taking preventive works and some restorative works that might prevent a great deal of damage and that would be useful for a final scheme? Finally, does the Minister propose, as is suggested in a later paragraph of the report &mdash; I think it is paragraph 530 &mdash; that a survey should be undertaken, even prior to legislation, in that and one or two other districts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is quite possible that a survey will be made, I cannot say that the survey would be confined to this catchment area or other areas.  What the Deputy says about the damage that is being done and that has been done over a number of years applies equally to a number of other catchment areas about which representations have also been made to us that the matter is very urgent.</P>

Would it not be possible to get some co-ordination between the Board of Works and the Land Commission in that particular respect?  The Minister will, I am sure, admit that the damage is cumulative.  It must be.  Every year makes the prospect of dealing with it more costly.  I would ask the Minister to look into it.  It is extremely urgent.  There is unemployment there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you allow me to raise a matter of Parliamentary privileges so far as this House is concerned? You recollect that when the Emergency Powers Act was being passed through this House we received an assurance from the Taoiseach that the debates in this House would not be subject to censorship.  So far as I know, no effort &mdash; no overt effort at all events &mdash; was made to prohibit the publication of proceedings which took place in this House.  Yesterday, some members of this Party, particularly Deputy Corish and myself, made references to the Trade Union Bill and expressed some views on the Bill.  In accordance with the assurance which we received from the Taoiseach, we had every reason to believe that the Press would not be prevented from publishing any portion of the speeches so made, but to-day <i>The Torch</i>, a weekly Labour paper, received a telegram which, I think, is an outrage on the privileges of this House and a wanton breach of the undertaking given by the <Col N="176" /> Taoiseach.  The Editor of <i>The Torch</i> has received this telegram:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Re Dáil debates Tuesday on Trade Union Bill you are hereby prohibited from publishing in your paper any reference to declarations by Deputies Norton and Corish of their intention in the event of the enactment of the Bill to advocate non-recognition of the law.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Michael Knightly,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Chief Press Censor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have not yet seen an official report of my speech yesterday.  The Chief Press Censor, however, is privileged to see it and has apparently acted on what he has already seen though I am normally prohibited from seeing a report of my speech yesterday and in fact have not seen a report of my speech yesterday.  But this is surely a gross breach of the assurance which we received from the Taoiseach. This surely is an invasion of the rights of this House.  If we speak in this House now and criticise measures, unwanted, despicable measures, then the Chief Press Censor is being used as an instrument of the Government Party to prevent the public outside knowing what in fact is said in this House. This is not democracy.  This is the law of Tammany Hall and with as little morality as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section reveals the mentality behind this whole Bill.  The mentality, of course, is clearly a most vicious mentality, because we are providing in Section 6 for the exemption of certain bodies, some of them being Civil Service staff organisations, teachers, and house unions.  Under Section 6, it is possible for any particular employer to make it a condition of employment in his factory that his staff must be members of that contemptible and detestable thing known as a company union, and you may not find it possible to get employment in that factory unless you are prepared to become a member of that creature of the employer.  That organisation under this Bill is exempt from paying any deposit whatever as a condition for getting a negotiation licence.  It may function as a trade union and carry on negotiations in respect of wages and conditions, but, so that it will not hurt the employer, so that it may be always under his thumb, always part of his creation, always just his plaything, the Minister put Section 10 into this Bill, which deprives an organisation of that kind of ever getting the strength to make it the economic equal of the boss.  That organisation, by virtue of Section 10, is prevented from enjoying the benefits of Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1871, and Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, so that if any of the members of that organisation go on strike, and if they try to resort to peaceful picketing, a thing which has been recognised in respect of trade unions down through the ages, that organisation does not get any such protection. The boss, in such circumstances, can send for the armed forces of the State and have those peaceful pickets removed, even though their only purpose is to make the public aware of the fact that the boss is not paying a fair rate of wages or is imposing unreasonable conditions on his employees.  Now, that organisation cannot tell the public by means of <Col N="180" /> peaceful picketing that there is a strike on.  They cannot tell the public that the boss is paying a low rate of wages. They cannot tell the public that he is enforcing bad conditions.  The Civic Guards in the first instance, the military in the second instance and the jails in the third instance, all line up behind the boss and prevent the workers in such circumstances from making their grievances known to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all this, in spite of the smooth humbug in the Constitution, which talks about freedom, of association. Freedom of association under Section 10 means the freedom that the boss will permit to the workers, or that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will permit to the workers.  That is the purpose of Section 10, to squeeze the workers in the interests of the boss. Every Deputy who goes into the Division Lobby in support of this section, no matter what humbug he talked at the last election about being in favour of raising the standard of living of the masses of the people, is going into the Division Lobby to strengthen the hands of the boss, and to take away from trade unionists the rights which they have had for over 70 years, rights which it was left to this Government to try to filch away from them.  I defy any person still purporting to have any fragmentary bias in favour of the working classes to justify this section.  It cannot be justified.  It can be justified only on one ground, that is, if you want to squeeze the workers, if you want to make them ineffective, if you want to prevent them from exercising the privileges of law which they have enjoyed for 70 years, and which were given to them by an alien Government.  For 50 years those privileges were enjoyed under the British Government.  They were enjoyed for 10 years under native governments, but this Government at this stage proposes to take away from the workers the rights which they have enjoyed for 70 years.  I say deliberately and definitely that it is done for the purpose of weakening the workers' movement in the interests of the employing classes.  As Deputy McGilligan rightly said yesterday evening, the <Col N="181" /> growth of the trade union movement has gone hand in hand with the raising of the standard of living of the workers, and trade union legislation generally for the past 70 years has been based on a recognition that trade unions expressing the view points of collectively organised workers can play a useful part in the promotion of social peace and the raising of the standard of living of the masses of the workers. Every piece of trade union legislation affecting this country for the past 70 years has proceeded on a recognition of the useful part which trade unions can play in those directions.  There has been a recognition, tardy at first, but accelerating afterwards, that it was desirable to give the trade unions such reasonable measure of liberty as was calculated to enable them to discharge their task of raising the standard of living of the workers.  Now, for the first time in 70 years, the hands of the clock are being put back by this Government. Workers now are being prevented from exercising their rights, or may be prevented from exercising their rights if the Minister can have his way under Section 10.  I protest against this section.  It is an outrageous attack upon the efforts of the workers to defend themselves against low wages and bad conditions of employment.  There can be no purpose for this section other than to weaken that resistance.</P>
    <P>This Government has shown scant regard for the interests of the workers. It has done nothing to protect their standard of living; it has done nothing to raise their wage scales; and it insists on imposing hardships on them under the Emergency Powers Order No. 83.  Having failed to lift the standard of living of the workers, having failed to protect them against the inroads which high prices make upon their standard of living, the Minister comes in under Section 10 to try to take from the workers even the protection they have left &mdash; the protection of combination and protection in the exercise of their rights and privileges which they enjoy under the Acts set out here.  The Minister is doing this in the interests of the employing class and should be ashamed of himself, and <Col N="182" /> he should never again be trusted with the confidence of a worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not replying at all?  I think he should make some attempt at some stage in this Bill to make the rase that is made against the different sections of it.  Up to the present we have seen the extraordinary course &mdash; cither complete silence or else, as he has done on other occasions, the Minister merely has quoted the result of considerations given by somebody else, namely, by legal authorities that he consulted. Surely &mdash; leaving aside the contempt that he shows for the House, which possibly is a thing to whrch we are accustomed &mdash; is it not a bad augury for the Bill that it is being passed in this way?  We are supposed to be a legislative Assembly.  This is a Bill that has aroused and is arousing a great deal of opposition and criticism amongst people who think they are being severely hit and that the privileges they have enjoyed for a long time are being filched away from them.  These people are presented with the extraordinary spectacle of a Minister who absolutely refuses to justify a single clause of this Bill, relying altogether on the efficiency of the Whips Department of the Government.</P>
      <P>Whatever chance there may be of this Bill being worked in the spirit that the Minister probably has in mind, what chance could there be after attitude and conduct of that kind on the part of the Minister?  It is hard to believe it and yet it is equally hard to avoid the conclusion that he is deliberately provoking opposition to this Bill outside the House.  I say it is extremely difficult to think that any responsible Minister would adopt an attitude of that kind.  I know that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Therefore, I am not repeating myself.  I am protesting against the Minister's conduct to-day. Deputy McGilligan, when finishing the debate last night from these benches, made an onslaught on this section and the purposes of this section. The leader of the Labour Party, breaking his silence &mdash; as we hoped the Minister would break his &mdash; also made an onslaught.  To-day the Minister does not deign to give any answer.  I suggest that if the Minister insists, and repeats his contempt for the House, on every occasion that he does that attention can be called to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the charges made by Deputy McGilligan last night were well founded, and that unless certain onerous conditions can be fulfilled by bodies of workers or by bodies of employers &mdash; it must be remembered that, as we have found out in the <Col N="184" /> course of this debate, this Bill cuts both ways &mdash; they are liable to the penalties of conspiracy, and so on, to which they would be liable were they not protected by the Trade Union Acts.  To that charge the Minister hag made no reply.  The charge is a grave one.  I do not think anybody who considers the Bill as a whole, as it war drafted, can be easy in his mind as to the future that this particular section is preparing for the country.  I hold, that even though his intention may be to help industry, as I presume it is, this Bill is more calculated &mdash; and this section is more calculated &mdash; to cause in dustrial trouble than a multiplicity of trade unions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not shown that workers &mdash; especially in small bodies &mdash; have unduly caused great material damage to the country, yet the whole purport of the Bill is to make any combination of small bodies of workers practically impossible, and to deprive them of the protection which was gradually granted to them as the result of humanitarian efforts quite as much as the result of agitation during the whole of the past 100 years.  Yet, as I have said, the Minister will not reply. It is hard, I admit, to justify this particular section.  It seems to to me that there is nothing to be said for this and various other sections in the Bill.  I admit that some amendments, very vague in character, have been put in, but the Bill as drafted would tend to make it impossible and illegal even for a county council to combine in fixing the wage of their workers.  That the Bill as drafted.  I hold also that it is quite obvious that every section of this Bill requires drastic amendment, or at least the principal sections do. They have an implication which must not have been apparent when the Bill was drafted in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, when this Bill was before the House, I described it as the nearest thing to dictatorship that was ever produced.  It is a tyrannical Bill.  I made reference to this clause as being the worst clause &mdash; one which cannot be justified.  It takes from the workers rights which they <Col N="185" /> won in days gone by, not alone from an Irish Government but from the British Government.  It looks very bad tor an Irish Parliament to take from our people rights they won in the days gone by.  They are to be denied the right of peaceful picketing and of exposure of their grievances if their union is not sufficiently strong to pay £2,000 to the Government; they are denied the rights to show the public how they are treated.  I say that the Bill ought to be withdrawn immediately. I believe that the Bill is beyond amending, that it is impossible to amend it, because every clause of it has the tyrannical idea behind it to crush the workers and, in many cases, to crush their leaders.</P>
      <P>I mentioned last week that I remember when the quay labourers in Dublin were being paid 18/- per week. Until a leader at that time adopted methods that appeared to be revolutionary these workers were paid that miserable wage, and it took their leader all his time to prevent the wages being paid to them in publichouses.  I refer to Jim Larkin, a man with whom I differed very often, but of whose good points I have knowledge.  Twenty-five years ago he stopped the stevedores paving the men their wages in publichouses. Now, as a result of organisation, the workers have reached a certain standard.  This measure will prevent them from bettering that standard.  I appeal to the Government to be wise, and to guide the Minister on to the right path and withdraw the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would be well-advised to reconsider his attitude in this matter.  This is a penal section.  There are other penal sections in the Bill, but they all recede, both in their intensity and in their powers, before this one.  As matters stand, if a trade union has not a sufficient number of members to enable it to put up the <Col N="186" /> sum required, and does not belong to what is described in the Bill as a negotiation body, then the members cannot withdraw their labour without endangering themselves and being open to prosecution for conspiracy.  So far as the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 is concerned, it is of small moment compared with the dangers there are in connection with the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.</P>
      <P>A book has been published recently called An <i>English Saga.</i>  Although that work is not correct in every repect, and is particularly incorrect in regard to its estimate of the number of soldiers from Ulster who took part in the last Great War &mdash; it put the number at 1,000,000 men when there were not 1,000,000 men in the whole of Ulster &mdash; it tells the story of the humanitarian efforts of certain people just described by Deputy O'Sullivan, and of the efforts of the workers during the last 100 years to improve their lot.  It is quite clear that an enlightened public opinion was brought to bear on that situation, and that the best elements in the community responded to the call of their fellow human beings.  We have evidence that the fruits of that were partaken of not only by those engaged in manual labour, but also by employers and the wealthy classes.  Perhaps in no case has the improvement been so marked as in the City of Dublin, where, within the memory of people who are alive to-day, the death rate was two or three times what it is at present.  That improvement in wages and in the conditions of labour is reflected in the health of the people. The benefits that those engaged in industry derived by reason of that great movement extended even to the employing classes who were able to live healthier, longer and more secure lives by reason of the humanitarian efforts of those who were engaged in improving the industrial conditions of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were suggested during the last 70 or 80 years ago that the Act of 1875 should be repealed, there would he a very strong revulsion of feeling.  None of us is prepared to contest certain parts of the case that the Minister <Col N="187" /> makes for this measure.  The intention is good, but unfortunately good intentions form the macadam of the road to a certain place in the next world where a great many souls arrive.  In order to achieve the purpose the Minister has in mind in connection with this measure he must get the maximum co-operation from those engaged in industrial occupations.  He will not get that so long as this section remains in the Bill in its present form. Whatever changes he proposes to make in the measure, or whatever amendments he intends to bring in to make it more acceptable, this section is one which cannot stand in a measure of this sort with the very partial support, if any, that there is for the proposals in the country.  No trade unionist could view such a section as this with composure.  Their entire future is bound up with the chance they have of being recognised as a negotiation body.  They may be placed in danger if they are not selected as a negotiation body, if any other trade union comes in and upsets them in that connection.  A great many people agree with the Minister that there is room for improvement.  I think the Labour Party believe that.  Why then should we put anything in a measure of this sort which would make for disunion at a time when the Minister requires the maximum of co-operation from everybody?  I suggest that in this situation, the section, with no provision whatever made for those societies which may not be passed as negotiators, is a very dangerous one, one which may possibly give rise to much greater industrial turmoil than the Bill proposes to remedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anyone who can throw his mind back some 40 or 45 years and contemplate the conditions under which people had to work then and who considers the changes that have since taken place, can calmly consider the insertion of a section of this kind in the Bill.  This Bill may be enacted but, so sure as it is, so surely will it be torn to bits by some succeeding Parliament. Humanity is not going to go back 100 years.  People are not going to revert <Col N="188" /> to the conditions under which men and women laboured when I was a boy. I would long regret if they had to do so.</P>
      <P>A half a century ago the working classes were emerging from conditions of slavery.  The conditions under which people worked and lived in the city of Belfast are not unknown to the Minister.  I am sure he does not for get the earnest pleas of the late Mr. Joseph Devlin for the improvement of the conditions under which people were called upon to work.  We are now asked to vote for a section of this kind. I think the appeal made last night by Deputy McGilligan is unanswerable He was dealing in a theoretical way with certain changes that took place in working conditions.  I know for a fact that those changes took place, because I had experience of the conditions under which people worked years ago. I know what the unfortunate workers had to endure, and I do not want anybody here or elsewhere to go back to such conditions.  So far as lies in my power, I would be prepared to resist a return to such conditions.</P>
      <P>The case submitted by Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan was a very moderate and unanswerable case, in my opinion.  During the last 50 years the workers have been emancipated from conditions amounting to slavery.  We all realise the better conditions under which people now labour, and we are aware that because of that improvement the workers are in a position to give better service to their employers.  The employer who does not observe that change does not deserve to be an employer.  He is really standing in his own light.  I am sure the Minister remembers when girls from seven to 14 years of age had to go to work at six in the morning on a breakfast consisting of a cup of tea and some dry bread.  For dinner those children had probably the same thing, and there was no change in the evening meal. That was the position of mere children. This House cannot possibly conceive the conditions existing 40 and 50 years ago in the Belfast textile trade.  I do not want the children of this country ever to endure such conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the efforts and the wisdom of democrats, those conditions were <Col N="189" /> remedied.  The employers and the workers saw the wisdom of it.  As a result, we have to-day healthier and more efficient workers.  No child who is compelled to work from six o'clock in the morning until six in the evening is fit to give efficient service to anyone. It would be physically impossible for a child to do so.  The physical and mental capacity of the workers half a century ago were so affected by the dreadful conditions under which they worked, that their output was not at all comparable with the output of the workers of to-day.  If the Minister throws his mind back he will remember some of those conditions quite well.  I am sure he heard about them often enough from the man who emancipated the Belfast workers, the late Mr. Joseph Devlin.</P>
    <P>It would be a tragedy if we put this vicious section into the Bill.  I thought, after the very moderate case submitted by Deputy McGilligan last night, that this section would be withdrawn for amendment.  I hope that even at this hour the Minister will consider it wise to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Deputies, I should like to ask the Minister to withdraw this section. I do not know whether the Minister appreciates the effect of this section or the power contained in it.  It is always in some tucked-away corner of Acts of Parliament that one finds the deadly blow and in this case, by reason of the inapplication of two sections of the Acts referred to in Section 10, my reading of the position is that unless a trade union actually receives a negotiation licence it will become an illegal body.  It became necessary to insert Section 2 in the Act of 1871 for the purpose of legalising the object for which a trade union would be formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it the Minister does not contemplate, in this Bill, to render illegal any body which obtains a negotiation licence.  I take it that it is the intention of the Minister to abolish a trade union unless such trade union is in possession of a negotiation licence, or unless it comes under the heading <Col N="190" /> of the excepted bodies mentioned in the other section.  The first point against this section is that, every trade union that is not an excepted body, or is not in receipt of a negotiation licence, is not entitled to the benefit of these two sections of the Act of Parliament which renders legal activities which would otherwise be illegal.</P>
    <P>There was some reason, I think, in the Act of 1871 for putting in Section 2 at a very early stage.  I think that as we are discussing these sections, in so far as they refer to trade unions generally, it would not be out of order to quote the Trade Union Act of 1871.  It sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful so as to render any member of such trade union liable to criminal prosecution for conspiracy or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Every member of every trade union, such trade union not having a negotiation licence or not being an excepted body within the meaning of the section we have already discussed, renders himself or herself liable to criminal prosecution and cannot plead the defence of Section 2.  Is it the Minister's intention that all trade unions, other than those that get a negotiation licence or excepted bodies, will become illegal.  Because, if it is, then he is carrying out that intention in Section 10.  If it is not, then Section 10 does not carry out the Minister's intentions. I have dealt with the position in 1871. In order to make the position clearer, the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, was passed and that is more explicit still.  Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>An agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute between employers and workmen shall not be indictable as a conspiracy if such Act committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime.</P>
    <P>Here again the effect will be that if any two employers or any two workmen <Col N="191" /> meet together for the purpose of settleing a dispute, they would find themselves before long, if the powers were so willing, in the criminal court, facing a charge of conspiracy.</P>
    <P>In the wisdom of their generation they started in 1871 and went on to 1875, and a whole statute was passed in 1906, but those are now sought to be done away with in connection with certain trade unions.  The Trade Disputes Act, 1906 gave the right of peaceful picketing and set out the code under which bargains could be carried out between masters and men or between different trade unions. The whole effect of this section is that it will give the State power to put out of existence any particular body that conies within the definition of trade union at present, if that body does not comply, or is not allowed to comply with the section which permits it to be a negotiation body.  With respect, I put that to the Minister and his advisers as the legal position.</P>
    <P>There is a second objection to the section, and it is this, that it is 70 years ago exactly since Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1871, was passed, and during that period all who have grown, to man's estate, having lived in a certain atmosphere of law and appreciation of fundamental rights, know of the endeavours to ameliorate the lot of the people.  But while it is very easy to do away with barriers and to increase, safeguards it is very difficult and very harsh to cut them away.  We have been brought up and have lived in an atmosphere under which Section 2 of the Act of 1871 and Section 3 of the Act of 1875, and the whole Act of 1906 have become the statute law of this land and have been acted upon as part of the fundamental law.  What is sought to be done will absolutely revolutionise everything now appreciated as law.  I wish the Minister to realise that, while there are many intentions behind this Bill which are probably very good, I believe the most harmful section is Section 10, and I ask the Minister seriously to consider the position that <Col N="192" /> will arise if it becomes the law of the land.</P>

      <P>Having the right to reserve my intervention in tills debate until I had heard the rase made against the section I am now going to say that I was impressed by the speech which Deputy McGilligan made last night, particularly with reference to Section 2 of the Act of 1871 and Section 3 of the Act of 1875. I have had some doubts as to whether it was necessary to refer to these Acts at all for the purpose for which this section is introduced in the Bill.  The House will remember that on the Second Reading the main focus of criticism was Section 6.  <i>(Interruptions.</i>) I gathered that there were some members of the House who took an intelligent interest in the Bill and would like to hear my point of view.</P>

      <P>I was saying that the burden of the attack on the Bill centred round Section 6 which, because it is necessary to preserve the natural right of people to discuss with each other the terms of employment, if they so desire, provided for what are known here as &ldquo;an excepted body.&rdquo;  It is alleged that this provision was introduced in order that we might encourage what is known as &ldquo;shop unions,&rdquo; and criticism of the Bill centred entirely on that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A reference to the debates will bring that point out.  I do not propose to endeavour to substantiate it here at the moment.  In replying, I pointed out that Section 10 had been introduced as a deliberate discouragement to the formation of house unions, and so tar from house unions enjoying the special privileges that were alleged, Section 10 definitely places members of house unions at a disadvantage as compared with members <Col N="193" /> of authorised trade unions holding a negotiation licence, in so far as it definitely reserves to the members of such authorised trade unions the privileges which are embodied in what I might describe as the Trade Union Acts.  I was not at all certain that in order to ensure that there would be no encouragement for shop unions it was necessary to refer it all to Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1871, or Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and I have been impressed by the speeches made by Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Cosgrave, and Deputy Esmonde.  Deputy Esmonde pointed out that, perhaps, under the section as it stands any body of persons coming together, other than for the purpose of discussing and considering wages and conditions of employment might be held, in so far as &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; could be interpreted as constituting a restraint of trade, to be guilty of conspiracy. Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to retain Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1871, or Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and on the Report Stage I will introduce an amendment to deal with the position.</P>

      <P>Apart from our individual interest in the future of our unions under this section, and the Bill as a whole, if it ever becomes law, I know of no measure introduced here during my period of membership, new nearly 20 years, which has given such grounds for complaint to the community. I was one of the founders in this country of my own union, of which I have been a member continuously for 34 years.  My colleagues and I know how in the early days of the organisation of trade unions, house unions were used by employers, against the efforts of those who were trying to establish legitimate trade unions.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation is being given the status if a house union under this Bill.  I would be deeply interested to learn <Col N="194" /> what Deputy Cormac Breathnach, and one or two other teacher-members of the Fianna Fáil Party, have to say about this proposal.</P>

      <P>The Minister read some extracts yesterday from a semi-confidential report which was submitted to the Irish Trade Union Congress in 1936. He appeared to build his whole case for the dragooning of the trade union movement in this country on the extracts which he read from that document and which suited his own point of view.  I, like most, if not all of my colleagues, and of every other person in the country who has taken an active interest in the trade union movement, am prepared to say that there are justifiable grounds for tightening up the the trade union movement, but that can never be secured by a measure of this kind. All the power of the military and of the police, all the whispering agents which the Minister may have at his disposal, will not compel &mdash; to use the Minister's words last night &mdash; the trade unionists of this country to swallow this measure in its present form.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Chair would realise, if it looked into the <Col N="195" /> matter carefully that Section 10 hits at the heart of the existing trade union movement.  It must be evident to anybody who studies the measure, and its implications that the object of Section 10, and of every section in the Bill, but of Section 10 in particular, is to weaken, if not to break, the existing trade union movement.  The trade unionists of the country who lost jobs in order to make it possible to build up the existing organisation which, as I have said, may not be 100 per cent. correct are prepared to lose a little bit more in fighting the Minister and this measure, if and when it becomes law It is my considered opinion, for what it is worth, that the trade unionists of the country and trade union officials will not recognise this Bill if and when it becomes law in its present form.  If the Minister is sincerely anxious, and I assume he is, to do the tightening up work which he thinks is necessary inside the trade union movement, why does he not attempt it by means of consultation, negotiation and agreement, especially in present circumstances? As I have already said the Minister read from the contents of a report which was submitted to the Trade Union Congress at its annual conference in 1936, in which particulars were given of the position at that time. But the conditions prevailing then were quite different from those of the present time.  If the Minister speaks again on the section, I should like him to give the House the number of hours of labour lost by trade unionists in this country during last year, from any cause whatever, and particularly if these can be attributed to the alleged jealousies and rivalries between trade unionists and trade union officials.</P>

This Bill, and this section of the Bill in particular, was horn inside the secret chamber of the Chambers of Commerce and in the offices of the Federation of Irish Industry.  The members sitting on these benches have known for a long time that certain leaders in the Chambers of Commerce, and in the Federation of Irish Industry, have, even in their own journals, been advocating the introduction and passage of this measure. This section has been advocated by certain employers who do not give a damn about the neutrality of this country, about who invades it or when it is invaded.  They know, as well as I know, that if the trade unions of this country refuse to recognise this Bill, if and when it becomes law, it is going to endanger the peace, security and safety of this State.</P>

      <P>I would advise the Deputy, if he wants to make the Federation of Irish Employers responsible for any publication, a Bill or other, that he should examine the matter a little more closely, before jumping at conclusions.  I do not want to labour that further.  We are all familiar with the saying of &ldquo;putting the cart before the horse.&rdquo;  If ever the cart was put before the horse, the horse being then turned backwards and having large nails stuck into it to help it to travel, we have an example of that sort of thing in tins section. We are out to introduce harmony into industrial life here.  This Bill does not provide any machinery for stopping strikes.  Section 10 confirms to those who hold negotiation licences all the rights that existed under legislation up to the present to carry on strikes in the good old-fashioned way.  I notice that the Minister calls these &ldquo;privileges.&rdquo; He rather emphasises that the rights won by legislation, which have proved so useful in improving the position of the working class, are to he called &ldquo;privileges.&rdquo; I do not know how many people in the House regard them as privileges.  I think that anything conferred on people by legislation might, reasonably, be described as &ldquo;rights.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is going to drop the reference to Section 2 of the 1871 Act and to Section 3 of the 1875 Act and that he is going to withdraw from anybody who does not hold a negotiation licence the rights secured to all trade unions under the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  It would be very important to know what exactly <Col N="199" /> he means.  Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful so as to render any member of such trade union liable to criminal prosecution for conspiracy or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is withdrawing that, so that a trade union which is not in possession of a negotiation licence will, so far as we can read the present riddle, still have the right to interfere in a way that will restrain trade without bringing themselves outside the law.  I have to read Section 3 of the Act of 1875, because the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, makes an addition to it.  While Section 3 of the 1875 Act is to go by the board, the addition made to it by the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, is to be held against people who have not a negotiation licence.  For the information of the House, I shall quote Section 3 of the 1875 Act:&mdash;</P>
    <P>An agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute between employers and workmen shall not be indictable as a conspiracy if such act committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime.  Nothing in this section shall exempt from punishment any persons guilty of a conspiracy for which a punishment is awarded by any Act of Parliament.  Nothing in this section shall affect the law relating to riot, unlawful assembly, breach of the peace or sedition, or any offence against the State or the Sovereign. A crime for the purposes of this section means an offence punishable on summary conviction, and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the statute making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.  Where a person is convicted of any such agreement or combination as aforesaid to do or procure to be done an act which is punishable only on summary <Col N="200" /> conviction, and is sentenced to imprisonment, the imprisonment shall not exceed three months or such longer time, if any, as may have been prescribed by the statute for the punishment of the said act when committed by one person.</P>
    <P>That is to go by the board.  Persons who do not hold a negotiation licence are still to have these rights retained to them but people who have not got a negotiation licence will not in future have the benefit of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  Section 1 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, added a paragraph to Section 3 of the 1875 Act which I have just quoted.  Section 1 of the Trade Disputes Act says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following paragraph shall be added as a new paragraph after the first paragraph of Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875:&mdash;</P>
    <P>An act done in pursuance of an agreement or combination by two or more persons shall, if done in contemplation or furtherance of a, trade dispute, not be actionable unless the act, if done without any such agreement or combination, would be actionable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that, even though an act would not in itself be actionable, if a party, consisting of two or more persons, not holding a negotiation licence, does the act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, it will he actionable by reason of the fact that it is so done.  That is being held against people who do not hold a negotiation licence.  What has the Minister in mind?  What none of us is able to find out is what is the long scale of punishment that lies behind this section, even with the 1871 and 1875 provisions taken out?  It strikes me that what the Minister had in mind last night in connection with Deputy McGilligan's comments was the suggestion that 1871 was a long time ago and that 1875 was a long time ago and that he does not want to appear to be taking from people rights which they got in 1871 and 1875, but it does not sound so badly when you come to 1906.  If Deputies consider what is being granted by the Minister <Col N="201" /> under his withdrawal and what is still being retained, they will have difficulty in ascertaining that anything is left. Section 2 of the 1900 Act says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for one or more persons, acting on their behalf or on behalf or a trade union or of an individual employer or firm in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That right is to be withdrawn from people who cannot put up £2,000.  I do not know what the penalties are to be on persons who may be found guilty of peaceful picketing.  Section 3 of the 1900 Act says::&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable on the ground only that it induces some other person to break a contract of employment or that it is an interference with the trade, business, or employment of some other person, or with the right of some other person to dispose of his capital or his labour as he wills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What exactly does the Minister ask us to think he is doing when be removes Section 2 of the Act of 1871 and leaves this other provision in?  Section 2 of the 1871 Act says that the purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful so as to render any member liable to prosecution for conspiracy or otherwise. Here we have an act which is</P>
    <P>&ldquo;an interference with the trade, business or employment of some other person, or with the right of some other person to dispose of his capital or his labour as he wills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am reading there again Section 3 of the 1906 Act and I am asking how does the Minister arrange that he is going to allow a person rights under Section 2 of the Act of 1871 and to deprive <Col N="202" /> him of the rights given under Section 3 of the Act of 1906?</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1906 Act says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An action against a trade union, whether of workmen or of masters or against any members or officials thereof, on behalf of themselves and all other members of the trade union in respect of any tortious act, alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the trade union shall not be entertained by any court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A group without a negotiation licence is going to be deprived of that protection.  The Minister has not been quite as explicit or quite as frank with the House as he might have been, considering that he has stated that he was impressed with the arguments put up. We should like to have from the Minister a schedule of the punishments that lie at the back of this section.  I have said that it deprives persons who are trade unionists, but who have not a negotiation licence, of the rights of protection they get under the Trade Disputes Act.  We ought to know what punishments we are laying up in store for these organisations throughout the country as the Minister, by implication, confesses that he does not know what is going to be done about them &mdash; the Tipperary Workers' Organisation, the Dundalk Workers' Organisation and the road workers even.  If the Minister has been persuaded by the speeches made by Deputy McGilligan last night and by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Esmonde to-day, let us see the nature of his conviction.</P>
    <P>To my mind, looking at the terms of the three Acts to which I have referred, the fact that the Minister is deleting the references to Section 2 of the Act of 1875 and Section 3 of the Act of 1871 is no contribution in any way to the appeasement of the situation so long as persons who do not hold a negotiation licence are being deprived of the benefits and the rights of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906.  I think the Minister ought to take the House frankly into his confidence and if he still persists in his attitude, as regards the Trade Disputes Act he should tell the House what are the penalties that are <Col N="203" /> involved by retaining the reference to that Act in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that he was so impressed with certain arguments which he had heard in connection with this matter that he proposes to delete, at a later stage, the references to Section 2 of the Trade Union Act of 1871 and Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, but he is taking very good care to leave in the reference to the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  The effect of doing that is to deprive a union which has not a negotiation licence, that is an excepted organisation, from the enjoyment of the natural rights to withdraw its labour, to deny it the right to withhold its labour if it is not paid a decent price for that labour.  Every Papal Encyclical, every tenet of Catholic thought has expressed itself on the side of the right of the worker to withdraw his labour and of not being put in the position of being forced to sell his labour at any price the employer may choose to pay.  Under the section as it stands, the Minister is still preventing trade unions from enjoying the rights which are set out in the Trade Disputes Act of 1906.  It is important that the House should know what, in fact, the unions will lose under Section 10. It might be no harm, therefore, to quote the terms of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 because that particular Act is a vital charter so far as trade unions are concerned, a charter of which they are going to be deprived by Section 10 of this Bill as it now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a long time since 1906.  In 1906 there was an agitation in this country which did not give the British Government much credit for any enlightened view in respect of conceptions, or high standards, of freedom.  Although it is 35 years since the British Parliament passed that measure, and although we might very rightly claim, after the lapse of the intervening period, to have leached a somewhat better standard and a better conception of freedom and liberty, particularly for the masses of the people, yet we deliberately in this section set out to go back Beyond the period of 1906.  In fact, what we are <Col N="204" /> really doing is going back to 1825, before the repeal of the anti-combination laws.  That is what is proposed by this enlightened Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; to put the workers of the country back to the period of 1825. That is the Fianna Fáil conception of progress &mdash; back to 1825.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the House should know what in fact the 1906 Act gave to trade unions.  In that year an alien Government enacted this Act. It said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The following paragraph shall be added as a new paragraph after the first paragraph of Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;An act done in pursuance of an agreement or combination by two or more persons shall, it done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, not be actionable unless the act, if done without any such agreement or combination, would be actionable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for peaceful picketing in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall be lawful for one or more persons, acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union or of an individual employer or firm in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.</P>
    <P>(2)  Section seven of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, is hereby repealed from attending at or near to the end of the section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 3 relates to the removal of liability for interfering with another person's business, etc.  It provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" />&ldquo;An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not he actionable on the ground only that it induces some other person to break a contract of employment or that it is an inter ference with a trade, business, or employment of some other person, or with the right of some other person to dispose of his capital or ins labour as he wills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4 prohibits actions of tort against trade unions in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An action against a trade union whether of workmen or of masters, or against any members or officials thereof on behalf of themselves and all other members of the trade union in respect of any tortious act alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the trade unions, shall not he entertained by any court.</P>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall affect the liability of the trustees of a trade union to be sued in the events provided for by the Trade Union Act, 1871, section nine, except in respect of any tortious act committed by or on behalf of the union in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 5 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  This Act may be cited as the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, and the Trade Union Acts, 1871 and 1876, and this Act may be cited together as the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1906.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this Act the expression &lsquo;trade union&rsquo; has the same meaning as in the Trade Union Acts, 1871 and 1876, and shall include any combination as therein defined, notwithstanding that such combination may be the branch of a trade union.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this Act and in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, the expression `trade dispute' means any dispute between employers and workmen, or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non-employment, or the terms of the employment, or with the conditions  of labour, of any person, and the expression `workmen' means all perons employed in trade or industry, whether or not in the employment <Col N="206" /> of the employer with whom a trade dispute arises: and, in section three of the last mentioned Act, the words between `employers and workmen' shall he repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was generally regarded as a very valuable piece of legislation from the point of view of the trade unions.  It gave them a new status, a new strength, a new dignity before the law, and carried on the general process of not regarding their beneficial activities as conspiratorial activities, such as were contemplated by earlier conspiracy Acts.  Nobody in the country in which this legislation was passed would dream to-day of impeding unions in the enjoyment of the rights conshrined in that Act, but in this country in a Bill which is falsely represented as a Bill to assist and encourage trade unionism a section is embodied to deprive workers who do not hold a negotiation licence of the enjoyment of the rights which were given them 35 years ago by an alien Assembly.</P>
    <P>Let us see what can happen under this Bill.  A house union may exist. An employer may insist on encouraging the establishment of a house union and may say that it is a condition of employment in his establishment that the staff must be members of that house union, which will be his own creature. The employer &mdash; and he may well be an alien employer from Whitechapel, Poland or some other place &mdash; may say to the workers: &ldquo;I propose to reduce your wages by 10/- per week.&rdquo;  The wages may be already low, but the employer may come along unscrupulously and reduce them by 10/- per week.  The employees in his house union may protest against an already low wage being made still lower, but they cannot go on strike.  They may stay at home, if they like, and, so far, under this Bill they cannot be compelled to work for that man.  They cannot be dragooned into his employment.  They can stay at home and they can be hungry.  The State will deprive them of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, of course, on the ground that they left their employment, but they cannot picket that man's premises. They cannot say to the Irish people: <Col N="207" />&ldquo; This alien employer, who enjoys a substantial tariff from this Government, has reduced our wages by 10/-per week and we are now paid much lower wages than are paid by his competitors in the same industry.&rdquo; They will not be allowed to say that to anybody outside, nor will they be allowed to carry a simple placard saying: &ldquo;This boss has reduced our wages by 10/- per week.&rdquo; If they do that, they are guilty of an offence and are liable to prosecution under the ordinary common law.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing under this section is protecting every unscrupulous employer who may have a house union in his pocket and preventing the employees of that employer from ever going on strike, no matter how unfairly they may be treated, or by how much the employer reduces their wages.  That may he done in the interests of an unscrupulous type of employer who has come into this country in recent years, the type of employer who does not accept some of the practices which, I am glad to say, are recognised by the best-class Irish employers. Under this section, it would be an offence for the employees of such an employer to go on strike.  They are prohibited from doing so and all the advantages of the 1906 Act are taken from them.  I should like to find out from the Minister why he insists on jumping into the ring on behalf of the bosses.  I do not think it is even his job to keep the ring.  Unless the Constitution is a greater humbug than I think it is, I think the function of the Minister of Industry and Commerce, under Article 45, is to come in on behalf of the weaker sections, to stand behind them and to prevent their position and their economic needs being exploited by a stronger class.  I do not think his function is merely to keep the ring, but to be in on the side of the workers, helping them in every possible way and endeavouring to raise their standard of living in every possible way.  The Minister, however, does not propose to do that under this section. He does not even propose to keen the ring.  He has come into the ring on this occasion on the side of the bosses, and <Col N="208" /> he is preventing the employees of such an employer from going on strike, no matter in what rascally way these employees may be treated by the unscrupulous employer.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us why it is necessary for him to line up with the bosses?  Will the members of the Fianna Fáil Party tell us why it is necessary for them to line up with the bosses, because every vote for Section 10 is a vote for lining up with the bosses against the workers, for depriving the workers of their weapon of the strike and peaceful picketing?  Will Deputy Cormac Breathnach tell us why he will go into the Division Lobby in support of Section 10 to allow an unscrupulous alien employer to sweat Irish workers, and to prevent Irish workers from telling the Irish people that that unscrupulous alien employer will not pay decent rates of wages?  The workers of Dublin are entitled to know why Deputy Breathnach wants to line up with the bosses, even if his own boss, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, wants to do so.</P>

      <P>Now, the point is this.  As the intention of the Minister now is before us, a number of workers, one or more, may withdraw their labour; in other words, may strike or agree to strike, and they are perfectly legal in doing so, but they have no right to discuss with their employer why they are striking or trying to prevent a strike.  Anything more absurd than that, I cannot well imagine.</P>

      <P>We are somewhat under a difficulty in dealing with this because of the Minister's silence, and I am going to look for some information, although whether I shall get it or not I do not know.  The Minister, apparently, holds a different view, in so far as he has given any view in regard to anything, in the House, as to what this section will mean if it becomes law.  I want to put the following case to the Minister.  Some years ago, there was a strike in a certain town in my <Col N="210" /> constituency It was a very bitter strike, and by &ldquo; bitter&rdquo; I mean as between the employers and the employees.  It was a big creamery strike.  It went on for eight or nine weeks, and as the strike went on, feelings became more bitter and it led to assaults on the workers by some of the farmers and to retaliation by the workers in attacking the farmers and spilling the milk and the contents of the tankards on the roads.  Several efforts, I understand, were made to settle that strike.  Ultimately, I was asked by some of the workers to see if I could do anything to bring about a settlement, and although I was not connected with a trade union &mdash; I was pot even a member of the Labour Party at the time &mdash; after some negotiations and some travelling to-and-fro between the creamery committee and the workers concerned.  I succeeded in having a settlement that was acceptable to both sides.  If that position were to arrive to-morrow, would I, or any other person in my position. approached by either one side or the other to bring about a settlement in that type of dispute, be committing an offence?  It seems to me that I would.</P>

One finds it difficult to understand whether his silence or his speech was the more harmful.  I am putting the point and putting the case to the Minister because he has failed to do his job.  It is his duty, when introducing a Bill, or putting a Bill through this House in Committee, to introduce each section to the House and explain the effect of each section to the House. Will he tell us how many members of this House, he thinks, have gone to the trouble of reading up the Act of 1871, the Act of 1875, and the Act of 19061 We would not be troubled with Section 10 if the Minister understood what it means.  I shall go so far as to credit him with this, that I do not think we would be troubled with Section 10, much less the Bill itself, if the Minister had the faintest idea of what is going to flow from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, a moment ago, pointed out one of the absurd positions that are going to arise.  There are an <Col N="213" /> employer and an employee in a house union formed by the employer himself. They cannot negotiate.  The Minister again s that they can strike, and the main purpose of this Bill, so far as it has a purpose at all, according to the Minister, is to reduce industrial unrest and strikes.  One of the effects of this section, if carried, we are told, will be that an employer cannot discuss with his employees why their hours should ho lengthened or why their wages should be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible, Sir, to discuss this section without referenrcs to Section.  The Minister himself, when he intervened for a few moments on this section, discussed lection 6.  On this very section, he discussed Section 6.  As a matter of fact, his words applied far more to Section 6 than to Section 10.  The only reference he made to Section 10 was that, having been convinced by speeches made by Deputy McGilligan and others that it would not be wise to leave in the 1871 and 1875 provisions, he is taking them out, but he did not utter one word to this House as to why he is going to retain the Act of 1906. Notwithstanding the fact that Deputies Mulcahy and Norton have quoted particular sections of it, practically the Act itself, the Minister yet does not think it worth his while to make any reference to it.  Then, when we endeavour to extract information from the Minister, so as to enable the House to come to an intelligent decision on-this matter, he immediately tries to stop discussion by raising frivolous points of order.  The Minister is very anxious to restrict the debate to Section 10.  Now, you can have a Bill introduced to this House and there might be ninety sections in it, but the whole Bill can very well be in one section. The Minister, in the course of his few words on this section, also said that the main point made against this Bill on Second Reading was on Section 6.  That is not so.  Important and all as Section 6 is, that was not the main point of the debate.  The fact is <Col N="214" /> that the whole volume of opposition in this House to this Bill was to the Bill as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister, apparently, does not himself understand this Bill.  He certainly does not understand the implications of the Bill.  Apparently he has no idea whatever of what is going to flow from the passage of the Bill into law because, if he understood the Bill, he would not now be trying to trip me up on this section on the point that I have made certain references to what is contained in Section 6.  He would not speak on this particular section himself without speaking on Section 6.  I would like the Minister and the House to realise that this is a very important. Bill &mdash; I said this on Second Reading&mdash; probably the most important Bill that has come before this House for a number of years, and this is a very important section of the Bill.  I only hope and pray, as I said before, that when this Bill becomes law, if it does become law, and is put into force the Minister and the Government may not find themselves faced with a far greater problem than they had to deal with before they set out to wipe out any union in this country &mdash; the road union, the town union, or the village union&mdash; any union that cannot put up £2,000 at least.  That is Section 10 in a nutshell.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey was seeking guidance on a point as to what would happen to a negotiator who was trying to do something in the interests of industrial peace, individually.  He was not conceded that information.  He was told, practically, that he was dealing with Section 6 when he should be confining himself to Section 10.  I consider Section 10 is no more and no less than the penalty clause for offences under Section 6.  I referred on the Second Reading of this Bill to a very important and useful section of the community who have been doing very good work, unostentatiously, and who are going to be put out of action.  I want to ask the same question in regard to these people as Deputy Morrissey has asked in regard to the individual.  What will become of or what will be the penalty on a trades council who try to offer their good <Col N="215" /> offices to settle a dispute between employer and employee?  Under this section they have no right.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that this section and its contemporary.  Section 6, is striking at a very vital function and there is nothing being put back in its place for the maintenance of industrial harmony in the country.  The Minister does not seem to give any attention to that point.  I have spoken of my own experience in my own city and I know it happens in other cities and towns where these bodies of workers who are affiliated from respective unions come together.  They go over to the employers and the employees to try to produce settlements of disputes that are pending or in embryo stages.  In many cases they have been able to settle disputes&mdash;in fact in most cases&mdash;before the intervention of the Minister's official was called for.  Where the local efforts have failed it has been the practice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; and the present Minister's predecessor, notably &mdash; to send some of his officials through the country &mdash; which took a lot of their time &mdash; trying to bring about settlements of industrial disputes.  I suggest, if it had not been for the good action and offices of the local trades councils you would have a whole-time staff of the Minister's officials doing this job.  If the Minister will tell me that the trades councils can still carry <Col N="216" /> on their functions, I will sit down immediately as far as this is concerned.</P>

      <P>In this discussion there has been a certain amount of confusion because of irrelevancies introduced by the Minister, and perhaps others, and I think it would be well to endeavour to focus the attention of the House on the real position which arises under Section 10.  Members of the House know that there are two distinct and separate types of unions recognised under this Bill &mdash; unions possessed of negotiation licences, and other unions not so possessed.  The view has been expressed, and the Minister has not met it in any way, that unions not possessed of negotiation licences will be seriously harassed and affected, as well as any other people coming to their assistance, if they seek to indulge in negotiations, or in the action following disputes which has been hitherto the legitimate privilege of any trade union.  Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1871, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The purposes of any trade union <Col N="219" /> shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful so as to render any member of such trade union liable to criminal prosecution for conspiracy or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That privilege has been withdrawn. That privilege will definitely be withdrawn from certain trade unions in this country.  The Minister says that is not so.  I would ask the Minister to show us in this measure any provision of kind that safeguards people in the position I have mentioned.  The Minister takes refuge in the fact that there are certain excepted bodies.  Will the Minister show us any portion of the measure that covers the excepted bodies?  The teachers in this country some time ago found it necessary to organise a one-day strike.  The teachers are an excepted body.  If they resort to action of that kind in the future will they be permitted under this measure to do it or will they be subject to the penalties provided in this Bill?  The Minister's policy in this whole matter has simply gone mad; even now, the Minister would do something to mitigate the feeling of hostility which this whole measure has aroused if he would endeavour to face up to the particularly dangerous parts of this measure which have provoked a great ideal of that hostility.  I want the Minister to make some reasonable contribution to the discussion on this particular matter, and to point out how he thinks that certain trade unions in this position, and their agents and assistants, will not be subject to the penalties that were provided as far back as the time when the anti-combination laws were repealed, I think, in 1825.</P>
    <P>Surely if is about time that a harking back to a situation of that kind was entirely forgotten.  Surely it is time that the Minister should adopt a more progressive viewpoint and outlook in regard to this whole measure than the viewpoint which was given effect to in the situation which arose when the anti-combination laws were repealed.  The Minister's whole attitude in relation to this section and <Col N="220" /> other sections has been anything but helpful to the conduct of an orderly discussion on the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the Deputy correctly, I think he is under a misapprehension.  I have already indicated to the House that I propose to bring in an amendment which will delete the reference to Section 2 of the Act of 1871, and to Section 3 of the Act of 1875, but as far as the Act of 1906 is concerned, it must remain.  It must remain for this reason, that I do not intend that anything in this Bill should encourage the formation of house unions.  It has been stated that paragraph (3) (a) of Section 6 of the Bill would encourage the formation of such unions.  That was never the intention. That was deliberately not the intention when the Bill was being drafted, and Section 10 is in here, not for the purpose of depriving trade unions, authorised trade unions, of the rights and privileges which they enjoy under the Act of 1906, but to confirm them in those rights and in those privileges, and to confine those rights and privileges to authorised trade unions only.  I cannot see how, in the light of that, any Deputy could, with a full cognisance of what he was saying, allege, as Deputy Norton alleged, that this Bill, and this section particularly, was directed against trade unions.</P>
      <P>The next point with which I want to deal is this: It has been suggested here that if an employer and his workmen have a difference in relation to wages or conditions of employment, that employer and his workmen cannot negotiate.  As far as the Bill stands at the present moment, paragraph (3) (a) of Section 6 is definitely put in to preserve that right to an employer and his employees to negotiate with each other. Therefore, the suggestion which has been made here that if men go out on strike they and their employer cannot get together to settle the strike is without any solid foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point, which has been made by Deputy Davin, indicates what has so often transpired during the course of this debate &mdash; that some of the <Col N="221" /> people who are criticising this Bill have not read it and do not understand it. Deputy Davin made the suggestion that, under paragraph (c) &mdash; which recites that an excepted body means any organisation of teachers recognised by the Minister for Education &mdash; the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, being presumably a body which would be recognised by the Minister for Education, would be an excepted body under the Act.  Of course it would be an excepted body under the Act.  All that means is that, in order to discuss wage's and conditions of employment with their employers and with the Minister, it is not necessary for that National Teachers' Organisation to register itself as a trade union and pay the necessary deposit.  That is, if it wishes to conduct these negotiations and if its sole object is to conduct negotiations and try to yet a peaceful settlement of differences of opinion in relation to wages and conditions of employment. If, however, the National Teachers' Organisation wishes to go further&mdash; whether it would be judicious for it to do so or not is another matter &mdash; and to secure for itself all the rights of authorised trade unions under Section 10, there is nothing in this Bill which would prevent the National Teachers' Organisation registering itself as a trade union, making the necessary deposit and securing a negotiation licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that it is possible for the excepted bodies under Section 6 (3) to escape being excepted bodies by making a deposit of £2,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>All the section says is that it shall not be lawful for any body of persons, not being an excepted body, to carry on such negotiations.  It would be lawful for an excepted body to carry on negotiations, but if excepted bodies wish to convert themselves into authorised trade unions&mdash; and their character lends itself to that conversion &mdash; there is nothing in this Bill to prevent them from securing a negotiation licence as such.  In fact, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation is registered already as a trade union.  As a trade union, the only <Col N="222" /> thing that is necessary for that body, in order to secure a negotiation licence and secure, if it wishes, the particular privileges of Section 10, is to make the necessary deposit.</P>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Davin&mdash;who has been so voluble here in discussing this section&mdash;had not adverted to that fact, and alleged that the National Teachers' Organisation would be affected by Section 10.  A number of questions arising out of that were put to Deputy Breathnach.  The only thing that was clear from the questions Deputy Davin put was that, as so many other people opposing this Bill have shown, he has not studied nor read the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister was objecting when the Act of 1906 was read.  Whether they can register or not as organised trade unions is beside the point.  The fact of the matter is that under Section 10 we are withdrawing from certain organisations the right to the protection which is afforded them under the Trade Disputes Act of 1906. Under that Act it is possible for a trade union organisation &mdash; which means it is possible for any seven people &mdash; to withdraw <Col N="223" /> the labour of their members and to picket the premises of an employer, alien or native, who is paying low wages or enforcing bad conditions of labour.  It is possible for them to picket that employer's premises in furtherance of a trade dispute which is caused by the action of that employer in reducing the rates of wages paid to such workers.  Under Section 10, if that organisation in future happens to be an organisation catering for workers employed by the same employer, that organisation cannot picket the premises of that employer and it has none of the protection afforded by the Trade Disputes Act.</P>
      <P>Let us take an example.  Suppose, for instance, that all the employees of the Sugar Company decided to establish a sugar workers' union and the Sugar Company decided that it was necessary, in order to secure employment with the company, that the employees should be members of this sugar workers' union.  In that case it would be a house union and would not be required to put down £2,000 deposit. They could carry on negotiations and do the things other old organisations-which have been in existence for 150 years &mdash; will not be allowed to do under this Bill unless they pay the ransom of £2,000.  The sugar workers' union might negotiate with the directors of the Sugar Board, but if they quarrelled with the directors of the Sugar Company and withdrew the labour of their members, on that day they could not picket.  They might stay at home, or go to the labour exchange to be refused unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance.  They could not picket the premises of the Sugar Company and could not proclaim to the community what the strike was about, nor could they carry any banners indicating that a strike was in operation at any of the various sugar factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> That protection is not now being afforded to a union of that kind under this Bill.  The Minister is encouraging the formation of house unions in order to exempt them from the payment of £2,000 and, in addition, having so exempted them, he is preventing them from using against an employer the same type of weapon which a union which paid a deposit can use against an employer.  This section is, I think, completely unconstitutional &mdash; apart from the fact that it is a perfectly unscrupulous section, and a dastardly section so far as organisation is concerned. The whole purpose is to give the boss a better chance to win.</P>
    <P>Article 40 of the Constitution provides that all citizens, as human beings, are held equal before the law. The provision of Section 10 of this Bill deprives citizens who happen to be members of a trade union which does not hold a negotiation licence from enjoying the protection which they got from the law under the 1906 Act.  That seems to be class legislation of the worst kind.  It is not only class biassed against the workers but class biassed towards the employer.  There is no reason whatever for the insertion of Section 10 unless the real purpose of the Bill is &mdash; as I believe it is &mdash; to weaken the trade union movement and to make it easier for the Minister and the Government to get over Emergency Powers Order No. 83.  The mailed fist behind this Bill is in Section 10, and the whole purpose of the section is to weaken the unions.  I charge the Government again, and those who will vote for Section 10, that that is being done in the interests of the employers and done in a way that will be used by employers who originally probably came from Whitechapel or Poland.  It is being done against the Irish workers.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever and so long as any authorised trade union registered under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, is the holder of a negotiation licence, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c)  such trade union shall keep at its office such register of members open free of charge for public inspection during ordinary business hours, and</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 not moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 5, to delete in line 40 the words &ldquo;free of charge for public inspection&rdquo; and to insert in line 41 before the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for inspection by any person having a <i>bona fide</i> interest therein and paying such fee not exceeding five shillings as such trade union determines&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 imposes on a registered trade union which holds a negotiation licence the obligation to specify the conditions as to the entry into and cesser of membership of the union. There is a further obligation on the trade union to maintain at its office a <Col N="227" /> register of its members which shall show for each union the name and address of each member, the date and commencement of his membership, and, where the membership has ceased, the date of the cesser and whether the membership has ceased by reason of death, resignation, suspension or expulsion, together with the date of the order directing such suspension or expulsion, and a reference to the authorising rule.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) also provides that the union shall keep at its office such register of members open free of charge for public inspection during ordinary business hours under conditions set out in the original text of the Bill.  It has been represented to me that there is a possibility that the very open conditions set out in the text of the Bill as introduced &mdash; that is to say, that the register should be open free of charge for public inspection during ordinary business hours &mdash; might be vexatiously used and to avoid that I propose to delete the words &ldquo;free of charge for public inspection&rdquo; and insert before the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for inspection by any person having a <i>bona fide</i> interest therein, and paying such fee not exceeding five shillings as such trade union determines&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A rather unusual procedure has been adopted in connection with this section.  It has not been thought desirable, in any of the Trade Union Acts during the last 70 years, to put in a provision to the effect that any member of the public can walk into a trade union office and inspect the register of members of the union.  The legislators of the past have apparently rightly taken the view that that is not a matter that concerns the general public, and they have rightly omitted any provision whereby any mischief-maker or busybody could say: &ldquo;Produce the register; I want to see who is in the organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One indication of the thoughtless manner in which this Bill was prepared, or perhaps I might say the wilfully malicious manner in which it was prepared, is that the Minister, in the early text of the Bill, put in a provision <Col N="228" /> that any Tom, Dick or Harry could go to a union headquarters and say: &ldquo;Produce the register; I want to see who is in the organisation,&rdquo; and he could go into the office on the 1st January and keep going day after day until the 31st December of the same year and maul and paw the registers every day when the offices were open, and he would be entitled to remain in the office all day merely for the purpose of looking at the register.  One can easily imagine the manner in which a right of that kind could be abused.  It still can be abused under this section, even though the unions are entitled to charge a fee of 5/-.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the provision made here is very indefinite.  &ldquo;Any person having a <i>bona fide</i> interest therein&rdquo;&mdash; what is a <i>bona fide</i> interest in a register? Obviously you have to indicate what <i>bona fide</i> means in that context. I might have a genuine interest in ascertaining whether a particular person was a member of an organisation, whether, in fact, he was a trade unionist.  Is that a <i>bona fide</i> interest? If I am an employer and I want to find out whether John Murphy is a member of a trade union, am I entitled to go to a union office and have a look at the register and, when I am there, can I ascertain what other people are members of the trade union?  The description <i>bona fide</i> seems to me to give rise to all kinds of doubts in the matter.</P>
    <P>This whole procedure seems rather strange.  No provision of this kind has been made in any of our Trade Union Acts so far.  No such provision has been made in respect to friendly societies or public companies.  The long-standing practice has been to allow a person interested in the funds to inspect the register; in other words, a parson who is a genuine member of the organisation, who created the organisation and who helps to maintain it should be afforded all reasonable facilities.  In this measure it is possible for a boss to come in and ascertain who is on the register, when a certain person went on the register and how long his name has been there.  I regard it as a most inquisitive power to give to anybody other than a person who is genuinely a member of an <Col N="229" /> organisation and who is interested in its welfare.  Under this Bill any busybody engaged in any type of sabotaging operation can, merely by paying 5/-, do damage, so far as a union is concerned, which would not be covered by the payment of the fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister the nature of the representations made to him and the source from which this suggestion came.  It would seem that for the payment of a fee of 5/-, some person, with qualifications approved by the Minister, can stay in a trade union office, the office of one of the biggest affiliated unions in the country, every day of the year for the purpose of inspecting the register.  There are some unions affiliated with the Irish Trade Union Congress having a membership of 70,000 or 80,000.  Some unions have a membership ranging from 25,000 to 70,000.  One of these gentlemen that the Minister has in mind can pay a fee of 5/-, and he can come into the office on the 1st January and go day after day until the 3lst December of the same year, and inspect the register of the trade union, thus causing considerable inconvenience and irritation to those who have to work in the office.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in all his speeches during the period of emergency, repeats in gramophone fashion that every individual is called upon to make equal sacrifices and to suffer some inconvenience.  Is he going to apply the ridiculous procedure contained in Section 11 to every society that exists?  What is the idea behind this section?  Did the suggestion come from a certain type of employer, who wants to have the right to send his spotters or his spies, if you like to call them that, to examine the register of unions catering for members working on his premises, or is it for the purpose of giving the police authorities access to the registers of affiliated unions?  If that is going to apply to every society, with the good will of the Minister, there might be something to be considered, but this is a special regulation, and it is brought in in these days of progress, to apply only to unions that will exist under the Bill, if and when it becomes law, or if and when it is recognised as the law by the unions that will exist after it is passed. We are entitled to some information as to what is at the back of this proposal, and whether the fee of 5/- will cover the right of some person authorised by the Minister to go into the office of a trade union on the 1st January and to remain there until 3lst December of the same year.</P>

      <P>The principle in this section is one that has been fiercely resisted for many years.  I want to know what is the object of this system of prying into the affairs of trade unions.  The Minister referred to a certain amendment.  Why does he think it necessary for trade unions to keep registers of members?  What purpose can that serve?  What is the advantage to anybody concerned?  Like Deputy Norton, I am uneasy about the reference to &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;.  Under the licensing laws the term &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; is one that has caused endless trouble.  I do not see how the Minister <Col N="231" /> can gain anything very substantial by the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;.  It may be news to the Minister but, in regard to one of the biggest unions, no register of members has ever been kept at headquarters.  Membership is measured in accordance with the contributions received from the various branches. That is the barometer of membership. Why will the Minister increase the hatred and hostility to the measure by having a section couched in such unfortunate terms?  This section gives very good ground for the belief that, like many of the other sections, the object is provocative.  I strongly protest against this section.  I think it is intolerable that it should be put into any Bill.  It comes very badly from a Minister who was once a revolutionary and also a poet.</P>

I urge the Minister to define <i>bona fide.</i>  Suppose that a complete stranger wishes to avail of the wording of the sub-section, he has no right until he has paid 5/-, and then he has no right if he has not <i>bona fide</i> interest. I can see considerable disputes about that.  In the first place, the payment of 5/- may be refused on the ground that the person tendering has not <i>bona fide</i> interest, while if the 5/- is accepted his right may be disputed on the same ground, that he has not a <i>bona fide</i> right.  The wording will give rise to a considerable amount of litigation if the unions in question care to question it. It might lead to a question of trespass or to a breach of the peace.  The position could be cleared up if a definition were inserted concerning what is meant by a person having a <i>bona fide</i> interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Esmonde has put his finger on the heart of the amendment.  It is designed to ensure that only a person who really has a right, because he has a genuine interest in the affairs of a <Col N="232" /> union or is genuinely affected, will, endeavour to inspect the register. Naturally the onus rests upon him, and having applied, if inspection is refused, he has to satisfy the court that he has a <i>bona fide</i> interest.  The matter would arise perhaps in this way, that under Section 21 of the Bill the tribunal may grant a determination to the effect that a particular trade union shall alone have the right to organise workmen of that class, or it may happen under another section that such a right may be granted to two or more unions.  If it happens that such unions have reason to believe that the determination of the tribunal is not being observed by a certain union, then the unions to whom determination was granted, will have the right to ask for inspection of the register of members of the trade union which is not honouring the determination of the tribunal. That is one of the principal objects the section hopes to secure, by having these registers open for inspection.  I take it that the unions whose registers of members it is desired to inspect will naturally consider, when a person tenders 5/-, the basis upon which he claims to have a <i>bona fide</i> interest, and decide whether or not it is desirable to allow the register to be inspected. If they refuse, the person affected by refusal, if the matter is of such importance, has a right to go elsewhere to secure, if he can, a declaration that he has a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the union.</P>

The only people excluded are those who ceased to be members before the negotiation licence was granted.

      <P>If a man was a member I understand his name must be kept on the register.  The section says &ldquo;including former members&rdquo;.  It does not say people in the land of the living but those who were at any time members.  That register is going to give some difficulty to keep after years have elapsed and, as far as I know, these registers are not kept in alphabetical order.  A person looking for a name might have to spend hours going through thousands of names.</P>

    <P>We had the point of view put forward that, once a man pays a fee of 5/- and has a <i>bona fide</i> right of entrance to the office, he can remain there until the office is closed for the day, and come back again the next day. Companies have been referred to, but it surely does not occur to anybody that anyone is going to have such an interest in the business of a company as to remain on the premises all day. With regard to the ordinary management of companies, that sort of procedure <Col N="234" /> is hardly likely to obtain very often, but it might in the circumstances in which the Minister has placed the background of all this business.  I learn from a speech made by another Deputy that the procedure under trade union rules up to date is that a person who has an interest in the funds of a society has the right to inspect.  What other purpose does the Minister want to serve by this?</P>

      <P>Exactly.  But surely all these categories could be arranged for by set phrases.  I think the Minister would be well advised to go some distance to allay the suspicion that continues to grow up around this Bill. A list of well defined classes could be prepared, and provision might be made for any person duly authorised by the Minister.  That would mean that the Minister would have to decide, before giving his authorisation, whether in his opinion such a person could be said to have an interest in the funds.</P>

I would have my suspicions deepened if the Minister refused to take on the invidious task of deciding whether people who might apply to him for the right to inspect had or had not in his <Col N="235" /> opinion a <i>bona fide</i> interest in doing so.  What the Minister has said seems to indicate to me that he feels there will be a lot of people he would feel bound to refuse, or, alternatively, that there will be a lot of people he would like to give the right to inspect to, but would not like to have to answer for here.  I suggest that there should be categories of people set out, with an overriding provision to the effect that such other persons as produce a warrant from the Minister will be duly authorised to inspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what was in the minds of the drafters of this Bill when they came to draft certain portions of this section.  There are some rather unusual innovations in it.  Under paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) the obligation is put on the holders of a negotiation licence to maintain at their offices registers of members, including former members other than those whose membership ceased before the grant of such negotiation licences, and these registers are to show a variety of things.  What the trade unions will be required to do under this provision is to create, where they had not already done so, a central head office register. They will have to keep it and make it available for inspection from time, to time to those folk who are supposed to have a <i>bona fide</i> interest in examining it, even though a person may have ceased to be a member for 20, 30 or 40 years after the passing of this Act, and even though a member is dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>For 40 years after his death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Suppose this measure ever passes and is ever implemented; suppose anyone takes any notice of it after it is passed, and suppose some organisation does create a register: suppose all these things are, in fact, done, then the union will keep a record of its members.  A member <Col N="236" /> may die next month.  Forty years hence the union will have to keep a record of that member, even though he is dead and even though every other relative of his may have long since followed him into eternity.  What purpose is it hoped to serve by insisting on a union keeping a record of members who have mouldered into dust?  I should like to hear someone tell me what is the reason for asking a union to keep a list of dead men?  That would seem to be the function of the registrar of deaths.  As I have said, these are most unusual innovations so far as trade union records are concerned.</P>
      <P>Under paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) it is provided that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who ceases to be a member of such trade union shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to continue to be a member thereof for one month after such cessor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that a member of a union who has been expelled, or a member who has resigned, is deemed to be a member one month after his expulsion or resignation. A member who has died is to be deemed to be a member one month after he has been buried.  That is a provision which has all the appearance of having been drafted in Grangegorman. What is the purpose of deeming a person to be a member one month after he has ceased to be a member? Would the Minister for Industry and Commerce like to have this position: that an expelled member of his Party would be entitled to turn up to the weekly Party meeting, and be deemed to be a member of it for a month after his expulsion?  Suppose a member of the Minister's Party died, would the Minister like, for the purposes of his membership of the Party and of this House, that he should still be deemed to be a member of both the Party and the House for a month after he had left this earth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another case.  A carpenter, say, is a member of a union.  On the 1st January he decides to open business on his own account and becomes an employer. On that date he automatically ceased to be a member of his trade union and became an employer and a member of an employers' organisation. <Col N="237" /> For the purposes of this section, although not eligible to be a member of a trade union according to its rules, that union must carry that gentleman on its books and accept responsibility, presumably, for his actions, even though he is now an employer and not a worker.  This Bill deals with the organisatiun of workmen.  It acknowledges that people must organise in classes of workmen and in classes of employers.  Before I say anything more on this unusual provision I should like the Minister to tell us in what set of circumstances it is necessary to deem folk of that kind to be members of a union long after they have left the union.  Why is it necessary to keep a record of members long after they have ceased to be members or even ceased to live?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of misunderstanding about the purposes of this section, and some very fanciful visions have manifested themselves in regard to the effect of it. I take it that the register of a trade union is a continuing document in which a name once inscribed remains. If a person ceases to be a member, his name may either be struck out or entered upon some other register as having ceased his membership.  The register itself would form part of the archives of the trade union, and as, from day to day, members died or otherwise ceased their membership, the register would preserve evidence that they had been members of the union. If it is felt that that interpretation might not be placed upon the provision as it stands, it is open to us to provide that the union may, after five or ten years, replace the register by a revised register of existing members, brought up to date.  I cannot see what objection there can be to a union allowing the register to exist in this form as evidence of past membership of the union.</P>

      <P>It is essential, in view of the special position in which authorised trade unions are being <Col N="238" /> placed under this Bill, and in view of the great power which trade unions now exercise in our industrial life, determining, very often, whether a man is to be entitled to employment or not, that there should be clear evidence as to whether a person is or is not a member of a union.  If, for instance, a strike takes place because it is alleged that a person is not a member of a union, we want to ensure under this Bill that that question can be settled, beyond yea or nay, by the production of documentary evidence.  It is essential we should do that, because, as I have said, this Bill, so far from doing anything to injure the trade union movement, as has been alleged very often during this debate, places these authorised trade unions in a very strong position.</P>

      <P>In a strong position. The Deputy, as a true-blue democrat, would not look for privilege even for a trade union.  The unions are placed in that strong position and, therefore, it is essential that there should be a clear and continuing record of men's membership of them.  Not merely that, but provision should be made that, if a person is unjustly expelled from his union and, perhaps, by that expulsion deprived of his right to earn a livelihood in certain occupations, there should be a waiting period during which he should have the right to appeal against such expulsion.  That is the reason why this period of a month is being provided.</P>

      <P>If I had made that reference, I would have been ruled out on a point of order and told that my remarks were not relevant to the section. The question of apprentices does not arise.  The Minister alleges that this provision will give protection to members who are unjustly or harshly treated.  There is nothing in the section to add to the security which members of trade unions have at the present time, so far as unfair treatment in concerned.  They can appeal to the law courts if they are not fairly treated.  The keeping of a man's name on the register, while it is no additional protection to him, is a potential danger to the union.  He may have resigned or been required to resign.  Yet, he is to be deemed to be still a member of the union &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. How is the court to determine the scope of the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;?  How are they to decide that he is a member for one purpose and not a member for other purposes? That man may be driving a vehicle and may knock somebody down, seriously injuring or killing him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister argue that the union is not bound to do all the things, in the way of his defence, that they were bound to do when he was a member? The words &ldquo;for the purposes of <Col N="240" /> this Act&rdquo; would be of little use in enabling the judges to come to a conclusion. The provision is unnecessary and is a potential danger to the unions, while it does not give additional protection to the members.  There is a sinister motive underlying every section of the Bill.  It is thinly veiled, and it seems to me that there is a sinister motive underlying this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put one point in connection with the dead man.  Why is it necessary to insist on a union retaining, for a time, on its register the names of people who were at one time members and who have died?  Not merely are unions bound to keep on the register the names of members and former members, but there is a penalty of £1 per day for every day the offence continues, whether membership ceases by death, expulsion or otherwise. When a member dies, the unions will, I presume, solemnly record that they know the man has died.  The position reminds me of a play in the Abbey in which the brothers of a secret society meet to record, with lamentation, the death of one of their members, eaten alive by four Orangemen.  They record that he was given decent interment inside the four Orangemen.  Are we to have all that entered up under penalty?  In the name of all that is wise and sensible, what is the reason for keeping the register continuously overloaded with the names of persons who were members at one time and died?</P>
      <P>With regard to live people, what ia the reason for saying that for the purposes of the Act a person is to be deemed to be a member for a month after he ceases his membership?  I can understand the point about giving protection against irregular suspension. But the ordinary law deals with that and this provision adds nothing to it. Why, for the purposes of this Act, insist on a man being a member a month after he has been expelled?  Added to that we have the provision that a man is a member a month after he dies.</P>

      <P>I put to the Minister a very definite case and we are entitled to some reasonable answer.  The Minister has been asked to say why it is necessary for instance to keep in the membership of a union for the purposes of this Act a person who desires to leave the union.  That person may say &ldquo;I want to get out&rdquo; and the union may say &ldquo;Go out, we do not want to keep you any longer&rdquo;.  The man does not want to stay and the union does not want to keep him.  Why are we to insist that such a person should remain <Col N="242" /> a member of the union for one month after he has actually left it?</P>
      <P>Take the case of the other man who becomes an employer.  He says: &ldquo;I am not any longer eligible for membership under your rules.  I am now an employer and I give you notice of my resignation from such a date; goodbye&rdquo;, and the union says: &ldquo;All right; we accept your retirement as inevitable in the circumstances.&rdquo;  Yet for the purposes of this section we are insisting that the man should remain in the union for a month after that date.  We are entitled to some explanation for that.</P>

      <P>We cannot draft an Act to cover every hypothetical facet of a situation which may never arise. All we can do is to prescribe in general terms what the position under the law is going to be.  I have pointed out that there is need for making some provision to ensure that cesser of membership of a union will not have effect until a reasonable period has elapsed. The need for that condition arises from the fact that trade unions under this Bill, it is anticipated, will become very strong.  They are already, in fact, so strong that they virtually control the right to secure employment in this country in a number of occupations. It is of vital importance that people who, by reason of the fact that they are members of a trade union, already enjoy this right to employment in certain occupations, should not summarily be deprived of that right by a union claiming to act in accordance with its own rules and that there should be an opportunity afforded them, if necessary, to go to the courts to vindicate their right to membership and their consequent right to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said in that regard that a person aggrieved by being wrongfully dismissed from a trade union has a right to go to court at present.  He has, but he certainly would have a very difficult job to prove his right in the circumstances, as we know them to exist, in the case of some of the bigger trade unions in this country We have heard it admitted to-day in this House that one of the largest does not even <Col N="243" /> maintain a register of its members.  It is accordingly essential, from the point of view of protection of workers in this country, that every authorised trade union should maintain a register of members.  It is vital to the interests of the workers themselves that no person should be wrongfully deprived of membership of such union, bearing in mind the advantages which such membership now confers.  Arising from that, there is certainly need to ensure that if a person is, wrongfully deprived of his membership, nothing will arise to interfere with his right to earn a living, and that the courts, it necessary, shall have the right to review the decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not, but we hope that perhaps trade unions themselves will so reorganise the movement on the basis of this Bill that they will provide domestic machinery for dealing with that situation.  I do not wish to compel any person to enter into litigation with a particular union in order to prove membership, but I do want in this section to make it easier for people who are <i>bona fide</i> members of a trade union and who desire a determination that they have been wrongfully suspended or wrongfully expelled from the union to obtain redress.</P>
      <P>A point has been raised as to why we should maintain a register of dead people.  We do know that in certain trades in this country there is a tendency to restrict apprenticeship and future entry into these trades and their appropriate trade unions to sons and near relatives of men already engaged in them.  I think it of vital importance, if a question at some time or other should arise as to whether a person seeking apprenticeship or admission to these trade unions is a son or a near relative of a deceased member or a former member &mdash; in this case a deceased member &mdash; that that person seeking admission should be able to refer to some existing document by which his claim can be proven or disproven. That is why we are seeking to ensure that the register shall contain the names of former members.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that he is trying to bring into this section certain safeguards.  I am prepared to agree with the Minister's point of view, but there is nothing in the section, from beginning to end, that is going to secure what he wants.  The Minister talks about people in certain trades not being able to secure work unless they are members of a certain trade union, but there is nothing in the section which is going to make the position any better than it is to-day. The Minister also talked about apprentices to certain trades, but there is nothing whatever about apprentices in the section, even if it were passed as it is set out here in the green paper. The Minister, with all respect to him, talked about something which is not <Col N="245" /> in the section at all.  It only confirms me in the point of view I had from the very beginning, that neither the Bill nor its implications are understood by the people who brought it before the House.  It is quite evident that the reactions of the Bill are not understood. The Minister's speech has proven quite clearly that the Bill was conceived in a hurry and was not given the consideration it should have been given, in view of its importance.  The Minister speaks of its being impossible to legislate to cover every detail, and he talked about this month after, during which a person is to be deemed a member, as being of no importance. If not, why is it put in here?  He did not tell us why it was introduced in the first instance.</P>

When one realises that we are facing a piece of legislation which will affect, directly, anything from 400,000 to 500,000 people, one feels that it is certainly entitled to a good deal more consideration than apparently it got before it was introduced, and certainly to much fuller consideration and debate than it is getting.</P>

      <P>I should like to supplement what Deputy Morrissey has said and I invite the Minister's special attention to it.  It is a common experience that, when we get down to a detail of this kind, we find that a very material element in the Bill pivots upon it.  It is quite clear that the case of a deceased member simply did not occur to the Minister when the Bill was being drafted.  We are all familiar with the fact that, when drafting a Bill, it is not possible to anticipate every detail that may arise.  That is one of the purposes of debate in Committee. May I put it to the Minister that there is no startling urgency about this Bill? <Col N="246" /> We all agree that things exist which ought to be put an end to in the trade union movement, and I think trade unionists agree with that.  The issue joined between us is how best to do it.  It is abundantly clear from the discussion on more than one amendment to the Bill that a variety of factors were not present to the Minister's mind.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made, or has attempted to make, one pet point in order in some way to fortify his retention of the provision leaving people to be members for a month after they ceased to be such; that is, he wants to make it easy for a person wrongfully expelled, wrongfully forced to resign or in any way wrongfully excluded from a trade union, to establish his rights.  How does the section make it in the slightest degree easier for him to establish his rights?  If he is put out at the moment, he has resort to the court.  He goes to a court as a person who is expelled.  In the new circumstances, he will go to the court as a person whom the union tried to expel but whom the Minister's Act keeps on as a member, first of all, a month is no good if the Minister is thinking about legal proceedings.  He will not get legal proceedings in a month, and the period ought to be extended very much beyond, the month, but would the Minister tell me one point in which the situation is eased by deeming a man to be a member for a month after the union have attempted to get rid of him?</P>

      <P>This is not so much a question of the legal side of the matter at all, because from the legal point of view the Minister's argument is useless.  I have always found that in these Acts there is a limiting phrase, such as that &ldquo;he shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a member&rdquo;, and I have searched through all the sections here to see where this would have any effect or where it would be linked up, bat I have failed to find it.  I thought that it might be linked up in some way with the matter of the deposits, but evidently it is not.  Now we have two points here.  One is the legal point that he is deemed to be a member for another month in order to ease his situation in getting back.  That is the suggestion, but in my opinion it does not ease his situation in that regard, and I challenge the Minister to give me one point of ease in the man's favour by deeming him to be a member for a month after.  The second point &mdash; I suppose this is the framework to get over this &mdash; is that a union will say that their men will not work with a man on a particular job unless he is a member of a particular union, and they wrongfully expel him, and he cannot work because, if he does, the others may leave.  Does the Minister think that there is protection there or an easing of the position because the man is deemed to be a member?  These are the two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton </NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Minister knows nothing whatever about the procedure taken by trade unions in connection with their head offices or their administrative machinery.  Because a Deputy had said that in the case of one union's headquarters no records were kept, the Minister, in his inexperience of trade unions, proceeded to assume that, consequently, there were no records of the members of that union.  What happens in a case like that is that the records are kept by the local branches and are always available for union headquarters, and that record of a person's membership is just as indelibly preserved locally as if it were at union <Col N="249" /> headquarters.  In very large organisations, it is a matter of administrative convenience to have the records kept locally instead of nationally, but that does not mean that the records are not available.  If that is an argument, therefore, in favour of the thoughtlessness of putting in Section 11 (1) (d), it is probably the poorest argument I have heard on a section, the defence of which has been so bristling with poor arguments as that section was.  The Minister says that it is necessary to protect people, by giving them a right to go to the courts if they are unfairly expelled, but when asked to show in what way.  Section 11 (1) (d) will give that extra protection he cannot possibly quote a single instance in which the phraseology of this section would in any way assist such a person to plead his case before the courts. Occasionally, at present, a member who is expelled from a union may go to the courts.  It has never been contended by the courts that his case is in any way weakened, because, in fact, the expulsion had taken place. The courts have considered cases of that kind without any reference to whether the aggrieved person, on the date of the action, was or was not a member of the union.  Membership of the union, therefore, has played no part whatever in court judgments on applications by aggrieved persons for relief and for compensation, perhaps, against expulsion from membership of a union.  The Minister is making a very poor case worse by pretending to believe that there is any relief or assistance provided for an aggrieved person in Section 11 (1) (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another case.  The Minister realises now that it is a bit absurd to deem a dead man to be a member of a union a month after he is buried, and he proposes, therefore, to remove that piece of dead timber from this Bill. Let us take another example of what the Minister is doing.  At present, some trade union organisations &mdash; all trade union organisations &mdash; have rules. These rules, and alterations of them, are registered with the Department of Industry and Commerce and, in respect of registered unions, there is a supervision of the rules exercised by <Col N="250" /> the Registrar of Friendly Societies, now functioning in connection with the Department of Industry and Commerce. The registrar may register the rules of a union, and these rules may provide that if a person is three months in arrears in his contributions he ceases to be a member in good financial standing, and that if he is six months in arrears with his contributions he ceases to be a member entirely.  The Department of Industry and Commerce will register these rules and.  by that fact, consent to these rules, but under Section 11 (1) (d) of this Bill the person who is a non-financial member from the end of three months until the end of six months, is put back into actual membership of the union &mdash; not into non-financial membership of the union but back into membership in good standing &mdash; even though the person is six months in arrears with his contributions and even though the Department of Industry and Commerce have agreed that his membership ought to lapse if he does not pay contributions after six months.  That is what the Minister is doing under this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not know the rules of trade unions or the supervision exercised over them by his own Department, and, not having had much experience of trade unions or of his own Department, he knows nothing about these matters.  He would be well advised to take some guidance from people who do know something about these matters. The only thing that was put forward to justify Section 11 (1) (d) was the possibility that a person might be unfairly expelled, but it has been shown that there is no relief for that person in this section.  But take the case of a person who definitely says: &ldquo;I do not want to remain any longer in the union.  I want to leave it and join another union&rdquo; or who says &ldquo;I want to retire from all kinds of industrial toil, and I do not intend to work any more.&rdquo; That person wants to go, and the union says: &ldquo;O.K., you may go.&rdquo; The Minister, however, says: &ldquo;Yes, but for the purposes of this Act you are still a member of the union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What purpose is served by keeping membership in the union in that case? Take another case.  A man says: &ldquo;I <Col N="251" /> am getting out of tills particular industry as a worker.  I am ceasing to be a journeyman or a craftsman and am going into business on my own or with a brother of mine.  I am going now to become an employer of workers and, in these circumstances, I intend to leave the union because, as an employer, I am no longer eligible.&rdquo; Yet, for the purposes of this Act, that person is deemed to be a member of the union.  I want to know why you must keep him in membership when he wants to go and the union is satisfied that he should go.  Will the Minister address himself to these arguments and say why that man should be compelled to remain a member of a union for a month after he leaves or desires to leave it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I want to renew my representations to the House.  This is a highly technical piece of legislation.  Take the very section we are now dealing with.  Deputy Norton discussed the inner workings of the maintenance of a trade union register and the advantages that accrue to a member by having his name on the register and the consequences of removing his name from it.  It is manifest to us all that on a variety of technical questions arising out of previous sections the warmest feeling has been evinced, and I say, with regard to Section 11, that, except to some active trade unionists and, notably, officials of trade unions, the merits of the issues involved are far from clear.  In that set of circumstances, is it not a reasonable thing to suggest that the whole of this problem should be referred to a, body which, as a preliminary, legislatively, would clarify the issues involved? Is it reasonable to ask Deputies to pass judgment on the merits of the Minister's proposal when secretaries of trade unions say that, from their experience of the thing, the Minister's conception is entirely wrong?  Now, the Minister may be right and the secretaries may be wrong, or the Minister may be wrong and the secretaries may be right; but how can the membership of Dáil Éireann determine between them, unless an opportunity has been afforded <Col N="252" /> to them to peruse the proceedings of a commission which has sent for expert witnesses to clarify this problem?</P>

I get up between the two contending parties and say: &ldquo;All I want is information.&rdquo; The Minister gives me one version of the story; the trade unionists give me another version.

      <P>The Minister can be provoking if he wants to.  My reputation in this House is not that of a Deputy who understands no legislation.  The Minister frequently finds fault that I profess to understand every kind of legislation.  On this occasion I am putting a serious point.  I am putting a point which I think, if taken earlier, might have avoided a great deal of pretty violent scenes in the House which a great many people outside in the country do not understand the necessity for.  I believe that a <i>modus operandi</i> could be found and an agreed measure arrived at to meet the evils that exist if a little patient consideration were given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any other Deputy in the House who will get up and say frankly that he does not understand many of the sections, and, notably, Section 11 of this Bill?  I know many of them do not.  Is it unreasonable for us to ask for machinery to enable us to understand the section?  I think that if that machinery were made available, a great deal of acrimonious debate could be avoided.  If all this violent clash of opinion were transferred to another forum, instead of having violent disagreement of the kind we have had, we might ascertain truths and I think, if we did, the passage of this Bill would be very much easier through later stages.  Indeed, it might become apparent that some entirely new section would fit the machine better than Section 11.  I put it to the Minister that that suggestion is worthy of consideration. It would be much better if we could get an instrument before the House which in detail we could discuss, having agreed in principle, than to get a measure before the House that pleases nobody, that is discussed in detail in an acrimonious spirit which results in no accommodation being arrived at.  We ought to be able to get accommodation about this problem, and we could if all sides of the House had the exhaustive information which the Minister professes to have but which the trade unionists in the House say he has not got but which, I have no doubt, they would be very pleased to <Col N="254" /> supply if some independent tribunal were set up to examine the evils this Bill is designed to abate, and to elucidate from them what their views are of the source of these evils and the most expedient method of overcoming them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that the Minister would have something to say before the section was put.  The Minister, in his attempt to justify this section, relied on two points which, to my mind, are not affected by the section at all.  There were two points on which I could find myself very largely in agreement with the Minister's point of view, strange as that may seem. The Minister said that this section was designed mainly to see that workers, tradesmen of a particular trade or craft, would not be deprived of their right to employment by being forced out of a particular trade union.  The Minister also referred to the system which he alleges to be in existence regarding apprentices, that is, that you cannot be apprenticed to a particular trade, or a particular number of trades in this city or in this country, unless your father or your uncle or some member of your family was a member of that particular trade and trade union. If the object of the section is as stated by the Minister and if something in that direction was going to be secured by this section then there might be something to be said for it, but so far as I can read the section there is nothing in it from the first to the last line that has the slightest bearing whatever on either, of the two main points made by the Minister in his attempt, as I said, to justify putting this section through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us which sub-section of Section 11 is going to secure to apprentices anything which they have not got to-day.  Is there anything in this section that is going to secure to a man if, for any reason, he ceases to be a member of a trade union, that he can get work at his particular trade in defiance of that trade union? That is the only case I have heard the Minister make on this section.  When I raised the point and when I asked the Minister to point out to the House <Col N="255" /> where the question of a member of a union or an apprentice was covered under Section 11, I was hoping the Minister would be good enough to give that information to the House.  That, apparently, is not the Minister's intention. Deputy McGilligan put two specific points to the Minister.  The Minister, apparently, does not consider either of these points worth answering. Deputy Norton put a number of points to the Minister.  The Minister has not thought it worth his while to reply to any of these.  Deputy Dillon has just put certain points to the Minister. Again, the Minister does not think it worth his while to make any comment. I suggest, to the Minister, if I may say so, that that is not the most helpful attitude to adopt in dealing with a measure like this.  It is a measure on which there are very different points of view, and I would venture to say that if he could get the free voice of this House the Minister would find that the majority of the members of this House have very great fears in regard to this particular Bill and very grave fears as to what is going to arise in this country and in this city as a result of its passage into law.  This section may mean a number of things but it certainly does not mean what the Minister says it means.  It makes no reference whatever, from the beginning to the end, to the Minister's point about safeguards for tradesmen who have ceased to be members of. unions, who have been expelled from unions, or apprentices.  Perhaps, even now, the Minister would give some information to the House on these two matters.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to add at the end of Section 18 two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 38 of 1926), is hereby repealed, and in lien thereof it is hereby enacted that for the purpose of this section the amount of a bet shall be taken to be the sum of money which by the term's of the bet the licensed bookmaker will receive, retain or take credit for if and when the event the subject of the bet is determined in his favour.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where by the terms of a bet (not being a bet exempted from duty under the provisions of Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1931 (No. 31 of 1931) ), a sum of money is wagered on the result of a horse race on the condition that if the said race be determined in favour of the person making the said wager the sum of money originally wagered is in whole or in part to be wagered on a later race, duty at the rate of seven and one-half per cent. shall be charged, levied and paid only on the sum of money originally wagered.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent, both sub-sections are on the same point, and in so far as. they are hot on the same point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>You are discussing both together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The aim of the first new sub-sections proposed to be put in is, I think, fairly dear.  It makes a slight amendment in the phraseology of Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1926.  There a bet is defined as being &ldquo;the sum of money which, by the terms of the bet, the bookmaker will be entitled to receive&rdquo;, and so on.  I am seeking to put in that the bet will be deemed to be only the sum which the bookmaker will receive if the -bet is determined in his favour.  The point I am at is this: for some years past the Minister knows that bookmakers as a whole have borne the tax.  The fact that they bear the tax means that they pay on all bets that come into their office, whether they win or lose.  A person comes in with a stake, and that is regarded as a bet.  If that client wins, they do not subtract anything from his winnings.  They are in the position that, win or lose, they have to meet the amount of the duty.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he might take this as a half-way house&mdash; as I suggested to him before &mdash; and drop the whole thing.  It possibly may reduce the amount which he hoped to get from the tax.  But it possibly may not have that effect, because the Minister knows that in a particular year when the bookmakers made the change to bearing the tax themselves the revenue shot up by about £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think &mdash; I have not looked into it very accurately &mdash; that there was anything in the times that we had which would account for that increase; I think the whole or the greater part of the increased revenue derived from the tax must be attributed to the fact that, by bearing the tax themselves, they induced a certain extra number of clients into their offices and got a certain bigger amount of business done.  It is possibly a gamble with the Minister.  He may lose a little of the £25,000 which he thinks he is going to get.  But he may not.  If the bookmakers have to put this tax back upon their clients &mdash; they tell me that that will be the situation &mdash; then I suggest that the revenue likely to be derived <Col N="258" /> from the increased tax is going to go down.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already given figures to show that in two years the tax has gone down from about £200,000 to about £100,000, so that it is now just at the point of being halved.  Of course, with racing still on the decline, and with racing days likely to be stilt more seriously curtailed on the other side and possibly curtailed here &mdash; the absence of fodder will probably bring about a fairly serious change in racing &mdash;the Minister is not going to have the same number of days' racing, and if there is not the same number of events there is not going to be the same amount of money wagered.  As the Minister, possibly, has been informed, clients do not often win, so that the greater portion of the money wagered would still bear tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was anything like that.  The second sub-section here is a fumbling attempt to put into parliamentary language a thing that everybody knows, but under another name.  It is what is called the &ldquo;if to credit&rdquo; bet.  I understand that originally, when this duty was put on, the Revenue Commissioners exacted duty on every bet, or everything that was deemed to be a bet, made by a client.  For instance, a client comes in with a sum of money and wagers it on that system, and the Revenue Commissioners are apt to regard that as two bets.  They take the original stake and they take the multiplication of it, if and when the wager is successful; they take that twice.  On what are called the &ldquo;if to credit&rdquo; bets, when not the bet and the winnings are carried forward but when only the original stake is carried, forward, they still call that one, two or three bets, according to the number of times it is carried forward I understand that some time ago a compromise was arrived at whereby the double or treble was no longer counted, <Col N="259" /> but the &ldquo;if to credit&rdquo; bet is still counted as one, two or three bets, according to the number of placings of it.  Of course, there is a certain amount of logic in it.  I suppose the Revenue Commissioners argue that the man who is going to put his stake on a horse has it at the back of his mind that he is keeping the winnings and putting the original stake on another horse, and so on.  They would say that if this man could stand at the book-maker's counter, when those events turned up successfully he would push the money across the counter a second or third time, and on that account it is argued that it should be reckoned as two or three bets.  But, of course, that is not the way it is done.  It is put in as a single bet.  The man puts on his money, and disappears from the office, and, if he loses, he is not going to make a second or third bet; that only happens in the event of his winning. I do not know whether or not the amendment, from the point of view of draftsmanship, catches the point, but, at any rate, it makes it clear that, on this thing called an &ldquo;if to credit&rdquo; bet, duty at 7½ per cent. should be levied, not on, say, if that is run three times, but only on the stake money as originally put down.  I had no statistics to guide me in this matter.  I do not know what amount of the bets that are put on at the starting price at the bookmakers are of this type, but I understand that a fairly large proportion are put on in this way.</P>

      <P>No, they may even put it on their docket and go in on chance to see, if they are free to go out of their offices or workshops.  I take it, however, that credit betting is by people who are in their offices or workshops and cannot afford to stay in the betting offices, and they make their bet through another party.  Whether or not it is a credit bet, it is a bet; and I think it would be illogical to say that a credit bet is not a bet.  I have read many documents regarding this.  I got a new document this evening.  J have read very carefully the various petitions and documents I have got.  This is from the Starting Price Turf Accountants' Protection Association of Eire.  Judging by the figures they have put up, they will be hard hit, and have been hard hit, owing to the reduction in the number of days' racing.  Of course, there are many other people hard hit, and many who have been taxed &mdash; and heavily taxed.  Perhaps, if this war ^continues, they will be taxed more heavily still.  They are not treated in an exceptional way.  They have tried to make a case that the tax on them is much heavier in proportion than that on any other class of business or profession. I do not see that.  It is a kind of luxury trade &mdash; I am sure it could be described as such &mdash; one that is not necessary to the life of the individual. Of course, a reduction in this business, as they say, possibly means a reduction in the number of the staffs, but that applies to every branch of business, industry and profession in these times. In the circumstances, I am afraid I cannot afford to forego the additional money that J seek out of the tax this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said these people were not being made suffer more than any other section of the people, that they were not being treated in any exceptional or unfair way; and he went on to say that this was a luxury trade, and so on.  Might I remind him that they are being treated in a rather exceptional way and that, as a matter of fact, it was only as an afterthought &mdash; and perhaps not so much an afterthought but only because something else happened &mdash; that this extra 2½ per cent. was put on this particular body at all.  The Minister talks about luxuries: the people who were relieved of the 2½ per cent., at the expense of the people we are now dealing with, can be described just as easily as being in a luxury class.  As a matter of fact, if I may be allowed to say so, they cater for people more accustomed to luxuries and &mdash; so far as it is known in this country &mdash; luxurious living than the people we are now asking to bear this 7½ per cent.</P>

      <P>In so far as it is a luxury at all, I believe there are more people of that class amongst those relieved from paying the 2½ per cent. than amongst the people who will be called upon to pay the 2½ per cent.  I put it to the Minister that this was an afterthought &mdash; not something calmly thought out in the Castle by the Revenue Commissioners when the Budget was being prepared.  The Revenue Commissioners, having weighed all the pros and cons and gone over the figures for receipts during the last five or six years, and having taken into full account the number of race meetings now as against the number last year or the year before, and then, in their cold, impartial and judicial way, having said this was where the money could be got, decided that, though it would place an added burden on some people, they would have to place the burden somewhere.  I think it is a little late in the day for the Minister to come in and say that these people are not being treated in any exceptional way.  I say they are.  This 2½ per cent. is being taken off certain sections &mdash;whether that was wise or desirable or <Col N="263" /> just is not for me to say &mdash; and it is being put on other sections because it had to be put somewhere.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  I would like to disabuse the Deputy's mind of that, in all seriousness.  Deputy Cosgrave was the first person who mentioned it and, as he knows a great deal more about racing than I do, I took serious notice of what he said.  I asked my officials about it and they said he made a good case on the question of interference with Irish racing, and it was on that basis the tax was dropped before.  That was the case made to me by Deputy Cosgrave, and others backed it up in the House.  He spoke witn a knowledge that I confess I do not possess when he made that suggestion to me.  After all, he is a knowledgable man arid the Leader of the Opposition and &mdash; I do not know whether Deputy McGilligan believes me or not &mdash;I do take serious notice of suggestions made from the Front Opposition Bench on any point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, of course, and am quite prepared to accept what <Col N="264" /> he said the last day &mdash; that he himself was not fully informed and that, if he had all the information he has now, he would not have made the suggestion. But I had adopted the suggestion in the meantime.  The same suggestion was made to me from other quarters outside the House, and from betting men in substantial businesses.  The same suggestion was made to me by betting men who bet on the course and off the course.  Deputy Fogarty introduced the deputation, but the rest of them I did not know except one whom I think I met somewhere at some time. I am told they were men of substance among the betting fraternity.  They reluctantly accepted this suggestion; they did not encourage me to accept it but they said: &ldquo;If you have to put on an additional tax that is the way to do it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is how this suggestion came about.  We are losing something by it I think about £8,000 altogether.  We will probably get about £8,000 less from this method than from the former one.  I was prepared to do that because I was anxious to meet tike men, and I thought I was meeting them fairly.  I did not know that there was a big body of people outside that association that I received.  In fact, there was no association before that. This Starting Price Association, I think, only came into existence as a result of the putting on of the tax.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already admitted that certain ridiculous things that could be done under previous sections should be rectified.  Paragraph (g), of sub-section (1), provides that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a person who ceases to be a member of such trade union shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to continue to be a member thereof for one month after such cessor.</P>
      <P>Those who have studied the rules and regulations of trade unions under the existing law know quite well that it would be impossible for a member of a union to continue his membership after he had gone into business on his own.  Take the drapery trade, for example.  Say that a member of the union catering for that trade opened business on his own as a merchant draper.  He at once ceases to be a member of the union.  Why should it be compelled to keep on its register the names of persons who had resigned or who had died?  I do not know what the purpose of this particular paragraph can be, and whether the Minisster, in view of what he has previously said, proposes to allow it to stand.  It is not necessary for me to point out any other defects in the section. Obviously, on the admission of the Minister, the section should either be deleted by him or more fully explained by him.</P>

I thought that limitation was going to be carried right through the section, but it is not.  Under paragraph (c) the trade union is to maintain a register of its members at its office in this country.  That is to say, all its English members as well as the members who are resident within the State.  I do not imagine that was meant.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of the section that I would like to refer to.  In this section a member of a trade union is to be deemed to be a member for one month after his resignation, his expulsion or death.  A number of trade unions provide benefits for their members.  At the moment I am thinking of mortality benefits.  Under this section, if a man's membership of a union is terminated voluntarily, or otherwise, or if he dies, then the union for one month after will be obliged to meet all its obligations to him in regard to benefits.  It will be obliged to pay mortality benefit to that person although, to all Intents and purposes, he has ceased to be a member.  I think the Minister should give a further explanation to the House as to why he is insisting on this provision, that a person should be deemed to be a member for one month after his membership has virtually, and for all practical purposes terminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this whole section is seriously intended or not.  I do not believe in passing legislation if it is not intended to carry it into effect.  What this section really amounts to is that the Civil Service is taking over absolute control of the secretarial side of trade union activities.  Heavy penalties are laid down in the case of failure to notify the Minister promptly of various changes in membership, etc.  Assuming that the whole section is seriously intended, then I want to suggest that it is going to be read through Civil Service spectacles.  I do not want to <Col N="272" /> say one word against civil servants. They are the last word in efficiency on paper.  The hall-mark of the efficient civil servant is that he is a man that has every record to the minute and every report made to the very tick of the clock.  A man that, in practice, may be most successful, experienced and efficient, but that is not so prompt with his diary and his reports is, according to Civil Service standards, most inefficient.  In the ordinary administration of trade unions, societies and organisations, it is the actual day-to-day work that is of the utmost importance rather than the time-table record.  Does the Minister seriously intend to impose a penalty of £5, and £1 for every day of a continuing offence, in the case of the trade union secretary who is late in notifying him that a new member has joined, that a member has resigned or died, or that a member has been suspended?</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister intends to do that.  Why, therefore, retain such a provision in the Bill?  If it be not seriously intended, Parliament should not be asked to pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason why anybody would have any sympathy with the section is on the assumption that a Government Department will blink the eye at irregularities: that, in fact, this requirement will not be carried out.  I suggest to the Minister that is a bad headline to set for the civil servant because, as I have said, the civil servant believes in absolute efficiency on paper.  He is a very successful man in his own atmosphere and surroundings, but take him out of these surroundings, and he is like a rabbit in a river &mdash; he does not know in what direction he is going or what he is aiming at, although in his own territory, he is most efficient.  In this Bill the proposal is to inject Civil Service control into the ordinary outside work of trade unionists.  That gives an absolutely incompatible mixture which will produce a poisonous product.  I would say this for the Minister, and those who have drafted this section, that they have drafted so many words which hang together nicely, which sound legal but, in fact, are meant to mean nothing.  If the Minister means to <Col N="273" /> carry out the sections that contain penalties for failure to comply with the regulations, then I believe this will be properly regarded as a most brutal measure.  If, on the other hand, these sub-sections have been put in in the hope that, occasionally, a trade union here and there will toe the line and that the idea is, &ldquo;Well, it is all to the good to have one or two toeing the line in up-to-dateness but we are not going to be too drastic with those who do not&rdquo;, then that is another matter. We should not make a humbug of legislation by putting down things and pressing penalties and intentions that, every sensible man knows, the Minister does not mean to carry out.  It is a tremendous mistake for anybody arranging business for those under him to lay down hard and fast rules which he knows they are going to break through every time they come up against a hard case.  Thousands of times a year the average trade union will fail to comply with some of the conditions laid down here.  Are we going to get a fine of £5 each time an offence occurs and a continuing fine of £1 for each day the offence lasts?  I do not believe that.  Because I do not believe it I think it is very unwise to ask the Dáil to pass it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if it is seriously meant, is it intended to mulct trade union officers&mdash;men, perhaps, in their first job, inexperienced, untrained men, without previous practice in administration, part-time men and, perhaps, badly-paid men?  If it is intended to mulct them for every failure to comply with the conditions set down here in a maximum fine of £5 and a continuing fine of £1 for every day while the offence continues, I should like an estimate of what it is likely to cost a middlingly successful secretary in any of the big trade unions where, accordins to the membership, there is the average percentage of deaths, the average percentage of resignations and occasional suspensions, and where those might not be promptly notified, for insurance if he is wisely to make provision for the penalties under this Bill?</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy <Col N="274" /> O'Higgins has misunderstood this section. There is nothing in it which binds a trade union secretary, or the officer of a trade union, to notify the Minister when a person ceases to be a member, whether by reason of death or otherwise. All that this section proposes &mdash; it cannot be argued that we are asking too much &mdash; is, in the first place, that the trade union &ldquo;shall include in its rules or constitution provisions specifying the conditions governing entry into and the cesser of membership of such trade union by persons resident within the State&rdquo;. Surely, that is an elementary provision with which trade unions must, I think, comply under the existing law.  Secondly, it is provided that &ldquo;such trade union shall have and maintain an office within the State for the purposes of this Act, and shall give notice in writing to the Minister of the situation of such office and of every change thereof&rdquo;.  Only one intimation need be sent to the Minister.  We all know that these offices exist, and all that will be necessary will be a formal notification to the Minister as to where the office of the union is situate. Thirdly, it is provided that</P>
      <P>such trade union shall maintain at the said office a register of its members (including former members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am prepared to consider an amendment in relation to this:</P>
      <P>... other than those whose membership ceased before the grant of such negotiation licence), and such register shall, as regards each such member, show (i) his name and address, (ii) the date of commencement of membership.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely that is the sort of record that any properly organised and properly conducted trade union, such as we contemplate existing hereafter under the provisions of this Act, ought to <Col N="275" /> keep for its own purposes.  All we are asking is that it shall keep that record not merely for its own purposes but for general purposes.</P>

      <P>We, also, have an interest in the accuracy of this record. The appropriate sum to be paid under the schedule is determined by the membership of the unions and it is of vital importance to us, for that reason and a number of other reasons, that there should be an accurate record of the members of the union.  The next paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where his membership has ceased, by suspension or expulsion, the date of the order directing and a reference to the rule or other provision authorising such suspension or expulsion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With trade unions, as we can visualise them in the future, becoming more and more important bodies within the polity of this State, that is, in my view, an essential provision.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) of this sub-section has already been amended and it will be still further amended to meet certain suggestions made by Deputy McGilligan. It merely provides that a trade union shall keep at its office a register of members open during ordinary business hours free of charge, not for public inspection, but for inspection by certain specified classes and categories of persons.  Paragraph (e) provides that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;such trade union shall, from time to time, as occasion requires give notice in writing to the Minister of the name of a person whom it considers suitable for accepting service of documents on its behalf and any document whatsoever may be served on such trade union by enclosing it in an envelope addressed to such person at the said office and by delivering such envelope at the said <Col N="276" /> office or by sending it thereto by-post&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That has nothing to do with the obligations of trade unions beyond ensuring that each trade union will give the notice prescribed by this paragraph to the Minister of the name of a person whom it considers suitable for accepting service of documents.  A further proviso is added here, as amended by the House, that, if there is a change in the rules or constitution of a trade union, or a change in its committee of management or other controlling authority, or a change in its trustees or in its secretary or other principal officer, such change shall be notified to the Minister within 21 days after the making thereof.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (g) provides that &ldquo;a person who ceases to be a member of such trade union shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to continue to be a member thereof for one month after such cesser&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are dealing under this section with very wealthy and well-organised bodies &mdash; with bodies whose reserves run, in some cases, into millions of pounds &mdash; who certainly employ, not ill-educated or inexperienced persons, but very able men as their officers and their representatives in this country, and whose business is, in general, very efficiently conducted. I cannot see, in asking a union of that type to comply with the requirements of this section, that we are doing anything really unusual or unreasonable or anything that is not fully within the capacity of the unions concerned to comply with.</P>
    <P>I think, as I have said, that reading paragraphs (c) and (f) it would be perhaps possible to get the impression. that we are requiring the particular union to furnish the Minister with these particulars in relation to cesser of membership.  That is not the purpose-All we wish to ensure is that the union will enter these particulars on its own register for several purposes, one of them being for the purpose of enabling-us to compute what would be the appropriate sum to be deposited by the union under Section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy raised a question as to the positions of unions under paragraph <Col N="277" /> (g), in relation to mortality benefits, in so Jar us persons claiming mortality benefit would be affected by the proviso that a person would be deemed to continue to be a member of the union for one month after he had ceased to be a member by reason of his death.  I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension as to the effect of the paragraph because the person is only deemed to be a member of the union &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo; and the Act does not in any way deal with the provident funds of a union or with any benefits in the form of mortality benefits to which a person may be entitled. I shall, however, in view of the fears which the Deputy has expressed, look into the section and, if necessary, I shall move an amendment dealing with the point he has raised on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason to modify my views as a result of the Minister's statement.  My objection, as expressed, was to the effect that if the secretary or an official failed to notify the Minister of certain things &mdash;departures, deaths, resignations, etc. &mdash;he became liable to a penalty and then to continuing penalties.  The Minister points out that these only arose if he failed to register in his own register the particular things referred to.  That is merely a difference of degree, of such a slight degree that it is not worth mentioning.  As I read it first, it appeared to be a case of writing a letter and posting a record. Everything I said is true with this alteration, that the penalty remains only if he does not make a record.  He is not bound, apparently, to post the record.  Who are the responsible people where there is slackness in the keeping of a register? I think the officer responsible for the register comes under the lash to the extent of the penalties outlined, but then, in a vague kind of way, the section says that any other persons who may be held to be responsible are liable to these penalties.  Are they all to be brought before a court for the court to find who is responsible, or is there to be a Departmental inquiry to find whether every member of the committee, or only special members or individual <Col N="278" /> officers of the trade union, are responsible as well as the secretary?</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any authorised trade union in respect of which this section applies fails to comply with any requirement of this section such trade union and such of the officers thereof as consent to or facilitate such failure shall each be guilty of an offence under this section and shall each be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £5 together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £1 for every day during which the offence is continued.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The offences are mainly failure to register properly.  Let us assume that there is failure on behalf of a clerk or secretary to keep the register properly over a period, that the management is not all that it should be and that that runs along over a period, that then some inspector of the Minister examines the register and he finds that hundreds of members have resigned and that the entries are not there.  Is he going to bring every officer of that particular union before the courts for the courts to assess who amongst the whole lot of them is responsible and what degree of responsibility rests upon each one of them?  In all honesty, I believe that if that is the intention, the only way to carry it out is to plant a civil servant in the headquarters of every one of these unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in discussing this section, made use of an argument which I do not believe he would be prepared to stand over for every other section of the Bill.  He asked us to remember that this Bill applies to trade unions which are very wealthy bodies, some of them having millions of pounds.  One of the objections I heard raised to the Bill on the earlier stages was that it was going to apply to the little unions with a small amount of money as well as to the wealthy unions.  Is it now announced to the Dáil that the policy of the Minister is that the only unions that will continue to exist are the unions that control or own millions of pounds? Is that the policy of the Government? If that is not the policy, and if that <Col N="279" /> is not the intention, then half the argument that was advanced in support of the section has to go by the board.  It cannot be both ways, and I leave the choice to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has not grasped the full purport of the section.  The section with which we are dealing relates only to authorised trade unions not registered under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, that is to say, what are commonly referred to here as the English unions. I do not think, notwithstanding what the Deputy has said, that there is anything unreasonable in asking these unions to keep a register of their members here in a form to comply with the requirements of this section.  As I pointed out these unions are wealthy bodies and their officers control very large funds.  I am quite certain that they are managed very efficiently, that every reasonable business check is kept upon the collection and the expenditure of their moneys and that their accounts ate duly audited by reputable persons.  In order, then, that that audit should be properly conducted, surely the union must have a record at the beginning of the financial year of the actual membership, of every person who is a member of the union, and if by any chance some of these persons cease, from one or other cause, to be members of the union, whether it be because of death, resignation or expulsion, there must be a record made in the books of the union of the fact that these persons have ceased to be members and of the reasons for their having ceased to be members.  All we are asking is that, in addition to stating whether the cesser was caused by death or resignation, if it has been due to suspension, expulsion, or otherwise, the rule and the date of the order directing the suspension or expulsion will be recorded as well.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that we are imposing an undue and unusual burden upon these unions, but under the law of their own country since 1871, these unions are bound to furnish certain particulars.  Section 16 of the Trade Union Act, 1871, sets out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A general statement of the receipts, <Col N="280" /> funds, effects, and expenditure of every trade union registered under this Act shall be transmitted to the registrar before the first day of June in every year, and shall show fully the assets and liabilities at the date, and the receipts and expenditure during the year preceding the date to which it is made out, of the trade union, and shall show separately the expenditure in respect of the several objects of the trade union, and shall be prepared and made out up to such date, in such form, and shall comprise such particulars as the registrar may from time to time require; and every member of, and depositor in, any such trade union shall be entitled to receive, on application to the treasurer or secretary of that trade union, a copy of such general statement, without making any payment for the same.</P>
    <P>Together with such general statement there shall be sent to the registrar a copy of all alterations of rules and new rules and changes of officers made by the trade union during the year preceding the date to which the general statement is made out, and a copy of the rules of the trade union as they exist at that date.</P>
    <P>Every trade union which fails to comply with or acts in contravention of this section, and also every office of the trade union so failing, shall each be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds for each offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is more, we are already obliging our own trade unions, the trade unions registered in this country, to comply with the provisions of that section and to furnish all these particulars.  All we are doing in the section is to put the English trade unions in the same position as the Irish trade unions under the law of this land, with suitable modifications to meet their particular case.</P>

      <P>If we assume, for the sake of argument, that the Bill becomes law and is recognised by the unions catered for in the section, I am convinced, from my knowledge of over 30 years as a trade unionist, that there-will be still more than one union left catering for the same group of workers, probably in the same industry.  If that is so &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will live long enough to see it happen &mdash; does he not think it very undesirable that this right of inspection of union registers should be allowed at all?  If there are two unions, or more than two unions, catering for the same group of workers in the same industry, we will have one of these coining along, making a payment of 5/- and demanding the right to inspect the register of the other union catering for the same group of workers.  It is bound to lead to irritation and confusion.  It is my opinion, for what it is worth, that poaching for members of trade unions from other trade unions will go on as long as the Minister is alive and trade unions are allowed to operate in this or in any other country.

      <P>Oh, no.  I am sure the Minister will live long enough after the Bill becomes law to realise that he is not going to push this down the throats of the trade unionists of the country. Time, however, will tell.  There will <Col N="283" /> be a certain amount of trouble created by the situation I suggest.  I have already pointed out that existing unions affiliated to the Irish Trade Union Congress which are likely to be affected by this section have a membership of anything from 20,000 to 40,000. Is it right or proper that any gentleman approved by the Minister, and willing to pay a fee of 5/-, should be allowed to walk into the office of a union which holds a negotiating licence on 1st January and conduct himself and his business in such a way as to toe able to remain there for the 365 days of the year, pretending that he is engaged in the examination of a register?  Will the payment of a fee of 5/-, and the rubber stamp of the Minister, approving of a gentleman of this kind, enable him to carry on in this way?  I suggest that it will, and I suggest that it is a roost ridiculous section to leave in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sub-section (d) is one of the subjections in the Bill that is certainly likely to cause considerable annoyance and irritation, whether it is applied in the case of Section 11 or Section 12. It just gives a certain amount of latitude to busybodies who will be authorised by the Minister to conduct this investigation.  It is the kind of authority that, in my opinion, should only be given to detectives when they suspect that people are likely to act illegally.  With regard to sub-section (g), I know of at least one union that is likely to be concerned with the operation of Section 12, where, when a member goes from one grade in the service to another, he ceases to have the right to claim that the union shall act on his behalf in negotiations or in any purposes, he is expected to retire from membership of the union concerned. That is the rule of the union and that is an agreement between the union I have in mind and the employers with whom the union negotiates on behalf of certain classes of workers.  Is it the intention of the Minister, under sub-section (g), to compel the union concerned, in cases of the kind I have in mind, to keep the member on the register a month after he has been promoted from one grade to another, as a result of which, in accordance with <Col N="284" /> the rules of the union, he ceases to have any claim on the union to act for him in any capacity?</P>
    <P>I think that if the Minister studies the rules of a number of trade unions he will find the same condition in the rules as they exist.  Does he, therefore, propose to compel the unions concerned to alter their existing rules. and will he make that a condition of their getting a negotiating licence? What is the idea, in any case, of compelling a person who had been employed as a draper's assistant to continue to be a member of an organisation catering for such workers after he has become a merchant draper or an employer, or after he has resigned from the union in accordance with the existing rules?  Will the Minister deal with that point?  I think the Bill is bad enough, without making it ridiculous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress the point raised by Deputy Davin with regard to abuses under the previous section and this section in connection with the examination of registers.  Deputy Davin seemed to think, and I am inclined to agree with him, from my knowledge of the matter, that that right, given in this and the previous section, is likely to be used mainly, if not altogether, in connection with poaching activities.  The Minister, in one of his statements yesterday, said that the jealousies and rivalries of the smaller unions were mainly responsible for industrial unrest in this country in recent years.  That statement is not true.  I am not suggesting, for a moment, that it is deliberately untrue, but it is not in accordance with the facts.  I do not say that the small unions were blameless, but one of the principal reasons for industrial unrest and inter-union rivalry and inter-union fighting was poaching. Anybody who knows anything about the trade union movement knows that. Let me tell the Minister, if he does not know it before now, that that poaching was not carried out, or even attempted as a matter of fact, except in a very small way, by the smaller unions &mdash; such inter-union rivalry or inter-union jealousy as there was &mdash; and the real industrial <Col N="285" /> upheavals that flowed from that and from the irritation caused by continual poaching and, if I might use the expression, cross-poaching, were mainly amongst the bigger unions.  The Minister seems to be amused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps that is a better way of putting it.  I want to take up Deputy Davin's point, however.  I can quite see whichever is the proper Government Department having the right-and perhaps it is desirable that they should have the right if this legislation becomes law-to examine registers, but does the Minister think that a 5/- fine is going to stop the big unions in this country &mdash;those operating either under Section 11 or Section 12, if they are passed without amendment &mdash; from using that for the purpose of poaching and creating irritation and, from that, creating industrial unrest?  I have not been convinced by anything the Minister has said that, even in its amended form, this particular sub-section in the Bill is a desirable one.  I think it is one that is going to cause more trouble and more jealousy, and it will certainly cause more bitterness between the unions.</P>
      <P>Let me say this in conclusion.  If the Minister even yet thinks that by passing this Bill into law, including this section and the other sections, and wiping out thereby the smaller trade unions, he is going to bring about peace in the trade union movement in this country and have fewer industrial. upheavals, then he is going to be very sadly deceived.  I said to him previously that sections like Section 6, Section 10 and this section are not going to remove an evil which, admittedly, is there but will bring about a far greater one with far more disastrous consequences.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of this Bill is, indeed, an ideal twin of Section 11, nnd there has been more muddled thinking in connection with Sections 11 and 12 than in connection with all the rest of the Bill.  Quite clearly, whoever was the author of these sections <Col N="286" /> might usefully have been sent into a trade union office for 24 hours with a view to learning something of the manner in which trade unions do their business, because these two sections disclose a deplorable lack of knowledge by the Department of Industry and Commerce which, Heaven knows, ought to know sufficient about trade unions that are doing their job efficiently to be able to draft a Bill based on some intimate knowledge of the manner in which trade unions perform their duties.  Section 12, of course, is different from Section 11 in certain respects, inasmuch as it deals with a union which is not at present registered under our legislation.  A certain position, I think, is arising out of a case in which Deputy Costello appeared, I believe, with success from his point of view.</P>

      <P>Well, I am not expressing an opinion on that, but I think the position was that organisations with headquarters across Channel were not, in fact, legal entities here at all.  That has been the position.  That is the position to date, but a different position, probably, will exist when this Bill is passed.  Section 12 gives these organisations corporate existence here, but is it not possible that it is giving everybody else corporate existence or legal status here?  I suppose it is possible for that revolutionary organisation, known as the International Workers of the World &mdash; a body which is fairly active in the United States, and an organisation with cells, as they describe them, elsewhere &mdash; to come into this country, pay £2,000, get a negotiation licence and proceed to function under our laws?</P>

      <P>He spoke, very mistakenly, I think, in favour of that kind of international trade union organisation &mdash; mistakenly, as I say, but nevertheless he believed in it.  They were a very revolutionary body, with Marxian ideas, and as far as they could ensure it, they carried on an international trade union organisation with, as I say, cells in whatever countries they could establish those cells. Suppose, for instance, they decided that they could possibly establish a branch of that organisation here, suppose they could get the necessary £2,000, would it not be possible for them, under Section 12, to make an application for a negotiation licence and, having produced a certificate that their headquarters were in Moscow, or Leningrad, secure a negotiation licence under this Bill and be duly registered under this Bill as a body entitled to carry on negotiations here, even though an Irish organisation, with headquarters here, all of whose officers were here, whose ideals were wrapped up in our conceptions of culture and liberty, would be prevented from carrying on any such negotiations because it could not pay the £2,000, for instance, which that international organisation was capable of paying?  It seems to me to be possible for that to happen under the Bill.</P>

      <P>The position, Sir, is that if any body comes in and pays £2,000 and does these things, automatically, that organisation functions under Section 12.  We have got a considerable number of Hebrew folk in this country.  Suppose, for instance, a Palestinian organisation decided that. they would organise racially instead of vocationally and decided that in the interests of Jewry, it would be-desirable to have a Jewish trade union here, and suppose they proceeded to organise Jews in a trade union here, with headquarters in Palestine, and were able to pay &mdash; as Jewish folk usually are able to pay &mdash; £2,000, with very little difficulty, is it possible for that organisation to be registered under this section and to function under this section and to do all the things that probably it has to do under this section?  If that is so, has any consideration been given by the Department of Industry and Commerce to that development?  I do not suggest that Jews ought not to be allowed to organise racially, if they desire to do it, but let us hope they would have the sense to organise as a class and not as a race because, just as you can find Irishmen exploited by Irishmen, so I suppose you can find Jews exploited by other Jews.  What I want to know is, has any consideration been given to the possibility that we are permitting the establishment and the operation here of either a Hebrew organisation on the one hand or a Muscovite organisation on the other hand?  I do not know what the Minister's view would be on Hebrews or folk from Islam, but I imagine, judging by his willingness to label everybody an agent of Moscow, that he would see red in a few moments at the possibility of a <Col N="289" /> Muscovite organisation being established here, because he does not like Russian folk in 1941 with the same enthusiasm as he liked them during the civil war in 1922.</P>

      <P>There are other paragraphs in this section that might be adverted to.  It is a very long section. It takes up a whole page.  One would imagine that in a whole page the Department would be able to express what exactly it wanted done and would be able to draft a section in a less clumsy and cumbersome way.  I want to get back again for a few moments to the meddlesome fellow who is entitled to go into a trade union office and, on payment of a fee, proceed to maul the main union register.  I do not know for how long he is permitted to do that for 5/-.  If a fellow goes into a trade union office, proves that he has a <i>bona fide</i> interest &mdash; whatever that may be I do not know &mdash; and can manage to pay the 5/- and get in &mdash; he can say his purpose is to look in the membership of that organisation for one Patrick Murphy and he may only know Patrick's age &mdash; would he not be entitled to go through the whole register and look for this Patrick Murphy, to call people along and say: &ldquo;Is that the Patrick Murphy that used to work in such a place?  His age is about 56.&rdquo; If when the office was closing at 6 o'clock that evening he said: &ldquo;I have not finished this inquiry yet.  I have not found Patrick&rdquo;&mdash; would he not be entitled to come back the following morning and resume the search?  It seems to me, once he paid the 5/-, until <Col N="290" /> his inspection is completed, he could keep coming back every day in the week.  It is not 5/- per day.  It is not 5/- an hour for inspection.  Once he goes in and says: &ldquo;I want to try to trace Patrick Murphy&rdquo; until his quest for Patrick Murphy is ended successfully for him or until, in sheer despair, he abandons the search, it seems to me that inspection is one continuous inspection and that it is not really interrupted by the fact that the office closes for the day.  The Minister is taking care that it is not 5/- a day he is paying for inspection.  Even supposing it was 5/- a day, I think it is a meddlesome thing to permit a person to go into a trade union office and there examine the records in this way.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister might very well have followed the beaten track used by much wiser legislators than he, that is, to leave well enough alone.  Trade union rules and trade union practices provide that anybody with an interest in the funds can inspect the records at union headquarters. Trade unions constantly permit members to do that.  They ought to do it.  There should not be any objection to their doing it, but when you get some &ldquo;meddlesome Michael&rdquo; coming along who wants to find out exactly what way union records are kept, and goes in there for mischievous and malevolent purposes, then I think the State ought not to have legislation to permit that to happen.  We are doing it, and we are causing endless mischief. If there are breaches of the peace, and if there are damaged faces as a result of people wanting to insist on their right to get in under this section, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and those who advised him on this section will be solely responsible for that undesirable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to try to get the Minister to say on Section 12 what he could not be induced to say on Section 11.  On Section 11 it was pointed out to him that a union had to keep a register of its members, including former members other than those whose membership ceased before the grant of such negotiation licence.  So that, if this section is passed, and the unions take any notice of it or of the Bill generally, they will <Col N="291" /> have to proceed to compile a list, in register form, of all their members at head office, if not already there.  Some unions will keep that register under Section 11 and other unions will keep it in respect of Section 12, but there seems to be no limit as to when a register can be cast and a new register constructed, because under the section, if, having compiled a register, a member or a dozen members die, their names must be kept on the register 50 years after they are dead, if this Act is not amended by some sensible Minister following its enactment.  What is the use of insisting on unions keeping a register of members who have been dead for 50 years?  Would the Minister give us any indication as to what is the reason for insisting on keeping a record of that kind?</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks &mdash; again he does not know the facts &mdash; that unions in any case write the names into a book, and that, as the took will be there, there is no great purpose in erasing, either with a rubber or with ink, the name of Patrick Murphy, who died 50 years previously.  He does not know that some unions do not keep those registers in that fashion.  They keep a membership record on a card index system, which is reckoned by many unions to be the best method of keeping records, and to be the best method of facilitating efficient office organisation.  Most people consider &mdash; I am one of them&mdash; that a card index system is the best method of keeping a pliable record of members.  Suppose an organisation keeps a card index system, which I think is a very efficient method of recording membership particulars, is it to store up all the cards of all the lapsed, all the dead, all the resigned, and all the expelled members, and keep those for all time?  What is the purpose of asking them to do it?  I should imagine that those documents were waste after a member had died. There is no purpose in preserving those relics of deceased members, yet under this Bill they must be preserved. But here is the humorous part of it, if it did not carry such penalties with it. If a union does not keep for 50 years the record of a deceased member, then it fails to comply with the requirements <Col N="292" /> of the section, and that union and such of the officers as consent to or facilitate such failure shall each be guilty of an offence under the section, and shall each be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £5, together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £1 for every day during which the offence is continued.  Suppose I am a secretary to a trade union and, when a member dies, I say: &ldquo;Cast that index card.  We will not have occasion to refer to it further.&rdquo; Suppose it is cast a month after a member dies.  Ten years afterwards somebody discovers that, in fact, I have been casting those cards.  Am I made liable, for that offence under this section, to a fine of £5 on myself, £5 on my union, and £1 for every day during which that card was deposited in a dustbin instead of being kept as part of the union equipment at headquarters?  Putting into a Bill a section like that, which gives you those idiotic results, seems to me to be a poor compliment to the intelligence of folk who drafted a Bill of this kind without any knowledge of the internal organisation of trade unions.  I would make another appeal to the Minister.  Would he tell us on Section 12 why it is necessary to do that? Would he tell us how peace in industry is preserved or encouraged by insisting that a union should keep the card of a dead member for 50 or 100 years after his death?</P>
    <P>Now we come to Section 12 (1) (g), and we gee back to this anachronism of a person who says: &ldquo;I do not want to be in the union, and I am leaving it. I am leaving it because I am retiring from industry altogether, and consequently will not be eligible for membership of the union&rdquo;; but that person is compelled under Section 12 (1) (g) to remain, for the purposes of this Act&mdash; whatever that means &mdash; a member of the union for one month after he says: &ldquo;I am going.&rdquo; You may very well get the case of a person who says to the union: &ldquo;Well, I have been a member for ten years.  I have decided to go to the United States.&rdquo; He leaves on 1st June.  He is probably in New York by 10th June, but under this section that person is still a member of a trade union in Dublin, say, although he is <Col N="293" /> then 3,600 miles, away, and has not a notion of ever coming back again.  Why cannot that person cease his membership when he wants to cease it?  Take the case quoted by Deputy Davin; it is quite a common thing for a draper's assistant who has worked at that occupation for a number of years to accumulate a certain sum of money and go into business for himself, and be a master draper in miniature, at all events an employer of labour so far as the union is concerned.  Because he is an employer of labour, and because he is not eligible to remain in the union, he wants to cease membership of the union, but, for some furtive reason which the Minister will not disclose, that person is obliged to remain in membership for one month after he himself desires to be excluded from the union.  Why is it necessary to keep him in membership?  What national interest is served, or what good trade union purpose is served, by keeping that person in membership?  If, however, the union says to him: &ldquo;We are not going to take any notice of this section; it is absurd to permit you to remain in membership,&rdquo; is the union liable to a fine if, during that month, that additional month during which he must be kept in membership, it fails to comply, for instance, with any of the formalities which are required to give notice to such a member, who, having intimated that he does not desire to remain in membership, ceases to pay contributions, and in fact is only a member under duress, that is to say his membership is only forced upon him, and forced upon the union, neither the member nor the union desiring that that type of membership should be continued?  I should like the Minister to tell us candidly what are the reasons which prompt the retention in this Bill&ldquo; of sections which have no meaning, which only indicate a muddled and confused state of mind, and which indicate the hasty and ill-timed manner in which the whole thing was approached by the Department.</P>

Therefore, the whole case which the Deputy built up in the 20 minutes or half an hour during which he was putting forward that fanciful argument falls to the ground.

I am prepared, if necessary, to go further, and, if the Deputy wishes, to have a fee of 5/- an hour or 5/-a day.

      <P>An employer might have a <i>bona fide</i> interest.  I am not going to decide whether he has or not; the courts must adjudicate on it.  Unless people bad a very real interest in securing the inspection of the register, they would not be prepared to undertake the risk of litigation simply in order to secure that inspection.  Therefore, I say that, so far as the fears which have been expressed in this debate are concerned, that the right of inspection would be subject to abuse, I think that the amendment which I have put down and which has been adopted by the House affords the unions concerned greater safeguard.  However, in view of the criticisms nude here, I am prepared on the Report Stage to give the House a further opportunity to consider this matter, by bringing in an amendment specifying the categories of persons who will be permitted and will have the right, on payment of a fee, to inspect the register.  I have also indicated that, so far as the maintenance of the register of the names of deceased members is concerned, I am prepared to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage which will give the House an opportunity to consider whether or not we should impose a time limit on that.  I have said &mdash; and I think it is true &mdash; that there are trades and trade unions who do impose <Col N="297" /> certain restrictions upon membership and upon entrance into those trades and occupations.  Those restrictions are family restrictions, providing that persons becoming apprenticed to a certain occupation shall be the sons of near relatives of persons engaged in that occupation and who are already members of a particular trade union or guild.</P>

I will not contend, for instance, that in the case of an organisation like the one with which Deputy Norton is associated, it is necessary that a postman should be the son of a postman, but I do know that the practice has grown up in regard to skilled occupations, to try to restrict entrance to those occupations to an hereditary basis.  I am not prepared to say &mdash; nor am I conceding &mdash; that that is a, good principle, but it is one which has been adopted by certain sections of the trade union movement.  I do not wish to interfere with the principle: I would rather that that sort of thing be dealt with inside the trade union movement itself.</P>

A register can be kept quite easily upon the card system and the cards can be cast when a member dies or for some reason ceases to be a member of the organisation.  There are other organisations, however, and particularly old-established trades and trade unions, where records may be of some historic interest and where I do not see any great harm in asking the unions to keep a perpetual and continuing record of the members.</P>

      <P>That is what the Committee Stage of a Bill is for &mdash;to examine and cross-examine the Minister.  If the Minister will allow me, it is quite clear that the organisation referred to by Deputy Norton does come within the section.  If it fulfils these conditions, that it is registered, that it is a trade union under the law of another country and that its headquarters control is situated in that country, that it has deposited and keeps deposited with the accountant of the courts the proper sum.  it obviously does come within the section.  The Minister did not say so; but if the House will cast their minds back on the Minister's speech he said that if such a body did try to establish itself here the law could be amended, which obviously shows that this section does embrace it.</P>

      <P>Neither this section nor the Bill itself could possibly be <Col N="299" /> amended in such a way as to make them acceptable to the trade union movement, but the Minister for his own sake, for the purpose of saving his own face, should make such amendments as will make the Bill understandable to those who might like to read it, if and when it becomes law.  The Minister admitted &mdash; and I was rather surprised to hear him admit it &mdash; that an employer could be regarded as a <i>bona fide</i> person who could pay 5/-, receive the rubber stamp of the Minister, walk into the office of a trade union with a negotiation licence, inspect the register and stay there as long as he liked under the amendment proposed by the Minister.  Now an employer &mdash; and probably many such employers will be found in the country after this Bill becomes law &mdash; who might be anxious to establish a house union might have a great interest in finding out who are the members on the register of a particular trade union.  Such an employer, if he got into the premises of a trade union on payment of the small sum of 5/-, could cause considerable trouble afterwards and perhaps make use of the information he would get from a trade union register for the purpose of victimising some of his employees. We are getting back to the period of 1825, and Deputy T. Kelly, I am sure, will be alarmed to learn that.</P>

I know that he was in personal and constant touch with some of the ablest and most patriotic trade union leaders this country has ever known during a long period of his life.  A number of these people were associated with Deputy Kelly in the old Sinn Fein movement and in the Gaelic League.</P>

He can be absolutely certain that, if this Bill ever becomes law, it will not be recognised by the trade union movement in this country and he will require all the artillery he has at his disposal and all the machinery of the State to force some sections of this Bill down the throats of the trade unions who have fought over a long period of years for the right to organise and to protect their interests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to understand Section 12, as amended, because the Minister has not given any definite and clear-cut explanation as to the <Col N="301" /> way in which lie proposes to amend, for instance, sub-sections (c) and (d). I think it is it fair question to ask if he proposes to compel the trade unions covered by this section to change their rules as a condition of getting a negotiation licence.  Does he intend to compel the trade unions, which under their existing rules can require certain people to leave the union when they go from one grade of work to another in certain industries, to alter that procedure and to amend their rules as a condition of getting a negotiation licence?  I think the Minister thoroughly understands what I am at in that respect.</P>
      <P>I want to say again to the Minister, and I say it quite sincerely, believing it to be quite true, that this whole idea of making it easy for a busybody to have access to a trade union office and to inspect the register on payment of a fee of 5/-, which enables him to go in and out of the trade union office for a period of a year, will cause considerable irritation and trouble.  If the Minister thinks that the unions will be reorganised in such a way as to make it impossible for two unions in future to cater for the same group of workers in the same industry, then I admit that what I am saying is not likely to happen.  But I believe it is certain, if this Bill becomes law and if it is ever recognised, that there will be more than one union and more than two unions still entitled to cater for the same group of workers in an industry. If that is so, poaching, which is quite common in every country where you have competing trade unions, will continue to be carried on, and this sub-section (d) will enable that to be carried on with greater liberty in future than it is at present.  The reason I say that is that no union would allow an official of any competing union under existing circumstances to get into their office and examine their register or card index of members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is making this lawful under Section 12 (1) (d), and by doing so he is going to cause more trouble and give more encouragement to the policy of poaching, making it more possible in the future than it has been <Col N="302" /> in the past.  If the Minister accepts my contention in connection with this particular aspect, what does he propose to do to prevent poaching?  Does he think a fee of 5/- a day is going to prevent an official of a union, who may have a personal or selfish interest, from going into the office of a competing union?  This is a kind of licence that is not tolerated in connection with the operation of any other registered society that I know of.  If the Minister wants to make the Bill understandable to those who may read and endeavour to understand it afterwards, I advise him to cut paragraphs (c) and (d) out of Section 12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this section, as distinct from Section 11, is intended to deal with trade unions that are not a legal entity in this country by reason of the fact that they are trade unions capable of registering and yet are not registered in pursuance of Section 6 of the Trade Union Act of 1871, or else by reason of the fact that they are deemed to be unregistered trade unions, being unions operating outside this country.  If such trade unions have no legal existence, and if it is the purpose of Section 12 to deal with trade unions that are not a legal entity, I suggest that the words in sub-section (2), stating that such trade unions shall each be guilty of an offence, have no meaning by reason of the fact that the group of individuals concerned have no legal existence.  The difficulty might be got over by convicting the officials.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of this section appears, on a perusal of its terms, to be somewhat peculiar.  Reverting to paragraph (b), it appears that this particular unregistered trade union must have an office within the jurisdiction of this State for the purpose of the Act.  Paragraph (e) deals with the service of documents.  I want to know if it is for the service of documents for the purposes of this Act only, or for all purposes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the construction of the paragraph, it is not for all purposes. Taking paragraphs (b) and (e), this provision as to service of documents can only be construed as limited to the service of documents for the purposes of the Act.  The next point is that there is no particular sanctity given to documents served in this manner.  You may serve them, but the section does not say anything about what is to happen when you have served them.  It reminded me, when I spoke to Deputy Linehan about it, of a question put in a law examination paper by a well-known professor: &ldquo;Can an action be brought for such-and-such a thing?&rdquo; The student who replied &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; got full marks, because you can always bring an action, whether you succeed or not.  This section says you can serve documents by post, but it does not say anything about the effect of the service.  Perhaps the draftsman might add something to the effect that when the document shall be so served it shall be deemed good service for all purposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>A third point is that under this particular section an unregistered trade union, which by definition is a trade union constituted outside this country, may name a person whom it thinks suitable as a person to accept service of documents.  Take the case mentioned by Deputy Norton.  If a trade union thinks Comrade Stalin is an appropriate person to accept service of documents, there is nothing in the section to prevent the trade union from saying so, so that a document may be addressed, under this section, to Comrade Stalin in some office along the quays.  Whether or not that is good service, I do not know.  What is the effect of service of documents by registered post at an office along the Dublin Quays directed to Comrade Stalin?</P>

      <P>I see in this section the danger that any boss's tout can search the books in order to trace the activities <Col N="304" /> in other directions of certain employees. I think the whole measure is out to shackle the trade union movement, and it is certainly going to do a good deal of harm.  Apparently the Minister has paid very little attention to the advice given by the members of the Labour Party.  On more than one occasion he sneered at them.  I think a little more attention should be paid to the objections that have been raised by them to the various sections in this Bill.  So far as I can see, the Bill is beyond any amendment that would give satisfaction to them.  Those men have done splendid work in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not think the measure should be allowed to pass as it stands and I ask members of the Fianna Fáil Party to reconsider their position and submit their points of views, whether privately or publicly, immediately to the Minister.

      <P>With regard to paragraph (e), I think the real point arising from what Deputy Costello said about the service of documents could be very easily got over if the Minister amended the paragraph to read like the previous paragraph dealing with where the offices must be.  From a legal point of view, so far as service of documents is concerned, there is one thing wrong with paragraph (e) and it could be covered if the Minister adds to it that the person on whom the document is served must be a person within the jurisdiction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;relation to deposits made with the <Col N="307" /> High Court in pursuance of this part of this Act, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  every such deposit shall be made with the privity of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and shall, when made, be under the control of the High Court;</P>
    <P>(b)  any such deposit may, in lieu of being made wholly in money, be made wholly or partly by the deposit of securities authorised by rules of court for the investment of moneys under the control of the High Court;</P>
    <P>(c)  where any such deposit is made wholly or partly in money, such money shall, at the request of the depositor, be invested in such securities so authorised as the depositor shall specify;</P>
    <P>(d)  the income derived from the securities in which such deposit is for the time being invested shall be paid to the depositor;</P>
    <P>(e)  the said securities or all or any of them shall, at the request and cost of the depositor, be varied into any other securities authorised as aforesaid and specified by the depositor;</P>
    <P>(f)  the depositor may at any time apply for the return, in whole or in part, of the deposit or so much thereof as has not been paid out in pursuance of an order of the High Court under this part of this Act;</P>
    <P>(g)  where such application has been duly made, the deposit or so much thereof as has not been paid out as aforesaid shall be returned, in whole or in part, in accordance with such application upon or as soon as conveniently may be after the expiration of six months from the making of such application and, immediately after such return, the Minister shall be informed thereof;</P>

    <P>This amendment is, to some extent, consequential on amendment No. 17. It provides that the deposits may be made by authorised trade unions in the form of money or in authorised investments or in both.  It also provides that the accountant of the courts of justice shall, when a deposit is made in money, invest such money as requested by the depositor.  Paragraph (d) provides that the income derived from the authorised investment shall be paid to the depositor; paragraph (e) provides that the accountant of the courts of justice shall, at the request and cost of the depositor, vary such investments-on the instruction of the depositor; paragraph (f) provides that the depositor may, at any time, apply for the return in whole or in part of so much of the deposit as has not been paid out in pursuance of an order of the High Court under this Act; paragraph (g) provides that the accountant of the courts of justice shall return so much of the deposit as has not been paid out six months after application for its return has been made, and shall inform the Minister immediately; paragraph (h) provides that the following matters shall be governed by rules of court and no order of the High Court shall be required in connection with any of them, that is to say, the payment of income from the securities in which the deposit is invested, the variation of such securities and the return of the deposit.

      <P>The Minister put, apparently with some care, Section 13 into this Bill, but now, without any discussion in the House and with no advertence to any difficulties that might arise in connection with it, he proposes to scrap it entirely and to substitute a new one for it.  The new section indicates a departure, in many notable respects, from the section originally introduced.  Would the Minister say what inherent defects there were in Section 13, as printed in the Bill, and tell the House what is the explanation <Col N="309" /> for the sudden change indicated by its deletion, and the substitution of the new section?</P>

Under the section as it originally stood, such an order would be required to do any of these things.</P>

      <P>This amendment reflects a remarkable improvement on the original section in the Bill.  If the Minister showed the same sweet reasonableness in connection with other sections, the measure would, I think, get a very much better reception from the House.  In the original section it appeared to me that the right was being given either to the Minister or to the Accountant of the Courts of Justice to regulate, to some extent, the manner in which the investments would be made, whereas under this new section that right is being conferred entirely on the trade union.  I think this new section represents the best effort that the Minister has so far made to improve the measure.</P>

      <P>That paragraph would seem to imply that a period of six months must elapse, from the date of the making of the application for its return, before a union can get its money back.  Would the Minister say what is the necessity for stipulating a minimum period of six months in a matter of this kind?

      <P>With regard to paragraph (h), if the matters set out there are to be governed by rules of court it is quite possible that these may require an order of the High Court before a payment out will be made. The Minister said that the matters referred to are to be governed by rules of court and that an order of the High Court will not be required to do any of them, but if the rules of court state that such an order is necessary, where is the Minister then?  Paragraph (a) provides that every deposit shall be made with the privity of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and shall, when made, be under the control of the High Court.  The money is then, if it is governed by rules of court, in exactly the same position as money that  is paid into the courts for the <Col N="311" /> benefit of minors.  If the money has to be paid out on their behalf, application will have to be made to the court and an order made for payment out. I want the Minister to be quite sure that there is not a definite contradiction in the last paragraph, which says that all these matters are to be governed by rules of court and that no order of the court is to be required in connection with any of them.  If, by the rules of court, under which the money is lodged, an order is necessary for payment out, then where are you? You say in the last paragraph that no order is necessary while you also state that these matters will be governed by rules of court.  Where are you in these circumstances?</P>

As a member of the union, I object to that money being paid out and I come into court and say I am exercising my ordinary equitable rights, that money of which I am part-owner is on equitable deposit, held in trust for certain specified objects, and that nobody has any authority to pay that money out without an order of the court, since it is governed by the rules of court.

      <P>I am not sure that paragraphs (f) and (g), taken together, do not defeat the object which, <Col N="314" /> apparently, the Minister has in mind. To a certain extent, the period of six months is provided for the purposes of enabling satisfaction to be made with reference to the order of the court for payment out of the deposit.  If you look at paragraph (f), you will find that it provides that the depositor may, at any time, apply for the return of the deposit or so much thereof as has not been paid out in pursuance of an order of the High Court.  That does not provide for the contingency where, after an application is made, an order of the court is made directing portion of the deposit to be paid.  Paragraphs (f) and (g) would suggest that the application should be made in anticipation and that would so to speak, freeze the order of the court.  I think that paragraphs (f) and (g) do not carry out the Minister's intentions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite unable to give us any intelligible explanation of Section 13.  Apart from such guesses as we can make as to the: intention behind the amendment to Section 13, we are really in the dark as to what is intended by the Minister-We must rely on such shadowy conclusions as we can derive from our own judgment.  Paragraph (g) prescribes a minimum period of six months for payment out of the deposit even if the money is available, is easily realisable and there is no lien on the deposit in respect of any other judgment.  We are still at sea as to the precise meaning of that sub-section or any of the. other sub-sections.  To me, the amendment tabled to Section 13 is just as objectionable as Section 13.  In order to protect the interests of their members, trade unions will, in future, have to deposit £2,000 with the High Court. I do not believe that it is fair to make a union deposit £2,000 with the court, or with the functionaries of the court, in order that it should be at liberty to defend the economic interests of its members.  The gist of trade union organisation, to me, is that the union should be a legitimate body, formed for the purpose of protecting the economic interests of its members, that it be efficiently and democratically controlled, and that it comply with such <Col N="315" /> requirements as trade union law, designed to promote trade unionism and not to strangle it, prescribes.</P>
      <P>In this section we are making provision for the deposit by trade unions of moneys which they may have accumulated for the purpose of protecting the interests of their members We are going to put on each union an obligation to put up a minimum of £2,000 and this £2,000, which should normally be available to the union for defending the economic position of its members, is to be frozen in court.  It is not to be available to the union but is to be available to such folk as may desire to prosecute the union in respect of any of the offences which are catalogued in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am doing my best in the face of a barrage of disorderly interruptions. Section 13 very clearly provides the machinery under which the deposits provided for in the Bill are to be made with the High Court. The deposits are to be made by the trade union with the High Court and this section provides the machinery to be complied with, in making the deposits and the method of verifying the deposits.  It is intimated that the deposits <Col N="317" /> need not necessarily be in cash, that they may be made up wholly or partly of securities.  Once a deposit is made, if you subsequently make an application to set it hack, you must wait for a minimum period of six months and you may have to wait for two years.  My objection to that machinery is that I do not think it is necessary that the High Court should get this money from trade unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A trade union may be a trade union and have no money at all. It may very well have spent all its money in the service of its members, in financing a strike against injustice, but as a result of this Bill such a union cannot function at all unless it deposits this money in the High Court, and unless it keeps there, from time to time, the minimum deposit required by the Schedule.  My objection is that the money which trade unions have been able to accumulate over the years is money which should be available to them to finance any of their legitimate trade union activities.  It should not be frozen in the High Courts but should be made available to the members.  The Minister might very well consider the question of not making the cheque book the sole test of legitimate trade unionism in this country.  That is what the Minister is doing.  He is insisting that wealth, the accumulation of property and securities, shall be the title-deed of an organisation to be regarded as a legitimate organisation.  Even if a trade union may not have an abundance of money, they may have sufficient assets to satisfy the distraint of any court in the land, but the Minister is not prepared to take the word of the union or their auditor on that matter.  He is not prepared to be satisfied by an examination of their accounts.  He wants to go further and, Shylock-like, he insists on getting from the unions a minimum deposit of £2,000 so that a garnishee order may be obtained against the union if, for any reason, it infringes some of the crazy regulations made under this Bill.  I do not think <Col N="318" /> that is right or proper, unless of course one wants to do what the Minister wants to do, to strangle trade unions under the Bill by requiring them to make this deposit.  A trade union can have all the attributes, all the standing and prestige of a recognised labour body and still be unable to make the deposit.  It is unfair, if it is in a position to guarantee that it is capable of fulfilling any obligation moral or financial that may be imposed upon it, to require it to make a deposit of £2,000 with the High Court when making that deposit means that the trade union may be depriving itself of money which it needs to finance legitimate trade union activities.</P>
