      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that after more than one and a half year's special appeal for the manning of the Local Defence Force the response from young men, between the ages of 18 and 23, has been practically negligible; and in face of the continuance of the danger that threatens our country will he consider the enforcement of compulsory service to ensure the proper training of the full man power of the country.</P>

      <P>The response which has been made to date to appeals for volunteers for the Local Defence Force has not been unsatisfactory, but there are still a number of physically suitable and otherwise eligible members of the community who have so far refrained from offering their services. While fully realising that the force is an essential part of our defence organisation and one in which there is particular need for the services of active, physically fit young men, the Government proposes, for the present, to continue to rely on appeals to those who have not yet joined the Local Defence Force to serve voluntarily.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not realise that repeated joint appeals were made to our people to join the ranks of the Local Defence Force and that far greater effect would be lent to these appeals were we in a position to say that we could put in their hands equipment which would match their valour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that we should like to see a rifle in the hands of every member of the Local Defence Force, but at the same time it is a fact that for the one man who is armed there is work that five unarmed men could do.  As I have said on a number of occasions recently, we cannot say until we have got, in the first instance, the regular Army raised to the optimum strength that we have set ourselves, that we are using the equipment to the very best advantage.  In regard to that, I can only say that every effort is being made and, as I pointed out before, you can arm a man in a night but you certainly cannot train a man to be a good soldier in a night.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach undertake to those who have joined the Local Defence Force that time will not be wasted in considering what might be done to conscript people until the maximum effort has been made to perfect the organisation and the training of the men that are there at present, to inspire them with confidence in the job they may have to do, and to ensure that they will be fully prepared?</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that we are not at all anxious to bring in conscription, and I feel that it will not be necessary.  The only reason I have used the phrase &ldquo;for the present&rdquo; is that we do not know what the situation in the future may be and we do not want anyone to assume that circumstances may not arise in which we would be prepared to take that step if it were necessary.  I do not want anybody to think that there is any suggestion of the immediate contemplation of conscription.  Every possible effort will be made to utilise the forces which we have got.  I do not regard the response to our appeals as unsatisfactory at all, but anybody who goes through the country and sees the parades that I have seen must know that one can see on the sidewalk looking at the parade quite a large number of people whose places one would imagine would be in these parades.</P>

      <P>Well, it is the same thing.  I asked the Taoiseach if he is quite satisfied that we are getting into the ranks of the Local Defence Force young men between the ages of 18 and 23.  I have had a large experience of recruiting for the force and I know that we got quite a number of men of 30 years of age and over, men with responsibilities, but the number of boys we have got between 18 and 23 is negligible.  These are the young men who are sneering at us from the sidewalk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the recent case in the Central Criminal Court of the People versus Chapman and Town the circumstances leading up to the plea of guilty in one of the 24 charges preferred <Col N="1024" /> and to the entering of a <i>nolle prosequi</i> in respect of the remaining charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will say who was responsible for withdrawing 23 of the 24 charges preferred in the Central Criminal Court on November 11th against Walter Chapman, Managing Director of Messrs L. Jordan and Co., Ltd., Ennis, and Ted Town, another director of that company; whether he is aware that Messrs. Chapman and Town were charged originally with conspiracy, fraudulent conversion and the uttering of forged documents, and whether on the acceptance from the accused men of a plea of guilty on one count only no objection was taken on behalf of the State, and, if so, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The case of the People v. Chapman and Town was fully opened by State Counsel before the court and jury on the 6th November.  The charges included two counts of conspiracy, five counts of fraudulent conversion, one of attempted fraudulent conversion, nine counts of uttering forged documents and six of falsification of books.  These counts were, of course, interrelated, and on behalf of the State it was charged that they all implied either fraud or deceit.  The evidence of the secretary to the company, including his cross-examination, was given to the court.  Copies of the depositions of all the witnesses were, in accordance with the usual practice, available for the trial judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the conclusion of the second day's hearing the judge sent for both the counsel for the prosecution and for the defence and informed them of certain views he had then arrived at on the statement of the case by the State counsel and on the evidence and cross-examination of the secretary to the company, and which he subsequently announced in open court.  The judge's views and his recommendations were communicated to the Attorney-General by counsel that same evening, following which the Attorney got into touch <Col N="1025" /> with the judge.  The judge informed him that he had come to the conclusion that even if the accused were convicted on all counts, he did not consider the case one for imprisonment but for the imposition of a money penalty.  As a result of his discussion with the judge, and having regard to the great weight and authority which must always be attached to the views of the judge in charge of a case, the Attorney-General agreed to have the case dealt with on the acceptance of a plea of guilty to one of the charges, which meant not proceeding with the other outstanding charges.  It was in these circumstances that the accused persons pleaded guilty to uttering a forged invoice with intent to deceive and the plea was accepted by the trial judge, whose view of the entire case can be summarised by the following extract from his judgment.  Addressing the accused he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only factor in your favour is that while irregularities and falsification of invoices were illegal, the element of fraud as between the two companies is not, in my judgment, sufficient to justify my sending you to prison.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear from this that the judge was taking the entire facts of the case into consideration although he was ruling on one count only.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, add that some months previously, when the case was listed for hearing before the then presiding judge at Green Street, it was proposed on two occasions that the Attorney-General should agree to the acceptance of a similar plea to that which was ultimately accepted by the judge, and, on the case as it appeared to him at that stage, he declined to accede to these applications and decided that the trial should proceed and be dealt with in open court by a judge and jury in the ordinary way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the fact that there is grave public concern arising out of the circumstances in which the State found it necessary to prefer 24 charges against <Col N="1026" /> the defendants in this case; that the public are in no way assured by the termination of this trial and the ease and willingness with which the Attorney-General consented to the withdrawal of 23 out of the 24 charges which presumably had been deliberately framed against the accused? Is the Taoiseach further aware that, as a result of the weak and vacillating attitude apparently taken by the Attorney-General in this case, the secretary of the company who was available as a State witness and who reported the admitted irregularities in this firm, has lost his employment?  If that is the type of reciprocity which has been dealt out to the secretary of the company by the two defendants, apparently in consideration of the Attorney-General weakly agreeing to withdraw 23 of the charges which were deliberately framed against the defendants, does the Taoiseach consider that that type of trial and that type of result are calculated to inspire public confidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, of course, that the public took a very great interest in this case.  But it is not right to suggest that there was anything weak or vacillating about the Attorney-General.  I have here a full report of what has happened and, in my opinion, the Attorney-General behaved very properly.  When a case comes to court it is in the hands of the judge, and there was nothing done in this particular case that is not in accordance with practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether the State proposes to do anything to ensure fair treatment for the secretary of the company, whose public-spirited action was commended by the judge, and whose action brought to the notice of the Government the fact that, according to the charges formulated by the Attorney-General, these two defendants were conspiring to deprive the State of £11,000 in revenue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that it is an unusual thing for a judge in a case of this kind to send for counsel before he delivers his judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that there was nothing unusual in the case at all.  It seems to me that when the judge is seized of a case like that it is out of the hands of the Attorney-General; it is in the hands of the judge, and, so far as I am aware of the practice, there was nothing unusual in what was done.  Suppose a trial like that were to last for a large number of days at considerable expense and, at the end of it, the judge were to say: &ldquo;Very well, my opinion is the opinion I was able to form after hearing the case for a day or two and all the costs could have been saved if my advice were taken&rdquo;?  The judge finally is the person in charge of the case once it comes into open court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>How did the Attorney-General justify the preparation of 24 charges against these defendants and then weakly consent to the withdrawal of 23 charges?  Surely there ought to be some consideration given to the preparation of charges if you can prepare 24 charges in that light-handed fashion and then, as if it means nothing to the prestige of the State or the prestige of the Attorney-General, withdraw 23 of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to know well enough that various charges are put forward, sometimes alternative charges, in accordance with the evidence. I say there was nothing weak in the action taken by the Attorney-General. He has to recognise and everybody has to recognise that when a case comes before a judge it is in his hands&mdash;the case, as a whole, not one particular count&mdash;and the extract which I have read indicates that the case as a whole was before the judge. Then, dealing with the case as a whole, he asked the counsel to see him and gave them at an early stage in the case what he thought would be his ultimate view.  The only point then was whether to continue the trial over a number of <Col N="1028" /> days and, at the end of it, possibly be told by the judge in charge: &ldquo;I was able to give you at an early stage in this case, from my examination of the evidence, what was likely to be my final opinion.  Nevertheless, you insisted, notwithstanding the fact that I am in charge, on continuing this case and wasting money and time for ten days.&rdquo; We have to remember that when a judge is seized of a case it is in his hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not trying the case here.  We have not got the evidence and all the material in front of us.  We have to rely on our judges. We cannot have it both ways.  This House is very insistent that the rights and privileges of judges should be respected, and that they should be put in a position of independence.  We are not, and even individuals who may have read the case are not in a position to know all the facts.  Otherwise there would be no need for the courts at all.  We established courts in order that the full facts of a case should be investigated, and we put judges in charge of the courts with liberty and responsibility to deal with cases. Everything done by the Attorney-General in this case was done as the result of the suggestion of the judge who was trying the case in open court.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told you, this case was going on for two days.  All the depositions were available to the judge and he had heard the examination and cross-examination of the secretary. So far as it was possible for the Attorney-General, all the facts were put in front of the judge at the time. It does happen, as anybody who has been investigating anything knows, that at a certain stage you are able to form an opinion, an opinion from which you are not likely to be changed by anything that may happen subsequently. You are able to form a definite opinion and apparently the judge formed an opinion here that the case as a whole was one in which he was not going to imprison the accused, that he was going instead to inflict a money fine.</P>

      <P>The export of bank notes by post from the United Kingdom is prohibited but I understand that, in practice, postal packets enclosing remittances in bank notes from the Irish workers, referred to by the Deputy, to residents in this country are allowed to proceed where the amount involved is small.  These workers have, of course, at their disposal the alternative means of sending remittances specified in the first part of my reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Inquiries have been made into the claim of Timothy Dunne of Turf Bank, Percy Place, Dublin, for the issue of a licence. Licences were granted to Mr. Dunne on 26th July and 20th August, 1941, for the removal of 130 tons of turf from Pullough, Offaly, and the Minister <Col N="1035" /> is informed that no grounds exist for the issue of a further licence, or for any increase in the quantity of turf for which licences have already been issued.</P>
      <P>The prohibition on the removal of turf from the scheduled turf areas, except under licence, was part of the policy decided on by the Government, as explained to the Dáil by me in the debate on the Adjournment on 30th October, 1941.</P>

Why drive out this man and others like him, such as Mr. Gordon of Harold's Cross?  These are two old Dublin traders who have been engaged all their lifetime in the business.  Why drive them out?</P>

Jordan and Co., Ltd., Ennis, were charged with conspiracy, fraudulent conversion and the uttering of forged documents, etc., to the effect that the profits of the firm in question, in particular instances, amounted to 80 per cent. and, whether, in view of the monopoly character of the business in which the firm is engaged, he will take steps to restrict the making of excessive profits in this instance; and, if so, whether he will announce the measures which he proposes to take to prevent monopoly concerns of this character exploiting the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I have seen the reports of the court proceedings in this case, but I am not aware that it was stated in evidence that the profits of the firm in question amounted to 80 per cent. As regards the second part of the question the aim of price control is to ensure, as far as practicable, that prices charged for goods to consumers in this country are not excessive.  The profits earned by any firm may be influenced by factors other than prices charged to consumers here.  In the case of this particular firm I am at present considering what further steps are necessary and practicable to control prices charged for its various lines of products.  I can assure the Deputy that in the case of every concern, where there is any evidence to justify charges of conspiracy, fraudulent conversion or uttering of forged documents, criminal proceedings will be instituted without hesitation; and in this connection I should mention that the criminal proceedings to which the Deputy refers were instituted as a result of information which came to the notice of my Department and which was promptly furnished to the Attorney-General.  I may add that, apart from any question of irregularity, it has always been the practice of my Department to devote special attention to the accounts of concerns which are in the position of being sole suppliers of goods of a particular class.</P>

    <P>That statement is contained in a paper published under the slogan of &ldquo;Truth in the News.&rdquo;  Even if truth does not get into the editorial articles, it sometimes gets into the news.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Transfer of the registration of a householder for tea is not facilitated except where the shopkeeper concerned has contravened the provisions of the tea rationing scheme by accepting the registration of a greater number of householders than he would be in a position to supply out of the monthly tea quota available to him under the rationing scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he will eliminate from price-fixing orders provisos that prices charged at a prior date will continue to be charged after a standard price has been fixed, as in the flour price order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally that fixing prices of commodities by reference to the prices charged at a particular date is not very satisfactory. Orders, however, fix maximum prices which tend to become minimum prices and cases occur in which through custom in a trade or through the more advantageous situation of certain traders lower prices obtain than the maximum fixed by order.  The proviso mentioned by the Deputy is intended to maintain the lower prices as long as possible or until such time as developments in the price situation of a particular commodity warrant uniformity of price throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in certain country towns you had all the merchants of the town charging 1/8 a lb. for butter, with the exception of perhaps one merchant, who in an <Col N="1043" /> effort to keep prices down while prices were uncontrolled, charged the lowest that he could possibly afford 12 months ago, and that in the new situation the reward for his zeal in attempting to keep prices down is that all his rivals are entitled to get 1/8, while he is restricted to 1/7?  Is the Minister also aware that a similar situation exists in regard to flour: that where one man got 3/1 while prices were uncontrolled, his rivals are now entitled to get 3/2 according to law, having charged up to 3/6 while prices were uncontrolled.  But the man who sought to do his duty is now restricted to 3/1.  That does not seem equitable or just.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel inclined to agree generally with the Deputy.  I felt it was undesirable, in some cases, that the effect of the order fixing maximum prices should be to increase the price to some people.  In my view, this arrangement of fixing prices in relation to prices charged previously, can best be all wiped out.</P>

    <P>In these costs no provision is made for overhead costs and administration charges of Fuel Importers (Éire), Ltd., nor is any provision made for loss due to pilferage or shrinkage of the turf.</P>
    <P>The overhead expenses of the company have been estimated at 4/6 per ton.  It will be appreciated that this figure can only be an estimate as it is not possible at this stage to say what total quantities of fuel will ultimately be handled by the company.</P>
    <P>The cost to be borne by the company for shrinkage of turf has been estimated at a minimum of 20 per cent. On this minimum it is estimated that the company will suffer an added cost of approximately 12/6 per ton under this head.  This figure is, of course, purely an estimate as a number of varying factors affect this cost.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the average price which Fuel Importers (Éire) Ltd. will realise on sales of turf at present prices is 50/6 per ton.  It will thus be seen that without having any regard to the company's overhead costs and administrative expenses or of turf shrinkage the company will suffer a loss of 1/- per ton on this price.</P>
    <P>Dublin wholesale distributors are allowed a margin of 6d. per ton on their wholesale sales and retailers are allowed a margin of 16/- per ton on their sales.  The 16/- margin is based on the ascertained costs of Dublin coal merchants for distributing coal, and on the basis of the information at present available to me I am satisfied <Col N="1045" /> that this margin will not yield an excessive profit to these merchants.</P>
    <P>The wholesale and the retail merchants have not been handling turf in the present quantities for a sufficiently long period to allow for a detailed examination of their costs of distribution of turf.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to meet the turf requirements of Dublin from the Listowel area, and it has been found necessary to transport turf from areas such as Mayo involving freight costs higher than 16/9 per ton.  The price of 25/- per ton at Listowel is comparable with the prices charged free on rail at loading points in other areas.</P>
      <P>The cost of turf delivered on rail at Dublin is not the final cost, as handling and delivery charges must also be added.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to my answer given to-day to Deputy Maolchatha's question relating to turf prices.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he refuses to grant licences for the export of mussels or other shell-fish in bags unless bags for the purpose are specially sent over to this country by the British importers of the shell-fish, and whether he is aware that this is killing the industry here both because of the delays (in the customs and otherwise) in the delivery of these bags and because the exporters here are at the mercy, in the matter of prices, of the importers who send the bags across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to numbers 21 and 22 together.  Having regard to the present scarcity of sacks and bags and to the necessity for conserving <Col N="1052" /> stocks in the country for essential purposes I have found it necessary to refuse to grant licences generally for the export of sacks or bags containing mussels or winkles except in cases where satisfactory evidence has been produced that the containers have been specially imported at recent dates for the purpose of the export trade.  The prohibition on exports is not, of course, confined to sacks containing mussels and winkles.  I am aware of the nature of the sacks used in the particular trade to which the Deputy refers, but the supply position is such that internal commercial users may have to lower the standard of their requirements and avail of bags which would not normally be regarded as suitable for their purposes.  I am prepared now, as I always have been, to grant licences to facilitate this export trade, where satisfactory evidence is produced to me that an arrangement has been made for the return to this country of the empty bags or where a licensed sack and bag merchant certifies that the bags to be exported are unfit for any other purpose.  I regret that I cannot exercise any control over the price charged externally for sacks or bags to be imported into this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is taking any and, if so, what steps to control the retail price of fish, and whether he will state what action he proposes taking regarding the selling of fish retail in Dublin at prices which are 300 per cent. in excess of those realised at the corresponding period in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of fixing retail prices for fish has been considered, but up to the present it has not been found to be practicable. Supplies are restricted and spasmodic, and turnover on the trade is considerably curtailed.  I am satisfied that retail fish merchants are not making excessive profits although prices are considerably higher than they were in 1939.  In the past 12 months only two complaints have been received as to prices of fish, and these were not substantiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it justifiable for him not to take steps to control a valuable food commodity like fish, the price of which has increased by 300 per cent. to the consumer since 1939, having regard to the Standstill Wages Order No. 83?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that the Wages Order No. 83 has anything to do with that.  I take it that the risks by those who catch fish have increased by 300 per cent.  The import of fish has ceased, and the very limited supplies available vary from week to week, and there is no practicable method for their disposal except that of auction.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether the estimated cost of converting pork into bacon is 28/- per cwt., and, if so, whether he will cause inquiry to be made into the price of 160/- per cwt. at present charged for green bacon when current price of pork is 111/- deadweight at the factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of converting pork into bacon varies considerably, depending largely on the volume of output, the efficiency of the individual bacon factory, and to a certain extent the location of the factory.  The average, however, may be taken at present to be somewhat less than 28/- per cwt. I am advised that a reasonable yield of bacon from pork is 75 per cent., so that the prime cost of green bacon is about 150/- per cwt. when it is kept in mind that a percentage of pigs is purchased at liveweight prices.  The conversion charge has to be added to this figure, as well as such items as wholesalers' allowances and the receipts from offals deducted.  The prices of bacon are constantly under review in my Department in the light of the changing factors in the industry, but I am satisfied that the present price of 160/- per cwt. of green bacon delivered to a retail merchant is reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstood me.  On the assumption that pork yields 75 per cent. of its weight of bacon, the prime cost of the bacon is 150/-.  The conversion cost is somewhat less than the 28/- mentioned by the Deputy, but there are other factors which indicate that 160/- is not unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.  I am aware of the proceedings referred to in the Questions.  The company concerned do not hold a new manufacture licence under the Control of Manufactures Acts.  A licence granted to the company on the 15th November, 1934, was revoked at the company's request on the 9th October, 1939, following a public issue of shares, when the company became qualified under the Control of Manufactures Acts to engage in manufacturing operations without a licence.</P>
      <P>No monopoly has been granted to this company.  While it is correct that, in respect of some of the lines of goods manufactured by the company, there is at present no alternative source of supply, it is, and always has been, open to any Irish firm to enter into the production of these goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the wages and conditions of its workers, whether juvenile or adult, <Col N="1057" /> are concerned, these, I understand, are regulated in the ordinary way by agreements between the firm and the trade unions concerned, subject, of course, to the existing law and regulations relating generally to industrial employment. The last inspection of this firm within a comparatively recent period did not indicate any breach of the general regulations governing such employment. This company, like other industrial concerns, furnishes to the Department at regular intervals and on a strictly confidential basis figures of the numbers of its employees, indicating the numbers of boys, girls and adult males and females.  As these figures, however, are obtained, as in the case of all other industrial concerns, on a confidential basis, I am not at liberty to disclose them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports have been received in regard to the unsatisfactory condition of certain cooked meats exported from <Col N="1070" /> this country to Great Britain.  It is understood that these reports had reference to meats which had been in Great Britain for a considerable time before coming to the notice of the local health authorities.  More recently samples of cooked meats were taken on arrival at British ports by representatives of the Ministry of Food and as a result of this examination the Ministry of Food prohibited imports as from midnight on 30th November.</P>
    <P>Steps were taken some months ago to regulate the manufacture and export of cooked meats.  Manufacturers were licensed and preparation of the meats permitted only on licensed premises. Owing to the perishable nature of the commodity and unavoidable delays in connection with present facilities for transport and distribution there is difficulty in ensuring that it will reach consumers in good condition.</P>
    <P>I am having the whole question of production of cooked meats for export examined, but can give no indication at present as to when, if at all, the trade can be resumed.</P>

Where, however, any of these persons had grain properly acquired as seed stocks, that grain was not impounded; (4) no compensation will be paid, but prices will be paid to the persons concerned approximating to the prices which they would have received if they had lawfully purchased the grain from growers and re-sold it as provided for in the Emergency Powers (Cereals) Order, 1941; (5) I do not consider that any special provision for seed supplies is necessary for the districts in which the above-mentioned grain was impounded.  I doubt whether any of the grain impounded would ultimately have been sown if it had been allowed to remain in the hands of the persons in whose premises it was impounded.  I am aware that in West Cork and adjoining areas large quantities of grain, particularly barley, purporting to have been sold for seed purposes last spring, must have been otherwise used as no corresponding grain crops were produced in those areas; (6) the action taken was necessary because the persons concerned had paid prices in excess of those fixed by Government order, or had purchased and were using the grain without having obtained authority to do so. Their activities were responsible for creating a &ldquo;black market&rdquo; and were interfering seriously with the equitable distribution of the grain harvest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the answer to this question is rather lengthy, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The results to date of the application of Part V of the Vocational Education Act to the area of the County Borough of Cork are quite satisfactory on the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Practically all the boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16 years resident in the county borough area are now attending either whole-time or part-time schools, approximately 2,000 being in the former and 1,000 in the latter.  Last session the attendance at <Col N="1074" /> the part-time schools was well maintained and averaged 82 per cent. for the session.  Forty-nine per cent. of the male and 27 per cent. of the female students attending the part-time schools were in employment, and I am glad to learn that their employers facilitated them in every way to attend.</P>
    <P>(3)  The instruction provided by the City of Cork Committee was efficient and well adapted to the requirements of the students.  Particular reference should be made to the instruction in household management, including the preparation of suitable meals for working-class homes.</P>
    <P>(4)  Those who attend the part-time schools follow a prescribed course of 180 hours per session, but the City of Cork Committee has associated with the prescribed course various useful activities which the students are not required to attend but which make a very considerable appeal to them. These activities include instruction in choral singing, drama, physical training, illustrated lectures and visits to exhibitions and places of interest in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>(5)  The general impression in my Department is that the scheme is being well conducted in the county borough area, but it would be necessary to have two further sessions' experience of its working before coming to any general conclusion.  Furthermore, the circumstances under which the scheme is being conducted must be regarded as being very favourable.  Suitable accommodation is easy to obtain and the services of experienced teachers are readily available.  At some convenient time it is my intention to have experiments conducted in one or two other centres where the conditions are not so favourable.</P>
    <P>(6)  I may say that I have had special representations from the juvenile advisory committee and other organisations in the county borough of Limerick to apply the provisions of Part V of the Act to their area, and it is my intention to seek the authority of the Dáil to make provision in the Estimates for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> (7)  On the question of the final acceptance of the scheme I should prefer to make no statement until further experience is available.</P>
    <P>(8)  On the basis of the expense of conducting the scheme in the County Borough of Cork, the cost in a full year of the general application of Part V of the Act would be £250,000.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication as to what he thinks the cost, at present rates of money values&mdash;I am not asking him to indulge in any speculations as to any changes in money values&mdash;of a referendum would be, firstly, when it does not coincide with a general election, and, secondly, the separate cost when it does coincide with a general election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would be very difficult for me to say what the separate cost would be when a referendum coincides with a general election. The Deputy will understand that the greater portion of the costs would be ascribable to the general election in the case where the two would coincide, and of course, in any case, a lot would depend upon the number of proposals which might be submitted to the electorate by means of the referendum.  Perhaps the best thing would be to say what we think the charge might be if a referendum were to be taken upon a day other than the day upon which a general election was being held.  In that case we might assume that the cost would be very similar to the cost of a general election, and that would be between £40,000 and £45,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 relates to amendments of the Constitution under Article 46.  When a proposed amendment has been passed or is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the first step in the holding of the referendum is the decision of the Government to hold it, and the date of that decision is the point of time at which the taking of the referendum begins.  The decision, of course, corresponds to the issue of the proclamation dissolving the Oireachtas, from the date of which nomination and polling days are calculated. Under sub-section (2) of the section the Minister will appoint the polling day, and his order must issue within seven days after the decision of the Government.  The referendum will <Col N="1087" /> take place not earlier than 30 days nor later than 90 days after the date of the order.  Under sub-section (3), of course, the usual notice will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and that order made by the Minister under the section will be published as soon as it is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever a Bill containing a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution shall have been passed or be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government determines that such proposal shall be submitted by referendum....</P>
      <P>That is the phrase I wanted explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is we have been advised that it does not necessarily follow that, because a Bill shall have been passed or deemed to have been passed by the Oireachtas, a referendum must be taken upon it.  Accordingly a prior decision of the Government has to be made as to whether a referendum shall in fact be taken or not, bearing in mind, of course, that the Bill cannot become law, particularly a Constitution Amendment Bill cannot become law, until it has been approved by the people. No Bill goes automatically from the Oireachtas to the people unless the Government decides that a referendum shall be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a time within the limits of which such a Bill passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas must be submitted to the President for his signature, and, if it is not submitted within the limit of that time, does it lapse or does it remain in a state of somnolence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact under the Constitution there is no time limit within which a Bill to amend the Constitution, after it has been passed by the Oireachtas, must be submitted to the people.  If a decision is not taken to submit it to the people, it will remain in a state of suspended animation until such time as a decision to refer <Col N="1088" /> it is taken.  There does not appear in the Constitution any means for terminating the state of suspension in which a Bill to amend the Constitution may be placed.  It is not felt that in this Bill, which does not touch the Constitution, we can deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it give the Government power, under the amendment that was passed to the Constitution, to do away with the referendum altogether?  We passed an amendment to the Constitution; is it possible under that, on the grounds of public safety, to pass an amendment to the Constitution without any reference to any referendum whatsoever, declaring that, owing to the requirements of public safety, we are amending the Constitution, to say that in this instance a referendum is not necessary?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 is merely to provide that, where the Government has determined to take a Constitutional referendum, and where pending the making of the necessary order a general election has been declared, the referendum may be held on the same day as the general election; similarly if it is convenient, even though the order has been made, it permits the referendum to be taken on the same day as the general election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This section refers to a referendum dealing with ordinary legislation, which must be held within 18 months of the date of the President's decision that it relates to a matter of such national importance that a referendum should be made. Otherwise, in this case of course, if the referendum is not made within 18 months, the proposed legislation lapses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the first two lines of Section 3:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Government determines that an ordinary referendum shall be taken....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, in this case the Government has to decide whether it will submit the proposed legislation to a referendum or whether it will await a general election.  In doing that, of course, it will have to consider the urgency and importance of the legislation from its point of view, and the probability that a general election may or may not take place prior to the lapse of the limiting period of 18 months.  It may decide to await a general election, on the assumption <Col N="1090" /> that such general election will take place inside the 18 months.  If, on the other hand, it makes that decision, and a general election does not take place within the 18 months, and the Government does not at some stage during the currency of the 18 months decide to take a referendum to the people on it, then the proposed legislation lapses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Brennan I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every personation agent duly appointed under Section 17 of this Act may in any and every case where a ballot paper is tendered to a voter ask to see the official mark on the ballot paper and the presiding officer in such case shall on such request tender such ballot paper for inspection to the said personation agent.</P>
      <P>A number of votes have been rendered invalid in the past owing to the fact that the official stamp did not appear upon them.  This amendment is intended to secure that the people present as personation agents can see if the stamp is affixed to the ballot paper before it is tendered to the voter.  I think it is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to accept the amendment because, first of all, the evil is not as great, I think, as the Deputy suggests.  At the General Election of 1938 the percentage of votes disallowed by reason of the fact that the ballot papers were not properly stamped was .027.  There were six constituencies in that election in which, while the number was over 20, it did not exceed 80.  If we exclude these six constituencies, in the whole of the rest of the country there were, I am advised, only 72 out of over 1,011,000 ballot papers which were declared invalid for want of a stamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not tally with the .027.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure was for all the constituencies.  I am saying that in the whole of the country, with the exception of six constituencies, out of 1,011,000 ballot papers, there were only .0072 per cent. of ballot papers declared invalid for want of a stamp. The difficulty in enforcing the proposed provision would be very great in urban constituencies where the great mass of <Col N="1094" /> the voters come in after six o'clock in the evening and where, at least in most of the areas of which I have personal experience, the congestion is particularly grave during those hours.  It is very difficult, as perhaps Deputies know, to secure proper and suitable premises for polling booths, particularly in the city and in urban areas, and I think it would be quite impracticable to enforce this proposal.  The only way in which the evil can be dealt with is, where the presiding officer fails to stamp the ballot papers and where the failure is on such a scale as to warrant attention, is to ensure that he will not be appointed to act in that capacity again.  But, as I say, the extent of the evil in general is very limited and not at all as widespread as is sometimes assumed.  In view of the fact that it would be almost impracticable to administer a provision of this sort, I suggest that the amendment should not be pressed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>I was dealing with this on the previous section.  The Minister has just turned down an amendment on the grounds of impracticability.  Now he is providing for finding the views of the people of the country on an amendment to the Constitution or any Bill, and he is prescribing a system that will make it practically impossible for those who are there on the part of the different people interested to check the matter at all.  When they have rejection in one case and acceptance in another case, it will be exceedingly difficult to keep any kind of a check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult, as we are without experience of the referendum, to say to what extent the provision in relation to the referendum will be availed of, and to what extent it will be necessary to hold more than one referendum on the same day.  But it does occur to me, so far as simplification is concerned, that if we assume that voters are able to vote rationally &mdash;and I think we must assume that; it must be the fundamental assumption indeed&mdash;there is not likely to be any very great confusion if there <Col N="1096" /> should happen to be more than one proposal referred to them on the same day, and that each of these proposals is set out on the one ballot paper.  When the system of proportional representation was first proposed, objection was taken to the fact that you would have a considerable number of names on the ballot paper; but in practice it is generally agreed that there has been found to be very little substance in that objection.  I think the same will apply here: that if the voter can read and write and is competent to decide on a proposal at all, he will have no difficulty in distinguishing one proposal from the other, even if they both appear on the one ballot paper.  If we assume the contrary, that he is not able to distinguish between a number of proposals on the ballot paper and to mark his paper intelligently, then we are thrown back to this situation: that he will have a number of ballot papers presented to him, that he will have extreme difficulty in sorting those out, marking them, folding them up and putting them in separate boxes, as perhaps it would be necessary to do if you are to provide a convenient and workable arrangement for the count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me at any rate that in the experimental stage it would be better to keep the whole machinery as simple as possible, to have only the one paper with the separate proposals set out, and one ballot box to receive that paper.  It is very difficult to make up one's mind in advance of actual experience as to which of these will be the better.  The only thing we have to guide us is that in Australia, where the referendum has been used, there is a provision to the effect that, if two or more proposals are submitted to the people on the same day, they must appear on the one paper.  That seems to me to be almost a necessary corollary, that if two proposals are to be presented to the people, they should, if the time happens to be convenient, be submitted to the people on the one day or at a general election.  I think that if we decide that separate ballot papers should be issued that should be carried to its logical conclusion and we should not have two <Col N="1097" /> referenda on the same day, but that we should submit the proposals on separate days, which would involve an expense of between £40,000 and £45,000 for each referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that neither the Minister nor any of his officials has ever attended an election in which the voting was by the ordinary &ldquo;X&rdquo; method, and there were more than two vacancies to be filled. If the Minister attended a count of that kind, he would realise the real purpose behind the amendment, namely, the difficulty of a check, and a check might be requested in a case where the voting was pretty tight.  If there were, as I have seen, four persons to be elected and some ten candidates for the four vacancies, one paper would be marked with an &ldquo;X&rdquo; after A, B, C, and D, the next with an &ldquo;X&rdquo; after E, F. G., and H, and another with an &ldquo;X&rdquo; after A, C, E, G.  A check is practically impossible in that case, without a recount, and a recount over a thing of that kind, where there would be thousands of votes, is not a very interesting performance.  The question may arise at any time, did the returning officer call out that particular referendum, the referendum with the blue print or the white print, once or twice, and so on.  A check is practically impossible. Even the form of the ballot paper here is departing from that rather peculiar one of the Constitution. I am speaking from recollection.  I think the Constitution voting was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and if a citizen put down an &ldquo;X&rdquo; he spoiled his vote, according to law.  I am dealing with it according to law, as it was laid down.  Here is a new method.  We will take it that a person approves of one measure and disapproves of the other. There is the natural disposition on the part of a person who wants both to say, If you do that you will spoil a vote.  You must either agree with both or disagree with both.  You mark &ldquo;X&rdquo; to approve of one and &ldquo;X&rdquo; to disapprove of the other.  It is mixing. But the real thing is in the count.  If there is a possible chance of the voting being tight and if feeling is running <Col N="1098" /> very high about it people are entitled to look for a recount.  It means hours and hours of work.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have ever referred in this House to any report that has been made of anything that was said in it, but on the last occasion when speaking here on this Bill, I was reported as saying bribery or &ldquo;treason&rdquo; were negligible offences.  I said bribery or &ldquo;treating&rdquo;.  Now, having said it, it cannot be altered.  That is one of the things we are dealing with.  We are making a law that cannot be altered. The Minister knows my view with regard to a referendum.  I think it is all humbug.  Every humbug that goes over there and sits on those benches, when he comes in, wants a referendum, and as soon as he is there he realises how useless and how evil it is and will not have it.  In my experience here in the City of Dublin there was a referendum taken once.  I learned enough during that to know that it was a bit of a joke and likely to be made a bit of a joke.  At any rate, we are going to pass a law for it here and we ought to have it so that it will not be regarded flippantly.  Whatever there is that is difficult and difficult to administer is certainly open to condemnation of one kind or another.  My suggestion now is for the purpose of simplicity, even though it may cost a little more money. It may be the best way of correcting people from having referenda and, in any case, it will make sure that whatever they decide will be decided in accordance with the wishes of the people and not in accordance with the infirmities of the presiding officer.</P>

      <P>Having done that and having taken his decision in relation to it, he will convey that decision in writing to the Taoiseach, and in the writing it is presumed that he will state&mdash;in the form in which it has been represented to him in the petition&mdash;the proposal which he regards as being of such national importance that the opinion of the people should be taken on it.  Therefore, it is contemplated that the writing which the President sends to the Taoiseach will state the proposal in its general form and it will be in that form that the proposal will be expressed on the ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the details of the proposal, I think those who wish to vote on it will have to consult the statute at the post office or the other places where <Col N="1102" /> such statute is to be available for public inspection, but, apart altogether from that, no doubt those who take strong views for or against the proposal will have every opportunity of representing to the people what in fact the proposal contains and what are the objectionable or commendable features in it.  I do not think the public will be in any ignorance as to what they are voting on, but in any event they will have to guide them an authoritative statement of the nature of the proposal, the statement which is contained, first, in the petition which the President in accepting and acting upon has approved of as being a fair and equitable representation of it and, secondly, in the President's message to the Taoiseach.  It will perhaps be mainly upon that representation and that view of it that the people will determine their votes.</P>

      <P>Suppose I am a person who is in a position to object to, say, the Trade Union Bill and suppose I can get sufficient backing for my objection.  In the petition I state what are the things in that Bill to which I object and on which I want a referendum.  I indicate <i>seriatim</i> these points.  Otherwise, I have not stated the ground for my referendum.  That goes to the President.  If the President makes up his mind that it is a fair statement of my reasons for objecting to what is in the Bill, he accepts it and sends it to the Taoiseach.  That then goes on the ballot paper and it may occupy a couple of pages.  It might be the best way, in my opinion, of bringing the matter before the elector.  The ballot paper then will be extraordinarily cumbersome.</P>

      <P>The proposal in the amendment is to allow of a temporary closing of the polling booth for part of a day until the riot has ceased.  I would be very strongly opposed to this amendment, because I think that if a riot has taken place, to the extent that the presiding officer feels it necessary to close the polling booth, we ought to do what we have done in the Electoral Act of 1923, namely, close the polling for the whole of that day.  Suppose a referendum and a general election were being held on the one day, it would be very inconvenient&mdash;it would be more than inconvenient, it would be ridiculous&mdash;to close the polling booth in respect of the general election and to keep it open for some part of the day in respect of the referendum.  If there has been such a disturbance&mdash;a general riot&mdash;and it is felt necessary to close the polling booth at all, then I think it ought to remain closed until such time, at any rate, as the general body of the electorate who vote in that particular district have reason to know that the State is represented there in sufficient force to ensure that peace and order will be maintained.  In certain circumstances it might be very difficult for that news to percolate until the following day.</P>

      <P>the expression &ldquo;duly presented&rdquo; means, in relation to a referendum petition, that such petition either was presented in accordance with this Part of this Act and did not become null and void after such presentation or was presented by the Attorney-General with the leave of the court under the provision in that behalf contained in this Part of this Act.</P>

      <P>Before line 33, page 15, to insert a new definition as follows:</P>

      <P>The amendment is not quite clear.  If it means anything, I presume it refers to the case made for or against the referendum in official publications and, for instance, to the message from the President to the Taoiseach.  I do not think we could ask the court in a case like that to convict the President of having made a false or misleading statement.  He is presumed to be the supreme guardian of the Constitution and is Head of the State.  He must be presumed to take reasonable care to secure that matters referred to the people will be referred is a form which truly represents their nature.  We could not accept the amendment in its present form.</P>

      <P>An attempt was made to bring one in, the effect of which would be that he could not be prosecuted for anything.  Fortunately, it was not pursued.  The point is a very simple one.  A man makes a case for or against the referendum.  We are not interested in that; we are interested in the question whether that is a false or misleading case, either for or against. There is no means of dealing with that at present but there is a means of dealing with it in an ordinary election. A candidate can move in the matter if he is so advised.  Here, there is no power to go to court and stop the evil thing.  The merits of the case can be discussed, with exaggeration if you like, but draw the line at a false or misleading statement.</P>

      <P>The Deputy forgets the provisions of Article 13 of the Constitution. Section 8 (1) of that Article states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment were adopted, I think it would be repugnant to the Constitution.  We should be calling upon the court to decide whether a statement issued in writing by the head of the State to the head of the Government was false or misleading.  That would be repugnant to the terms of the Constitution.  Apart from that, I think that it would be disedifying and that we should not put ourselves in the position of assuming that the President <Col N="1114" /> would be capable of making a false or misleading statement in these circumstances. It is better for us to assume that, so far as the President is concerned, whatever issues from his hand in respect of a referendum is authoritative and true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On that we will vote. Supposing a false and misleading statement was made by some person, a person perhaps not of any great importance, a person whose word might not carry any weight, are we going to upset the referendum by reason of the fact that that false and misleading statement was made by such a person? But suppose the statement has been made by a newspaper and one is able to prove it was deliberately false and misleading, who is going to assess the extent to which it has been misleading, or has influenced the result of the referendum?  Leaving these difficulties aside and looking at the matter in a practical way, is it not clear that statements which are, perhaps, neither deliberately false nor deliberately misleading, but which may have a bias one way or another and which will represent extreme points of view for or against the petition will, in the end, cancel out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we are doing is asking the electorate to form an opinion upon a proposal which is submitted to them on the paper, an opinion influenced, no doubt, by the arguments and statements made for and against the proposal.  I doubt whether a false statement of such weight that it might ultimately influence the electorate would remain uncontroverted to such an extent that its influence would prevail.  We have all the agencies of publicity here in a position to controvert a statement which was manifestly false and misleading and, in the light of that fact, I think we ought to resign ourselves to the practical situation and realise that, whatever proposal is submitted by any body of persons, there will be always more than one point of view, always more than one opinion in regard to it, and we had better let it be assumed that people are expressing their opinions <Col N="1115" /> in all good faith and veracity and let those who have to decide between the various opinions thus expressed be guided just by their own judgement, influenced perhaps by their general opinion of those who make the conflicting statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 34 deals with the ground upon which a petition questioning the validity of a provisional referendum certificate may be presented. It points out that the petition may be presented on the ground that corrupt practices prevailed extensively in a local constituency, that the result of the count in the constituency was incorrect, or that the local returning officer had not conducted the election according to law, or that the total number of votes was incorrect, or that the number of Dáil electors was not correctly stated.  It gives individuals who are interested an opportunity, if they wish to avail of it, to present a petition on one or other of these grounds and, in addition, the Attorney-General is given the general right to petition if he sees fit to do so.</P>

There, again, if a person is alleged to have been guilty of a corrupt practice in such circumstances, the High Court may direct, and will direct, that that person's name should be added, if it is a matter affecting the character and conduct of the person concerned and if he wishes his name to be added.

      <P>On the section, Sir, I should like to make a remark in connection with paragraph (g), the question of lodging full and detailed particulars.  It says here that, save where the Attorney-General is the petitioner, the petitioner shall lodge a full and detailed statement of the particulars of the corrupt practices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that that paragraph might bear a little further consideration, but I think the real exemptor there is that it shall not be necessary for the Attorney-General to serve a copy of his own petition on himself.  However, I think there is something to be looked into there.  It says that where the ground or one of the grounds on which the petition is based is that corrupt practices prevailed, such corrupt practices need only be stated generally in the petition.  This would seem to except the Attorney-General from lodging a full and detailed statement of particulars, whereas it seems to me that it is meant merely to relieve the Attorney-General of the obligation of serving a copy of his own statement on himself.  However, I shall look into it.</P>

      <P>It takes much longer, of course, to mark a ballot paper in this way than to issue papers to people who mark their own ballot papers.  It seems that this is a power which may be exercised at the discretion of the presiding officer.  It might be more satisfactory if such voters were compelled to vote early because there is a lot of dissatisfaction expressed sometimes when it becomes necessary to exercise a discretion in this way.  For instance, people who are engaged at work all day might come in at the close of the poll and if the matter at issue were one in which Labour were interested, the fact that such people were prevented from voting might affect the decision.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that Emergency Powers (No. 98) Order, 1941 (Compensation) Scheme, 1941, dated 17th September, 1941, should be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an order which has been issued <Col N="1128" /> for the purpose of fixing the amount that should be paid by way of compensation where people have suffered personal injuries, whether resulting in death or otherwise, as a result of bombing which has taken place, and naturally it makes provision for any future cases.  An examination of the order brings us up against such astonishing facts that I think it is only necessary to state them, and to hear from the Minister what he has to say on these facts and on the principles behind them.  Deputies may have read in some of the daily papers the other day that a High Court jury, in the case of an accident where a man was killed by an Army car and left a wife and family, awarded £1,700 to the widow and daughters by way of compensation. If an Army aeroplane had been responsible for the death of that man, the jury would, no doubt, have awarded £1,700.  But, if an aeroplane belonging to one of the belligerents had accidentally caused the death of that man, the Minister for Finance, acting for the people of the country and expressing the public will, fixes in the most rigid language under the order, the cancellation of which I ask for here, that the widow and family would not get any more than £600 by way of compensation.</P>
    <P>On the 20th November, as reported in Volume 85, column 845, I asked the Minister for Finance by way of supplementary question to a question on that day:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would the Minister say if, in making claims in respect of loss of life and injury, the intention is to make a claim against the German Government on the basis of the amount of compensation contemplated in the Minister's order fixing the amounts of that compensation?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think so.  We have not got the claims yet, and I should not like to say so definitely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the Minister say whether, before making a claim on such a basis, he will make a statement to the House on the matter?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> The Minister in reply said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I do not understand why, if an Army car kills a man who leaves a wife and family, and a High Court jury decides that the State should pay £1,700, the Minister for Finance, in the distressing circumstances that we have and are likely to have, should fix for a widow and family left without a breadwinner, as the result of an accident caused by an outside aeroplane, a sum of £600, and why in making a claim against the people responsible for the accident this country on behalf of these aggrieved people should only make a claim for £600.</P>
    <P>Again, the order provides for compensation in respect of injury, and I simply take the case of a person who has a wife and five children.  If that man is seriously and permanently injured as a result of a bombing accident, the order provides that the maximum award that may be made for the maintenance of himself and his family is 30/- per week.  Therefore, we get this picture.  Assume it is a British aeroplane which comes down, as some of them have come down, and injures a man who has a wife and five children so as to disable him permanently and seriously.  Under this order he would get a pension of 30/- a week, and, as the Minister suggests, we would make a claim against the British Government for that amount.  But, if an Irish aeroplane happened to be driven across the Irish Sea and came down accidentally in Great Britain and injured a British citizen, as the Minister is aware, the British Government would compensate that man and his wife and family for prolonged and serious disablement at the rate of 68/9 per week, and no doubt would send us the bill.</P>

      <P>As long as the serious disablement lasts, the injured person would get 34/2; the wife 8/4; the first child 6/3, and the remaining children 5/- each, amounting to 69/9. I do not want to go into these details, except to point out that the Irish Government fixes the compensation for its own people at 30/-, and probably will send the bill; that the British <Col N="1130" /> Government, on their basis, would fix it at 68/9 and would send us the bill. I do not understand the order then from the point of view of the comparison that is in the minds of the Irish people of a jury dealing with a particular type of accident, or the comparison where you have the British Government considering their people and the Irish Government considering their people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, if we take a man with a wife and five children who was drawing unemployment assistance in the City of Dublin, he would be entitled to 23/- a week.  The Government have repeatedly emphasised the fact that the payments made under the Unemployment Assistance Act are not intended to be full subsistence allowances. On that understanding, the relief authorities of the City of Dublin invariably add, according to the circumstances of the case, a certain amount by way of outdoor relief to the amount paid by way of unemployment assistance.  They would add between 5/- and 10/- in the case of such a man, depending on the amount of rent he had to pay or particular expenses he had to meet.  Under the recent order dealing with the giving of assistance to persons in particular classes by way of food vouchers for bread, milk and butter, a man receiving unemployment assistance, with a wife and five children, would be entitled to six units of milk, officially valued at 5/3; six units of butter, officially valued at 2/4½; six units of bread, officially valued at 3/-, or a total of 10/7½.  So that the man with the use of all his limbs and in good health, who is unemployed and has a wife and five children, would be entitled to 23/- unemployment assistance, 10/7½ value in food&mdash;milk, butter and bread&mdash;and anything from 5/- to 10/ from the relief authorities in the City of Dublin, or he would get from 38/7½ to 43/7½ to maintain himself and his family.  I do not understand whether the 30/- is intended to maintain a man who is permanently disabled and his wife and children or whether the idea is that his family is to carry on with one foot on this compensation order and another on relief for the rest of his days.  The order <Col N="1131" /> applies in such a way that no person, no matter what his position, no matter what his previous circumstances, no matter what his general requirements, no matter what his family, can get more than 30/- a week.  That is another aspect of the matter that I do not understand and I think we ought to be told something about the principle that is underlying it all.</P>
    <P>There are other details in connection with the order that deserve the most critical examination and that are objectionable in certain ways.  As far as I can see, if a person under 14 years of age is injured he can get compensation to a limit of £25, but if that injury is a permanent one I do not know that there is any provision in the order to cover it.  However, I do not want to go into details.  I simply want to ask what is the principle underlying the fixing of £600 as the maximum payment in the case of the death, say, of a bread-winner and 30/- a week in the case of a man who is permanently disabled, who may have a wife and five children or who may have a larger family.  I think the Minister would be very well advised to turn to the view of things that was taken by the High Court jury&mdash;I saw a similar case in the very same paper.  Gárda accounts of cases have attracted my attention since this order came out.  I think there is a great wealth of example and advice awaiting the Minister if he would review the decisions and opinions that Irish juries have expressed on cases where a breadwinner has been lost.  I do not suggest that the circumstances are always entirely of a type that would guide the Minister, but through the general body of them I think the Minister will find much more guidance than he would find wherever he looked for guidance in the framing of this order.  I submit to the Minister that it really ought to be cancelled.  I submit to the House that by its vote it ought to ask the Minister to cancel it.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to tell the House that it is not necessary to ask him to do so, that he proposes to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, as Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, juries in this city have awarded damages to the extent he has suggested&mdash;£1,700 to a widow and child, probably in the case of death caused by motor accident or something of that kind.  I know that cases of that kind are not uncommon, but I do not think it would be logical to compare an individual case, where a jury has an opportunity of going into all the circumstances of the case and of the family, with a general order such as this is, which is meant to deal with an entirely different set of circumstances.  We know that every day the courts sit juries do award damages, sometimes greater than the modest amount that is the maximum allowed to be paid for the death of the head of a family under this order. The amounts vary as the opinions of different juries vary and as circumstances vary.  That is true.  But could one imagine these same juries being so generous if they were acting in the place of the Minister for Finance?  In the circumstances surrounding us, with no knowledge of what our commitments are likely to be or what the full extent of them ever will be, working in the dark as we are and, unlike Britain that has been mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy, with at any rate limited resources, we have to try to measure what, in justice to ourselves and in justice to the injured parties, we can afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of interest, I might mention that before the present Road Traffic Act was enacted here it was not possible to take an action against the Minister for Finance in the case of injury by any motor car in the Government service.  It was the last Road Traffic Act that I introduced and piloted through Parliament that enabled an action to be taken against the Minister for Finance in such circumstances. It is only since the passing of that Act that a jury can award damages like £1,700 in such circumstances and, of course, juries, not <Col N="1133" /> thinking of themselves as taxpayers, do award what I regard as generous damages in a case where the action is against the Government in the name of the Minister for Finance.  But that is an aside.  We have to consider the position here.  We are not in the war, thanks be to God, but we have suffered damages arising out of the war. Already our liabilities, so far as they can be measured&mdash;we have not anything like all the claims in yet&mdash;are pretty heavy, and we have to go on the basis that we may have to pay all these damages ourselves or practically all. We have to work on that basis and, bearing that in mind, we cannot afford to be generous.  We try to be just but we cannot afford to be generous.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the House how often I, as Minister for Finance, and other members of the Government are attacked from different sides of the House, principally by the main Opposition, for the costliness of the Government, the expense of the Government. We are attacked regularly.  There is hardly a day this House is sitting that we are not told of the costliness and expense of this Government and, on the other hand, whenever any measure of this kind is before the House we are equally vehemently told that we are skinflints, ungenerous, illiberal and unjust.  I try to be just and in all cases, as Minister for Finance, I have to bear in mind that we are already taking considerable sums out of the taxpayers' pockets, and we may have to take all this compensation out of the taxpayers' pockets.  In cases where any of the deaths, injuries, or damage to property are recognised by a belligerent as its responsibility and where that belligerent pays compensation to us, if that compensation is greater than the sum we have paid out, we will pay the excess over to the individual whether it be for personal injury, death or damage to property.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are going to be embarrassed by putting our compensation to our own people on a basis commensurate with our modest circumstances. The persons injured and the persons who suffer damage are entitled to make their claims.  When the foreign Government has accepted responsibility, <Col N="1134" /> these people will make their claim to us and we shall put that claim to the foreign Government and fight as hard as we can to get the utmost compensation from that foreign Government.  As I say, anything received in excess of the amount we shall have already paid out will be paid over to these individuals. I hope we shall be able to get greater compensation for them, when it is properly deserved, but we have to go on the basis that the national Exchequer will bear the liability, whether or not we get any compensation from the foreign Power.  Acting on that basis, I think the compensation, which is based on the terms of the Workmen's Compensation Act, is just.  It is not generous; it is not liberal; but I think it is just, and it is within our competence to pay, especially bearing in mind the fact that we have no idea what the liability which the payment of this compensation to individuals is going to put upon us.</P>
    <P>The case has been made to me that in such services as the A.R.P. services, the L.D.F. and the L.S.F., where similar compensation terms are allowed for, there are, as there are amongst the ordinary populace who may be injured, like the people in the North Strand and the South Circular Road, people in very different circumstances, and that the compensation ought to be measured according to the circumstances of the people concerned.  We cannot proceed on a basis of that kind in arranging a general scheme.  We have to go on the basis of the same compensation.</P>

      <P>I might as well. Great Britain, bearing the great cost of war, not getting an odd accidental bombing but getting a systematic bombing, is able to find money to pay its people who are injured.  If, as a result of bombing, the head of a family in Great Britain, with five children, is so injured that he is permanently disabled, the British Government can spare 68/9 a week to maintain him, and to continue that indefinitely.  Here we are, thanking God that we are spared the ravages of war.  We have, unfortunately, had accidents.  We have had people killed and injured, and this House is asked to accept without question an order by the Minister for Finance that an injured man, permanently disabled, and his wife and five children, are to carry on on 30/- a week, when, bringing our minds to bear on purely relief measures, we ensure that a man in the City of Dublin will get at least 38/7½ to keep himself, his wife and five children, he being in his full strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to discuss this matter in any reasonable way, except to say <Col N="1136" /> that Great Britain with its war, its expenditure and its losses, can provide 68/9, while we provide 30/- per week, and the claim that we are to make against a belligerent Government is based on that figure.  I do not mind that so much.  There may not be very much hope of getting it, and it might be just as well to ask for a small thing as for a big thing.  What I do shudder at is that when, arising out of this tragedy of war, death and disability fall from the sky on a man or woman living and rearing their families, in a Christian country we have nothing to offer them but 30/- a week.  I have not been answered as to whether that is to maintain them or whether they are to get something from relief sources, whether the policy of the Government is that anybody with family responsibilities who is injured during this war is to go to the relief authorities for the rest of his days.  We speak in our Constitution about the sacredness of the family.  Article 41 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and of the State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State the support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State, shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And a woman with five children and a disabled husband is offered 30/- a week by the State as compensation to enable her to keep the home going. What is the use of talking?  The Minister says he will not speak any more <Col N="1137" /> simply because he is asked how a disabled man with a wife and five children can live on 30/- a week.  He will not talk.  What is the use of my talking? The Minister may as well shut down this Parliament if he has reduced it to a condition in which this matter can be discussed in this particular way, <Col N="1138" /> because the matter cannot rest there and the matter will not rest there.  I do not think there is any use in my saying any more about it, except that if the Minister persists in his attitude on this matter, he may shut down this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At the adjournment on the last occasion, when the Second Reading of this Bill was being moved by me, I was dealing with what was not in the Bill rather than with what was in the Bill.  In the course of my preliminary observations I stated that I had introduced this Bill for the general purpose of drawing attention to the necessity for law reform rather than for the purpose of getting a particular Bill through the House.  I understand from a communication I have had from the Minister that he is rather sympathetic to the proposals in this Bill or to something along its general principles. I appreciate his attitude very much if I interpret it correctly as conveyed to me.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the discussion on this particular Bill but wish to make the case that, while I put it down with very attenuated proposals, the purpose I had was rather to find an opportunity to advocate the necessity for a law reform committee.  I am very anxious that the provisions in this Bill should be given legislative effect, but the Bill as it stands does not go far enough.  I may make the case a little clearer by referring to the fact that the actual provisions of this Bill, with the exception of Section 4, are practically a copy of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, in England.  The actual Bill I am introducing does not contain anything like half of the proposals in that Act and which, I think, should be included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the close of my observations on the last occasion, I was dealing with the necessity to provide that, in cases of death caused by the negligence of another person, the dependents of the person so killed should be entitled to get the funeral expenses.  That particular provision is contained in an earlier Act in England&mdash;the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, of 1934.  That Act also contains a provision <Col N="1140" /> which I would like to see the law in this country.  It deals with the effect of the death of a party to a civil action before the actual action comes to a final determination.  As regards the provision for making the negligent person causing death liable for funeral expenses, I do not think the English provision goes far enough.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am talking now on matters more familiar to practitioners than to members of this House, but Deputies will probably be aware that if a person is injured in, say, a motor accident through the negligence of the driver of a motor car, he can obtain substantial damages, owing to the compulsory insurance provisions of the Road Traffic Act.  Although the person injured has a reasonable chance of recovering the amount of damages given to him by a judge or by a judge and jury, in the case of death caused by such negligence of another party the rule was that the death of a party put an end to the action.  If the person lives long enough he may get substantial damages, but if he is dead his dependents can obtain only comparatively small damages which are related merely to the extent of the dependency of certain limited classes upon him. In other words, under what we know as Lord Campbell's Act, if a person is killed by the negligence of another person his estate can get nothing and a limited class of dependents can get only the actual money loss they sustained by reason of the death. Up to the present moment in this country, the actual expenses of burying the person killed by the negligence of another cannot be recovered, and that is clearly an injustice which should be removed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>That particular provision is not in my Bill, as I merely put this down as a token, to show the necessity for amendment of the law in all these matters.  I may give an example of a case I was engaged in last year, where a person was very seriously injured. He was a bachelor and had no dependents whatever.  At the time of the trial in November the suggestion was made that it should be adjourned to January, but we were sufficiently alive <Col N="1141" /> to the position and opposed that, and it was settled ultimately with a very large amount of damages.  Inside a month or two, this man died.  Had the case been adjourned from November to January, the insurance company&mdash; of the defendant in that action, which was really the insurance company ultimately&mdash;would not have had to pay one single penny.</P>
    <P>I think that brings out the point I am making, that there is a rather curious anomaly in connection with the law of negligence and the effect of death in the case where the death has been caused by the negligence of another party.  At all events, it is quite clear that provision for the funeral expenses should be made in this Bill, and also that some provision should be made in reference to the situation where the death occurs between the institution of the proceedings and their final determination.  As I have stated, under Lord Campbell's Act the damages are confined to the actual money loss suffered by a limited class of dependents.  I think, in the case of death caused by negligence, that, irrespective of dependency, those expenses should be recoverable from the person responsible for the death.</P>
    <P>I said before that I have been dealing with what is not in the Bill rather than with what is in it.  I dealt with the first three sections on the last occasion.  May I now make one or two observations on Section 4?  This section contains my own proposals and embodies merely my own ideas.  I think, however, they are such as to commend themselves to reasonable persons giving them a proper consideration.  The proposals contained in Section 4 have not been given effect to in England.  I might explain Section 4 by saying this: A person writes a letter to a newspaper, that letter is printed in the newspaper.  On the face of that letter it appears to be perfectly innocuous. There is nothing to show the editor or the proprietor of that newspaper that there is implicit in the letter a serious libel on another person.  It may be so worded that no care, no reasonable view of the case from the point of view of persons who do not understand the circumstances referred to, would bring them to believe that there was a libel, <Col N="1142" /> or, as we would call it, an innuendo in that letter.  But then it turns out that the letter, which on its face would appear to be quite innocuous to a stranger, contains a libellous innuendo on a third party.  That third party brings an action for libel.  He is entitled to bring an action against the writer of the letter who may not be a mark.  He is also entitled to bring an action against the newspaper.  There is only one set of damages given in that case, and it is given against the writer of the letter and the editor or proprietor of the newspaper.  The plaintiff in the case, the person injured, is entitled to execute for the amount of damages given against the proprietor of the newspaper, leaving the person who is really responsible to go scot-free and, really in a sense, punishing a person who, in the particular circumstances I have mentioned, may be completely morally innocent.  It is to meet a situation of that kind that I have put in Section 4: to enable a judge or a jury hearing an action of that kind to say, where there are several different persons who publish and disseminate a libel, that they are responsible in different and varying degrees, that one set of damages would not meet the situation: that in respect of the person who commits the libel originally, and who is the real person responsible, the heaviest loss should fall on him, but that in respect of the others who publish it, that they are only partially responsible, and, therefore, that a smaller sum in damages should be given against them.  I know a powerful case can be put up against that argument because the Press is a great institution: that it may, in fact, work out oppressively, but at the same time, balancing the situation, I think that the proposals that I have in this Section 4 would enable a judge or jury, on the facts of a particular case, to deal out justice in accordance with the facts of a particular case.</P>
    <P>I think that covers all the proposals in this Bill.  When I say that the proposals in the Bill do not go far enough, I mean they do not comprise what is in the 1934 Bill in England, and they do not comprise what is really in the 1935 Bill in England to the fullest extent.  I <Col N="1143" /> have put down the Bill merely to draw attention to the necessity for some of the proposals that I have adverted to in the course of the remarks that I have made up to date.  I have put it down primarily for the purpose of drawing attention to the necessity for something in the nature of a law reform committee. In the course of various speeches that I have made in this House from time to time, I did draw attention to the necessity for such a committee.  If my recollection serves me aright, I had an amendment down to the last Courts of Justice Act in 1936 calling for a Bill dealing with arbitration.  My recollection definitely is that I was given to understand&mdash;of course there was no binding promise by the Attorney-General at the time&mdash;that he would recommend the introduction of an Arbitration Bill in the course of a few months.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done about that. We in this country at the present time, so far as arbitration is concerned, are dealing with law which is very nearly a century old.  It is entirely out of date, and quite inappropriate to meet the complex facts of the present time.  I think that arbitration could be made a very serious instrument of oppression against a poor person.  I would think, therefore, that one of the most urgent reforms necessary in our law at the present moment is arbitration.  The English legislature has also brought that matter up to date in a recent Act. While I think that Act is not entirely appropriate to our circumstances here, it might form the basis upon which a Bill could be drafted for our consideration to meet the peculiar circumstances here.  I think that arbitration, as a form for the settlement of disputes, is useful.  In some cases it might be, as I say, made an instrument of oppression.</P>
    <P>In passing, I may mention that there are two fundamental matters that I would like to see provided in the Bill. Our law, as I have said, at the present time is entirely out of date.  There is no power for an arbitrator to deal with the question of costs unless a specific reference to arbitration is made in <Col N="1144" /> writing and unless a specific provision is inserted in the reference.  Now, the commonest way in which this matter is raised is in insurance policies.  In practically every insurance policy that is issued, where it covers liability for motor accidents or for anything, there is nearly always a provision to refer the dispute between the assured and the insurance company to arbitration.  I should say that in 99 per cent. of the policies that are issued, there is a reference to the English Arbitration Act in the clause, and there is no reference whatever to the law here.  That causes trouble as to where the arbitration is to be held if the policy is made with a British insurance company. There is very rarely a provision to enable the arbitrator to deal with the question of costs.  You find this kind of situation arising.  There is a motor accident.  The insurance company repudiates liability on a particular ground, and that has to be referred to arbitration.  Now, even if the assured wins the arbitration, there is normally no power in the arbitrator to award the winning party the costs of that arbitration. Deputies can see how heavy the liability might be in particular circumstances. I would like to see a provision in such an Arbitration Bill providing that, whether a contract is a policy of insurance or anything else, disputes are to be referred to arbitration, but that nevertheless it will be within the power of the High Court to say that notwithstanding any agreement a particular case should be dealt with by the courts of justice and in open court.  That is a very essential provision, particularly for the protection of litigants in not very affluent circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the Minister or the House with a reference to all the matters that urgently require consideration by such a committee as I would like to see set up.  I should like, however, to give a short outline of some of the matters that do urgently require reform, with a view to making the case clear that such a committee as I envisage is urgently wanted, and that it would perform a useful public function.  I appreciate that the Minister is concerned with various matters <Col N="1145" /> that must, in the present circumstances, occupy his time and the time of his officials, and, consequently, the particular type of tribunal that I would like to see set up would be one composed entirely of professional men or judges, or both.</P>
    <P>I would have put down a motion some years ago calling for the appointment of a law reform committee to deal with these matters were it not for the fact that I feared at that time that such a committee would be composed of a collection of all the cranks that could be collected in this country, and that our last situation would be worse than our first.  I think, even in the matter of law reform, the number of cranks that could be collected would surpass the imagination.  It was dread of that situation that prevented me at that time from putting down such a motion.  I have sufficient confidence in the Minister to think that he would not collect such a body of cranks and put them on this committee and, consequently, I make the suggestion now.</P>
    <P>The proper personnel of the committee would be professional men who make their living by the law, and who know and understand the problems to be met with in the ordinary rough and tumble of litigation.  I suggest that judges who hear cases and who know the defects and the gaps in our law would be very appropriate members of the tribunal.  Any person connected with business or belonging to any other section of the community could submit suggestions and memoranda which would be given the most careful consideration. The committee could advise the Minister on the various matters in respect of which law reform is urgently required.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been done by a law reform committee composed of the best lawyers in England.  That committee has been sitting during the last few years.  They have made interim reports which are valuable and which contain information that would be of great utility.  I do not advocate here or elsewhere that we should slavishly follow British legislation in everything they pass&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I do say that where there are matters <Col N="1146" /> which are common to this country and England, it is desirable that our procedure in law should, so far as our own requirements permit, be much the same and that even the very wording of the statutes which deal with situations common to this country and England should be as closely similar as possible.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this is not a rich country, and the members of the legal profession have a pretty hard job to make their living, and they have no leisure time to write text books.  The result is that the text books dealing with the law of this country, a law perhaps peculiar to this country, have gone completely out of date and there is very little chance of any great abundance of text books being furnished for the guidance of our practitioners and judges in the future.  For that reason, where there are matters common to this country and England, I think it useful, from the point of view of practitioners and judges, but particularly from the point of view of litigants who want to be advised as to their rights before they embark on litigation, that we should have the benefit of the very rich store of legal lore that exists in England, and especially the text books that are written and kept up to date there.</P>
    <P>No matter what law we pass here, whether it corresponds with the British or not, I am satisfied that we could mould and fashion and interpret that law in accordance with our own ideas. It would be most useful if we could have the guidance of the text books and decisions that are available for the information of litigants before they embark on litigation here.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a few examples of the type of thing that is required.  I have mentioned arbitration.  It would perhaps be better that I should mention the crying need that exists for an amendment of a particular branch of the law, and that is in relation to workmen's compensation.  The Workmen's Compensation Act that was passed in this House is now being administered by our courts.  In the course of the administration of that Act very serious defects have emerged, particularly in relation to provisions <Col N="1147" /> that are in the Schedule of the Act dealing with the amount of money that youthful dependents are entitled to get in the event of a parent being killed in the course of employment.  A number of other matters have emerged and the circuit judges, particularly in Dublin, have had a vast experience of the administration of that Act and they have collected quite an amount of data dealing with defects and difficulties in the Act and indicating various points in which an urgent necessity arises for amendment.</P>
    <P>To pass to another topic, there is the question of the widow's right to a share in her husband's estate if he dies intestate.  The law existing in this country merely provides that on the death of the husband, if he dies intestate and without children, the widow is entitled to get £500 and half of his estate.  It very frequently happens that a man and his wife live amicably together and, through some misfortune, neglect or oversight the husband makes no will, dies unexpectedly, perhaps as the result of an accident, and then somebody at the end of the earth, some remote next of kin, may take half of his estate and leave the widow very inadequately provided for.  That is a matter that requires some reform, and so indeed does the whole law of succession. There is then the old feudal rule of the heir at law acquiring freehold property. That also requires examination and reform.</P>
    <P>The bankruptcy law of this country is entirely out of date.  I think there was a report made some years ago with reference to that particular branch of the law, and there was also something with reference to the law of companies. The Companies Act of 1908 is still the law here.  It is the basis of our company law.  It has been brought up to date in England by the Act of 1929.  I think there is some material in Government departments which would enable the law relating to companies very easily to be brought up to date, and I think there is a fair degree of public demand and certainly public urgency for such a reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> I could give numbers of other examples, such, for instance, as the law relating to hire purchase, in which case the existing law here could be very easily examined into and amended in the public interest.  In many respects our criminal law requires drastic reorganisation and reform.  To mention only one particular topic, there is the spectacle, very frequently met with in the Central Criminal Court, of an unfortunate woman who, in the stress of the birth of an illegitimate child, destroys that life.  We have the old, ancient law that that is nothing but murder.  The British have introduced the Infanticide Act, in 1938, enabling a more humane treatment to be given to the unfortunate person than usually happens here in this country.  We have the necessity here for the prosecuting counsel to indict that young girl, as she very frequently is, for the full crime of murder.  Then there has to be a certain amount of examination of the facts with a view to seeing whether the court or the prosecution will accept some other plea less than the plea of murder.  Perhaps the Minister and some of the Deputies are aware of the story of a judge who, in such a case, proceeded to go through the farce of putting on his black cap for the purpose of sentencing to death a young girl who was indicted for the murder of her illegitimate infant in circumstances in which it was quite clear that the girl did not know what she was doing.  The law, however, required that the judge should go through the ridiculous farce of putting on the black cap and sentencing her to death, and then the Executive Council had to go through the equally ridiculous farce of commuting the sentence to imprisonment for life.  The observation of the judge on that occasion was: &ldquo;Do not be a bit afraid, my good girl; I am going to sentence you to death but nothing will happen to you.&rdquo;  That is a case where, I think, the criminal law requires examination.  We are dealing here with a system of law the whole roots of which are founded in the legal practice and jurisdiction of another country, and I think our whole attitude towards criminal procedure and punishment requires very drastic investigation and reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> I have various other topics, such as the introduction of a law enabling a person to adopt a child legally and properly, with the full implications of statutory adoption.  We have no real power at the moment to enable a person to adopt a child and treat it as its own.  The question whether an illegitimate child who, in fact, was dependent on one who was killed as a result of negligence by someone else, should have some share, after the death of the person responsible for their being, under Lord Campbell's Act, is one that ought to be inquired into.</P>
    <P>Then there is the last example that I intend to give, which is the question as to whether it is regarded as still proper that a person who enjoys considerable wealth, and who has a family, is entitled to leave every single penny of his fortune away from his family and make no provision whatever for them. Again, the British are in advance of us in this respect and, by an Act of 1938, the Inheritance (Families Provision) Act, they have given power to a court to make provision, notwithstanding the particular will, for a widow, an infant son or a dependent daughter, or relatives of that child.  Whether that goes far enough or not is a debatable point, but at all events it is something that, I think, requires to be inquired into here because there exists power here still under the law for a testator to deprive his dependent relatives, his widow and, perhaps, his children, of every penny of his property in favour, perhaps, of some ridiculous idea which masquerades under the name of charity, or to give it to some other object altogether.</P>
    <P>Now, I have only mentioned these cases in outline for the purpose of making the case that I set out to make: that there exists here at present an urgent need for inquiring into various branches of the law with a view to seeing how the law can be reformed to suit our own native requirements and conditions.  I have said that I attach no blame to the Minister or the officials of his Department for this not being done before.  Various preoccupations that have occupied the entire attention of the Minister's Department <Col N="1150" /> for years past have prevented that from being done, and still, perhaps, prevent it from being done. Consequently, I suggest&mdash;and in suggesting it I again emphasise the fact that it is my own convinced opinion&mdash; that the best law reform committee will be one of practitioners in both branches of the profession, as well as judges, and that members of the business community and others can help that committee in its deliberations.  I appeal to the Minister that, if he does accede to my request to have set up a law reform committee, he should carefully avoid, as far as possible, putting on that committee anybody with cranky or preconceived notions about law reform.</P>
    <P>As regards this Bill which I am moving, its provisions, and other provisions, to which I have referred, contained in the two British Acts of 1934 and 1935, are urgently required.  I go so far as to assert that the Bill, in fact, as drafted by me, is not sufficient to cover what I want.  I did not set out to do everything that I wanted.  I merely put down this particular Bill with the minimum in it so that I could, if possible, enlist the Minister's sympathies not merely for the few provisions that are in the Bill but for the general purpose of law reform.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that I am favourable to this Bill, but I find myself in a dilemma which, I think, the Deputy sees himself.  First of all, as he knows, both the Minister for Justice and the Department of Justice were preoccupied with other very urgent and important matters and, as a result, we have not been able to devote our time to legal reforms which are necessary.  I did not at first understand what type of committee the Deputy had in mind, but I imagine, from what he has said, that he has in mind a permanent committee sitting, say, for a number of years and acting whole-time on that work.  I thought at first, when he mentioned the idea of a law-reform committee, that he had in mind a kind of joint committee of both <Col N="1151" /> Houses, but apparently that is not the idea.  I do not know if it is possible, but I myself would like to have it done because I am quite aware that there are several pressing reforms needed, and I do not think the reforms put down in this Bill by the Deputy are the most important.  I should like to say that I was not aware that there was much demand for the reforms suggested in this Bill.  As the Deputy is aware, there were some committees set up under the Courts of Justice Act, and I have not had any representations or any requests from them.  I know that that is one of the duties placed on them, and I thought I would have heard from them if there was such a demand.  However, perhaps they were too busy, or they might not have thought it well to do so.  I know it is one of the duties which have been placed upon them by the 1936 Act.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Costello has been speaking to any member of that committee.</P>

      <P>I have not.  I have not consulted them, but, if I may interrupt the Minister, I want to say that so far as the provisions in this Bill are concerned, although there has been no public demand for them, I think everybody will recognise their urgency.  The mere fact that nobody has demanded them is no evidence that they are not required.  There has been a lot of talk about it, and one of the reasons why I took it on myself to put down this Bill was that I had to do something which everybody wanted but nobody would do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>If the Minister could have it examined in his Department, or by a Select Committee of both Houses, whichever he prefers, and have the provisions of the 1934 and 1935 English Bills examined also, I think it would be desirable that those provisions should be put into effect as soon <Col N="1152" /> as possible, because the provisions in regard to those joint torts arise every day in motor accident cases in the courts.  I think I gave an example&mdash; if I have not done so I intended to do it&mdash;of the sort of abuses that arise from the existence of the old common law rule whereby a person can get more than his damages by holding up to ransom, so to speak, one particular party as against another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any way of doing that, and if it could be done quickly, I should like it to be done. There are a couple of other provisions which I think we would like to have incorporated, and whether it is better to go ahead with this Bill and bring in another one later on I do not know. My own personal attitude is that I would not have brought in a Bill like this at the present time, because, I thought there was a sort of understanding during this present emergency that Bills of this type would not be introduced. I felt that, if I had not some understanding with the Opposition, I would be asked: &ldquo;Have you nothing better to occupy your mind than a matter of this kind?&rdquo;, because I think the ordinary member of the House does not think there is such an urgent demand for this reform.  If they wanted to play politics with me, they might have said: &ldquo;You have an emergency here.  Have you nothing better to occupy your mind?&rdquo;  I did not know whether or not that was the way I would be received if I brought in a Bill of this kind.  I am glad to see the attitude which Deputy Costello has adopted in the matter, and I should be glad to have those and perhaps some other points dealt with.  I quite agree that the reforms in this Bill are necessary. I do not know that I would take over the Bill myself; I think the procedure is to refer it to a Special Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I spoke on this matter last week some changes have occurred.  The price of wheat has been increased, but not in my opinion sufficiently to cover the danger which threatens this country.  I have here <Col N="1154" /> a rough table of figures as to how the wheat last year worked out.  We paid roughly £7,765,000 for wheat altogether. Of that, 290,000 tons were produced by the farmer, according to the Minister's figures, at £4,640,000, and, before one bit of that was milled, £725,000 had been drawn by agents and other parasites. No matter how things work out this year the wheat will cost us £1,000,000 more, even though last year's acreage is grown in full by the farmers.  I do not believe it will; I think that, even at 45/-, we will not get last year's acreage, in view of the shortage of artificial manures.  I am estimating 240,000 tons at £18 a ton, which will amount to £4,320,000.  The agents' fees will be £600,000, and you will have to import 130,000 tons.  If we import it at the Minister's figure of £30 a ton, that will be £3,900,000 to the foreigner.  What I had in mind was the growing of 330,000 tons of wheat here by the Irish farmer at £20 a ton.  That would cost £6,600,000.  Let us import nothing except what we require, namely, about 40,000 tons of hard wheat, which the nice people in Dublin and the nice people in Cork and other cities say must be mixed with the bread to make it palatable for them.  Let us give them their 40,000 tons at £30 a ton.  That will cost £1,200,000 and drying and commission will amount to £825,000. That will mean that our wheat will cost £8,625,000, but it will cost it with this difference, that instead of paying £3,900,000 to the foreigner we will be paying portion of it to our own farmers at home.  I know there is a certain risk, the risk that even at 50/- the farmers would not grow the quantity required.  I suggest to the Government that if the farmers grow 330,000 tons of wheat&mdash;which would mean that only about 40,000 tons would have to be imported&mdash;the Government should guarantee them a price of 50/- a barrel, the understanding being that if they do not grow it they will not get that price.  It is a gamble both ways, but it is giving the farmers of this country an incentive to grow more, the incentive that they will be paid for their labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the agricultural community are sufficiently nationally-minded not <Col N="1155" /> to look for any great profits during the war, but we have got to face the position that they will have very little artificial manures to grow these crops. I suggest to the Government that it would be very good business to offer that incentive now to the farmers.  I suggest that they should say to the farmers: &ldquo;If you leave us with a gap in our wheat requirements of 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 tons&mdash;a gap that could be filled by wheat produced here&mdash;you will get 45/- per barrel, but if you fill that gap and if you save us from the necessity of paying a couple of million pounds to the foreigner for imported wheat we shall give you a bonus of 5/- a barrel on your wheat.&rdquo;  I put that forward as a proposition here before and I think it is a fair and reasonable one.  I am afraid the Minister has been led away in this matter by the catch-cries of certain ranchers in Cork who never did any tillage and never would till anything unless they were forced to do so.  We had the leader of the so-called Farmers' Party down there last week speaking on a motion before the Cork County Council asking for a bonus of £2 per acre on grassland that has been broken up.  Do you think that he had any sympathy with the man who had been tilling all his lifetime?  Not at all; he only wanted the rancher to get his pound of flesh.  I am afraid the Minister has been working on that figure of £2 an acre.  I would suggest that it would be very good business for the Government to say to the farmers: &ldquo;Very well, you save us from the necessity of importing wheat and we are prepared to give you a great portion of the amount we would have otherwise to pay the foreigner for imported wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that arises under this motion and I should like as briefly as possible to deal with it, namely, the price of beet.  When we complain of the cost of artificial manures, we are told that the prices of raw materials have gone up and, therefore, Messrs.  Goulding must still get their pound of flesh.  The price of artificial manure has gone up for the farmer by at least £2 per ton this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> The cost of labour for pulling the beet has also gone up.  Freightage has been increased by the railway company and carriers in general.  In all, the costings have gone up on the farmer by about roughly 9/- per ton.  I should like to know from the Minister from what source that 9/- is to be forthcoming. Surely our industry is as much entitled to have these extra costings considered as either the railway company, the artificial manure manufacturers or the merchants?  A case has been made and figures have been put to the Minister already, and I suggest that the farmers who are tillers of the soil and who are growing beet in order to supply sugar for the country are at least as much entitled to recover their expenses as the bloated aristocrat who is marked down as receiving 6 per cent. on paper but who receives 25 per cent. otherwise.  The time for this debate is, unfortunately, limited.  I do not think there should have been any limit on it as it is a very important matter, but, since such a limit applies, I shall not waste the time of the House by speaking longer.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry would seem to have credited the proposer and seconder of the motion with prophetic powers, but I do not think he was quite justified in that assertion.  We have a fairly long experience in this House and we know that in order to get a motion considered one must be prepared <Col N="1157" /> to allow for the very long period that must elapse from the time it first appears on the Order Paper.  That was what happened in this instance.  However, in putting down our motion we not only considered the circumstances as they stood at that time, but the conditions which we knew would prevail for a considerable time, having regard to the type of administration, the type of Government and the type of Minister for Agriculture which we have.</P>
      <P>I do not want to blame or criticise the Minister for Agriculture very severely.  I feel that he, coming from one of the best agricultural counties in Ireland, and I might say without being personal, coming from a fine agricultural family, can be taken as a man who has a definite sympathy with the farmer and a certain amount of understanding of the position of the rural population but, at the same time, in shaping agricultural policy, not only the present Minister for Agriculture but his predecessor, has allowed himself to be dominated by city interests, by the interests of those who say that no matter what the farmer may demand or claim, the consumers' interests come first and that the farmer's claim for a fair price for his produce must be secondary to the consumer's claim for cheaper and still cheaper food.  We see where that policy is laid down both in this country and in the country which we are inclined to imitate, England, it has led to a steady decline in every branch of agricultural production.  It has led to a steady, I might say a rapid, reduction, in the number of people engaged in agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last week I noticed in an English paper a criticism of farmers in Great Britain for paying £1 per day to Irish agricultural labourers for pulling beet.  What was the reply of the British farmers?  They said: &ldquo;Those men are well worth what we pay them. Those men have acquired a skill, efficiency and speed in their work which cannot be equalled in this country.  The amount of work which they are able to do is colossal.  As a matter of fact, we would not be able to get our beet crop to the factories without the help of these men.&rdquo;  That is a <Col N="1158" /> striking tribute to our Irish agricultural workers, coming as it does from the hard-headed English farmers.  Yet the distressing fact is that these excellent workers, these men who are regarded as champions in the agricultural fields in Great Britain, are the very men whom our agricultural policy is driving to emigration.  Therefore I say that this motion, which has been on the Order Paper for six months, is still timely.</P>
    <P>In this motion we ask for two things. We ask first that a census of production should be taken.  In that connection, I should like to stress the fact that at present we have no real census of agricultural production.  The type of census taken and the manner in which agricultural statistics are collected in this country are purely a farce.  There is no use in sending around a member of the Gárda Síochána casually to a farmer to ask him what stock he has or how many acres of various crops he has sown, because there is absolutely no obligation on the farmer to provide complete and accurate information.  In taking a census of production, we should be as thorough as in taking an ordinary census of population.  I suggest that, having presented the farmer with a definite form on which to complete the census of production, the machinery of the Gárda Síochána should be used to ensure that these agricultural statistics are correct. There would be no difficulty in ensuring that one Gárda in each station should be specially qualified to collect agricultural statistics, and have a definite appointment as a collector of such statistics, just as we have food and drugs inspectors.  That would get over that difficulty, and we would not have to rely so much on guesswork as we have at present.</P>
    <P>We all know that if a Gárda goes to a farmer to collect statistics, the information he gets is governed by a considerable number of factors.  If a farmer happens to be an eligible bachelor of 30, 40 or 50, and he knows that the facts and figures which he is giving will probably be conned at the next house where there is a young lady who may be interested in him, he <Col N="1159" /> naturally makes his stock appear as presentable as possible.  If, on the other hand, a farmer is being hunted by the sheriff or the rate collector for debts, he will naturally cut down his assets to the lowest possible minimum. These are facts which everybody knows, and they are matters of very great importance to the Minister for Agriculture in a time of emergency such as this, when every ounce of production should be adequately measured and estimated.  In this connection, the Minister may notice that the Irish Sugar Company, in collecting their statistics, do not rely on such a haphazard method.  They have their inspector, who inspects the beet crop and even measures the acreage in order to ensure that the correct acreage is given.  He also gives a forecast to the factory of the probable production of that crop.</P>
    <P>So much for the census portion of this motion.  Then we also suggest in this motion that immediate steps should be taken to provide an adequate food supply.  That is where I think the Minister has failed.  Steps have certainly been taken, but the steps taken have not been adequate.  Any Deputy who has any knowledge of agricultural conditions knows that the amount of wheat sown up to the present is not as great as the amount sown this time twelve months.  That is a deplorable state of affairs, and is due mainly to the fact that the inducement offered has not been sufficient.  It was hopelessly incompetent on the part of the Department of Agriculture, and, I think, offensive and insulting to those engaged in production, to offer an increase of 1/- over last year's price at the outset.  The fact that that order has been amended is clear evidence of the fact that the Government now realise that they made a mistake.  I am afraid they will have to make a still further amendment of that price if they are to secure anything near an adequate crop.  It is a deplorable state of affairs that, in a time of emergency when the population of this country are crying out for food, we have such a mean and miserable offer made to <Col N="1160" /> the agricultural producers as 1/- over last year's price.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is part of the enormous loss we have suffered by allowing the affairs of this agricultural country to be made the shuttlecock of the two big political Parties.  The farmer has been used by the two big political Parties as a kind of flail with which to beat each other.  If the farmer is mangled or bruised in the process it does not seem to bother anybody.  We have a difference of view between those two big Parties with regard to tillage, one Party advocating tillage and the opposite Party advocating live stock.  Everybody knows that while both Parties are partly right, they are also partly wrong and the farmer has to suffer as a consequence. We have at present a number of important and influential people going about the country praising the farmer, telling him what a great fellow he is and how the country is depending on him.  But that kind of praise is no use if the farmer is not paid for the work he is doing, if the farmer is not getting an adequate price, as it is on the price of wheat and other agricultural products that production will depend.  Loans or doles or alms or anything else will be of no use.  The farmer must be paid a price which will cover the cost of production.</P>
    <P>As against the demand on the part of the farmer for a price that will cover his production costs, we will be told that such a price cannot be paid unless one of three things is done: either the price to the consumer must be increased or taxation must be increased to provide a subsidy, or money must be raised by borrowing in order to pay the difference between what it costs the farmer to produce and the price which the consumer can pay.  But I hold very strongly that there is a fourth way out of the difficulty.  We are basing all our economic considerations on the assumption that money is definitely a limited commodity, the amount of which cannot be increased or reduced in any way; that it is something fixed and definite.  I hold that if we are to increase and extend agricultural production, we must increase <Col N="1161" /> the amount of money in circulation, and that can only be done by the State taking control of national credit and currency, issuing the money which is required, and making it available free of interest to the farmers.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that any other method of dealing with the problem would defeat itself in the long run, while it might be a temporary expedient. Deputy Corry has suggested that an increase of a further 5/- should be given on wheat, provided that farmers cultivate a certain acreage.  I could not agree with that proposal because it would be manifestly unfair to a number of individual farmers.  For example, if a farmer put 100 per cent. of his land under wheat and his neighbours did not make any special effort, the position would be that the total acreage of wheat would not be grown, and, therefore, the farmer who made a tremendous effort to meet the national requirements would have to be satisfied with a low price.  That, I think, would be sufficient answer to Deputy Corry's suggestion.</P>
      <P>Again, we have a suggestion from various quarters that there should be a bounty on new pasture land ploughed up.  I think every farmer will agree that such a proposal would be manifestly unfair to the old tillage farmer, to the man who has been ploughing the maximum amount of his land for years and who, as a result, may possibly have impoverished his land to a certain extent.  Such a man would, under that suggestion, be deprived of any benefit whatever from the bounty and such an injustice could not be excused or tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton, in proposing this motion, put forward a very original suggestion, namely, that the entire subsidy payable on wheat should be <Col N="1162" /> payable upon flour of the maximum extraction, that is, 90 to 95 per cent., and that white flour should be produced and sold to the consumer at the cost of production.  Of course, such a proposal could not be carried into effect unless there was a sufficient acreage of wheat grown to allow for a quantity of white flour being produced. That would be, of course, the first essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton has suggested that it would be and is possible to get the required amount by paying the producer a fair price, that is, £3 a barrel, and that in that way it would be possible to get so much wheat grown that it would be possible to allow for half the wheat being milled at a 70 per cent. extraction, thereby providing white flour.  I am not quite convinced that Deputy Belton's proposal is workable, although I must say that in theory it is perfectly sound.  It is perfectly sound to suggest that a person who wants white flour should pay the full cost of production, and it is equally sound in theory that the poor and those who cannot afford the white flour should get the other type of flour at a cheap rate.  I think that if it was not for the fact that our population have been accustomed in the past to regard white flour and white bread as ordinary food and not as something in the nature of a luxury there would be no difficulty whatever in carrying out Deputy Belton's suggestion, but I am afraid that the mentality of our people would create a difficulty in carrying out this proposal.  At the same time it is, I must say, a very original proposal and very sound and logical in theory.</P>
    <P>I think that, having regard to the low yields which we have been getting out of wheat during the past number of years, particularly to the exceptionally low yield last year, and to the fact that during the coming year we cannot hope for a higher yield than last year, but must, very naturally, expect a further reduction, there is a case made for a very substantial increase in the price of wheat.  That case has not been met by the slight increase which has been given.</P>
    <P>We want a sound agricultural policy, not only in regard to wheat, but in <Col N="1163" /> regard to tillage generally, and I believe that the Government will make a great mistake if they confine their attention to cereal crops in planning our agricultural economy, because there is no doubt that cereal crops alone will exhaust the fertility of the land and will not give the total output which the nation requires.  Very substantial efforts must be made to promote the growing of potatoes and other green crops if we are to remain in tillage and continue to increase tillage, as we may have to do if the present emergency lasts, as it is likely to do.  In Great Britain at the present time the potato crop is being subsidised to the extent of £10 per statute acre, notwithstanding the fact that the market price of potatoes is much higher there than it is here.  Why is there not a similar attempt made to subsidise the price of potatoes here? The potato crop, used as a foodstuff for pigs and poultry will, as every farmer and every feeder of live stock knows, give a much larger percentage of food than any cereal crop.  Therefore, from a national point of view it is essential that the greatest possible quantity of potatoes should be grown and used as a foodstuff and substituted as far as possible for grain crops which would then be available to a greater extent than at present for human food.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister has considered this question of a subsidy on potatoes, because it seems to me the most effective means of promoting the feeding of pigs and poultry which in turn would add to the fertility of the land by producing farmyard manure.  It would also increase the output of our tillage lands.  The Minister must surely have given some consideration to that problem but I am afraid the Minister is allowing himself to be bullied to too great an extent by the Department of Finance and he is not standing up to them for the farmers' interests.  I think it was the late Sir Edward Carson who referred to a British Prime Minister as being a man with a very strong head and very weak knees.  I might almost apply the same description to our Minister <Col N="1164" /> for Agriculture, but our trouble as farmers is that the Minister seems to have used his head when dealing with the farmers' claims for increased prices and to have relied upon his knees when dealing with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There is one final matter to which I want, with your permission, Sir, to refer.  At the moment, in shaping an agricultural policy and in getting the maximum production out of our land, it is important that the Minister for Agriculture should have the wholehearted co-operation of every farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties.  In seeking to secure that co-operation, I believe the Minister has been hampered to a certain extent by certain libellous accusations which have been made against him and circularised to a very great extent in rural Ireland.  It is the bounden duty of every Deputy, and particularly of Deputies who are opposed to the Government and who, therefore, cannot be regarded as trying to whitewash the Government, to condemn such accusations, to brand them as maliciously false and to do whatever he can to secure that the people, and particularly the plain working people of the country, will not be misled by such false and malicious propaganda. Denials by the Minister, or his colleagues who are similarly accused, are quite all right; but they may not be taken fully to heart as it might be said that they are specially affected, but I think there is a special obligation, an inescapable moral obligation upon the leaders of other Parties, and particularly of opposition Parties, to condemn such accusations and to stand up for a Christian standard of conduct in respect of propaganda and such matters.  I have been waiting very patiently for the leaders of the other political Parties to speak out on this matter.  I have been waiting, also, for the independent newspapers of this country to join in denouncing such propaganda, which is very harmful not only to the Government Party, which would not be a matter of very great concern, but to the country generally.  For that reason it should be exposed by those who are in a position to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the whole question of the production of essential food for the nation I think we must all agree that a compulsory order is not sufficient to secure our essential requirements.  You cannot, by the simple making of a compulsory order, force farmers to produce at uneconomic prices and expect to get satisfactory results.  I do not want to create what is usually referred to as the vicious spiral, and I do not think that farmers, generally, expect that it is possible at present, but what I do suggest is that the agricultural community are at least entitled to the profit they were getting pre-war, and more especially can we claim that profit when we bear in mind that certain vested interests in this country have that standard of profit secured to them.  The House, the last time it met, voted practically £2,000,000 to subsidise flour and bread, and that subsidy was based on a secured profit to the milling industry of 6 per cent.  In the same way in respect of the production of beet, the farmers' costs of production generally are not taken into account. In an arbitrary fashion, the price is fixed, but the profits of Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teo, are secured. Their profits have been practically constant for the last three or four years.</P>
      <P>It is on that basis, I suggest, we should approach this matter&mdash;that the agricultural community's profit ought to be secured to them.  In other words, the agricultural returns in the matter of producing food should be adjusted to meet the increasing cost of production. I should like to ask the Minister whether, in arriving at the increase in the last few days of 4/- in the price of wheat&mdash;the price is now 45/- per barrel &mdash;he did so on any set of costings.  Did he base that figure on any known set of costings, or did he simply arrive at that figure in an arbitrary fashion? I do not know whom he consulted about it, nor do I know how he arrived at the figure, but I am satisfied that he cannot produce any set of costings in respect of the average type of land in this country that will show a fair margin of profit to the farmer on a price of 45/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dominant consideration at the <Col N="1166" /> moment is the securing of the production of food for our national requirements, and we have been told by the Minister for Supplies that even in the case of wheat, to make good the deficit, the short-fall so far as home-produced wheat is concerned, we will require 80,000 tons of wheat, for which we shall have to pay at the rate of £3 10s. per barrel.  Last year wheat was produced at £2 per barrel, showing that the Government are evidently quite satisfied to pay, over and above what they pay the Irish farmer, 30/- per barrel for imported wheat.  I understand that we must pay for that wheat in dollar bills, and in that there is a very important consideration&mdash;the question of nursing any dollar holdings we have so that we shall be able to spread them over a long period, if the war lasts for a long period.  If we could get produced, if we could hold out sufficient inducement to the Irish farmer to produce, sufficient wheat at home, it would mean that we could spend those dollars on some other commodities which are essential.  If there is a reduction in the acreage under wheat this year, it means that we shall have to import more wheat next year, and the importation of that wheat means the finding of more foreign currency to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to suggest that any money that can be saved by having the wheat grown at home should be paid to the Irish farmer.  I understand that, in order to meet our requirements for the coming year, we will need to have between 500,000 and 600,000 acres under wheat.  When moving the motion under discussion on the 20th of last month, Deputy Belton, speaking at column 994 of the Official Debates, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no way of meeting the situation except by laying down the amount that must be cropped, not in the aggregate, but in the crops that we are short of&mdash;wheat, oats and barley.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be wise for the Minister to lay down what percentage of grain the farmer should produce. For instance, it would be unwise to suggest that we should all put 10 per cent. of our land under wheat, for the <Col N="1167" /> reason that the fertility of a lot of our land is so low that it is unable to produce wheat.  On the other hand, there is some land in the country so rank that it is suitable only for the production of wheat.  It must be left, I suggest, to the agricultural community to decide what is the most suitable crop to produce under existing conditions.  Since the bulk of the wheat grown in this country in the last few years has come off old tillage land, the danger we are up against at the present time is an acute shortage of artificial manures which are necessary to enable us to continue to produce wheat on this land.  In the old tillage districts in the past we have been giving that land a liberal amount of artificial manures.  The Minister must realise that there is bound to be a sharp fall in the yield from land of that type if it is to be utilised for the growing of wheat.  Because of that possibility there will be a tendency for people to switch over to the growing of other cereal crops&mdash;oats and barley &mdash;and in order to correct that a sufficient inducement must be held out to them to put their land under wheat.</P>
    <P>The price for wheat announced in the last few days will not be sufficient, in my opinion, to get our requirements in wheat produced at home.  As I have said the dominant consideration in this whole matter should be to get our wheat requirements produced at home because it is the most economical way of securing the food that we will require. It will mean that there will be no risk to shipping from U-boat activities. I suggest that in offering a price that is not attractive to the farmers the Minister and the Government are, in the present situation, taking a very grave risk.  I have no hesitation in saying that the price of 45/- a barrel announced the other day is not, from the profit point of view, comparable at all with the 30/- a barrel that we got three or four years ago when we had ample supplies of artificial manures at a very cheap rate, when the costs of production generally were lower as well as the cost of freights, threshing operations, seeding, implements, and their wear and tear <Col N="1168" /> less.  I would like to see the Minister produce for the House any set of costings from a reputable source that he has based this figure of 45/- on.  It is on the costings that our price for the crop ought to be fixed.  The agricultural community are treated in a vastly different manner from people in any other form of industry in this country. In the case of all other industries, their price is based on the cost of production, leaving to them what is considered a fair margin of profit, but in the case of agricultural produce the price is not fixed on any known cost of production.  So far as I know, the costs of production in relation to agricultural produce have not been gone into.  The Minister, in an arbitrary manner, simply fixes a price.  The farmer has got to take it or leave it.  In fact he is compelled to take it because, under a compulsory tillage order, the farmer must cultivate his land.</P>
    <P>At a time when it may be said the agricultural community is the most essential service in the State, it is very unfortunate to find many farmers being seriously hampered by the activities of the sheriff's officers.  Deputies know how our farmers have been scourged by the foot and mouth outbreak. It is, therefore, I say very unfortunate that just when those people were getting an opportunity to dispose of their stock, in fact when they were free to move them for the first time for many months, the first visitor at their doors was the sheriff's officer.  The Minister for Lands gave an assurance that no undue pressure would be used against the farmers at the present time, but I do not think any member of the House can deny that the situation I have just described exists.  The financial position of the Government may be difficult.  They may think it necessary to collect a couple of million pounds in the form of annuities during the coming year, but, surely to goodness, this is not the time to put undue pressure on people who have suffered the consequences of the foot-and-mouth scourge&mdash;on people who have had no opportunity of realising any money over the last few months. I think the Minister for Agriculture should personally concern himself with <Col N="1169" /> that aspect of the case.  If the first few pounds they have been able to realise over a period of months are to be grasped by the sheriff for the Land Commission, how can we possibly hope that they will be able to become productive and economic units for the purpose of producing food in the coming year?</P>

      <P>I suggest that he is responsible for the welfare of the agricultural community.  It is a question of food production&mdash;I do not know that there is any particular Minister concerned&mdash;and this matter concerns the welfare of the agricultural community and has a very substantial bearing on their ability to produce food.  I do not want to dwell unduly on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other aspects of the case that I would like to touch on.  There is the question of raw material for the production of food. The Minister should get an assurance from the Government that he will have first claim on all raw material necessary for the production of food here. It is off the big farms that we must look for the big end of our production under a compulsory tillage order.  I know many big farmers who are being seriously hampered at the present time by the Department of Supplies because of the fact that they are not able to secure supplies of kerosene for the operation of tractors.  The number of forms and monthly returns that have to be completed is most irritating.  In fact it is impossible to complete them. I attempted to complete some returns a couple of nights ago, as far as I am affected personally, and I found it utterly impossible to complete them and to set out on the form what work I was going to do in the month of December.  No one could put that down, as it depends on the weather; if you are having a very bad month, you are not going to do very much on the land.  Then, to apportion definitely how much or what part of the month you are going to take to plough an acre of land is impossible.  But the officers <Col N="1170" /> of the Department of Supplies can fix that in their minds and tell you how much kerosene it will take to plough an acre.  No farmer could do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The armchair fellows in the Department of Supplies can tell you about this job, but there is no farmer in the country who can tell what it takes in kerosene to plough an acre of land.  We realise that there are varying conditions which may obtain on stiff types of old leas, which may not have been ploughed for 100 years, and the consumption would be double as compared with light land in cultivation. That has an irritating effect on the agricultural community and the Minister shows no sympathy for that. I have always held in the Dáil that, so far as the Department of Supplies is concerned, there is no sympathy whatever for agricultural interests or outlook in this country.  It is dominated by the city outlook and the city mentality all the time.  The farming community is looked upon as the slave. The farmers are being compelled to do their job and told it is their bounden duty to do it at the present time. Surely that is not a proper outlook. The Minister ought to have an assurance from the Government that he has, for the people who are his particular care, the first claim on any raw materials necessary in the production of food.  That is a very reasonable thing to ask for.</P>
      <P>Petrol can be provided for many sections of the community, but when it comes to the farmers' interests there is no consideration at all over and above any other man.  Again, I suggest that the farmer is the most important individual here at the present time. His claim should come before that of anyone else.  Time is running out and I wish to leave the Minister an opportunity to come in on this debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton's motion can be divided into three parts, the first of which is: &ldquo;that the Government has failed to make adequate provision of food supplies for man and beast in the coming year&rdquo;.  In respect of that portion, Deputy Belton took certain figures of the amount we tilled last year and made out a certain deficit. Naturally, we all have a shot at making up such figures from time to time, to see how they work out; and some time ago I myself did it in this way, and perhaps this is the best way to do it. These are not official figures: they are only my own, and, therefore, they are subject to error.  I took the tillage in 1938 and in 1941, and the imports in 1938, and in that way got an idea as to how far we have made up the deficit. The deficit will be taken as the imports in 1938&mdash;that is a normal year before the war.  Take the increased tillage in 1941 over 1938 to see how far we have gone to make up that deficit as disclosed by the imports during that year. As far as I can make out, this is roughly the position: we want another 200,000 acres of wheat.  That is on a yield of 17½ cwts. which, I believe, would be reasonable &mdash; it is not optimistic, anyway&mdash;and I think our yield for this year will be more than that.</P>

      <P>That is well below the average for the last ten years, and I think it was only twice during the last ten years that such a low yield was reached.  I am taking it at 17½ cwts. and taking white flour&mdash;that is, 70 per cent. extraction&mdash;and 6 per cent. excess moisture in the wheat, and also providing seed for the coming year.  All these things pointed out that we would be 200,000 acres short this present year in wheat and of other cereals about 100,000 acres.  That is roughly our position as worked out in that way. I think Deputies will agree that it is a reasonable way of doing it&mdash;taking the years 1938 and 1941 and seeing how far we have gone to make up for what we used to import before the war.  Of course, there are various things that arise now.  For instance, we take a 95 per cent. extraction and, therefore, there is no pollard or bran.  That means we really transfer 100,000 acres of what used to be animal feeding into human food, so that the deficit of wheat is changed from 200,000 acres to 100,000 acres, but the deficit of other cereals is changed from 100,000 to 200,000.  Against that we have a considerably larger acreage of potatoes which would roughly account for our want of other cereals for animal feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to import wheat&mdash;we do not know how much we may import to make up for that deficit&mdash;but the strange thing is that, working it out like that on paper, we do not seem to be very acutely short.  We should not be very acutely short of human food or animal food.  We all know, however, that there is a shortage in the country&mdash;that very little oats or barley is being put on the market.  No oats or barley is being put on the market that could be fed to animals, because the position so far with regard to human food is not secure enough for that.  It is rather puzzling to know what the position really is.  Maybe we have not adverted to the fact that the farmer this year is rather conservative&mdash;and nobody would expect him to be otherwise&mdash;owing to his experience last <Col N="1173" /> year.  If he sold his oats or barley early last year he got a poor price, and when he came back in the spring to buy he paid a very high price; so very naturally, if he has oats or barley to spare this year he says: &ldquo;I will keep it over for fear I would be in the same position as last year.  Well and good, if I have to sell in the spring, I will sell it.&rdquo;  I think there is possibly a fair amount of grain in that way that will reach the market.</P>
    <P>Another factor which we must remember is that we have less pigs to feed&mdash;at least one-third less, I think, though some would say half what we had last year&mdash;and that again should mean a little more foodstuffs in the country available for other purposes. Against that, we have more cattle, and whatever concentrates&mdash;in that sense I mean cereals rather than fodder&mdash; may be available would be used for these extra cattle.  However we look upon it, if the figures we are getting are in any way correct&mdash;that is, the basic figures we take in 1938 and 1941&mdash; there cannot be an acute shortage of foodstuffs, and I think it is possible that some of these foodstuffs will come on the market later on, when farmers feel fairly sure that they are safe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe a great number of farmers&mdash;though not them all, as some are very badly in need&mdash;have a little grain to spare.  It is a pity they should not market it as soon as possible as, though there will be a seasonal increase in the month of January, prices are not going to increase inordinately as they did last year.  It would be well for farmers to sow all they can, as they did last year, to keep at least enough seed and put in all they can for the coming year; secondly, to provide for their own families&mdash;which they are perfectly <Col N="1174" /> entitled to do&mdash;and not more than that; and then to put whatever spare wheat they have on the market.  The same would apply to a great extent to anything farmers have in the way of oats or barley.</P>
      <P>Looking at it in that way, as well as one can make out the figures&mdash;the statisticians would not attempt to make out figures at the moment, as they have not enough reliable data to go on, but neither Deputy Belton nor I would mind making a shot at them ourselves, to try to make up the position&mdash;and if the position is as I think it is, Deputy Belton is not justified in saying that the Government has failed to make adequate provision of food supplies for man or beast in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is admitting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  We have not failed to make adequate provision. I admit we have to import some wheat, but apart from a comparatively small quantity which will be brought in, I believe we have made fairly adequate provision.  I would like very much indeed if I could be more sure about those figures and could say definitely that there is not the slightest danger of want of food or foodstuffs; but the position is not so very bad and I am rather convinced that before long some surplus oats and barley will be coming on the market and the position of those who are waiting to purchase it for animals will not be so bad as it is at the moment.  As everybody knows, there is also a very big potato crop: our acreage increased considerably, and it was a good crop on the whole, perhaps the best we had, taking them all round, this year.  Of those potatoes only a small quantity is fed to human beings, the greater portion going to feed animals and so replace cereals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of Deputy Belton's motion says: &ldquo;That the Government be requested at once to make a full and detailed census of the land&rdquo;, and so on.  Deputy Cogan said the census we are taking is by no means reliable. <Col N="1175" /> That is true; the Guards take the census, and it is well-known that no Guard goes to every farm in his particular area to survey the amount of land under the various crops.  Some of the Guards, however, and I hope the majority of them, go to some trouble in questioning the farmer as to whether he has more wheat this year than last year, more or less potatoes, more or less barley, and so on, and in that way they try to get at the truth.  One thing that has been proved fairly well over the years is that whatever error there is in the census remains a fairly constant one.  Therefore, if we get a return that there are 4,200,000 cattle this year compared to 4,000,000 last year, that relative figure is fairly correct.  We have always found that to be a fact.  Naturally, there is a certain amount of error but that cannot be avoided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned the sugar company and said they were very particular about having land surveyed that was under the beet crop.  The sugar company, however, is only dealing with 60,000 or 70,000 acres, while in total tillage we have to deal with 2,400,000 acres in addition to hay, pasture and live animals.  It would be extremely difficult and we would need a very big staff of persons trained&mdash;to some extent, anyway&mdash; in reading maps and surveying, if we were to go in for the accuracy Deputy Cogan would like.  I admit it would be a great thing if we could have it, but I am afraid we must depend on the present system for our census.  I have kept in mind that, in the case of compulsory tillage, one is likely to get exaggerated figures.  A farmer coming under the Compulsory Tillage Order to till 20 acres, and who knows in his heart and soul that he only tilled 18, is likely to say he has tilled 20, as a safeguard.  He may have the idea that the figures will be examined and compared with his total holding, and think he had better be on the safe side, so he says he has tilled his quota.  Therefore, there is possibly a bit more exaggeration now than there would be in pre-war years, and in that way we may not have that full <Col N="1176" /> acreage of barley, oats, wheat and so on that the census would indicate. Regarding the coming year, I should like to say something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the third part of Deputy Belton's motion.  It says that we should take adequate measures to see that everything is done rightly for next year.  We must have more wheat &mdash;we all admit that.  I believe that the price is economic.  Some Deputies will say that they do not consider the price uneconomic but have some doubt as to whether we will get enough wheat or not.  If the price is economic&mdash;and I am banking on that&mdash;the farmer has a duty to the nation, to provide food. After all, other members of this community have made sacrifices.  We are not asking the farmer to make much sacrifice in this respect.  Other men have made sacrifices.  I know personally&mdash;as I suppose other Deputies know &mdash;men who have left their jobs and gone into the Army, though they may not get those jobs back again when the war is over.  There are also men in the Local Defence Force who spend every leisure hour in training to fight for the country.  We are not asking the farmer to give his life or his leisure: we are asking him to grow more wheat for a guaranteed market and a fixed price.</P>

      <P>I have often said that the farmers and the farmers' sons are the backbone of every national movement. I know there are farmers in the Local Defence Force, and I know farmers who left their jobs to go into the Army, but at the moment I am talking of the farmer as a wheat grower.  We are not asking him to give his life; there is no great risk involved in sowing a field of wheat.  We are not asking him to give up his leisure time; he can sow wheat or barley or oats just when it suits him.  All we ask him to do is to sow wheat for a fixed price and a guaranteed market.  Whether the war is over or not, he will get that price and that <Col N="1177" /> wheat will be taken from him.  These are great advantages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are helpful.  Some of them recommended 60/- and some Deputies here recommended it also, but that is no reason why we should give it.  It is ridiculous to make a comparison with world prices.  Even if we do give 60/- here, it is possible that we might have to import wheat.  Why should we compare the price of homegrown with the price of imported wheat?  We gave £12 a ton for wheat before the war and we could import it for £5 5s.  The taxpayer was satisfied to do that and one of his reasons was that he wanted to be secure here in time of war.  The consumer went on paying that subsidy to the wheat grower for some years before the war in order that he might be secure should war break out.  If he does not now get the security he expected, what will he do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think you could not blame the consumer should he adopt a certain attitude when the war is over, if he does not get the security that he is now looking for.  His argument will be: &ldquo;Why should we subsidise the farmer in peace time to grow wheat if he does not stand by us when a war is on?&rdquo; The same applies to beet.  I do not like the scheme put up by Deputy Corry, because it is a gamble, and so also is Deputy Belton's scheme, about half white flour, a gamble.  Then there was an objection put up by Deputy Hughes, and I believe it is a very valid objection. There is too much gambling in those schemes.  Farmers do not grow <Col N="1178" /> wheat as much as we might expect them to, because it is such a gamble.</P>
    <P>The price of wheat has gone up by 50 per cent. since the war commenced. It has risen from 30/- to 45/-.  How are you going to cost wheat now in comparison with 1938?  A farmer might say: &ldquo;I used artificial manure in 1938, and I cannot get that manure now.&rdquo; Some incidental costs may have gone up, but, on the whole, I do not think the cost to the farmer for growing wheat has gone up anything like 50 per cent.  My impression is this: that much more than half the wheat was grown always without artificial manure, and it always will be.  After manured crops and in lea land it was grown to a large extent without artificials.  I will say that the farmers' prices have gone up by 50 per cent.  We have heard a lot about men getting away with huge profits.  Where are they?  There is no wage earner in this country who has got anything like a 50 per cent. increase since the war started.  There is no man earning a dividend who could get anything like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. Firms that never before paid a dividend are now paying up to 6 per cent. The farmer is not getting 6 per cent. on his capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he is, and a bit more.  The man with the dividend, the man with the salary, and the man with the wage is tied by the standstill order, but the farmer is getting 50 per cent. more for his wheat.  Maybe that is not enough, but there is no use in making the point that everybody else can get away with it and the farmer cannot.  That is not true, because everybody else is not getting away with it.  The farmer, we are told, is not getting enough, and there are business men who say they are not getting enough either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not getting the consideration that it deserves, particularly from the Minister.  Deputy Hughes does not agree that half of our bread should be white.  He thinks that that would set up an invidious position, that we would be making the white bread for the rich, while those who would not be able to pay the high price would have to do with brown bread.  The price of white flour in Dublin to-day works out at 11d. per lb. There is no use in Deputies claiming an economic price for wheat unless they can create an economic market.  I have suggested that economic market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister regretted that he had not more time to deal with this interesting matter.  There are several motions on the Order Paper, including one that proposes an annulment of the Tillage Order.  It is not really for the purpose of an annulment; it is put down in order that we can have a debate on the matter. That is the only way to get a debate, and we are availing of that opportunity.  The Minister stated that the prices for the farmers have gone up by 50 per cent., and nobody else got that much.  I am amazed at a man in the responsible position which the Minister occupies trotting out an argument of that sort, an argument which is without foundation.  The farmers are being asked to cultivate 600,000 acres, and instead of the choice land being put under wheat, the farmers are being asked to cultivate the second-rate and third-rate land for that purpose.  Last year Deputy Corry said 50/- a barrel was too much for <Col N="1180" /> wheat, but a few days ago he thought the proper price for wheat would be 50/- a barrel.  When he spoke against 50/- a barrel last year, he had in mind getting a return of eight barrels to the acre&mdash;unfortunately for him, it is here on the records of this House&mdash;but instead of that he only got five or six barrels to the acre.  Equating the result of eight barrels to the acre at £2 per acre, which would be £16, even six barrels to the acre at 50/- would be only £15.  I have not the least doubt, if we are all alive and here in 12 months' time, that he will say that if we did not get £3 a barrel next year, we should have got it.</P>
    <P>What is the price that it has been pushed up to?  The price it has been pushed up to is 45/- a barrel.  Nobody expects that we will get the required quantity at that price.  Nobody can produce it.  The Minister appeals to the patriotism of people, but the Minister knows that many acres of wheat were sown this year which did not produce even the seed that went into them.  Now the thing is spread out further, and without fertilisers there will be a less return and, therefore, in order to get the wheat, we must spread out still further.  Now, there is only one way of spreading out in order to get it, and that is by paying for it. Why does the Minister propose to import 80,000 or more tons of wheat and pay four guineas a barrel for it while he is only giving just a little over half of that price for wheat produced at home?  What is the argument in favour of that?  I do not want to labour too much the price element, because there are other motions on the paper dealing with the question of price and this motion is essentially not one dealing with price.</P>
    <P>I had intended to put this motion to a division just as a matter of record, but I decided that I would not do so when I heard the Minister's speech because, from start to finish of his speech, he admitted that we were short but that we were not dangerously short.  Let him look at the reduction in the pig population and the reduction in the poultry population.  Why have they been reduced?  Do we not know <Col N="1181" /> that sows were fattened off and that hens were sold because there was not feed for them?  Does he not know that, and does he not know that corn is not coming on the market?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is true. So that there is a shortage.  I admit that the Minister and the Government had a big job, but they did not approach it in the right way.  Now, Deputy Hughes, who takes a very intelligent view and who has certainly the practical man's mind and view on these matters, said that he disagreed with having an order within an order, as suggested by me&mdash; having an order fixing a minimum percentage for the crops of which we were short.  I know no way of getting an article except by producing it.  I know no way of getting an adequate wheat supply unless we put an area under wheat that will produce the amount of wheat we require.  If it takes 5 per cent. of our arable land to produce a sufficient supply of wheat for this nation there is no way, on God's earth, of having it except by cropping 5 per cent. of the arable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we should not apply a 25 per cent. tillage order to the individual farmer, according to that.  Of course, there will always have to be a certain amount of elasticity in those things.  You can have arable land which is not all wheat land.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am only pointing out that there has to be a certain amount of elasticity.  I suggest, however, that as a base line you should start with a minimum area under the crops you require.  The Minister said that he is satisfied that the price is an economic one.  I agree that, if you are not thinking of quantity of production, if you are not up against the problem of producing three times as much as <Col N="1182" /> you were producing in peace time, then the price is attractive.  There is not a farmer who cannot produce a little wheat and be well paid for it at £2 a barrel or less even at the present time. Every farmer has a choice bit of land that will grow a good crop of wheat. But if you expect the land of this country to produce an adequate supply of wheat, then you are asking the farmer to spread out over land that, normally, is not fit to grow wheat, and down goes the productivity.  If you have to sow four acres in order to produce what a well-manured acre or two acres would produce, then the cost of tillage, of seed, and of going through the whole routine is just as large over a bad acre as over a good one, and the price will have to go up.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted figures as a way of parrying the blow that the Government had not made adequate provision for man and beast in the matter of food.  He produced figures, but these figures only dealt with areas and not with quantities produced.  He cannot, I presume, ascertain the weight of production, but we all know that with the shortage of artificials, the shortage of manures and the increased tillage, the volume of production has gone down per acre.  So that the Minister is very far wide of the mark when he quotes increased areas as showing that the Government has done its job in this matter.  I am sorry the Minister had not time to deal with the scheme that is put up.  The Minister knows that there is a trade in foreign wheat in this city at the present time, and that the people of this city are hungering to buy flour at a price that is equivalent to £8 19s. per barrel.  That is the price of white flour to-day.  It may be more now, but that was this morning's quotation.</P>

      <P>Why should you not put out your wheat and ask them to pay you even 1/6 per loaf?  This is a serious matter.  If we produce half the flour we require and sell it at cost we will have a white loaf at 1/6 for the two-pound loaf.  We will be able, without any more subsidy, to sell the present type of loaf at 11d.  I challenge contradiction on that.  The Minister for Supplies, a fortnight ago, introduced his £2,000,000 subsidy.  That subsidy was based on the following figures. Last year the cost of flour was £5,800,000.  In the current year, owing to the increased price of native wheat and the increased cost of importing wheat, the cost of our flour ran up to £7,800,000.  The difference of £2,000,000 had to be put up by the taxpayer in order to keep the loaf at 1/-.  Now, with the increased risks, are we going to get imported wheat next year as cheaply as we did this year?  It cost us £4 4s. this year.  Will we get it as cheaply next year?</P>

Mind you, he threatened us here the last day that if there is any increase in the cost of wheat it must be put on the loaf, and that he will not ask for a subsidy. Now, is the loaf to go up anyway?

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day in the House, and on 20th November last, I addressed the following question to the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the cost per ton on the bog of the turf produced during the 1941 season at Clonsast, the cost of the haulage per ton of such turf from the bog to the railhead at Portarlington, the cost per ton of its transport by rail from Portlaoighise to Dublin; (b) the cost per ton of transporting turf by road from Clonsast to Dublin, and (c) the total quantities of Clonsast turf carried by (1) rail, and (2) road to Dublin up to October 31st, 1941.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, who is also known to Deputies and to the people of the country as the Turf Controller, furnished this rather amusing reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Turf is produced at Clonsast by the Turf Development Board, Limited, and sold by them on a commercial basis.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the answer to the query as to what is the cost per ton of the turf produced at Clonsast.  He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost of haulage and rail transport is the subject of a business <Col N="1185" /> arrangement between the parties concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is another rather amusing answer to a request for a figure.  Continuing, the Parliamentary Secretary said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Generally, the question relates to administrative matters within the competence of the Turf Development Board, and in this regard I would refer the Deputy to the replies made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to questions on such matters asked by him on 16th June, 1936, and 9th February, 1939.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 9th February, 1939, in reply to a question addressed to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce dealing with the quantity of turf produced at Clonsast, and the conditions under which such turf was produced, Mr. Lemass said, as reported at column 222 of the Official Debates, Volume 74:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a similar question addressed to me by him on the 16th June, 1936.  On that occasion I told the Deputy that the particulars desired by him related to administrative matters, a settlement of which falls within the competence of the Turf Development Board and in which my Department does not interfere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position, I suggest, has been completely changed since the Turf Development Board was transferred to a section of the Department under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  As far as I understand it, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, by virtue of the powers conferred upon him under the Emergency Powers Act, has complete control over the production and distribution of what is known as national turf, and that includes turf produced in Clonsast.</P>
    <P>To confirm that, the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a supplementary question put by me on 20th November (Official Debates, column 849, Volume 85) asking him: &ldquo;Is it a fact that the Turf Development Board is now under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary,&rdquo;<Col N="1186" /> said: &ldquo;The answer is in the affirmative.&rdquo;  As a Deputy in this House I have good reason to know that the Parliamentary Secretary, under the powers conferred on him in the Emergency Powers Act, has given directions for the distribution of the turf produced at Clonsast.  He did order, I believe, at a particular date, that all the turf produced at Clonsast should be sent to Dublin.  Will he deny that?  I would be the last in this House to charge the Parliamentary Secretary with discourtesy in replying to questions, but there is no doubt that the reply given to the question addressed to him by me on 20th November last is more like a reply that would be given by a school-master to a schoolboy, and I am not prepared to accept the position of schoolboy in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the Turf Controller, who is in complete control of the turf produced in Clonsast and the turf produced by the county councils throughout the country, will not give me this information because he suspects that, if he gives the information to the House and puts those figures on the records here, his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, will find it extremely difficult if not impossible to convince the people of this city that they should be charged at the rate of 64/- a ton for the best of turf produced in Clonsast.  I assert here now that about six weeks or two months ago the best of turf was produced in Clonsast bog under trade union conditions at 22/6 a ton; that the cost of carrying that turf from the bog to Portarlington station was 5/- a ton, and that the cost of carrying it by rail from Portarlington to Dublin was at the rate of 7/11 per ton, making 35/5 per ton for the best turf produced in this country and landed in the City of Dublin.  I can imagine that, if those figure are anything like correct, it will be extremely difficult for the Minister for Supplies to justify a charge of 64/- a ton to the citizens of Dublin.  There is 28/7 to be accounted for, if my figures are anything like correct.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, when <Col N="1187" /> he was appointed to the position of Turf Controller, appealed to all Parties in the House to co-operate with him in carrying out the difficult task that had been handed over to him, and handed over to him at a time when it had been muddled and messed by the four different Departments which were dealing with the turf production scheme in this country up to the time when he was appointed to the position of Turf Controller under the Emergency Powers Act.  He has, as far as I know, been given all the co-operation which he invited.  On the other hand, I think it is only fair that he should be frank with Deputies of this House and give Deputies information of this kind to which, as representatives of the people, they are quite rightly entitled.  If he has the information in this possession&mdash;as I have good reason to believe he has, because he is a competent head of the Board of Works, and he is, I would say, a competent Turf Controller&mdash;it is not fair that he should withhold it from the Deputies of this House.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I think it is quite unfair for the Parliamentary Secretary to refuse to give information which Deputies are entitled to ask for and get.  I should like to hear from him the reason why he persists in refusing to give this information to me or any other Deputy who may seek information of this kind.  I contend&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the Parliamentary Secretary, in his position as Turf Controller, is in quite a different position from the position occupied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 9th February, 1936.  I believe it is true that at that time in 1936 the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not interfere in the detailed administration of the Turf Development Board, but I also believe that the position is quite different to-day, that the Parliamentary Secretary and Turf Controller is almighty so far as turf production and distribution is concerned, that he has this information in his possession and he has given no good reason for refusing to give it to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing at any rate Deputy Davin has made clear is the consistency of the conduct of those who from this bench have spoken for the Turf Development Board, when over a period from 1936 to 1941 he has had in relation to precisely the same question, precisely the same answer.  What I have to say is that that answer, then and now, is based upon precisely the same grounds. This House in its wisdom has set up a series of Governmental or semi-Governmental&mdash;I do not mind what phrase you like to use&mdash;organisations whose purpose it is to use the money and the resources of the State for doing, as they think and as the House thought, more suitably to the purposes of the State, things which ordinarily might be done or perhaps left undone by commercial organisations.  In its wisdom, consistently the State has tried to give such organisations as it has set up a reasonable chance of carrying on business under the same circumstances and with the same facilities and the same possibilities of success as an ordinary commercial enterprise.  It has not merely been rather anxious, but it has specifically declared its anxiety to safeguard these institutions from what one might call day-to-day interference, questioning and examination from the Oireachtas in relation to matters which the ordinary commercial firm would not be required to answer for here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be wise, or it may not, but it is consistent history over a long period of years, and covers an immense amount of money which the State has used in particular ways.  In every one of those cases it has, as far as it was possible to do so, safeguarded the ordinary commercial activity, contracts, etc., of these associations from being put in a worse position from a commercial point of view than the activities of other organisations.  As I understand it, the idea which was behind the mind of not merely one Government, but of the two Governments, was that that form of semi-Governmental trading should have a fair run for its money, a fair run for the money of the <Col N="1189" /> State, and a fair chance to do its work. It is for that reason, utterly unrelated to the nature of the questions which are asked that, as I have said, and as my predecessor has said, these being matters which are within the administrative competence of bodies set up for a special purpose and intended to be so safeguarded, in relation to no question which does come within that competence, whatever it may be, will I accept the position that I must give information to the House.</P>
    <P>The only new point which the Deputy has brought out, one in which there might seem to be some element of reasonableness, is that having regard to the fact that the Turf Controller has control over the activities of the whole of production, distribution, and so on, therefore he must have control over a particular part of the production and distribution of turf.  However, that argument unfortunately goes too far, because were I to assume exactly the responsibility which the Deputy attempts to put on me in relation, not to Clonsast, because Clonsast is only a small portion of it, but in relation to the Turf Development Board, one of whose activities is centred in Clonsast, taking the Deputy's argument on its face value, if I give him that information or any part of that information that comes within the administrative capacity of that portion of one organisation which is cutting and producing turf, I must take responsibility for giving to the House in relation to every association, Governmental or otherwise, in relation to every part of its activity in the production and distribution of turf, precisely the same information, and I must take the responsibility of ascertaining that information.</P>
    <P>I always like to give Deputies of this House their fair side of the argument. One thing that is perfectly certain is&mdash; I think there is no person who has the slightest doubt about it&mdash;that the refusal in this case has no element of discourtesy. It is founded on a principle and on the understanding of a principle which may be wrong, but a principle which has, from the very beginning up to the present, been accepted by this House.  It has been accepted by this <Col N="1190" /> House to cover Governmental money running into many, many millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary case the difficulty which I have put against the Deputy's argument might not seem sound.  But, fortunately or unfortunately, there is another order in existence which does enable me compulsorily to obtain all such information in relation to the production, distribution or carriage of turf in reference to every organisation in this country.  Therefore, if I give this particular piece of information, or any other information of an administrative character, in relation to this particular activity, then logically I can be compelled to give to the House in regard to any firm in Ireland, in regard to any man in Ireland who is cutting, handling, transporting or dealing with turf, any information of any sort, kind, or description, that the curiosity or the interest or the perverted imagination of the Deputy may desire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is actually the logical position.  There is no escape from that logical position.  The Deputy himself has declared the parallel and I say I have the power.  It is the power which I have as Turf Controller; not my power in the ordinary way in relation to the Turf Development Board, but my power as Turf Controller which the Deputy demands that I should use for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment; you just sit quiet.  If I exercise that power in relation to any portion of it, then it can be demanded of me that I exercise it in relation to the whole ambit of my activity and to every single organism which is functioning in it. That was not the understanding this House had when it set up the Turf Development Board and it was not the understanding of this House when it set up the Turf Controller and gave him certain power to get information. Because I should be violating the intention of this House when it set up <Col N="1191" /> the Turf Development Board and I should be outraging the intention of the House when it gave me power as Turf Controller if I did what I was asked, I continue to refer the Deputy on this occasion, and will refer him on all future occasions on which he asks questions within the administrative <Col N="1192" /> competence of the Turf Development Board, to the answer which he has already received twice from my predecessors and twice from me.</P>
