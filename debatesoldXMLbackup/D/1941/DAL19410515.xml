    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> Question again proposed:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in normal circumstances, when there is nothing like war or rumours of war to upset the even tenor of his way, the duty of a Minister for Finance introducing a Budget is frequently filled with difficulties.  I need not stress the fact that under conditions as we know them to-day the duty imposed on me as Minister for Finance is much more difficult.  It is bad enough to have heavily increased and increasing expenditure to meet, but it makes the situation much more difficult when the sources of revenue to meet the necessarily increased expenditure imposed by present conditions are less in many respects than when such increased expenditure was not required.  Tobacco, as I said in my Budget statement, has been a sort of fairy godmother for Ministers for Finance over a long period.  It has provided us with a very considerable part of our revenue.  Beer and spirits have been to a secondary degree helpful. Beer and spirits we produce here, and the amount imported is very small in proportion.  There was very little imported last year and there will probably be much less this year.  We have already had to restrict the amount of tobacco taken out of bond by 20 per cent.  That, as you will understand, has had a very bad effect on the revenue.  We have a certain amount in stock but, unless there is a change in the shipping situation, I do not know where, at the end of nine or ten months, we are going to look for the revenue of the year to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy, in speaking on the Budget last week, complained that the Minister for Finance had not given the House, as was, he said, customary, a detailed review of the economic prospects of the year or the future.  In <Col N="513" /> times like the present, circumstanced as we are, not masters of our own destiny, economically and financially, we are living and are forced to live a kind of hand-to-mouth existence.  No amount of forethought would enable us, circumstanced as I say we are, to overcome the difficulties inherent in our situation.  Even if we had a fleet of 100 ships at our disposal, owned by us or chartered by us as the case might be, unfortunately we have no guarantee that these ships could land their cargoes in our harbours.  That is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think that is obvious to everybody.  Ships are being sunk round our coasts, our own ships included, every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>By whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been always able to decide by whom, but we can very well imagine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not, therefore, give anything like a detailed forecast of what our economic position is going to be by the end of this financial year and with less certitude could I forecast what the future after the end of this financial year is likely to hold for us.  From what we read, it would be, I think, a miracle to expect that the war will end before the end of this financial year.  I noticed, in reading the debates that took place in the British House of Commons on the war situation a week ago, that some of the most prominent and distinguished British statesmen, in office and out of office, were talking in terms of the war as it might be proceeding in 1943 and 1944.  I think I read of one prominent man who spoke about what the war position might be in 1945.  I hope that the war will not last that long for God only knows what our position is going to be if it does.  It was difficult enough before to make ends meet but we can imagine what the difficulties will be if the war continues&mdash;even if our circumstances remain as they are and we are <Col N="514" /> lucky enough to avoid any worsening of the situation.  The difficulties of any Minister for Finance may be doubled or trebled in 1943, 1944 or in 1945 should the war continue into these years.  All we can do is to try, as best we can, to overcome present difficulties and to forecast up to the end of the financial year as best we may.</P>
      <P>Though we have not attempted to balance fully the expenditure and revenue side of the Budget, except through borrowing, we shall be lucky if we are able to get away in future years with a Budget of the type that it was my duty to put before the House in the last week.  There is no use now in Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Dillon or Deputy McGilligan upbraiding us with the extravagance of the last ten years about which Deputy Cosgrave reminded us.  I am satisfied that if Deputy Cosgrave had remained in office for the last nine years, he would have had to increase expenditure year by year just as we had, though perhaps not to the same extent because he evidently had different ideas of how things might be managed from what we had.  The fact that we had different ideas, that we put these before the country and suggested to the country that if we were given office, we would do things in a different way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that, though I have often heard it trotted out here.  I do not know which of my colleagues is alleged to have said it. At any rate, we did tell the country that in certain directions we would expend considerable sums of money and <Col N="515" /> we did.  We got office on that basis. Not alone did we get responsibility then but we got it over and over again. Deputy Dillon has, I know, told the country over and over again that the country is to blame.  It is a fact that we did propound a certain policy to the country.  We told them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view was that Deputy Cosgrave and his Party had not managed the country satisfactorily. We told the people that they should feel politically the same as we did.  We got them to believe that.  We were then in office for 12 months and Mr. Cosgrave and his Party went round the country to every hole and corner where they could get two people together and told them that they had made an awful blunder in 1932, that they must have been living in the clouds when they allowed the spell-binders of Fianna Fáil to mislead them so far as to get them to elect them to office.  Of course, we were reminded that Fianna Fáil did not get a majority then and that it was the Labour Party held them in office. We then went to the country again and we got a bigger majority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave reminded us, in one of his speeches on the Budget, that we had been extravagant and, incidentally, he said that we had added to the dead-weight debt.  I presume he was referring to housing. That is the item which might be said by some people to add the greatest amount to what would be described by them as the dead-weight debt of the country.  I do not regard it as dead-weight debt.  I regard it as a good investment, but I do admit that it was expensive.  Balancing up your account, you have to allow for a certain amount of capital debt, but you cannot express in figures, accurately or adequately, the amount of advantage&mdash;even financial advantage&mdash;the building of these houses has been to the country.  While you have the debt placed against you on one side of the account, you cannot express in financial terms the advantage brought to the country by that housing policy on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Cosgrave had been there, I take it, from his criticism of us, that he would not have built these houses. His Government built a certain number of houses during their period of office and, as he reminded us, they did not add to the dead-weight debt.  If we had carried out the same financial methods in regard to housing as he carried out, we would have been as great failures as regards housing as he was.  The carrying on of that policy with regard to housing&mdash;I quote that as an example because it is one I know a great deal about&mdash;necessarily meant increased staff.  When I took up office in the Department of Local Government and introduced, at the request of the Government, the Housing Act of <Col N="517" /> 1932&mdash;our first year of office&mdash;there was not sufficient staff in the Department to carry out the work involved by that policy.  What is true of housing is true of other items in the Fianna Fáil policy which were good for the country, which the country asked for and which the country gave us power, again and again, to carry out.  This policy involved increased capital expenditure on housing and public health works and it involved increased staff. The policy could not have been carried out without increased staff.  I know that nothing I could say to them would convince Deputy Cosgrave or those on his front or back benches that they are unwise in carrying on this propaganda about extravagance, and about increases in the number of civil servants, and in Civil Service salaries. Nevertheless, I think the country knows that it demanded the housing policy which we introduced, the change brought about in the industrial policy of the Government and improvements in social services.  The country wanted these and were prepared to pay for them.  If they are now told that they are paying too much for the staffs to operate these policies, I think it can be said that the country has adjudged that issue more than once.  The people of the country got, at least, two chances since we came into office to decide whether we were extravagant or not and, if they wished, they could have decided against us.  Deputies on the other side can keep on hammering at these things as much as they like but I do not think that they will change the people&rsquo;s minds.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested and rather mystified by a remark made in the course of his speech by Deputy Giles. He said that the people were looking outside the House for a leader.  Does that mean that they want to drop Deputy Cosgrave, that they have lost faith in him?  Evidently, Deputy Giles has lost faith in him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to get somebody outside the House to put us out.  He talked about a revolution and revolutionary bodies if <Col N="518" /> they were to get rid of Fianna Fáil. There is not much chance of Deputy Cosgrave, judging by his past performances, getting rid of Fianna Fáil, and I think there is less chance for the revolutionary body Deputy Giles seems to have in mind.  Does he seriously want to drop the pilot?  I am not surprised, because he has not been much of a success in the past eight or nine years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave talked about balanced budgets&mdash;&ldquo;occasionally there was a balanced budget&rdquo;. As I said at the beginning, these are difficult times for people in my position.  However, from the strictly financial standpoint and keeping in mind the strictest canons laid down by any of the financial writers or economists, I do not see that there is anything&mdash;financially speaking&mdash;wrong in the Minister for Finance setting aside in any year a portion of his expenditure as capital expenditure.  My predecessor here did that and was challenged in several years by the Opposition. When expenditure of a capital kind is spread over a number of years, I do not agree that it is wrong to charge a certain proportion as capital expenditure which will benefit the country for a long period, and to divide it over four, five or ten years, or whatever number of years may be adequate.</P>
      <P>It must be understood clearly that it is capital expenditure, the fruits of which will come in when the capital has been fully expended and when the institution or building, as the case may be, is brought into full use for the operation of certain services on behalf of the State.  Because that factor has been introduced into budgets here in the past, Deputy Cosgrave has objected and claimed that my predecessor&rsquo;s budgets, or some of them, were not balanced.  I do not agree with that view.  I suggest that, judged by the strictest financial standards, the budgets of my predecessor were as honestly&mdash;that is a word that Deputy Cosgrave used&mdash;balanced as any budget of a former Minister for Finance in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy claimed that, during the last eight or nine years, we made no effort to increase the productivity of the country.  That is a charge which cannot truthfully be levelled at this Government.  Certainly, we set to work with great energy.  The present Minister for Supplies is a man of energy and ability.  He was put in charge of the policy of industrialising <Col N="522" /> this country, and carried that through with a great measure of success.  He brought new industries into existence here, some of which it was thought never would have been successful in this country.  Increased numbers of men and women were put into industry to manufacture things which never had been manufactured here before.  In that way, we added materially to the productivity of the country, so it is not true to say that we did not do so during our period of office.</P>
    <P>We tried to carry out the Sinn Féin policy of industrialisation.  Before the split in the Sinn Féin Party on the Treaty question, the gentlemen on the Front Bench opposite were associated with Sinn Féin&mdash;Deputy Brennan was one, and Deputies Cosgrave and Mulcahy were others.  We all preached the industrial policy that Griffith taught. It was he who gave us those ideas; he gave them to Deputies Cosgrave, Mulcahy and Brennan as he gave them to me.  We adopted them and propagated them; we went around the country asking people to back Sinn Féin and the Independence Movement for the purpose of enabling Ireland to acquire political and industrial independence. Griffith&mdash;the Lord rest his soul&mdash;got no opportunity to put his own policy into operation.  He was not spared, but his disciples were there, and the Deputies opposite were as much his disciples on that matter as I was.  We all understood that, when they got power, they would endeavour to build up industries here and not allow Ireland to continue as it was until then&mdash; practically an agricultural country, with the consequences that meant to the general standard of our wealth.</P>
    <P>As well as housing that is one of the several reasons I mentioned why Fianna Fáil was given office.  It was worth mentioning for this reason, that we were charged with being extravagant and increasing the number of civil servants and their salaries.  In order to introduce that policy we had to increase to a considerable extent the staff of the Revenue Commissioners, to implement the tariff policy that was necessary for our industrial progress. Deputies on the opposite benches are blaming us because we put into operation <Col N="523" /> the policy that the founder of Sinn Féin, Griffith, stood for and preached all his life, but which they failed to operate when they had the machinery of office in their hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nally went through the Book of Estimates and took the figures for 1932 and compared them with the figures for this year and last year. Take education, on which we spent £60,000 more in 1932, and this year we are spending £80,000 more.  These are rough figures, and I am not quoting what the Deputy said exactly.  If there was never a change of Government, if Deputy Cosgrave and his Government had remained in office for the last eight or nine years, or if there had not been one added to the staff of the Civil Service, the cost would be increased by 10 per cent. or 15 per cent., because when the State was set up the civil servants were mostly young people. Civil servants&rsquo; salaries are graded, and when they reach a certain maximum, if they are qualified, they can go higher, so that there would have been a considerable increase in every Department if not one person had been added to the Civil Service.  It is not true to say that we are responsible for all the additional expense shown in the Book of Estimates for the various Departments for this year compared with 1932.  The Deputies who made that statement did not take what has happened into account.  Deputy Cosgrave wondered how expense could be decreased at the end of the war, and he quoted a phrase of mine in the Budget speech, in which he said I looked forward to the day when the present heavy burden could be lightened with advantage to the well being of the nation.  &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; the Deputy added, &ldquo;the Minister must have been serious when he made himself responsible for that statement.&rdquo;  He also asked how it was to be carried out.</P>
    <P>In the Budget statement I said what I think should be obvious to everybody, that to put it in a modest way, we are spending four times as much on the Army this year&mdash;in reality more than four times as much&mdash;as we spent before the war.  There is £6,000,000 alone&mdash; and that is a considerable sum for this <Col N="524" /> country&mdash;that need not be spent if we had peace in the world around us. Deputy Linehan, who made what I thought a very good speech, stated that once expenditure goes up it never goes back to the same figure.  There is a good deal of truth in that statement. The House is as much responsible for that as the Government or the Minister for Finance.  Once taxes have been imposed and we become accustomed to a large revenue, one hundred and one projects spring to the minds of Deputies in all Parties, that they think may be excellent projects, and excellent ways of spending money for the benefit of the nation, but that may not be thought practical or expedient in other circumstances because of their cost.  We have now got to the realm of £40,000,000 for the Budget.  That is an enormous figure.  Deputies say that as the people have been made pay, and as income-tax and various other taxes have been raised, the people have got used to them, and as we have that much money, why not spend it on projects like the one Deputy Dillon is seriously interested in, family allowances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, Deputy Linehan and Deputies in all Parties want family allowances.  They suggest that if we had family allowances introduced we could do away with some other expenditure. Perhaps expenditure might be moderated on a service like home help, but you will never get rid of that service altogether.  There are other people besides the people who would get family allowances to be thought of, and with family allowances there would be a considerable addition to the burden of the social services that we are at present bearing.  The question of family allowances is being examined at present, but I should like to see the results of the examination before expressing an opinion.  We would all like to do away with what is called poor relief.  Every Party would like to do away with that service if it were possible.  Despite the fact that we are dealing with the Budget in the realm of £40,000,000 we are not a rich country.  That could not go on.  We are doing it for the emergency, and in the hope that the service on which we <Col N="525" /> are spending this money will keep us out of greater trouble.  If we were involved in the war there would be no use in talking about the Budget, as money, property or anything else would not matter.  If we want to take any account of the future, and if we have any hope of living anything like a normal existence, we cannot, I suggest, go on on the terms of a Budget of £40,000,000, because it is at a great sacrifice on the part of every class of the community that that heavy taxation is raised.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that Deputies stated that once taxation reached a high figure it was very difficult to bring it down, but Deputies on all sides look forward to the day when peace is restored in the world, and when we can benefit, as we hope we will, by being able to save at least £6,000,000 that is now being spent on the Army. Whoever is Minister for Finance will not be allowed to save the whole of the £6,000,000, because there will be demands from all parts for projects, perhaps good in themselves, but that will be costly.  Deputy Cosgrave wanted to know how expenditure could be decreased.  I pointed out one item, and I hope it will not be long until the day comes that a very considerable portion of the expenditure on the Army can be eliminated from the Estimates.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave said, I propose to balance the Budget by borrowing close on £4,000,000.  Some Deputies on the Front Bench opposite, Deputies O'Higgins, Linehan and McGilligan, for example, suggested that I should borrow a great deal more.  There does not seem to be any unity of thought in financial matters on that side of the House.  I get flailed by one set of Deputies for borrowing at all, and I get abused by another set of Deputies, sitting almost side by side with them, for not borrowing more. Deputy Linehan said I should borrow £15,000,000 and Deputy McGilligan asked why I should not borrow a great deal more.  I thought I was striking a medium, not taking an extravagant view on one side or the other.</P>
    <P>I propose to put on a very considerable amount of additional taxation. You realise, or you have been told by <Col N="526" /> various interested parties, how the heavy additional taxation proposed has impinged upon, and will impinge upon, the lives of people in various ways.  I do not think it would be wise to go much further this year with additional taxation.  Neither do I think it would be wise to go much further with borrowing.  If this war continues, God only knows what methods we will have to resort to yet, but for the present we will try to play as safely as we can, keeping in mind that we have to live, that this is not the last financial year, that there are other financial years to come that must be provided for.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Norton reminded us, the struggle for life is hard.  He says it is going to be harder than ever.  That is probably true, especially if the conditions that we are now accustomed to continue.  That is why we were obliged to take the measures that we took within the last week or two, with the standstill order as one side of it. Life is hard and it is going to be harder.  We had the choice between allowing what happened in the last war to be repeated, or else trying to take measures to see that the disasters, financially and economically speaking, that resulted after the last war would not be repeated.</P>
    <P>Despite the jeers about equality of sacrifice, we have sincerely tried to make the burden as equal as possible on all classes of the community.  I know that Deputies on the Labour benches do not agree, but in proportion we have tried to spread out the burden as evenly as possible.  I do not deny that the 4d. on the ounce of tobacco is a heavy burden on the poor people, but look at the thousands we are taking off other people.  As some Deputies have reminded us, the man with £1,000 or £5,000 a year has had a heavy blister put upon him&mdash;no more moderate language can describe it.  But Labour Deputies say: &ldquo;What does it matter to him?  He can live and he will never be short of a meal.&rdquo;  Do Deputies on the Labour benches suggest that the proper thing would be to get that man who has, let us say, through his business or as a professional man or an industrialist, <Col N="527" /> earned for himself a prosperous living, a good living and is used to it, and place him on a much lower level?  Are we, in order to get that equality of sacrifice that seems to be in the minds of some Deputies, to oblige that man to live in a labourer&rsquo;s cottage on 30/- a week?  The extravagant suggestions made by some Deputies put that thought in my mind.</P>

He is paying to-day so that he may be able to live, so that he may have even 23/- or 24/- a week, in a year or two after the war.

      <P>We are trying to secure that he will have some employment. If we do not take these steps now, there will be nothing but the most serious consequences facing us if we allow the spiral&mdash;a much abused word invented in the last war&mdash;to continue. If we allow that process to be reenacted during this emergency, the gravest consequences will follow.  I know the position is difficult, and it was not with any pleasure that I submitted to my Government colleagues the proposal to put this heavy duty on tobacco, or additional heavy taxation on incomes or on corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told here and elsewhere that putting this heavy additional tax on corporations is going to strike at the foundations of industry.  There is probably some truth in the suggestion that there will not be the same <Col N="528" /> incentive to the men engaged in industry, directors and owners of industrial institutions and those who promote industry&mdash;that there will not be the same desire or incentive on their part to invest in industry.</P>

      <P>I do not object to the road-worker getting a decent living wage.  I have done my best in a modest way to help to see that road-workers got it, when I had the opportunity.

      <P>However, the Deputy is none the worse for it.  I know he is interested in the poor, but he should not put on blinkers and look only in the one direction.  Deputies who have spoken have asked me: &ldquo;Why do you tax tobacco?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why do you not tax cinemas?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Why do you not tax bicycles and leave the corporations alone?&rdquo; There are not two <Col N="529" /> men in the House who, if they were making a Budget, would agree how exactly that Budget should be made out.  We would all have differences of opinion.  Deputy Hickey, I am sure, would be one of the most difficult men to get to agree with any of his colleagues as to how it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy would be a very difficult man to handle on matters of that kind.  At any rate, I went into a variety of things with my advisers.  I did not, as somebody suggested, forget bicycles, cinemas, or beer and spirits, and I did not forget a variety of other things.  I went into them all, but there are difficulties and snags in everything that you can suggest. Some Deputy here suggested that he would not agree with some other Deputy who wanted a tax on bicycles. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; some Deputy said, &ldquo;I would not tax bicycles, because the bicycle is the poor man&rsquo;s motor car.&rdquo; I think it was Deputy Everett who said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>And so it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, although there is a number of men, who would not be reckoned by Deputy Everett to be poor men, who are now riding bicycles.  However, there were other reasons why that tax was difficult. It may have to come yet, but a strange thing is that I got a lot more letters&mdash;I got very many letters offering suggestions for taxes of various kinds &mdash;but I got a lot more recommending a tax on bicycles than I did recommending any other form of tax.  So it evidently was expected.  I got twice or three times as many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>These were from lads who did not ride bicycles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, before this emergency ends, and if it continues much longer, bicycles may not be safe from tax, and a variety of other things may not be safe.  The cinemas are very heavily taxed at present, and there is a thing you have often heard about, called the law of diminishing returns. <Col N="530" /> If you go beyond that ratio, if you go beyond the rate of tax to where it gets so heavy that, instead of making a profit out of it from the revenue point of view, you kill or help to kill the industry, then you lose your tax: not alone do you lose what you got formerly, but you lose a great deal more.  That might happen with regard to the cinemas, which are heavily taxed at present.  I would not hesitate to tax bicycles, cinemas, or anything else that I found profitable and reasonable under present circumstances.  I would have avoided putting such a heavy tax on the poor man&rsquo;s tobacco or cigarettes if I could have found a reasonable other form of tax that would be convenient for the time, but with regard to bicycles and the cinemas together, if I did put an extra tax on them, I could not impose a tax on them that would bring me in anything like the amount of revenue that the tax on tobacco will give.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes, I think, was one of those who were interested in a tax on cinemas and said, in effect, why should I not tax cinemas rather than tobacco? I agree that the tax on tobacco is heavy.  As far as tobacco is concerned, I am like Deputy Hickey: I had to give it up.  I do not know whether he ever smoked or not.  I did, but for throat reasons I had to give it up.  However, I did not like putting a tax upon tobacco, particularly the plug tobacco.  I was able last year to lighten the load to some extent on the plug tobacco, but I was not able to do any more in that direction this year. Deputy Hughes thought I was too optimistic in suggesting that I would get a certain revenue out of tobacco and spirits and other such things this year, but there is a certain considerable store of stocks here and, at any rate, we will get the revenue on these, whatever may happen in the future, so I do not think I was over-estimating in putting down the figures I put down in the Budget.</P>

      <P>Some Deputy did. Now, there was one matter to which Deputies referred, about which there was a certain misunderstanding, and that was in relation to the Defence Conference and the Defence Council. I referred to the Defence Council in my speech, or the Council of Defence, and Deputy Cosgrave took it up that I was referring to the Defence Conference. Perhaps it was my fault that I did not correct Deputy Cosgrave when he was speaking, but I did not want to interrupt him, and so I let it go.  It is true, nevertheless, that the Defence Conference did have the Estimates for the Army in their hands for a fortnight before they were introduced here.  Now, I do not want to suggest that the Defence Conference are in any way at all responsible for this Army Estimate.  They have no responsibility for it.  The Government and the Minister for Defence take the responsibility for it, but Deputy Cosgrave, speaking on that matter, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the first time I heard that the Minister approached the Council of Defence in connection with this matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He took it that I was referring to the Defence Council.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was the first time I heard that the Minister approached the Council of Defence in connection with this matter.  I was unaware of it.  I should have been glad to afford him every assistance in my power if he had made such application.  In my view, that Estimate of £8,000,000 should be reduced by over £3,000,000 as it contains a negligible amount for the most important item in the Estimate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, it was, as I understand it, at the suggestion of the Defence Conference that the Army Estimate was not published in detail in the Book of Estimates, and the Defence Conference was given, in greater detail than is published usually in the Book of Estimates, the Army Estimate this year.  The Minister for Defence, introducing his Army Estimate, said here:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The detailed Estimate, showing the cost of the many services covered <Col N="532" /> by the Army Vote, has been in the hands of the members of the Defence Conference for the past two weeks, by whom it has been carefully examined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said when introducing the Army Estimate.  Now, I do not want to put, as I have already said, any responsibility at all on the Defence Conference.  They have no responsibility for the Army Estimate, and I do not suggest that they should have, nor do I suggest that they are responsible for the size of the Army, but it was at their suggestion that the Army Estimate was not published in detail in the Book of Estimates, and the details were given to them, as the Minister said, and were in their hands for at least two weeks.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Cosgrave saw the Estimate; he is not a member of the Defence Conference; but he says here: &ldquo;It is the first time I heard that the Minister approached the Council of Defence in connection with this matter.&rdquo;  He meant to say the Conference for Defence or Defence Conference instead of Council of Defence.  I did not approach the Defence Conference, but the Minister for Defence said here that the details were in the hands of the Defence Conference for a fortnight.  I do not know whether Deputy Cosgrave&rsquo;s colleagues showed him these details&mdash;the Deputy says he did not see them&mdash;but he says that he would be glad to afford the Minister for Finance whatever assistance lay in his power, if he had made such an application.  I would not think it proper&mdash;it would, I think, be improper of me&mdash;to go over the head of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, to ask the Defence Conference for their views.  If I wanted their views, I should have to get them through my colleague, the Minister for Defence.</P>

I did not intend to give the impression that I had ever asked, and I do not think it would be right or proper for me to approach them, but I do say, now that the matter has been raised, that the Estimates were in the hands of the members of the Defence Conference for a fortnight.  The Minister for Defence says that they were in their hands for a fortnight, and Deputy Cosgrave, if he saw them, did not make any suggestions, although he says that he could save £3,000,000 on the Army Estimate.</P>

      <P>It is perfectly true that the Estimates were submitted in detail to the Defence Conference, but, as the Minister has admitted, it is no function of the conference to regulate Army expenditure.  It is concerned merely with defence.  It is perfectly true also that the Defence Conference, for the purpose of screening our military preparations, did decide that the details of the Army Estimate should not be published.  That was done by agreement at the Defence Conference, and I think it was a sensible agreement, but the Defence Conference was not asked to say whether they would spend £8,750,000 on the Army or not.  That was not the function of the conference at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Deputy.  Why did Deputy Cosgave come forward afterwards and say he could have reduced them by £3,000,000? He had his chance of telling the House, or anybody else, when the Estimates were presented, but he did not suggest taking even £1 off them.  Deputy Norton reminds us that there was an agreement that they would not be discussed in detail.  If that be so, stand by the agreement, and do not come forward afterwards and tell us: &ldquo;I could have reduced that amount by £3,000,000, if I got the chance.&rdquo;  He had his chance if he had wanted to avail of it and there are various ways in which he might have made the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other remark which I thought unfair of Deputy Cosgrave was his reference to the foot-and-mouth disease and &ldquo;the incapacity and uselessness of the Minister for Agriculture and his <Col N="535" /> Ministry.&rdquo;  He is entitled to say what he likes to the Minister for Agriculture. I am sure he will get a Roland for his Oliver any time he does address polite or other remarks to that Minister, or to others, myself included, but I think he might have left the Ministry out of his reference.  My belief&mdash;and I think Deputies in general will agree with me&mdash;is that we have in the Department of Agriculture as fine, as experienced, as hardworking and as enthusiastic a set of officials as could be found in any Department of Agriculture in any part of the world.  I say that for the administrative and professional staff.  I do not know any of the professional staff, but I know some of the administrative staff.  I met the secretary of the Department for the first time when we were going to Ottawa.  I got to know him then, and I have got to know him very well since, and there is not anywhere a more experienced, a more knowledgeable man on everything relating to agriculture than that man. He is a first-rate official.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement should not have emanated from that bench, and particularly from Deputy Cosgrave, that we have a useless Ministry.  Let him say what he likes about the Minister.  He is fair game, but the officials there, and particularly the secretary, are as experienced and as knowledgeable in matters pertaining to agriculture as could be found anywhere. The secretary is head of the administrative side, and he has a unique knowledge of all branches of agriculture, and I believe that we have on the medical side of that Department as good a staff as could be selected, take them from where you like.  Whatever advice these men gave to the Minister was, I believe, carried out to the letter.  The Minister, unquestionably, <Col N="536" /> is responsible, and I am sure that his shoulders are broad enough to take any blame put on them, but he has an excellent Department, with experienced and hard-working officials.  They have been run off their feet for the past few months since this unfortunate outbreak which has done such awful damage in the country.  I am not speaking of the financial cost, which is upwards of £500,000, but of the cost to individual farmers, which amounts to a great deal more.  There should not be any derogatory references of that kind to the officials of the Department of Agriculture, and Deputy Cosgrave ought to take the earliest opportunity of mending his hand.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton said that keeping down the wages of the workers is a disastrous policy.  I went into the subject of the standstill order before Deputy Norton came in.  We have to keep down expenses on everybody, and it is not fair to say that we are dealing only with the workers, because the workers and directors of industry are being treated alike.  The directors of industry are not to have an increase any more than the workers.  The shareholder in industry is not being allowed an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday, and I should like to put a somewhat similar question to the Minister for Finance.  If a manufacturer pleads that the price of raw material has increased, he is entitled to increase the price of his manufactured goods, but the city worker whose raw material &mdash;his food&mdash;has increased in price is not entitled to get an increase in wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If a manufacturer increases the price of his goods to an <Col N="538" /> extent that is found not to be justified, he will not be allowed to get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not allow the worker to get any increase, justified or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not allow a manufacturer to get away with an unjustified profit.  As to the question of taxing profiteers, taxes cannot be sprung on an industry, any more than on individuals, from week to week or month to month.  Normally it is only once a year, when the Budget is introduced, that taxes are re-arranged. Suppose, for instance, that in 1939 a business man or a manufacturer laid in big stocks because he saw the war coming and in the year ending 31st December, 1939, was able to make big profits.  He might know he was making profits, but he would not be certain, if he had an industry or a factory or a warehouse, until the auditor went through his books, and he would not have his balance sheet presented to him until some time in March.  The income-tax authorities would not get the returns from him until some months later, and the assessment for income-tax does not go out until a year after that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally two years will elapse before the impact of an increased tax on anybody earning big profits will become operative.  The ordinary machinery works in that way.  It is next to impossible to speed it up.  People say: &ldquo;Why did you not take the increased profits last year off the people who made them in 1939 because of the war?&rdquo; When I became Minister for Finance and was looking for money in connection with the emergency Budget and last year&rsquo;s Budget I inquired from the Revenue authorities if there was anything in the till of these big business people in the way of extra profits that I could get and the report made to me was that it would not be worth while getting after them on the balance sheets and returns in their possession, but these returns related to a period a year or maybe two years before that. At the beginning of this year I again asked the Revenue authorities, having <Col N="539" /> in mind the extra profits that might be got, what they had to say with regard to this year.  They made a thorough examination and they said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yes, there are extra profits.  It will be for the Minister to decide what amount of tax he will put on, what share of the extra profits he intends to take.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is why the excess profits tax was put on this year and not last year.  It is not easy, with the machinery as it is, to put on taxes earlier than I have suggested.</P>

      <P>One of the most popular types of reading is the thriller, and there were some thrilling items in that speech, but there was nothing about disasters.  Deputy O'Higgins suggested a rebate in the tax on petrol for certain types of people.  I have been informed by my officials that, when the British were here, they tried to operate something of that kind.  They found, however, there was so much abuse of it&mdash;that so many fraudulent claims were being made&mdash;that they had to drop it very quickly.  I suppose we would be liable to be treated in the same way.  Deputy Cogan suggested an extra duty on the cinemas.  I have before me the amounts we get out of the tax on tobacco and cinemas.  What we get from tobacco is 20 times greater than the amount we get from the cinemas.  We were talking about a tax on bicycles.  I suppose if things continue as they are we may have to consider the Deputy&rsquo;s <Col N="541" /> suggestion.  I have no objection to taxing cinemas.  I am no lover of them. I do not think I have been in a cinema once during the last five years.  At the same time, as I said the other day, I am no killjoy.  It is not because I do not go to cinemas that I would not tax them.  I would, if I thought I could get anything worth while out of the tax. This year we are getting £337,000 in tax out of the cinemas.  Deputies should remember that a number of the cinemas in this city have been closed. From an examination of their accounts and balance sheets, we are aware that a number of other cinemas are just barely able to keep open.  That is the position.  We do not want to close any more of them.  The cinemas give a good deal of employment.</P>
      <P>The corporation profits tax was dealt with at considerable length last night by Deputy McGilligan in what I thought was a reasonable speech.  It is a tax that can be criticised.  It will bear heavily on industry.  We often talk about the undesirability of retrospective legislation.  This is retrospective taxation, a thing which is not to be admired in normal circumstances. But then, on the other hand, I have to get money.  Here was a source from which to get some.  Between this item and certain other income-tax items I expect to get close on £2,000,000.  If I had not put on this tax I do not know what alternative source I had from which to get money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin said that the banks would not give money for necessary constructive works.  I do not think any constructive scheme put up to me or to the Minister for Local Government in the last few years has been left without money.  There have been delays, and while we have had to pay pretty dearly for the money, I think I can say that the local authorities have got the money they required for their housing schemes.</P>

      <P>In Dublin, Cork and in other areas they have got the money for their constructive schemes. <Col N="542" /> Deputies may blame the Government if they like, but it is not fair to say that the banks would not give the money.  I know that this Budget imposes heavy burdens.  At the same time, I think it is true to say that there was a sigh of relief not only in the House, but outside of it when the Budget statement was read by me on yesterday week.  I say that because everyone expected that the demands to be made would be higher.  That view was expressed by some Deputies.  Some said that it was a very popular Budget.</P>

      <P>I do not know what figure the Deputy would regard as a reasonable one for income-tax. The day may come when it may have to be higher than 10/- in the £, but let us not run away with the story until the time of real pressure comes.  We hope to have a little bit in hand to meet the day of real depression and disaster.  But on the whole, as I have said, I think I can claim that this was not an unpopular Budget, and that it met the present situation fairly. Deputy Norton claims that it hits the worker pretty hard.  I have had deputations from various industries putting the other point of view, as to why I did not tax this, that and the other, and pointing out that the tax on this or that industry was going to ruin some particular industry.  Surely, it is not the desire of the Government, or of any Minister for Finance, to tax industry in such a way that the future of that industry is going to be jeopardised. I do not want to do it.  It would be very foolish for any Minister for Finance to do it.  I have tried to fit the burden to the back that has to bear it, as best I could.  As I said <Col N="543" /> earlier, if some other member of the House had my job in the last few months working out the details of this Budget he would probably have arranged the taxes differently.  It is true to say that hardly any two members of the House would arrive at, or adopt, the same methods of taxation, but I think taking it all in all the Budget is as fair and equitable as the circumstances permit.  I know it is heavy.  I know it takes a lot of the gilt off the gingerbread in many cases. I know that I have got letters of bitter complaint from people in industry, but my job is to try to regulate the finances of the country in the best interests of the country as a whole, not thinking of individuals, not thinking of classes, but thinking of every individual and of every class and thinking of their welfare in the future that lies before us.</P>

      <P>I will not get very many.  I know that a very influential section of the community here, the newspaper people, who hold a lot of our political futures in their hands, are wrathful with me for taxing them, but it cannot be helped.  They have to bear their share the same as anyone else.  I know that times are hard for them and that paper is hard to get, but the times are bad for everybody, and while it would be tempting, if one is thinking of a political future, to remember the newspapers, I am afraid I cannot give way to the pressure which has been, and is being and will be brought to bear on me before this Budget goes through to relieve the newspapers of the tax.  There are, however, two items which I have agreed may be foregone for this year at any rate.  One is the tax on cider. I have gone into the question of cider again, and while I have a doubt in my mind, I think a case has been made that the tax should not be increased at any rate for this year, and cider is going to get the benefit of it.  The second item is, strange to say, the tax on imported daily and non-daily <Col N="544" /> papers, periodicals and the like.  I have gone into the figures, and I find that the tax already imposed has hit that trade so hard that it has reduced it to about one-third of what it was before the tax went on.  Not alone the tax but the difficulties of transport have almost blotted out that trade, and this tax would probably finish it; so, in the circumstances, I agreed to drop the tax in this case.  The two of them, the tax on cider and on those imported daily and non-daily papers, would amount in revenue to about £14,000 to £15,000, but I have had one piece of luck which enables me to meet that loss without altering to any great extent the figures which I put before you last Thursday.  Through the operations of the Prices Commission I am getting a considerable sum, which was not expected, out of matches.  Balancing one with the other, I am able to meet those two items and have a small bit in hand.  With your permission, Sir, I am proposing not to report Resolutions 7 and 8, which deal with cider, and Resolutions 11 and 12, which deal with newspapers.  That is a matter which may have to be arranged.</P>

      <P>This amendment is introduced to deal with a point raised by Deputy Hughes on both the Second Reading and Committee Stage.  It is provided in the Bill that creameries which sent milk to Dublin during the strike period will be permitted to continue to send milk on a certain basis, but it was thought that we should put some limit to the time during which they would be permitted to qualify.  There are two points to be fulfilled in the qualification. Firstly, they must qualify under the Milk and Dairies Act before they are permitted to send milk for consumption and, secondly, they must register with the Milk Board.  It is also provided that they must comply with the Milk and Dairies Act within two months of the passing of this Bill.  I should like to repeat that there is only one creamery that I think can qualify, apart from those now qualified, and that creamery, if it is going to qualify, has now only two months to do so.</P>

      <P>(6)  If any person being a registered producer in respect of a joint district attempts to sell any milk to any other person being a registered retailer or a registered wholesaler in respect of such district at a price less than the appropriate statutory minimum price such first-mentioned person shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in the Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>(7)  If any person (in this sub-section referred to as the vendor) who is a registered retailer or a registered wholesaler in respect of a joint district attempts to sell any milk to another person who is a registered retailer or a registered wholesaler in respect of such district at a price less than the price which would, if the vendor were a registered producer in respect of such district, be the appropriate statutory minimum price, the vendor shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in the Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the remaining point raised by Deputy Hughes. He thought that we should provide for penalties where any person attempts to evade the regulations.  The matter was evidently not covered in the Principal Act, and this is the best attempt we can make to deal with it now.  It is a very difficult point, but this is the best we can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister just one question.  I understand that, as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, between 1,500 and 2,000 cows have been slaughtered in the city. Does the Minister contemplate restrict-the number of cows to be licensed for dairying purposes in the city in the future?  Does he think it good policy to permit such a large number of cows to be kept in a modern city, and is he satisfied that there are proper facilities for keeping these cows?  To my mind, it is scarcely an economic proposition for people to keep these cows in a city because they have to buy the fodder, mangolds, turnips, grain and concentrated foods which are necessary. Again, most of them have to pay for grazing on the 11 months system during the summer period.  I think an opportunity is now afforded the Minister, if compensation has to be paid for these slaughtered cows, to review this whole matter.  I do not know how he could deal with it, but I suggest, now that he has the opportunity, that the whole problem should be examined before he permits restocking in the city.  I think the question is well worthy of examination, even from the public health point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, it is only on public health grounds that the question can be considered.  I have no function in that matter because the licensing of these dairies is altogether a question for the Corporation, acting under the public health laws.  I cannot say what the Corporation intends to do about it.  The Corporation, of course, are bound by the Milk and Dairies Act, and they must register premises that are up to standard.  Whether the Corporation would be inclined to raise the standard I could not say, but they will have to act within the law.  The only matter in which I could interfere when the foot-and-mouth restrictions are withdrawn would have reference to lairages for the markets.  We intend to insist on much higher standards in <Col N="551" /> the future than we had in the past in that matter.</P>

      <P>Some questions have been asked the Minister latterly in this House with regard to a census of wheat sown in the country and the provision that has been made for the future flour requirements of the country.  I have had a good deal of sympathy with the Minister in his efforts to answer these questions, because I do not think that any reliable census has been taken, or is being taken, of the amount of wheat sown.  In some districts it may be possible to get information from the seed merchants, but where wheat seed was sold in the open market, that is, exchanged between farmer and farmer, it is not easy for the Minister to obtain any indication as to the amount of wheat sown.  I should like to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to another aspect of the question to which my attention <Col N="552" /> has been drawn within the last week&mdash; that is, in regard to failures of wheat. I have before me a statement written by a very reliable person, setting out the very large number of people in his locality who had sown wheat which has failed, and who have had to plough up the land again.  As a matter of fact, he sets out that within a radius of a mile of his home 42 Irish acres of wheat have had to be ploughed up.  I am very glad to say that I have no information as regards wheat failures in my own locality, but I am afraid, if wheat has had to be ploughed up in this manner, a great deal of the blame must be laid at the door of the Minister and his advisers.  When they started out on this wheat campaign, I remember raising the matter here in this House, and I expressed the view that I was afraid people might sow wheat on land that would not support wheat.  I suggested that the people should be advised to grow whatever cereal crop they felt sure would give them the best results, because 30 cwt. of oats is much better than a ton of wheat.  I pointed out that if we had oats and barley we should not be hungry.  Yet the Minister and his advisers went out and asked for wheat, wheat, wheat.  I am afraid that the facts given in this letter are the result of that.  Unfortunately, it is now too late to sow any further cereals, and the tillage of these lands will be a total loss.  I do not know to what extent this has happened, but, from the letter before me, the position seems to be pretty alarming.  I should like the Minister to inquire into it, because it may be of great importance to the people.  If wheat has been sown in impoverished land, which is not able to grow it, or in weak, lea land, the Minister will see that a mistake has been made, and that mistake ought to have a lesson for himself and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion on which we debated this Estimate, I endeavoured to convince the Minister that a mistake was made in his Department, particularly during the past year, with regard to the supply of artificial manures.  For some reason that I could not understand at the time or since, the Minister lost his temper pretty badly.  I hope he is in better form <Col N="553" /> to-day and that, if we tread on his corns to a justifiable extent, he will not squeal as he did last time.  We are practically tied in a knot and will probably have to rely on our own resources for food.  One thing that will bring success to the Minister&rsquo;s Department is the creation of a feeling of confidence amongst the people.  If the Minister wants to establish confidence in himself and his Department, the best thing he can do is to face up to the situation.  There is no use in endeavouring to hide plain facts or the misdeeds of the past.  On the last night we debated this Estimate, I endeavoured to show that the Department made a great mistake with regard to artificial manures and I pointed to the grave and serious need for soil-fertility at the present time.  I said that there was diminishing soil-fertility during the period of the economic war and that we did not use, during that period, the amount of artificial manures which we were accustomed to use.  I should like to remind the Minister of the words I used on that occasion.  I said that the position with regard to this matter was, that the land was starved from 1932 to 1937.  The remainder of the debate, as reported, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dr. Ryan: Why did the Deputy&rsquo;s Party starve it?  What about the ten years before 1932?</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan: No....  I can give the figures.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: I do not care what figures the Deputy gives.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan: What amount of artificial manures was put into the land after 1932, as compared with what went in previously?</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: The same amount as went in for the previous ten years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, on the same occasion, accused me of saying things I knew to be absolutely without foundation or truth.  I did not do that. Anything and everything I said on that occasion I believed to be perfectly true.  If I were to accuse the Minister of making statements without foundation, and which he knew to be without foundation.  I should have more justification on my side.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> I have looked up the shipping statistics regarding the importation of artificial manures.  We did not import even half the amount of raw materials for artificial manures after the economic war that we did previous to it.  Our imports dropped from 222,000 tons to 94,000 or 95,000 tons.  I can give the Minister the figures out of the trade and shipping statistics.  When speaking the last night, I knew that there had been a considerable drop in the imports, because I had consulted these figures before.  They are not prepared by me but by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is not fair, particularly when the country is in a crisis, for the Minister to try to bluff through a situation of that sort.  That is not good for the Minister and is not good for the country.  If the country is to have any future, it must have soil-fertility and it is much better to face up to the fact that the soil was starved.</P>
    <P>During that period, whether the volume of agricultural output fell or not, the price fell and the profit to the people engaged in agriculture fell accordingly.  Land was not paying and the people had not the money to purchase artificial manures.  Nevertheless, the Minister comes to the House and says he does not care what figures I give, that the same amount of artificial manures was imported during the economic war as previous to it.  Not half the amount was imported in that period and we should face up to that situation.  We have heard of wheat having to be ploughed up at the present time.  Let us get to the root of that.  If anything can be done to increase the import of raw materials for artificial manures, it ought to be done. We are endeavouring to establish a mercantile marine and I understand that we have purchased ships for the conveyance of wheat to this country. That is very important.  I hope the ships arrive here safely and, when they do, I hope it will not be forgotten that we require rock phosphate from Africa, or wherever we can get it.  There is no use in expecting to feed our people on the fruits of the soil unless the soil is able to grow what we want.  Prior to the Minister assuming office, there was a feeling that the fertility of the soil <Col N="555" /> should be maintained but, in the conflict referred to by Deputy Childers regarding live stock and tillage&mdash;a conflict that should never have arisen&mdash; that was completely forgotten.  Peculiarly enough, the imports of raw materials for the manufacture of manures during the economic war and since were not, in the main, those required for the basis manures but for stimulants such as sulphate of ammonia, so that we have been using up, to a large extent, the fertility of the soil.  We shall not get better results by denying that we have been doing this.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the past year and immediately before it, the Minister has been very lackadaisical in telling the people what was expected of them. They were not told at the proper time. If we were to have a cereal scheme, it was very unfair that it was not thought well to go out and acquaint the people of the requirements until the beginning of 1941.  That was a very bad mistake. Looking back on the activities of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, they give the appearance of a half-dead, half-alive Department.  I should be very glad, indeed, to be able to congratulate the Department on having dealt with any particular matter in a very efficient way.  I am afraid, from the growing of wheat to the foot-and-mouth disease, the Government has not shown that it can control either the one or the other.</P>
    <P>Looking back, we find that there has been a decrease in the employment on farms.  Certainly, that does not fit in with the Minister&rsquo;s explanation here the other night that this Government had made agriculture more prosperous than their predecessors had.  If it was more prosperous, it appears extraordinary that there has been a drop even in the number of people employed on the farms.  In the period 1934 to 1938, taking agricultural employment as shown in the statistical publications, there was a drop of 20,052 persons&mdash;members of families&mdash;on the land.  In addition to that, there were 9,126 permanent workers less in agricultural work in 1938 than in 1934.  That was in a period in which some people say the self-sufficiency <Col N="556" /> policy was in operation&mdash;the policy which they say is saving this country now from starvation.  I do not agree with that at all.  We could have gone much further ahead in two years without such a self-sufficiency policy, if the matter had been properly pursued from the beginning of the war.  In the matter of families and permanent and temporary employees under and over 18, we had 42,000 less on the land in 1938 than in 1934.  I do not wish to make the Minister, in his present Estimate, responsible for that but it is a point which must not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers appealed here the other night for planning ahead.  I entirely agree with that, but do not agree that there has been any planning ahead by the Minister for Agriculture. I do not think there has been a live interest shown in his job by the Minister at any time.  There is a very serious matter which will confront this country and for which no provision has been made in the Estimate, and I should like to have the Minister&rsquo;s views on it&mdash;in connection with planning ahead for agriculture, planning ahead for progress and for prosperity&mdash;and that is the matter of artificial manures and the after-effects of growing too much cereals.  We may be compelled&mdash; as we are at the present time&mdash;to put cereals on land which, in my opinion, would yield a pretty poor crop.  In the ordinary way, we would not put them down, but we have done it this year and we may be forced to do it next year and in later years.  If our supplies of artificial manures are as meagre next year as they are this year, our land will suffer as a consequence.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there are people at the present time taking conacre all over the country.  They are to be highly commended for doing that.  I know men who have gone out with tractors in my district and have sown 40 and 50 acres of cereals on other men&rsquo;s land&mdash; on the land of men who could not afford the cost of the seed and other requirements.  These men will, I hope, take a good crop of cereals this year, and similarly next year, if necessary; but, eventually, the time will come when those people who do not own the <Col N="557" /> land will clear off it.  Then we will be presented with a terrible situation, unless we have made provision for it, unless we are by that time in such a position that we will have artificial manures.  The man who has been taking 50 or 60 acres in conacre and ploughing it with a tractor will not put in clover or grass seed in a few years when it is rid of nearly all its fertility. The owner will not be in a position to do it, either.  That is not a very bright picture to draw, but there is no use in closing our eyes to it.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister can take advantage of shipping in some shape or form, whenever he gets the opportunity, we will not have artificial manure.  If we are to grow our foodstuffs, we must have manures.  We cannot grow them otherwise.  The land is supposed to feed the people of the country, and the Minister must see that the land itself also will be fed.  There is no use in people here&mdash;particularly in a crisis like this&mdash;endeavouring to follow some particular policy for the sake of following a policy.  Let us only follow a policy because it is good.  There has been in the past too much of the idea that a certain policy is right and has been the policy which somebody has given to this country and one which we are to follow to a conclusion, whatever conclusion that may be.  I do not think that is right.  A policy should be followed because it is good and because it gives good results, and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>In that respect, very little foresight has been shown.  We must endeavour to increase the productivity of the soil and, as far as we possibly can, lower production costs.  When the war is over the same conditions will prevail. We will have the same type of competition to deal with.  We will be thrown on the world&rsquo;s markets again and the best competitor will win.  It would appear, from listening to Deputy Childers last night, that the one thing we had to do was to produce a better article so that we would be prepared for the competition.  I entirely agree that that must be done, but there must be judgment and foresight.  It is of no use to produce an article unless it will sell.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> People must not run away with the idea that you can do that in any market all over the world.  We cannot &mdash;and we know it, to our cost.  I know that it is pretty hard at the present time&mdash;that it is difficult and, in fact, impossible&mdash;to forecast the future and what it will bring us with regard to markets.  The one outstanding thing is that this is an agricultural country and will remain so, that upon the productivity of the soil and upon its fertility will depend either the wealth or the poverty of the people here.  The Minister should remember that, and should not close his eyes to the fact that our soil has been starved.</P>
    <P>There was a period here in which farmers had no money and during which the land was not paying.  During that time the fertility of the soil decreased very considerably.  Taking slag as an instance, there was a fall of some 20,000 tons in imports compared with 1932, and 20,000 tons per annum would manure 60,000 acres of land. That meant a big loss to the country. When we look at these things it is no wonder that we despair at times whether the Minister is alive to the seriousness of the situation.  I am afraid he has not been thinking of it. His Department is a very important one, and it will remain so, and I want to impress upon him that no matter what Department presses for consideration of its work, the Minister should do what his predecessor did, and that is, to insist on any legislation that came up being submitted for examination regarding its effects upon our main industry.  That practice ought to continue.  The Minister should take a note of that, and whether it was an industrial question or a financial question, its reactions should not be allowed to affect agriculture adversely. If it did it should be thrown aside. This country has to live by agriculture, and the Minister should see that it is not affected adversely by any legislative or financial arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody realises that these are exceptionally trying times for nations as well as individuals. Although we are lucky&mdash;and I trust that our luck will continue&mdash;to have <Col N="559" /> escaped the ravages of war, we cannot avoid the repercussions of the conflict that is raging over Europe.  In a time of emergency we have to fall back upon our own resources, and circumstances have compelled us to fall back on the land for the necessities of life as far as food and drink are concerned. Perhaps I overstated the case by mentioning the necessities of life, but in present events we can only expect food from outside sources on a very small scale.  I avail of this opportunity to express my gratitude, and the gratitude of the nation, at the foresight and wisdom of the Government in having instituted a tillage policy when they took office.  The people realise that it is that policy alone has saved them from hunger at the present time.  Quite recently, in a debate on this Estimate, Deputy Dillon described the Government&rsquo;s wheat scheme as &ldquo;codology&rdquo; and as a failure.  I wonder if Deputy Dillon seriously believes that the people of the country are living in a fool&rsquo;s paradise.  Were it not for the wheat-growing policy of this Government our supplies would now be exhausted, and we would not have wheat from which to produce flour to bake bread.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also stated that he had put certain proposals before the Taoiseach, suggesting that we should grow barley instead of wheat, and exchange the barley with the British for wheat.  Could a more ridiculous proposal be put up by a Deputy?  As the British people are fighting for their very existence, is it likely that they would exchange human food, which is undoubtedly scarce with them, in order to get animal food?  If Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s advice were carried out, or if the policy he preached here for the last seven years were put into operation, the only substitute we would have for wheat would be &ldquo;codology&rdquo;.  I am sure that even Deputy Dillon and his supporters would not get much comfort from &ldquo;codology&rdquo; for breakfast, &ldquo;codology&rdquo; for dinner, and &ldquo;codology&rdquo; for supper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people had not experience of wheat growing within the past eight or nine years, or the experience of producing other cereal crops, which are <Col N="560" /> essential to our economic life as long as this war continues, they could not have embarked upon such a widespread campaign of tillage this spring.  In proof of that statement I need only point out that in the areas that ignored the Government&rsquo;s appeal in the last eight or nine years, you will find them trying to dodge the Emergency Powers Tillage Order.  I mentioned some districts on a previous occasion, particularly in County Limerick, which contains some of the most fertile land in the world.  Undoubtedly the traveller in the train notices that the position has improved, but still there is nothing like the area under tillage that is tilled in County Cork.  The reason is that the people there do not really know how to till, as they followed the advice of Deputy Dillon and some of his friends.  I want to give credit where it is due, and it pleases me to say that all the members of Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s Party are not in agreement with him as far as his &ldquo;codology&rdquo; scheme is concerned. They approve of wheat growing.</P>
    <P>It is with pleasure that I noted the wholehearted response of the farmers, and particularly the farmers in my constituency, to the appeal for increased food production.  Deputy Brennan referred to failures of crops of wheat in certain areas, and said the cause was due to the land not being suitable.  As a grower of wheat, and as one who has experience of some failures, I know that in a few places that was not because the land was not suitable, but because the proper seed was not sown as the people had not experience of the crop.  In other cases it was because farmers were over zealous and put wheat on land invested with wire worm and the leather-jacket grub. In any cases where I have known failure the position was made good by sowing some other cereal crop, which would have a better chance of succeeding late rather than early in the spring.</P>
    <P>On one point I was in agreement with Deputy Dillon.  He referred to a certain creamery group in North Cork, under the control of the Dairy Disposals Board.  About two years ago the farmers supplying milk to the creameries there formed a co-operative <Col N="561" /> society, and since then negotiations have been proceeding with the Dairy Disposals Board for the taking over of these creameries.  I have no hesitation in saying that the attitude of the Dairy Disposals Board in regard to these creameries is not the attitude of people who are inclined to sell an article at a fair price.  The Minister has undoubtedly shown his sympathy to the farmers of that district in this regard, but another Government Department seems anxious to hamstring all efforts to get these creameries into the hands of the farmers.  One would think from Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s statement that the farmers had the creameries before, but that is not correct.  It must be recognised that it would be a good, a healthy and an economic thing to carry out this arrangement.  I realise I am spurring a willing horse when I am asking the Minister to help to bring the negotiations to a conclusion, and so enable the creameries to be handed over to the farming community there.  It would mean a great relief to the State and, of course, the agricultural community would benefit.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on this Estimate on the 1st of May, Deputy Dillon, prompted, I presume, by the very highest motives and&mdash;I give him the credit for it&mdash;acting in the interests of the public, made an allegation against the members of a certain firm, namely, the Roscrea Meat Producers Company.  He alleged that these people availed of the unfortunate position created by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and mulcted the unfortunate farmers from whom they purchased cattle.  I think he stated that they purchased Grade A cattle for the dressed meat export trade at the price of Grade C cattle.  Any Deputy who draws public attention to sharp practice or to anything which would amount to taking a mean advantage of a certain section of the community, deserves credit, and I expect Deputy Dillon was prompted by the highest motives in saying what he said.  At the same time, I am afraid he made a great mistake.</P>

They also stated that they had to purchase the cattle in competition with other firms.  I think they purchased, during that period, about 1,086 cattle and the average price paid was £22 3s. 6d.  They told me that they did not buy many by live-weight, but any they bought by live-weight were purchased at a price running from 50/- to 51/- a cwt.</P>

      <P>They buy Grade C cattle for canning in the month of November, and perhaps later.  As one who has sold them cattle time and again, I must acknowledge that their price for cattle for canning purposes was reasonable.  In view of their denial, I expect Deputy Dillon will go into the matter carefully.  I can quite understand a man being anxious to serve the public by exposing certain things, but when he realises he has made a mistake I am sure he will do all he can to remedy the situation.  The statements made here have caused a lot of mischief, apart from being unfair to the men concerned.  These men have stated that they can give the names and addresses of the people from whom they purchased cattle in that period.  I hope Deputy Dillon will submit to them the points which form the basis of his complaint.  They are anxious to hear what Deputy Dillon has to complain of, and I do not expect that Deputy Dillon will shelter behind his privilege as a member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with cow-testing associations.  Cow-testing is <Col N="563" /> very commendable and very useful, but there is too much pen-work attached to it, and for that reason it is not likely to become really popular among the farmers.  It is confined to a limited number of farmers in every district, and only small numbers of cows are tested.  I suggest to the Minister that, instead of carrying out cow-testing under the existing methods, the number of supervisors should be increased, and that the weighings should be made up by the supervisor once a month.  If that is done, you will have a more correct return of the cows&rsquo; milk yield than you will have if the arrangements are left in the hands of some of the farmers.  I regret to say that in some cases farmers who may have stock for sale later on are not over scrupulous in adding a pound or two to the milk yield.  I know it.  I was connected with a cow-testing association one time, and I resigned from the job because of that kind of thing, and because I would not certify what was false.  I put it to the Minister that something should be done to see that, if the supervisor goes around, things will be correct.</P>
    <P>I think that a good many farmers acted on the advice of the Minister and his Department to try to provide themselves with ample supplies of vegetable and farm seeds for next season.  I am not an expert, and I do not know whether it is already getting too late for planting mangolds.  I know that, at any rate, it is too late for swedes, but there is the real danger of a scarcity of all seeds next year, and I should prefer to see as many people as possible planting their own seeds.  I think that an appeal from the Minister and his Department to the farmers, asking them to do more in that direction, would get good results.</P>
    <P>Before I finish, there is another matter to which I want to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  It is a matter which concerns another Department as well as his own.  As we are all aware, there is a big national drive on to procure as much turf as possible for fuel for the coming winter.  That, of course, is of vital importance, as I suppose we shall have to depend very largely on our own <Col N="564" /> fuel.  I am wholeheartedly in favour of that scheme, but I do not want fuel or turf to be produced to the detriment of the harvesting of the cereal crops which are now planted.  I think there should be some cohesion or some arrangement between the Minister&rsquo;s Department and those responsible for the production of turf to prevent men, who are ordinarily and regularly employed by farmers, from leaving their employment to go on the bogs to cut turf.  That is happening in some districts, and happening in districts where farmers have put far more of their land under tillage than was required of them under the Tillage Order. It would be rather disastrous if the drive for one type of necessity of life should cause a loss in another necessity. I would ask the Minister to go into the matter carefully.  Cases have come to my notice within the past week.  I know of men of that type who are trying to leave the land and go on the bog, although to my mind the conditions of employment on the land, taking the whole year around, are probably better than those of employment on the bog.  Still, however, the danger exists, and I think it is the duty of the responsible Departments concerned to make some arrangement which will enable us to have the maximum production of human food and animal food, as well as the maximum production of fuel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Estimate I should like to refer to the present position in the country with regard to foot-and-mouth disease. There is a very serious danger of the disease spreading to the southern counties.  In the Dublin area, at the commencement of the outbreak of this disease, the Minister thought it wise to allow horse racing, dog racing, and so forth to go on as usual&mdash;to allow &ldquo;pleasure as usual&rdquo;, in other words. In the course of time, when it got serious, after a week or a fortnight, the Minister then found out that, possibly, it would be wise to put a stop to this &ldquo;pleasure as usual&rdquo;, and he did so, with the result that the disease has gone out of this area.  Now, I hope he will do the same in the areas where it is at the moment and where it is very much felt, and that any sort of congregation <Col N="565" /> of people, whether for horse-racing or anything else, will be prevented until the Minister has the discase completely cleared out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate itself, I do not want to go back on the mistakes of the past year or two years.  Rather would I desire that my remarks would be more concentrated on something constructive for the future.  Before I do that, however, I have a few &ldquo;grouses,&rdquo; and one is with regard to cow testing. The Minister, in his opening statement, said that cow testing, after all the allurements that were offered to the farmers, had resulted in only 4 per cent. &mdash;I think he said&mdash;of the cow population being under test.  There is less than 4 per cent. at the moment, because I had an experience within the past couple of months of a case where there had been an excellent cow-testing association in my area.  In the opinion of the members of that cow-testing society, they had a very good supervisor. I was interested in this case, and I knew the circumstances pretty well.  The supervisor had been ill for some time; he had been suffering from frequent illnesses continuing over, perhaps, a year.  He neglected to report the matter, with the result that the weighings were not regularly carried out, but still there was no grumbling from the members of the association, and when the inspector from the Department went down, I think everything was satisfactorily explained.  However, before that happened the Department made up their minds that they should get a new supervisor and that this man should go. He had been 20 years working and was as interested in cow testing as any member of the Department of Agriculture. He was interested in keeping that society going and was naturally interested, seeing that it was his job and that he had very little else to live on, and if he did make a few mistakes, still, he was a very capable man.  I approached the Secretary of the Department and I wrote specially to the Minister, and the chairman and every member of that association signed a memorial, which was sent up to the Minister, asking for the reinstatement <Col N="566" /> of that man.  He has not been reinstated, and that association has gone flop.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to compare that case with that of another appointment, which was made at that time under another section of the Department. This was the appointment of a man who had been dismissed from the Department a good many years ago. I was also interested in the case of that man when he was dismissed, and I thought it was terribly drastic of the Department to dismiss him.  I held that some other action could have been taken besides dismissing him, and I made representations to the powers-that-be at that time but they could not see their way to do anything to prevent him from being dismissed.  Time and again, representations were made to the Department to have this man brought back.  I hold that he should never have been dismissed.  Now we have the case of the cow-testing supervisor being dismissed from office, and this other man taken back 18 years after his dismissal, and given a job.  If the Department was wrong in dismissing the man in the first case then I think that man should get back his original job, but if they were right in dismissing him, then he should not have been taken back at all.  They must have been wrong, I hold, or he would not have been taken back.  In like manner, I hold that they are wrong in dismissing this cow-testing supervisor.  As I have pointed out, there was an appeal from the chairman and members of the association to get him reinstated and I hope the appeal will succeed.  He is a good man, and this cow-testing association itself is as good a one as is to be found in County Cork, and if he is reinstated it will carry on in the old tradition which it has had for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Another little &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; I have is with regard to the way in which manures were distributed this year and the prices at which they were sold.  I think the Minister should have had some control over the prices at which the manufacturers sent out the manures for distribution.  There is no <Col N="567" /> good in my talking of it now, but I hope it will not occur in the future. There is another matter to which I want to refer.  The Minister and his officials have for years back been preaching that you cannot produce beet successfully without the addition of potash to the artificial mixture, that you cannot grow a good table potato without the addition of potash and that you cannot grow wheat successfully without potash.  Those are three items of food for our people, but what did we find?  We had no potash for potatoes and no potash for beet, but, at the time of the flax growing, there was a notice in the papers that there was so much muriate of potash in stock &mdash;it would require about six to eight stone to the acre&mdash;which the Department had reserved for the area to be sown in flax this year.  Flax is not used in this country at all.  Every ounce of flax grown or scutched here is sent away for purchase by the foreigner.  Apart from the money value of it, it is of no advantage to us. Furthermore, very little of the land of our flax-growing counties is flax sick because for a number of years flax was not grown.  In fact, the people there had practically gone out of flax production and it is only where flax is intensively grown, that is, where it is produced on the same land once in five or six years and that continues for a generation or two, that the land becomes flax sick and needs potash.  Whether that is so or not, the first thing the Minister should have done was to see that the potash in the country was given to people producing food.  I think it was very short-sighted to reserve the potash for flax growers, whose product goes to the foreigner.</P>
    <P>Now I want to deal with this planning ahead about which we hear so much, and to see if there is anything constructive we can do to tide us over the difficult period before us. I am not as optimistic as some people who think that we are going to have artificial manures while this trouble lasts.  I cannot see any coming at all. I have stressed this matter so often that I am tired of it, but I should like <Col N="568" /> the Minister, in co-operation with any other Departments who are interested, to take cognisance of the fact that along our seaboard there is seaweed for the manufacture of kelp, and I hope that now, at the eleventh hour, they will rise to the occasion and ensure that whatever quantity of kelp can be manufactured in this country will be manufactured.  The Department should also carry out experiments with regard to the dried weed.  Along the seaboard, we are not so badly off, but it is certainly wanted inland, and there is no use in people saying, as Deputy Corry said last night, that there is no fear of our being unable to continue to grow wheat for the next 20 years.  There is no such thing as that.  You are not going to produce wheat or other foodstuffs, unless you have the manures to manure the land. The Department should experiment on the dried weed and see what manurial value it has after drying and, if it is worth anything at the end of six months, it could be packed in bales and sent inland.  I believe that it would have a manurial value, and it is worth a trial, because we should take advantage of this natural stuff that we have available to us.  It would perhaps give us some of the self-sufficiency which is so much talked of, and it is one of the lessons we might learn that we should depend more on what we have than on phosphates from Africa and such imports.</P>
    <P>A further point in connection with the matter of manures is the value of liquid manure.  Discussing this Estimate last year, I suggested that one of the things money should be spent on was the erection of liquid manure tanks in every farmyard.  Anybody who has any knowledge of agriculture knows that liquid manure is as valuable as the solid manure, and, if it were available in a dry season like this and if a man could cart the liquid manure and put it over his beet or his corn, we would not have so many complaints of wire-worms and of corn dying. It is a very valuable asset, and the Minister should make every effort to ensure that not an ounce of it goes to waste.  A good deal of it can be absorbed by a bedding of sand or bog <Col N="569" /> stuff.  Bog stuff is not as good as sand, but a good deal of it could be absorbed by it.  Straw or other bedding, however, does not absorb the liquid manure, and it goes to waste.</P>
    <P>In regard to this matter of liquid manure and the possible necessity of having it in the future, I would suggest the adoption of the continental system. The sewage from our cities and towns at present is washed down to pollute the rivers, in some places, and the harbours in others.  An amount of valuable stuff could be got from it by the erection of big reservoirs, and, personally, I should prefer to see them being built than the silos which are at present going up.  It is a pity to see the waste involved in the polluting of the rivers by this valuable substance. It is one aspect of this planning-ahead campaign which may save us in the future.  The cost involved in erecting the tanks and saving a good deal of the sewage would not be very much, but it might save us millions later on. It is again a case of utilising the stuff available to us, but then many of us prefer the things from far away&mdash;is mór-thaibhseach iad adharcanna na mbó thar lear&mdash;instead of concentrating on such a matter as this and seeing what could be done in saving the liquid manure.</P>
    <P>The Minister made what, I think, was a terrible mistake last year in regard to the marketing of onions.  The growing of onions has taken on in this country.  They are being pretty successfully grown, and they are a great asset in the poorer districts amongst the smaller people, farmers and cottiers, who cannot take advantage of the guaranteed prices for wheat, beet, or any of the other products.</P>
    <P>The way the marketing of onions was handled last year was a scandal.  I remember putting a question to the Minister asking if he would remove the prohibition on the export of onions at a time when £60 or £65 per ton could be obtained for them in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Minister would not remove the prohibition at that time when onions were selling in this country from £12 to £14 per ton. The Minister did not remove the prohibition <Col N="570" /> until he realised that the smugglers were at work.  But before that the smugglers had been buying onions in Kerry and Cork and selling them for £60 per ton across the Border.  It was only then that the Minister took off the embargo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was only when we had lost on the transaction.  Then the price was fixed at £25.  I hope a similar mistake will not be made in connection with the marketing of onions this year.  While I am speaking of onions, I should like if the Minister would tell us if there are any protective measures which can be taken against the mildew which attacks onions.  It is a pity to see fine crops of onions, which have been treated well and which have grown up to a certain point, destroyed because there is no remedy to prevent them from being attacked by mildew.  I have heard of a dressing of calomel powder and other things, but I do not know of any effective dressing.  It would be a great help if the Minister knows of any proper dressing to prevent this disease if he would make it known to the onion growers.</P>
      <P>Another matter that affects my area and, indeed, all the south of Ireland, is the closing of the port of Cork for the shipment of cattle.  I understand that the Cork cattle traders have written to the Minister asking him to have the port of Cork opened for the shipment of cattle for immediate slaughter.  I do not know what the difficulties may be, but I know that the farmers in the south are very hard hit by the closing of the port.  I appeal to the Minister to respond to the appeal of the Cork cattle traders to open the port, if it is at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on the cattle question, I should like to point out to the Minister that the hard-working farmers of County Cork, especially West Cork, who have practically all the land they have available under tillage at present, <Col N="571" /> are depending on their cheques for milk to keep them going during the summer.  In County Cork we have certainly good creameries and good cattle and every farm is stocked to capacity with milch cows.  It is a great blow to these farmers that Great Britain will not now take their yearling cattle. The farmers of West Cork and other parts of the county, as well as County Waterford, have to dispose of their yearlings in April, May and June. Farmers who prepared cattle for the market at this time find that they are now left on their hands.  With the increased tillage there is no grazing available for these cattle, with the result that they will be without their cheque for the store cattle as well as for milk this year.  I would ask the Minister to get in touch with the British Minister to see if there is any possibility of getting a market for these yearlings.  If not, the farmers of West Cork will be in a very bad position this year.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the growing of wheat and other crops, but I want to say in connection with wheat, potatoes, oats, or any other crop, that if we have not manure we cannot produce these crops.  I think that the demand of the Government that the people should plough land and produce crops irrespective of whether the land was fit for such production was nonsense, to say the least of it.  I would rather have one acre of potatoes which was properly treated and cared for, than three acres which were not properly cared for and manured.  The same thing holds good with regard to oats or wheat.  One acre properly treated would be much better than three acres which were not properly treated.  Asking farmers to plough 20 or 30 or 50 acres of land which will not produce a good crop is madness. The cost of labour and of seeding that land will be lost.  It would be better to concentrate on what can be done and do it well by manuring the land and treating it properly.  Land that is not fit for crop production can be used for something else.  I do not think it is wise to be asking people to increase production to that extent if you <Col N="572" /> will not provide the manure in some shape or form to help them to produce the crops.  I hope the suggestions I have put forward with regard to seaweed, sand, kelp, liquid manure, etc., will be considered by the Minister, and that the Minister will do all he can to help us to tide over this difficult time by taking advantage of these things which we have available, and thereby providing us with the necessaries of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that strikes me in connection with this Estimate is the limited amount of money provided for the service of agriculture. When speaking on the Budget I referred to the fact that when we are proposing to spend a sum of £41,000,000, which will probably be increased within the next six or seven months to £50,000,000 by Supplementary Estimates, one would have expected that the amount of money devoted to the chief industry of agriculture would have been very much increased. However, I suppose that is a matter over which the Minister for Agriculture has not any great control, and that he has to make the best of the amount given to him.</P>
      <P>One of the matters I should like to refer to is dairying.  Dairy farmers will have a particularly bad time this year; everything appears to be against them.  The dry season, as Deputy O'Donovan pointed out, has retarded the growth of pastures and, at the moment, the supply of milk on most of the farms is very limited.  Unless we have some rain in the near future the pastures are likely to be very poor this year and, as a result, the cheques for milk will be very small.  Deputy O'Donovan also referred to another difficulty under which dairy farmers are labouring, and that is the difficulty of getting rid of their young stock.  It is almost impossible at the moment to sell any beast under one and a half years.  I have seen beasts sold recently at practically &ldquo;giving-away&rdquo; prices.  As I have often said in this House, it was mainly on the cattle end of his business that the dairy farmer made his profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk production has ceased for <Col N="573" /> a good many seasons to be an economic proposition.  Were it not for what the farmer makes on the turnover of his cattle, dairying would, I am afraid, have collapsed many seasons ago.  On the face of it, this is going to be a very bad year for dairy farmers.  No doubt the Minister has had that brought to his notice by the various dairy societies.  As he knows, there has been a consistent demand for an increased price for butter and milk.  I should like to support that demand as strongly as I can in the Dáil.  There are, as I have said, dangerous times ahead for the dairy farmer, and anything that the Government or this House can do to help him ought to be done.  We are expending huge sums of money this year, some of it on essential things, such as defence, but even so it should not be impossible to make available enough money to safeguard our main industry.</P>
    <P>The spread of foot-and-mouth disease within the last couple of months has added to the difficulties of farmers in the dairying districts.  The position in East Limerick and Tipperary, at the moment, is almost terrifying.  In the last few weeks the disease has spread rapidly from Kilkenny to Tipperary. Within a week or ten days it spread from Tullaroan to Ballingarry, on to Mullinahone and close to Thurles.  If it continues to spread at the same rate in the next few weeks, the position will be truly alarming.  The conditions in the dairying counties are going to be indescribable.  While I do not want to criticise the Department I am at the same time not at all satisfied that everything was done that could have been done to stop the spread of the disease.  I am sure the Minister&rsquo;s advisers and the officials in his Department did everything they could to prevent its spread.  At the same time, I am not satisfied that from the start the situation was properly handled.  In the speech I made at the outbreak of the disease I suggested that with the material at our disposal&mdash;the Army and other forms of Defence Force which fortunately are not required for the purpose for which they have been primarily established&mdash;it should have <Col N="574" /> been possible to arrange that the farm or district infected with the disease was isolated and that people would not be allowed to leave or enter without being properly disinfected.  I am not satisfied that was done.  I have heard that people got into these infected farms and out again, that they travelled distances and carried the disease with them.  The infected areas should, if necessary, have been surrounded by the military, even though that might be a very drastic course to take.  A cordon should be drawn around them, and people should not be allowed to leave or enter an infected farm.  The human factor entered a lot into the spread of the disease.  I believe the Department are satisfied that, from the first, it was the human carrier that was the most dangerous.</P>
    <P>There is another dangerous practice and I am not at all satisfied that it occurred to the officials of the Department to take steps to guard against it. Farmers were cautioned over the wireless, and in other ways, and very properly so, with regard to the importance of reporting suspected outbreaks. I think the Department might have gone a step further, and told them the things they should do to stop the infection spreading.</P>
    <P>I wonder did it occur to anybody that the man reporting the disease might himself be a carrier of it, and be the means of spreading it.  The first thing that the ordinary farmer, who has not been properly instructed, will do if he suspects the disease is manifesting itself amongst his stock is to rush off to the Guards and make a report.  In doing that he may carry the disease to the Guards, and they, in turn, may spread it amongst other people.  In my opinion instructions should have been given over the wireless by the Department&rsquo;s officials to such people to disinfect themselves before leaving the infected farm.  In my parish a week ago a scare was raised.  It was reported that an outbreak had occurred at a certain place.  Fortunately it did not turn out to be true.  What I have said happened there.  If there had been an outbreak on that land it is 100 to 1 that <Col N="575" /> the disease would have been spread all over the district and through the adjoining districts.  Therefore, I say that people going to report the disease should first of all disinfect themselves so as not to become carriers of it.  As a matter of fact that point did not occur to me until about a week ago, and it may not have occurred to the officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of this disease is the greatest disaster that could have come upon this country, and it is the duty of everyone to help to try to stop the spread of it.  If it gets a proper hold on the dairying districts, I do not know how it is going to be stopped.  The most drastic measures that the Department could conceive for the purpose of stopping the spread of it would, I think, be readily accepted by the people of the dairying districts.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endeavour to excite the Minister&rsquo;s interest in some mineral deposits in connection with this Bill.  It is true, of course, that the Bill excludes coal for the purpose of definition of minerals, but there is an area convenient to Carlow town and going into Laoighis for a considerable distance, the area of Killeshin and Rossmore, where a small mine is being worked at present in a rather primitive fashion.  If local folk of substantial maturity can be believed, the area contains very extensive deposits of other <Col N="577" /> minerals as well.  Because the matter is very urgent in our present circumstances, I should like if the Minister could see his way to direct some examination of that particular area, to ascertain whether, in fact, the minerals reputed to be there are there, whether they are there on a scale that would make them profitably exploitable, and whether it would be possible to direct the attention of the Exploration and Development Company to those deposits with a view to having them worked with the utmost expedition.  As I have said, local people who have very many years of experience of the deposits in the area, and claim to have some geological knowledge of the extent of the deposits, are satisfied that very valuable minerals are lying there untapped.  If that is true, I am sure the Minister would feel that they should be exploited with the utmost expedition.  At all events, it seems to me, from all the information which I have been able to gather, that the subject is one which is well worth probing, and the probing of the deposits in the area might in fact lead us to quite a variety of minerals of a kind that we badly need in existing circumstances. I am just putting it to the Minister, on the Money Resolution, that perhaps he would have that matter investigated as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say why it is that, in paragraph (b) of this amendment, the terminology is &ldquo;in such newspapers as the Minister thinks fit&rdquo;?  My recollection is that the general description of these newspapers is &ldquo;newspapers circulating in the district&rdquo;.  I cannot remember the precise circumstances of the case, but it has been brought to my notice that recently in regard to the insertion of advertisements by some State department discrimination was made against a newspaper having a fairly large circulation in favour of a newspaper with a much smaller circulation.  Whether there was anything political in it or not I do not know, but it would appear that this particular description scarcely meets the case.  I do not know whether it is intended to confine advertisements to the area or the county, or a county in close proximity to the district in which it is proposed to acquire the mining business, or whether it is confined to the Dublin newspapers.  As a rule in these cases the description is &ldquo;newspapers circulating in the district&rdquo; and, if that were so, it would appear to be a natural corollary that it would be the newspapers <Col N="584" /> with the largest circulation circulating in the district.</P>

I do not think there is any reason to fear that there will be discrimination as between one newspaper and another in regard to the matter but, obviously, the advertisements cannot be put in every newspaper.  It is intended to allow the Minister to insert them in the newspapers which he thinks will come under the notice of the proprietors of the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Line 6, page 9 of the Bill, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The order shall not be expressed and shall not operate to impose on or transfer to the Minister or the company any liability for any of the debts and other liabilities of the proprietor of the existing mining business in relation to or on account of the said business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently it is intended to acquire some of these businesses.  If it were not for that paragraph, it might be expected that in acquiring such business, regard would be had to the liabilities affecting it.  In another place it mentions that the liabilities, if any, for debts of the proprietor arising out of the business shall be enforceable against the compensation.  It can be inferred from the way in which this particular section is drawn, if my interpretation of it is correct, and from the way in which Section 24 is subsequently drawn, that an effort may be made to escape liabilities that are there already.  If the proprietor is insolvent, that is one thing.  It is not expected that the State should make good his insolvency.  The second point which would arise is: would the acquisition by the mining company tend to make him insolvent?  Thirdly, if the compensation is sufficient to discharge the liabilities that are there already, what is the necessity for putting in this particular section?  Surely anybody who has a claim against the person whose property is going to be acquired would have that claim without these sub-sections going in?  I ask the Minister to explain what is meant by them.</P>

      <P>The position here is that we propose to acquire only the property and assets of a neglected mining venture and that we should acquire them at their full value, fixed either by agreement or as assessed by the mining board.  Any liabilities which have attached to the business <Col N="588" /> will remain liabilities of the proprietor because they have been contracted by him and will not be transferred to the company.  They are the personal debts of the proprietor.  As against any assets which he held, he will get compensation and the onus of discharging his debts will rest upon him, presumably to satisfy them, out of his compensation or out of any other resources which he may have.</P>

      <P>The terminology of the sub-clause to which I have referred is rather significant:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;....liability for any of the debts and other liabilities of the proprietor of the existing mining business in relation to or on account of the said business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not his other liabilities that are in question.  It is merely the liabilities which have arisen out of his particular sphere of activity in connection with the business.  Why is it proposed to escape these?  There is a disposition, as far as I can judge, in recent years on the part of the State to be dishonest, to claim the right to be dishonest, and to legalise dishonesty in so far as the State itself is concerned&mdash;to grab all and to pay nobody.  I should like to see what justification there is for it in this particular case.  A man may have incurred certain liabilities which have arisen out of the business &mdash;not private debts at all&mdash;and it is said that these debts will not be the concern of the State.  Why not take them over and give him whatever balance there is, or are we going to do this in the way in which the State generally attempts to get property&mdash;to confiscate the property in the first instance, and to confiscate the claims of the people who have given credit to the former proprietor in the second instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two classes of debts which we may consider.  There are first of all debts which are secured on the assets or otherwise.  In so far as they are concerned, they are covered by paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 24, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  all securities for any of such debts and other liabilities which, immediately before the date of <Col N="589" /> acquisition, attached to the said business shall on the said date cease to affect the said business and shall, in lieu thereof, attach to and be enforceable against the compensation awarded under this section in respect of the said business.</P>
    <P>Any debts which are not secured by the business would remain in exactly the same position as any other debt of the proprietor, even though they have arisen out of the business.  It is not the practice when you are acquiring a business, I think, to assume responsibility for the prior debts of the proprietor. The usual practice is to buy the business as it stands, if possible free of all liabilities, and to allow the man who contracted the debts to settle with his own creditors by paying them, if he can, 20/- in the £, and if not, by making a composition with them.  That is the normal business procedure.  That is is what we propose here.  As the State is acquiring the business, it is necessary that our responsibility in this matter should be very strictly defined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often, in acquiring a business, you acquire the assets and liabilities in full, particularly where the business is going to be continued. In this case I do not see any reason for a departure from that practice except a Civil Service reason. These Acts are becoming almost impregnated with Civil Service psychology which has not a soul, and has not a body to be kicked either.  We have had the same experience in connection with corporations.  The letter of the law was adhered to, but it cost them a small fortune, to meet debts and liabilities&mdash;all within the law.  In the normal course one would say that the proper procedure would be to take over the assets and liabilities, and finish the job.  Let the new institution take over and settle up these debts.  Remember you are putting a man out of business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> After sub-section (3), page 9, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(4)  Every application under this section for the assessment of compensation and also every application under this section for compensation in respect of which the applicant and the company fail to reach agreement shall be referred by the company to the mining board, and thereupon the mining board shall assess the compensation payable in accordance with the next succeeding section.</P>
    <P>The mining board will be constituted within the next couple of days and the relevant section of the Minerals Development Act provides that it shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members and that they shall be qualified as follows&mdash;the chairman shall be a practising barrister or solicitor of, at least, ten years&rsquo; standing.  One of the ordinary members shall be one of the panel of official arbitrators appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment and Compensation) Act, 1919, and the other ordinary member shall be an officer of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It seems to me that a board better suited for assessing compensation in matters of this sort could not be secured.  The board will operate in a more general way under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, and will have a great deal of experience in dealing with matters of the kind covered by this section.  I think that I could not get a better board for the purpose or one more likely to deal fairly between the applicant for compensation, on the one hand, and the company, on the other hand.</P>

      <P>The mining board will consist of nominees of the State, no matter how impersonal the Minister may be in his selections.  It will be a State institution.  The class of work they will be called upon to do will be slightly different from that of settling compensation.  If they are to have the responsibility of assessing compensation, that will be one of the things they will consider when they are passing judgment as to whether a place should be acquired or not.  Why should there not be an agreed arbitrator?  That is the usual course and it would appear to be the more satisfactory method.  If the mining board is, in addition to its ordinary administrative work, to undertake the task of arbitrator, it will be doing something more than the Minister had in mind when he originally conceived the idea of a mining board.  It seems to be a reasonable proposition that the arbitrator should be, if possible, agreed upon by the parties and that course would be likely to give greater satisfaction than the procedure proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something basically wrong in having a mining board, paid by the Government which holds the shares of this company, assessing compensation in respect of acquired mineral rights.  The State has, naturally, an interest in securing that the company shall get such assets as it desires to acquire at the minimum price.  In the event of a dispute between the person with the assets to sell and the company desirous of buying the assets, you refer it to the mining board.  You find, then, that three members of that board are appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible for putting up the capital of this company, and that one of the members of the board is, in fact, an official of his own Department. Without at all reflecting on the normal honour and honesty of the <Col N="594" /> official, I say, candidly, that he is bound to be influenced by the Minister&rsquo;s desires so long as he is acting as a member of that board.  You have an independent person from the panel of arbitrators but you have the chairman conscious of his position every time he gets a cheque from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not think that that is the type of board to which we should refer this kind of question.  Let the aggrieved party, if he wishes, select the chairman but do not compel him to take the board if he does not want to take the board. He has an asset to sell and he should not be obliged to take less than its value nor should he be compelled to take his grievance to a board all the members of which are in the pay of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I could not possibly accept the amendment which has been proposed.  It might completely defeat the purpose of the Bill which is that, in the event of the parties failing to agree as to the amount of compensation to be paid, the matter should be settled expeditiously by competent authority. This amendment merely provides that it is to be settled by an arbitrator agreed upon by all the parties. Supposing we could not get agreement, are we not to be able to acquire the business at all, even though it is to be acquired by compulsion as a mining business exploiting commodities essential to the life of the community and even though the Minister be satisfied that the requirements of the community cannot be met unless the Minerals Exploration and Development Company take over that mining venture?  Are we to allow the proposal embodied in this amendment to defeat the whole purpose of the Bill, as it could be defeated by the simple expedient of a person who is not prepared to come to a reasonable agreement with the Minister refusing to agree to the choice of an arbitrator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some rather unjustifiable reflections have been passed on the mining board. Let me remind the House what the mining board is.  It is a board originally set up under the Mines and Minerals (Development) Act, 1931.  It has been in existence for the past ten <Col N="595" /> years and has, I believe, given satisfaction. It is not an administrative board at all.  It is purely a judicial tribunal, the principal function of which is, and always has been, to determine the compensation that shall be paid for minerals acquired by the Minister where such compensation cannot be settled by agreement with the dispossessed owner.</P>
    <P>This is a board of which the House approved, not merely last November, but when the original Act was before the House in 1931.  The board is constituted in exactly the same way and the primary purpose in setting it up is identical with the purposes for which we propose to avail of it now&mdash;that is to say, first, to determine the compensation that shall be paid for minerals acquired by the Minister, where such compensation cannot be settled by agreement with the dispossessed owners.  The next purpose of the board was to hear and determine applications for unworked mineral licences.  The third purpose was to advise on applications for ancillary rights&mdash;that is, rights necessary to enable mineral deposits to be worked conveniently: the right, for instance, to dam or divert rivers.  The fourth purpose was to determine the amount of compensation to be paid to persons against whom awards were made. This board has been functioning in this fashion for the past ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It had cases before it &mdash; not very many.  Some of them were very difficult.  I do not think that any person has for a moment suggested that the members of this board have been in any way susceptible to Ministerial influence.  I think it is wrong to suggest that they are, or could be, so susceptible.  They are appointed very definitely as arbitrators, and I am perfectly certain that, as men of standing in their profession, they will act as arbitrators and will not, at the instance of any Minister&mdash;no matter who pays them, no matter whether they are remunerated <Col N="596" /> out of public monies or not&mdash;do anything which would be unjust.  One might as well say that the judges whose salaries are paid out of public funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  If, however, the Minister were to remove the chairman of this board for an improper reason, I know that it would not go without public notice.  I am perfectly certain that if an applicant felt that a member of this board had been removed by a Minister because that member had refused to deal unjustly with his application when before the board, the person interested in the application would very quickly ventilate that and we should hear a great deal about it in this House, where the Minister would not be able to stand over it.  Let us be fair and reasonable in regard to these matters.  There is no point in casting doubt and reflections&mdash;and they are reflections&mdash;upon the integrity, first of all, of the Minister, and next upon those whom he honours with his confidence when he puts them on a board of this sort.  I say that he honours them with his confidence, as it is an expression of his belief that they will act honestly between all the parties concerned, and that is all we are looking for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied, there is no reason why he would not agree to consider adding a clause that &ldquo;in default of agreement, either the Chief Justice would arbitrate or the mining board would do so.&rdquo;  When we consider what they will arbitrate on, it is very interesting to realise that we have excluded any <Col N="597" /> rights that the person would have in respect of State minerals, though the unfortunate man who had a mine and was working those minerals may have gone to very considerable expense in connection with them.  He is not to get a penny: he will not be considered. We then consider how compensation is to be fixed, and we find that account is to be taken of the assets but no account whatever of the liabilities.  That is a new form entirely.  So far as the Minister&rsquo;s case is concerned, one simple sentence, &ldquo;in default of agreement, the compensation would be arranged by the Chief Justice or the mining board would undertake it&rdquo;, would suffice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is the whole reason why we make judges independent of the Ministry.  We pay their salaries out of the Central Fund and we make sure they can be removed from office only by an overwhelming vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas, so as to make them independent of the Executive Government in the matter of the exercise of their functions.  In this case, the board is to be vested with judicial functions to assess the amount of compensation to be paid.  My complaint is that these people who will assess the compensation are on the Minister&rsquo;s pay roll and are, to that extent, subservient to the Minister.  He may say that they are of the highest probity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy tell <Col N="598" /> me who would pay the arbitrator suggested in the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  Here are three people, one of whom is an official of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, and the other two are appointed by the Minister.  My complaint is that, in principle, it seems wrong that a Minister who holds the shares in this company should compel a person who has assets to sell to submit his case to a mining board, the members of which are on the Minister&rsquo;s pay roll.  This amendment by Deputy McMenamin might, if literally interpreted, prevent the submission of any case to arbitration.  That does not alter the position.  Where a person has a grievance in a dispute, he should be able to put his case before some independent body.  A body appointed by the Minister, and where the Minister holds the shares, cannot in fact be an independent body.</P>
      <P>Under the Railway Acts, for instance, the Chief Justice has power to appoint an arbitrator, and, in fact, I think he has appointed two arbitrators to adjudicate on disputes.  Where is the difficulty in endeavouring to draw up this Bill so as to ensure that, in the event of a disagreement, either the Chief Justice or somebody else will be required to appoint an arbitrator; or, at all events, that the matter will be taken away from a board which is on the Minister&rsquo;s pay roll?  My objection is one of principle: I am not concerned with the personnel of the board or the personality of the Minister.  It is a question of shunting grievance into a side line where the Minister controls the operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are making this a matter of principle, we ought to stand by the principles which the Legislature has already laid down, that a board, constituted as the mining board is, is the fairest tribunal to which an appeal of this sort could be made.  The Deputy made a great deal of play about members of the board being on the pay roll of the Minister.  They are not on the pay roll of the Minister, except to this extent, that arbitrators normally have to get <Col N="599" /> fees for arbitration, particularly where there may be difficult arbitration. Sometimes the terms of reference provide that the payment of these fees, will be divided between one party and the other.  The only way in which these gentlemen come on the Minister&rsquo;s payroll, as the Deputy described it, is because the State takes upon itself the obligation of defraying arbitrator&rsquo;s fees.  Provided the person appointed is a person of standing, we have no other influence.  In fact one of the members of the board is on the panel of arbitrators under the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act, 1913, and as the Deputy knows, that panel is settled by the judges.  The other is a senior counsel of long-standing and the third happens to be an officer of my Department, who is there more in the capacity of an assessor, because he is familiar with all the considerations involved, but he will act notwithstanding all that, as arbitrator and as part of the board entirely unfettered by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to tell a man who has listened to a case what is fair treatment between the company on the one hand, and the applicant on the other hand.  He will be as free as any private individual in the State would be to act according to his conscience and his good judgment.  I cannot possibly see any substance in the point made against sending these applications to the mining board.  It could not be made, and was not made when the original Act of 1931 was going through this House, or when the subsequent amending Act of 1940 was going through.  The board has been in existence for ten years, and I do not see why we should cumber up the whole administrative processes of the State, particularly in the circumstances contemplated by this Bill, with unnecessary machinery.  The Chief Justice has enough to do to look after his particular responsibilities.  The Department is also greatly pressed. Why should we set out on a purely illusory search to secure agreement in regard to arbitration with a person with whom we have been able to come to agreement on price?  We would have to put in all sorts of provisos.  If <Col N="600" /> we accept the fundamental principles of the amendment why we should have to put in all sorts of administrative provisos?  As to when, say, we should have to have recourse to the Chief Justice or, in the event of his failure to appoint an arbitrator, to go to the mining board.  In the end we would have protracted proceedings in a matter which should be carried through expeditiously.</P>

      <P>The time allowed for lodging applications for compensation is limited, but at the will of the Minister it can be extended to six months. Under sub-section (2) the form of application for compensation may be prescribed by rule.  I consider two months a very short time to permit a person or a firm to prepare a claim of this character, involving probably a considerable amount of figures.  It may depend on the advice of experts being taken and that may have to be secured from abroad.  The wording of sub-section (3) is of such a nature that unless the application is lodged, presumably in the prescribed form, an application for compensation will not be considered.  The preparation of an ordinary claim very often takes a considerable time, and in a claim of this kind two months is very short.</P>

      <P>27.&mdash;(1) As soon as may be after the end of every year, the company shall furnish to the Minister a report giving, in respect of that year, particulars of all existing mining businesses acquired by the company, either by agreement or by means of mining business acquisition orders, and such particulars of minerals worked or prospected by the company as the Minister may consider it expedient in the public interest that the company should be required to furnish.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Further to my remarks on foot-and-mouth disease, I should like to suggest that, drastic as it may appear, and improper as it might be to suggest it, we ought to go so far as to prohibit all gatherings of people who are likely to come from any fairly extensive areas.  This would include racing, games of all sorts, dances and other things which attract numbers of people from different districts.  It will not be a popular proceeding, but desperate diseases require desperate remedies.  This particular disease that I am alluding to is, perhaps, the greatest scourge that could be inflicted on this country, and any measures we can take to protect the country from the spread of that disease ought to be taken.  Even if some of those measures appear unnecessary, if they offer any possible hope of the extermination of the disease, they should be taken. Racing was prohibited for some time and, while I am probably as interested in the continuance of that sport as any Deputy here, I believe we ought not to have departed from the prohibition of it as long as foot-and-mouth disease was prevalent.  I think the same applies to all Gaelic games and other games, as well as to dances where, as we all know, numerous people gather, having come from long distances.  All these are a possible danger because the people attending may be carriers of the infection, thus spreading the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan made a suggestion, in connection with the cattle <Col N="607" /> trade, that Cork port might be opened for the shipping of cattle.  I should like to support that scheme, if it is at all feasible.  There may be some difficulties in arranging that, but so far as the southern breeders and sellers of cattle are concerned, we should be glad to see the port open again for export. It would provide competition in the purchasing of cattle and would also mean a lot for the southern farmers generally.</P>
    <P>In regard to tillage, I think that the Minister, considering all the circumstances and the weather and other conditions, must be fairly satisfied that on the whole the farmers made as good an effort as could be reasonably expected from them to carry out the wishes of the Ministry.  Probably, not for many years have we had such a very bad opening of the Spring.  For six or seven weeks it was impossible in most counties, and rarely possible in any county, to put in crops at all.  In that connection I hope the Minister is not forgetting his promise to the House to arrange for the fixation of a minimum price for oats and barley in the coming harvest.  On the results that will accrue from the harvest this year will depend mainly, or to a great extent at least, the enthusiasm necessary to carry on the tillage campaign next year, and we all hope that the farmers will get the best price possible and that they will get a better price than they have got for the last few seasons.</P>
    <P>Practically all the headings of the Estimate have been covered by various Deputies during the debate, and I do not wish to prolong the debate unduly. I shall just end by asking the Minister to look forward rather than backward and, as some of us suggested to the Minister for Finance when we were criticising the Budget, to plan in advance for the period after the war. We are not asking the Minister for Agriculture to plan for after war, but we should like him to plan ahead for next year, so that all arrangements will be made for whatever is necessary in the way of tillage for 1942.  We are asking him to see that due notice will be given to the farmers of what is required, and all possible arrangements <Col N="608" /> made to provide for the farmers as much artificial manure as it is humanly possible to provide.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to be much hope that we will get anything like the required amount, but we might organise the use of substitutes, so far as we have substitutes in the country. I was rather pleased with the suggestion of Deputy O'Donovan that a greater use should be made of what is a very essential manure, which is very commonly wasted in this country, and that is liquid manure.  Much could be done now to arrange for that during the coming winter, and a very extensive use of liquid manure could be made.  It will require organisation and, possibly in the case of some of the small farmers, it would require grants for the making of tanks and other things, but there is a great possibility in the use of liquid manure, particularly in dairy counties and counties where they feed cattle.  There is a great opportunity there of providing a substitute for the artificial manures which will not come in: As I say, it might be necessary to provide a grant for small farmers in that connection, and it also might be necessary, where a group of five or six farmers would co-operate, to provide them with funds to acquire a manure spreader.  That is as far as I want to go in regard to the tillage campaign.</P>
    <P>In regard to butter, I hope&mdash;in fact I am quite sure&mdash;that we will not have the same kind of thing as occurred last year when people were rationed for butter for a month or two.  I hope we will start the storing of butter earlier than last year.  In fact, I think it will be necessary to start the storing of butter much earlier than last year, inasmuch as there is likely to be a greater consumption of butter this year than last year.  At least, we all hope there will be, in view of the provision made by the Minister for Finance in giving a grant for the supply of butter for the unemployed, old age pensioners, and certain other people.  To my mind, that will make necessary a greater provision for cold storage, than there was last year or the year before.  That is as far as I want to go in criticising this particular Vote.  The real kernel of <Col N="609" /> the discussion, as far as I am concerned, is that we should plan ahead, that the Minister and his Department should make such arrangements for next year that things will go more smoothly than they have this year and, I hope, in such a manner that very little criticism will be needed of any Estimate that is produced next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied with the progress made by his Department in regard to egg production over the last number of years.  The figures for egg production show that it has gone down, and gone down very considerably. They also show that egg production has shown a tendency to reduce in accordance with the amount of legislation that has been brought in here by the Minister&rsquo;s Department over a number of years.  I think that at the present time the Minister could very well relax a number of the orders that he has made in connection with egg production and egg export.  I certainly cannot see the use of some of the recent orders that were made, during the last couple of years, in connection with the export of eggs.  I cannot see, for instance, what is the use of filling up dockets by egg buyers and giving a copy to the country-woman from whom they buy the eggs.  They just fill up the docket and put the copy in with the woman&rsquo;s eggs, and does the Minister expect that the egg dealer or egg buyer will go into court and prosecute his own customer for having, perhaps, a cracked egg or one that is not absolutely clean or fresh?  Does he think that that system will work and that his officials will have an absolute check every time they go around to an egg trader?  I can tell the Minister frankly that egg buyers and egg exporters fill up these dockets at the time they are buying the eggs in their travelling shops or lorries, collecting throughout the country, or when they buy direct from the producer.  Then, when they come back in the evening, or afterwards, they go through these dockets and make them complete to provide against a raid by the Minister&rsquo;s officials. The egg exporters would need a staff <Col N="610" /> almost as big as the staff of the Minister&rsquo;s own Department in order to deal with all the regulations and comply with them.</P>
      <P>I think that at a time like this, when there is a ready market for eggs, the Minister should relax some of these orders and endeavour to give more help both to the producer and the exporter.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials who have been going around the country for the past 12 months or two years have made themselves a proper nuisance to the egg exporters.  That may be all very well.  Their work may not be popular, but if they tried co-operating with exporters, instead of trying to pay stealthy visits to them and blackmailing them, I think they would achieve much more.  For instance, I know egg inspectors who pull up their cars a quarter of a mile from egg traders&rsquo; stores and steal up in an endeavour to catch them out by finding a small egg, a cracked egg, or a stale egg.  Those tactics will not have the result the Minister desires.  I know that these egg inspectors have got the backs of the exporters up against them, and that exporters, in view of the way they have been treated, and in view of the methods used, by these egg inspectors, are endeavouring to evade the law.  I do not know what the qualifications for these positions are, or how these people are appointed, but I have had several complaints from County Mayo about these inspectors, and particularly about the lady inspectors the Minister sends out.  I think that, for a job like this, the Minister would be better advised to send out experienced men who know the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Department inflicts a very grave hardship on exporters in forcing them, in face of the present lack of petrol, to live up to these regulations and to send out their eggs every two days.  In some districts in my constituency, exporters have to collect over a large area.  They have not got, and they are not able to get, sufficient petrol to take them to the stations, or to get around the areas from which they collect.  It is absolutely impossible for them to comply with the Minister&rsquo;s regulations at <Col N="611" /> present.  Furthermore, the regulation providing for confiscating a case of eggs in which an inspector finds a couple of cracked or stale eggs is altogether too drastic at present.  The market to which those eggs are going, I suggest, is quite open now.  We are not competing with anybody and the people there want to get as many of our eggs as they possibly can.  It is a very great hardship on a small exporter if, out of his consignment of eggs, a case or two cases are confiscated &mdash; I would not mind if something serious were found &mdash; because of a very slight breach of the regulations, such as a couple of cracked eggs, which may get in in spite of the exporter, or one slightly stale egg which has not been detected.  In such circumstances, the whole case is confiscated and the profit of his whole consignment is gone.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s inspectors are at the port, and they examine the consignments. The trader has nobody to represent him there, and, while not questioning the inspector&rsquo;s decision in the matter, in most cases there is a feeling amongst exporters down the country that they do not know what is happening when the inspectors open a case at the port.  They have no representative there, and they feel in many cases that they are getting a &ldquo;raw deal&rdquo;.  I suggest that, for the duration of the emergency at all events, a number of these annoying regulations should be relaxed. I think it would help both the producer and exporter to do so.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed to read some of the doctrines propounded on the Minister&rsquo;s policy generally, and particularly with reference to the Minister&rsquo;s wheat campaign, by Deputy Dillon and some other Opposition Deputies.  I was amazed that, in the year 1941, we should not all have wakened up to the fact that the only policy for our people is to try to be as self-supporting as possible, and, in this present emergency, to endeavour to grow as much wheat as possible. Wheat, according to Deputy Dillon, is a &ldquo;cod&rdquo;, and he says he is as right now about it as he was some years ago when he made the statement.  He says <Col N="612" /> that, with all our &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; campaign, we have achieved nothing, and at column 2196 of the Official Reports of 1st May last, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Codology it was 12 months ago; codology it was ten years ago; and codology it is now.  But it is a dear, and cruel, codology on our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the House wants to know the success of the wheat policy, the figures are there and they are very simple.  In 1932 we produced 21,388 acres of wheat, and in 1939, owing to the Minister&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; campaign, we increased that acreage to 255,280 acres.  In 1940, we came to the 300,000 acres figure.  In 1932 we had a yield of 32,250 tons, and in 1939, a yield of 277,950 tons.  Deputy Dillon tells us that that is codology, and he solemnly tells the House that he has a scheme whereby we will be able to barter barley with Britain in return for British wheat.  The Deputy presupposes that the British have wheat to give us, and, further, that they will give it to us if they have it. He talks about shipping losses, and says that we should be in a position to tell Hitler to go to blazes; but where would we get the shipping for these 278,000 tons of wheat which we are now producing as a result of the &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; campaign?  If it is so very difficult for us now to import the quantity of wheat by which we are short, how much more difficult would it be to import 278,000 tons more?</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal is absolutely absurd, because if we examine for a moment the way the British treated us, even in respect of articles they have, we have not got any reason to be very hopeful.  If their people are getting 75 per cent. of their tea requirements, and we here can only get 25 per cent., it is very hard to expect that, even if they had the wheat, they would give us the wheat they have such difficulty in importing in return for anything we may be able to give them.  I think the Deputy&rsquo;s whole argument about wheat is a complete &ldquo;cod&rdquo;, to use his own expression, and I hope that most of the members of the House will realise that, whatever other policy the Minister advocates, his wheat <Col N="613" /> policy was, and is, right, and has been a success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon thought fit to make an attack on certain individuals outside this House in connection with the prices of stock.  I hold no brief for these people, but I do think it is only fair to them and to the public that I should let the House know what the people down the country think of the Roscrea Meat Company, and of the prices they paid.  I should like to quote extracts from two Mayo newspapers, which are not advocates of the Fianna Fáil policy, and certainly are not friendly towards me with regard to the Roscrea Meat Company&rsquo;s activities in that county.  The <i>Connaught Telegraph</i>, in its issue of 26th April, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a result of the efforts of the Castlebar Parish Council, it became possible for a large number of farmers to sell fat cattle at the fair in Castlebar on Thursday last.  The council arranged with the manager of Roscrea factory to have a purchaser here, and Mr. T. King, Westport, well-known cattle dealer arrived in Castlebar and purchased some 60 fat cattle, which were later railed to Roscrea factory.  Were it not for this action on the part of the parish council, the fair, which otherwise was poor, would have been the worst held for some time past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The <i>Western People</i> of the same date wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Writing to Mr. Courell, honorary secretary of the Ballina Parish Council, Mr. M.J. Egan, County Commissioner, says he understands there are still some stall-fed cattle in the Ballina district, and he asks for the names and addresses of the owners, and the number of cattle for sale &mdash; only finished stall-feds are required. If the number in the district justifies it, he might be able to get the Roscrea Meat Factory to send a buyer to the district before the Ballina fair on 12th May.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same paper also wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmers of Mayo should be pleased to know that at Castlebar <Col N="614" /> fair on Saturday there was a good clearance of beef at satisfactory prices, and the rumour spread that it was due to the presence of Government buyers.  This was not correct, the purchaser being Mr. Tony King, The Mall, Westport, who is western agent for Roscrea Meat Factory, and up to 52/- a cwt. was paid for a big bunch of animals suitable for cross-Channel trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the comments of two newspapers circulating in my county, which are not, as I say, advocates of Government policy, and which, as a matter of fact, are not friendly to Fianna Fáil. I give these newspapers credit for being independent, and I think they would be the first to attack the Roscrea Meat Company and the prices paid by them if they found any evidence of exploitation. I think it is only fair that this House should get an opportunity of judging that concern on its merits. It is an industry, I understand, which expends about £500,000 annually in this country between the cattle purchased and the wages paid to the workers. That is a very large sum of money to expend.  I would urge the Minister to endeavour to have more concerns like that established in the country.  It is much better that the cattle should be killed here and employment given to our people in that way than that live cattle should be sent to the other side and employment given to hundreds of people in Birkenhead and other places in the slaughter and offal business.  I think that such concerns should certainly be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that the Roscrea Meat Company are plunderers and robbers.  But I can assure Deputy Dillon and the House that, so far as my information goes with reference to my own constituency, the people there were very glad to have the Roscrea buyers down there.  The people would be in a very bad way for the last couple of months if the Roscrea buyers were not there to take some of the cattle from them.  I can give the House further evidence of that.  I have several letters here from people in Mayo, people who do not belong to my particular Party and who are not supporters of its policy, stating that <Col N="615" /> they are completely satisfied with the prices paid and that the prices were the best they could possibly get. Against that evidence I certainly cannot accept Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s word.  So far as County Mayo is concerned, those people have not attempted to exploit the position, but have paid the best prices for the cattle in the open market there.  In fact, they were much better buyers than the Government buyers and have paid much better prices.  In view of that I do not think it is fair to castigate them and call them plunderers and robbers.  I think it is a scandal that they should be slandered in this House where they have no chance of protecting themselves. I certainly take off my hat to the Roscrea Meat Company for doing so well, and I am sorry that in Mayo we have not some concern able to do as well and which would take the cattle off the hands of the farmers there in the way the Roscrea Meat Company have been doing it.</P>
    <P>In some parts of the County Mayo, particularly in the west, the people would like the Minister to continue and increase the lime scheme.  It has been a very successful scheme in my part of the country.  The only difficulty is that we had not sufficient to go round.  If the grant to my constituency could be further increased it would be very much appreciated by the farmers, and I ask the Minister to bear that in mind. I realise the financial difficulties, but it is a scheme in which a little money would go a very long way and a little more money would put us in a much better position in Mayo.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question of manures at any great length, but there are certain areas, particularly in my constituency, which have got a very raw deal and which are absolutely unable to produce crops without artificial manures.  I gave particulars to the Minister before about the Tourmakeady area.  I also find that in Shrule the people are in a very bad way for manures, and representations have been made to me that they will not be able to grow crops there owing to the lack of them.  One <Col N="616" /> way of getting over the difficulty there would be if transport could be provided for them to bring seaweed from the sea coast 60 or 70 miles away, and they would gladly avail of that.  So far as I am aware, there are only two places in Mayo where this difficulty has occurred, but those areas will certainly suffer unless the Minister can come to their aid in some way by getting over this difficulty of manures.  The Minister may not be able to supply them with manures, but if he could arrange with the Department concerned to provide some form of transport to enable them to get the seaweed, those people would be satisfied, because they would be able to grow some kind of crop at all events.  These people are mainly living on farms which are really cutaway bog and they cannot possibly grow crops without manures.  I have not so much sympathy with people in other districts where the land is good and who are kicking up a row about manures.  The Minister, however, will appreciate that there are areas where manures are absolutely necessary because the land is very poor and something should be done by the Department to provide those areas with a certain quantity of manures.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants more tillage and more production.  I suggested to the Minister before, and I again suggest to him, that the places to get the increased production are the places where they have good land.  I suggest to him that in order to increase production he should schedule certain areas that must produce certain crops; that the proper way to tackle the matter is to compel people living in certain counties, such as Meath, Limerick, and counties of that kind where the land is very good, to grow wheat, and to suggest to people in constituencies such as I represent to grow other crops.  In that way the Minister will get increased production.  Unless he does that I believe that the people in the midlands who are very poor tillage farmers will not co-operate with him and produce the amount that they should.</P>
    <P>The fines that have been imposed on those people in the courts are absurd. <Col N="617" /> If one man finds that it is going to cost him a considerable amount in labour, time and material to put more of his land under tillage, and that his neighbour, who refuses to till his land can get over the difficulty with a fine of 10/-, then naturally that is no encouragement to the former to go in for increased tillage.  I think some method other than that of bringing such people to the ordinary courts should be adopted for dealing with them.  I welcome the action of the Minister in entering and taking over farms that were not being used for food production. The only difficulty that he may have in doing that in more cases is the lack of sufficient staff to get those lands put into production.  Naturally, the Minister does not like entering a farm unless he finds it is absolutely necessary to do so.  At the same time, I think that if he took over more farms he would achieve much better results than by prosecuting those who failed to comply with the tillage order.  Bringing them to court, in view of the fines that have been inflicted has, I think, done more harm than good.  I should prefer to see the Minister taking over those farms and giving them to people who will work them and produce food on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister for Agriculture and myself can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the farmers in the County Wexford have done their part, and a little more, in producing food for the people. That is a right and a proper thing to do.  As regards the advice to grow more wheat, I think the Government were somewhat backward in telling the people to do that.  The farmers should have been told last August or September to prepare their land for the growing of more winter wheat.  That is my view as a practical farmer, representing a county that has always grown wheat.  The proper time, in my opinion, to sow winter wheat is from the first or second week in October to the middle of November, so that it will be strong enough to stand the heavy frosts and snow that usually come after Christmas.  This was an exceptionally hard year.  It was laughable <Col N="618" /> for any man with a knowledge of tillage to hear men, who do not know much about tillage, telling the farmers in March last that it was not then too late to sow winter wheat.  I say that it was too late then.  I am sure that the farmers of this country &mdash; those men who have the interests of the country at heart &mdash; will produce plenty of food for the people.  It is our duty and we will do it.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word about the prices charged for seed wheat.  Some farmers in the County Wexford were fortunate enough to be able to buy seed wheat at 47/6 a barrel, while others were charged 70/- a barrel for it.  That is a matter the Minister should do something about as regards regulating the price.  Very often, it is poor men who have no ready cash that suffer most from this failure to regulate prices.  As a rule they have to pay more than the man who is able to put down the cash.  The same thing goes on in connection with artificial manures.  We are also very much concerned about the prices charged in County Wexford for seed barley and seed oats.  Those farmers who were not fortunate enough to sell their barley to the agents of Messrs. Guinness and Company had, in too many cases, to take from 17/- to £1 a barrel for their corn.  I know that the Minister advised the people to hold the barley.  That advice is of no use to the majority of farmers who grow the crop and thresh it after the harvest for cash.  The Land Commission, the rate collector, the shopkeeper and others are waiting until the farmer threshes his corn to get paid the sums due to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested from the Fianna Fáil Benches the other day that farmers with a valuation under £25 should get money to enable them to build stores.  The suggestion was a good one, but it did not go far enough. When the stores are built and the corn in them, what steps are going to be taken to enable these farmers to get an advance of money to pay their lawful debts?  If they get into financial difficulties, what is their position going to be if the bailiff comes out and says he wants the corn in their stores?  If <Col N="619" /> farmers are to be encouraged to build stores, and to keep the corn in them, then some provision must be made to enable them to get an advance of money to tide them over bad times and to enable them to pay their debts.  It costs a good deal of money to put a crop into the land and to take it out. There is no use in advising farmers to build stores and keep their corn unless some arrangement such as I have suggested is made about making advances on account.  Farmers who sold their barley at from 17/- to £1 a barrel were charged by some farmers, as well as merchants, 45/- a barrel for the seed barley that they had to buy back.  I think that is very unfair.  A thing like that does not offer much encouragement to poor, unfortunate, struggling farmers to till their land. While a great many farmers in the County Wexford sold their oats after threshing, at 10/- and 12/- a barrel, they were obliged to pay 30/- and 34/- a barrel for the seed oats that they had to buy back.  I know, of course, that the Minister told them to hold it. They had not either the money or the storage to do that.</P>
    <P>Artificial manures are very necessary for increased tillage.  Someone is to blame for not having a sufficient supply available this year.  The war did not break out overnight, so that steps should have been taken to see that this year&rsquo;s supply was there for the farmers.  I know plenty of men with poor, worn land, and without the manures it is almost certain that they will not get more than half a crop off it.  Those with good, fresh land will, with the help of God, be able to get good crops.  I think the Minister should put his hand to his heart, and next August ask the people with the good land to make preparations for the sowing of winter wheat.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, I am sure that every farmer will be willing to do that.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see to it that the farmers will be able to get adequate supplies of seed mangels, seed turnips.  There is a great scarcity of both in the county that the Minister <Col N="620" /> and I represent.  There are many seed merchants in the County Wexford who have not got as much as a lb. of seed. I am afraid there will be a lot of land ploughed, but it cannot be sowed as the seed is not available.  It is getting a bit late now for the sowing of mangel seed.  Turnips can be sown up to the second week in June, but in the case of mangels the time is getting very short.  I am sure that the Minister has done his best to get this seed.</P>
    <P>On account of that unfortunate economic war the farmers of this country have been left in a very bad state.  Their land is only half stocked and they have no farmyard manure to substitute for artificial manure, so they cannot get full growth out of their outworn land.  There is also another matter to which I must refer.  I hate to have to mention it again, but it was a terrible mistake for the Minister in 1933-34 to slaughter over 500,000 calves. Perhaps the Minister was innocent enough to believe his advisers that he was doing a good day&rsquo;s work, but I think it was a very bad day&rsquo;s work. We have heard a lot about alternative markets.  Everybody knows that before the war everybody was trying to out-do us in the British market.  It was the only market we had for our surplus produce.  I may be called a West Britisher for saying that, but that is the fact.  This country cannot exist without rearing a certain amount of cattle.  In order to be a practical farmer, you must go in for mixed farming. You must have plenty of mangels and hay to feed your animals, and you must have farmyard manure to put out on your farm in the spring or autumn. If you do that, you are a good farmer; if you do not, your land becomes overgrown with weeds; and you are on the road to bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem is one which calls for solution.  Before the 1932 election, I hesitated as to whom I should vote for when I was told by Fianna Fáil that the simplest thing in the world was to solve the unemployment problem, and that they would not be six months in power when they would have to send to England and America for the exiles.  We know that, when America closed down against <Col N="621" /> emigrants from this country, if we had not got our young people over to England we would have been eating each other.  If a solution of the problem was so easy to find, why was it not found?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that matter, but it is a very important side of the Agricultural Vote.  A lot has been said here about Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s statement in this House in connection with Roscrea Meat Products, Limited, but the extraordinary thing is that from that side of the House no Tipperary Deputy has got up to defend Roscrea Meat Products.  We heard one Deputy from Cork and another from Mayo.  Like my friend from Mayo, I should like to see several of those factories through the country, and to see 400 men employed on tinning meat and exporting it across the water, but I do not hold with Deputy Meaney that the people who run this factory are cattle dealers of the very highest repute. They are ordinary, decent cattle dealers, the same as most other cattle dealers, but I do not know why they are said to be of the very highest repute, unless the Deputy thinks that, because men make a couple of hundred thousand in a few years through the sweat and hard work of the farmer, <Col N="623" /> that makes them of the very highest repute, and places them above the ordinary cattle dealer and above the ordinary man.</P>
      <P>I have really no information on the matter except that I have seen the cattle which were sold to those people, and have talked to the ordinary farmer in North Tipperary and on the borders of Queen&rsquo;s County, and discussed with them the price of those cattle.  While those extracts from this dossier read by the Deputy from Mayo give a very glowing account of those buyers, it is known all over North Tipperary and Leix that the full price of the cattle is not being paid.  Even if I take this dossier which was quoted by the Deputy over there, and take the price of 28,000 cattle, what do I find?  I do not know &mdash; nor is it explained in that document&mdash;what they were, but judging from the price of those 28,000 cattle they could not be any more than cow beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was all the price that was paid, according to that column of figures given there, with the exception of about one beast in 16 during those weeks.  I do not mind what Deputy Dillon said; I may not be in agreement with all he said, but I certainly agree that those people should have an eye kept on them by this Department. Everyone will take the opportunity to make money at different times and, therefore, during this emergency, it is the job of the Minister and the Department to watch factories like this, where there is no competition.  It is an extraordinary thing that if you go into some areas where cattle are being bought by those people they will tell you they get a ten-times more satisfactory price from the Waterford dead meat factory.  But there, again, there is some trouble, because we hear from the buyers when we complain about the price of the cattle paid by the Waterford meat factory that one can never be certain, when selling cattle, as to how they will be graded. Some will be graded third-class, some second and some first.  It is an extraordinary thing at this hour of the day in any factory that in the case of about <Col N="624" /> three-year-old bullocks bought on a field some of them can become third-class, some second and some first.  That should not happen.  The time has come when it is up to the Minister and the Department, in order to ensure that the people of this country will be paid for their cattle, to see that they are sold on a live-weight basis, even though it was not always the practice in this country to sell on a live-weight basis.  The buyer who came into the fair judged the beast on its live-weight and bought it on that basis.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be no difficulty in fixing a live-weight price for all cattle sold in this country.  Even in regard to Dublin, although I do not know much about it, from the complaints one hears, I believe it is also necessary.</P>
    <P>To return to the Roscrea case. 1,806 cattle are sold for export and 25,245 cattle are sold for canning.  I would ask the Minister: are not cattle for canning worth as much as cattle for export?  If the Minister inquires, he will find that two days ago those very buyers were buying good young one-and-a-half-year-old cattle for less than 35/- a cwt., because there is no competition.  That is the reason why the Minister should see the people get a fair price.  When there is competition, there is no necessity to fix a price but during an emergency like this &mdash; and God knows what is going to happen &mdash; it is up to the Minister to see there is a fair price given for every beast sold. The only way to do that is to insist on a live-weight price for all cattle.</P>
    <P>In connection with pigs, an extraordinary thing has happened, and whether it is to oblige the Prices Commission or not I do not know.  Of late, especially during the emergency created by the foot-and-mouth disease, in certain areas pigs were sold on a live-weight basis at scales.  The buyers now have refused to buy them by live weight. They buy them by hand, and when the man says to the buyer that he will not give them to him, the buyer says: &ldquo;You must, because you cannot take them home; your permit is only to bring them here.&rdquo;  I will give the information about that to the Minister if he wants it, but I will not say any more <Col N="625" /> in this House, because, like Deputy Dillon, I might be challenged to make the statement outside.  In my opinion, this House is for telling the Minister and the Government and the Departments things we cannot say outside, because we cannot prove them.  As the Minister knows, and as this House knows, no matter what the complaints are outside this House, you cannot get people to put them on paper.  They will come to you and grumble.  You will know it is a fact, but you have no way of getting proof.  Therefore, this House is the only place where you can ventilate those things, and if you should not use it for that purpose, why is the privilege here at all?  Therefore, I say that Deputy Dillon, or any other Deputy, should not be attacked for saying things in this House that cannot be said outside.  They are said for the purpose of helping the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I will say that the Minister&rsquo;s and the Department&rsquo;s intentions were very good this year, but their efforts in connection with increased production were belated.  Nearly everything in connection with the campaign for increased production and increased tillage was belated.  Even in the month of January or February they had made no effort to control the manure supplies, to see that the people would get manures for that increased tillage.  The Department knew very well that, around Christmas of last year, manures were being sold wholesale to people who were able to pay cash, and they knew that, because of that, a number of farmers who always got their manures on credit would get none.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the ordinary small farmer of this country, who is the mainstay of the country, the farmer of 30, 40 and 60 acres, who has to rear a big family, who lives from hand to mouth, and rears his family hard, lived on the credit he got from the shopkeeper, or the small accommodation he got from the bank.  I do not believe there is any Deputy in this House who is not aware of that fact.  More than 50 per cent. of our population lived in that way.  They lived on the credit they got from the merchants.  There is no such thing this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> I say the Minister and the Department knew that manures were being sold wholesale to the people who had money and there was no effort made to control them, not one effort.  While the campaign continued for increased production, while the Department officials and the Taoiseach and the Minister went all over the country, there was no effort made to control supplies of manure at all, and to see that the people who were the greatest producers all the time in this country would get their manures and their seeds.  There is no use in saying more about it now, but I would suggest that if any manures are to be had next year the Minister and the Department ought to control them, and ought to see that the merchants give them to the people who always got them even if they did not pay cash when they were getting them.  I do not mean the &ldquo;bad pay&rdquo;, who never paid or who would not pay or who tried to get out of paying, but I mean the ordinary farmer.  Fifty per cent. of the people of this country got them that way, and ought to get credit until they are selling their harvest.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to seeds seems to be worse than any of the things I have spoken of.  Seeds seem to be in a worse position than petrol.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> a few days ago seeds were advertised at so much a pound. There was a whole column of advertisements. You can go into every second merchant at the moment and buy seed at 5/6 a lb.  There was no mangold seed to be got a fortnight ago.  They have been selling them for the past fortnight.  It seems to me a regular ramp, and it is one thing the Department might look after.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to bring the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  It is milk.  Of course, I know in many cases he is interfered with by another Department, but his last Bill has not remedied things as they might have been remedied, for this reason: a farmer of this country gets about an average of 7d. per gallon for his milk.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking skim and everything else.  He gets an average <Col N="627" /> of 7d. a gallon and yet in the very centre of rural Ireland, in the dairying districts, poor people cannot get a pint of milk.  By going two miles to what is known as a registered dairy they may, perhaps, get a pint for 2d.  I think there was never such a chance for the Minister to do something in connection with milk.  He is paying a subsidy to try to export some of it across the water.  He knows that when this war is over, when competition is resumed, there will be no hope of competing with those countries that produce butter.  I think it is time the Minister and the Government woke up.  They should see there is a chance to educate our people to drink milk.  It would be better to subsidise milk and give it to the people to drink, and try to educate them into drinking it now than to be subsidising butter &mdash; much better, because sometime or other, I believe, if this emergency continues, you will have to set up milk depots and you will not be considering whether all the milk is produced under the hygienic conditions imposed by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for the future development of dairying and the creamery industry.  I think that during this emergency a great chance is afforded him of trying to get milk at a reasonable price for the poor.  There was never such a chance before of educating these people into the drinking of milk.  Now that tea, cocoa and coffee are so scarce, the poor could be easily accustomed to the drinking of milk and many other people as well as the poor.  I would appeal to the Minister and to his officials to deal with that side of the milk question and to try to get milk at a cheap rate for the poor, working on the bogs and elsewhere. I can assure the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that in many cases the regulations governing the production of milk are not carried out; they are not thought of or bothered about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that has been referred to during this discussion is the question of cow testing.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should <Col N="628" /> drop the cow-testing scheme as it is operated at present and start some new scheme.  Cow-testing has now been in operation for 20 or 25 years and we have not got any of our cows beyond the 500-gallon standard.  The 250 or 300 gallon cow represents the average but only 4 or 5 per cent. of our cows are undergoing any test at all.  This is not a matter in which we should depend on voluntary effort.  In this emergency we have depended upon it for a good many things, and for a number of years now cow testing has been left to voluntary effort.  Our people do not like compulsion but it is better to have compulsion where you see that voluntary effort is of no avail and it has been proved that voluntary effort is no use in cow testing.  There is no hope of making our dairying industry prosperous unless we can appreciably raise the standard of production amongst our dairying cattle.  I think the Minister will have boldly to decide that cow testing will be enforced compulsorily at least in the dairying areas, and particularly where there are creameries.  I can see no hope of the scheme being a success while 70 per cent. of the suppliers to a creamery will not join a cow-testing association at all.  Even people who belong to cow-testing associations if they see a nice heifer offered by somebody who does not belong to the association, buy her in and do not keep their own cows very long.  In a good many cases, they are not able to do so.  As I say, I think the Minister should introduce compulsory cow-testing, at least in the creamery areas.  I do not know what can be done in the non-creamery areas. It would be an easy matter for the Minister to introduce compulsion in the creamery areas and to retain something from the money due to the suppliers to the creamery, to pay for the scheme.  That would be a better method than charging 2/- per cow to each member of the association, some of whom refuse to pay even that fee.</P>
    <P>A question was addressed here yesterday to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the milling of wheat.  The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the production <Col N="629" /> of wheat this year.  They got the farmers to grow wheat and other cereals voluntarily.  In former years a farmer who grew wheat was allowed to mill whatever quantity he wanted for himself.  From what I gleaned here yesterday from the reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it appears that the ordinary miller in the country will not be allowed to mill wheat for any farmer who takes it to him, that the farmer must sell his wheat to the miller or merchant and buy it back at £7 per ton more in the form of flour.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some explanation of that.  I should feel very sore, if I were a farmer who had grown wheat, and who wanted to keep five or six barrels for his own use, if, when I took it to the miller who always milled it for me, I was informed that I should have to sell it to the merchant or the miller and buy it back from him later as flour.  I can see the snag, of course, the fear that too much wheat might be used in farmers&rsquo; houses for purposes other than human consumption; but, mind you, things are very scarce now and too much flour is being used, because flour is cheaper at the moment than pig meal or poultry meal.  These are two things to which I should like the Minister to direct his attention &mdash; firstly, to see that the farmer is allowed to mill whatever wheat he requires for himself, and secondly, to see that some decent kind of pig and poultry meal is made available &mdash; not sawdust, grains and chaff, which are sold at a dearer price than wheaten meal or flour.  If that is the only stuff that is available, people are bound to use wheat as animal feeding stuff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my constituents, I wish to state that we appreciate very much the efforts of the Department during the past year to meet the demands for seeds and manures for congested districts.  There are just a few points which I should like to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s notice, arising out of this Estimate.  There is, firstly, the question of pig prices.  On several occasions the Pig Marketing Board advertised current prices for <Col N="630" /> certain grades of pigs &mdash; Class A, Class B, etc.  It appears that the local buyers frequently exceeded these prices.  There was one instance of that in Tralee and another in Killorglin. The ruling price advertised was 112/- per cwt. and the price paid on these occasions by the local buyers was 118/-. The producers have come to the conclusion that either the Pigs Marketing Board have not been sufficiently in touch with the conditions in the industry, that they have not got proper costings, or are not allowing for the increased cost of feeding stuffs that have to be purchased by the farmers. This is a matter that I should like the Minister to investigate because the discrepancy in prices which arose on a number of occasions has resulted in much confusion for producers.</P>
      <P>There is then the question of the transport of seaweed from coastal districts to areas inland.  A committee in Kerry tried to put a scheme dealing with sea-sand into operation, and we appreciate the action of the Department in assisting us to subsidise that scheme.  I suggest that, for the coming year, we should plan ahead and arrange for the transport of large quantities of sea-weed.  I thoroughly agree with the suggestion made by a member on the opposite benches &mdash; that seaweed be dried and an experiment carried out to ascertain the value of the dried seaweed when transferred inland.  I have also been asked to raise a point &mdash; the Department may have considered this question &mdash; as to the extraction of nitrogen from the air for manurial purposes.  A Tralee merchant remarked to me that he wondered why the Department did not experiment in that direction and set up some plant, as has been done in France and Italy, for the extraction of nitrogen from the air.  That would be a move in the right direction because, if we succeeded, we could plan ahead and this question of the import of artificial manures would not be so urgent as it is.  The Industrial Research Council and similar bodies might, under the auspices of the Government, consider that suggestion. It is about time something on these lines should be attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> The last point I have to make is in connection with milk.  I think that some increase in price should be allowed for the coming season.  I appreciate the difficulty in doing that during the emergency, but one has to consider the increased cost of production, including the increased cost of feeding stuffs.  I think that there should be some small increase, if at all possible, on last year&rsquo;s price and the current price.  I should be glad if the Minister would make reference to these points when he is replying.</P>

      <P>One of the things occupying the minds of farmers at the present time is the question of foot-and-mouth disease and the efforts being made to bring it under control. I am sorry to see that the disease has extended to my constituency.  I have no advice to give on the matter save to say that if, in the opinion of the Minister or his advisers, it is necessary to take more drastic steps than have already been taken, it ought to be done.</P>
      <P>However drastic and however unpopular these measures might be, it would be up to the Minister and his advisers to take them because, so far as one can see, there is very little sign of the disease being stamped out.  It is a terrible hardship on the country as a whole.  In my own district, there has not been what you could describe as a fair for about six months and, in the whole of the Twenty-six Counties, the cattle industry is being held up. Suggestions have been made as to stopping congregations of people.  I am sure these matters have been considered, and I am satisfied that the veterinary staff know more about the disease than the ordinary layman does. I offer no advice save this&mdash;that some drastic steps should be taken to get the disease under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at present regarding some aspects of our agricultural economy.  Take dairying, for instance. The Minister knows that the production of milk was very low last year and, so far as one can see, it is likely to be low this year.  These are not matters over which we have a great deal of <Col N="632" /> control.  We had a dry summer last year.  We have had very dry weather recently, and everybody knows that the absence of grass is responsible for the low production of milk.  I am concerned, however, about the price.  The price paid by the creameries is about 6d. a gallon and I understand that the Minister has held out very little hope of an increase on that price.  There is no use in anybody saying that 6d. a gallon, even with the separated milk back, compensates the farmer for the milk which he produces.  It certainly does not.  I know that it is a difficult problem to deal with because, for good or ill, the price is governed by the export price.  Meetings are being held, and I think the Minister has been asked to attend these meetings to discuss matters with those engaged in the dairying industry.  A meeting is to be held on the 17th of the present month in Limerick and I think the Minister, if he can spare the time, should attend that meeting because I understand he did not attend some of the conferences in connection with this industry.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was putting a levy some time ago on home production&mdash;a levy of about 4d. per lb&mdash;he justified his action&mdash;I speak from memory&mdash;by saying that the price of butter from exporting countries at that time was from 1/9 to 2/6 per lb. The price here has always been governed by the price operating on the British market, though I know that that price has been subsidised lately and has effected some improvement so far as the creamery is concerned.  I find that the price being paid to the farmer in Britain, and even to creameries, is nearly double what we can get for it here.  I think that the price paid on the British market bears no relation whatever to the cost of production. I know they will buy in the cheapest market and, if we were in the same position, we would probably do the same thing.  In any event, some means should be devised whereby a better price would be paid to the farmer for the milk he sends to the creamery.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Flynn, spoke at length in connection with the <Col N="633" /> production of pigs.  What I feel about pigs&mdash;and I couple poultry with them&mdash; is that there will be a great shortage for some months, and may be for some years to come.  One hears every day that sows are being fattened and sold. Anybody who has a moderately small number of pigs is doing that.  I will give an idea of the situation.  I met a small farmer the other day who told me that he had pigs to be disposed of, and that they could be had &ldquo;for the taking away&rdquo; as they were worth so little.  We all know that the whole crux is the price of feeding stuffs.  Roughly speaking, the cost of any sort of feeding stuffs which are to be had is about 3/- a stone.  Under present circumstances, one simply cannot produce bacon at that price for feeding stuffs, and the same thing applies to fowl.</P>
    <P>These are the things I hear of when these matters are being discussed by people who know something about them.  Last September or October, since the factories could not or would not take the pigs from the farmers, they had to bring them home.  That is very discouraging to a farmer.  That has happened certainly, and the practice has grown up within the last 12 months.  I do not know everything about the whole situation, but I know something.  Heretofore, it was the practice to buy the pigs by live weight at the local market.  For some reason or other, that was discontinued and they were sent to the factory.  The story was that they were a long time there before they were killed, and that they were reduced considerably in price, to the detriment of the farmer.  At any rate, there is likely to be a big decline in the production of bacon in the future.  I do not know the remedy. Some people say that cheaper feeding stuffs would be a remedy.  Those which we were accustomed to cannot be had. The best substitute is barley and, at the present price of barley&mdash;if it can be had at all&mdash;it is very hard to produce bacon, and even then the return is an uneconomic one at the present price of bacon.  Like other speakers, I know that there is great variation in the prices and that some have been paying lower than the fixed price.  The <Col N="634" /> whole thing is in a very unsatisfactory state.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to tillage. So far as I know, the farmers have complied very well with the Compulsory Tillage Order introduced by the Government.  In only a few cases can it be said that it was necessary for the Minister to enter upon land and take it over.  I should like to tell the Minister now that I hope to put questions to him when the time comes, and ask him to show the costings in connection with some of the lands on which he has entered.  We will expect that from the Minister: I will expect it, at any rate.  It is his duty to give it to us and we will see then, as far as his farming is concerned, how it compares with the costings which have been given in connection with some of the cereals for which prices have been fixed.  I would not agree at all with anybody who says that £2 a barrel is a generous price for wheat.  I do not agree that it is generous.  I was in my local town on Monday and saw a man who had four barrels of wheat in the cart, costing £4 per barrel, to bring it out to sow it on a plot of land on which wheat had failed.  That was only last Monday.  One can realise the cost of that.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is a good deal of wheat like that in the country.  There is nothing but complaints about spring wheat.  I have them myself.  I have as good a crop as there is from here to where I live, and I have had as bad, and I think it is not due to any fault of mine.  One of the reasons why I have a good crop in some places is that it was sown last October.  More of what I have was not sown very late either, but I have been told always that spring wheat is a very doubtful proposition. In general, the farmers have complied very well with the tillage order, and if sufficient crops are not produced it will not be their fault.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Roscrea factory.  I should like to deal with cattle prices in general, in so far as they affect farmers.  Deputy Moran has said that the best price was paid in an open market.  Of course, there was not an open market in this case, <Col N="635" /> and I have heard complaints in connection with the prices paid in Roscrea. It is human nature, when persons are in a monopoly position, that they will be generous to themselves. The Minister can do nothing about it but fix prices.  I know that there are fixed prices in Dublin at present. Whether they are satisfactory or otherwise, it is not for me to say; but they probably would be more satisfactory than those of a monopoly which is uncontrolled.</P>
    <P>There should be fixed prices for dressed meat exports.  Then farmers would know how they stood.  It was somewhat different before the restrictions came on, and I suppose it would be different again if you could put your cattle in the open market and have Bill Smith or John Brown to bid for it.  In that way, it was possible to find out a fair price.  The situation in the country for some months back was that the Roscrea factory was taking cattle, and there was also the Waterford factory. Roscrea belongs to an individual and Waterford to the farmers, and I believe that the farmers at Waterford have been paying reasonable prices for the cattle they got.  There may have been a complaint here and there, but I have heard that it was more satisfactory than sending them to Roscrea.</P>
    <P>If this dressed meat business is to be a feature of our agricultural economy for any length of time to come, the Government must, in my opinion, fix prices in accordance with what would be realised in the export market.  That is not asking anything unfair.  I believe it is the only way in which you can satisfy the people. When replying, I wish the Minister would state if he has any more information regarding the restrictions to be put on the entrance of cattle into Britain next October.  He stated that there might be restrictions, and I should like to know if any change has taken place in the situation.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there are through the country numbers of cattle which, under other circumstances, would have been sold.  With the continuance of the present weather, and the absence of pasture or grass, it seems to me that <Col N="636" /> there will be a great many cattle to carry over this summer, and I am afraid that that is a position that it will not be easy to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House many minutes on this Estimate.  Certainly, this is not a time for controversial discussions about the Department of Agriculture.  It is not even a time when it would be discreet to indulge in criticism in a detailed way, as the country, in its agricultural economy, is in the middle of a serious disaster, in the shape of foot-and-mouth disease.  The only hope for the country, as a whole, in successfully grappling with that particular menace, is by the very closest co-operation between the officials of the Department and farmers in particular, as well as the general community.  That co-operation can only be fully effective if it is based upon confidence.  I do not propose to give expression to any views that might have any effect other than to increase the confidence of the people in the officers of the Department.  There is a responsibility upon people in Parliament to discuss at some time the activities of a Government Department in dealing with any big crisis, or any serious situation that comes within its scope.  My idea is that that some time should be after the corner is turned, rather than when the country is in the course of turning it.  For that reason I have no intention of discussing in any detailed or general way the various activities of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, one or two points that were brought to my notice within recent days which I think it well to avail of this opportunity to bring to the notice of the Minister.  The points in question are ones that could very usefully be considered sympathetically by the Department of Agriculture. One matter to which I desire to call attention concerns the position in which small co-operative bacon factories find themselves under the pigs and bacon legislation.  In particular, I was approached on behalf of Roscrea bacon factory.  Under recent legislation a pool has been created to compensate for all carcases or portions of carcases <Col N="637" /> condemned <i>post mortem</i> by veterinary examination.  The pool is by way of being an insurance fund out of which full compensation is paid for every carcase condemned.</P>
    <P>The body working that particular fund is empowered under the Act to strike from time to time a rate or levy on every pig killed in every factory, and out of that general fund to compensate for carcases condemned.  The principle of having a joint insurance fund to compensate for condemned carcases or portions of carcases is undoubtedly a very sound one.  It can also be agreed that no body of experts at the beginning of the year could possibly say how many carcases were going to be condemned in the course of the year.  Consequently, the suggestion that the levy rate should be struck from time to time is perfectly reasonable, but these powers are not, in my opinion, being exercised in a perfectly reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>In the case in point, this is a small co-operative factory, owned by farmers who are shareholders and not a proprietary or profit-making institution. At the beginning of January, 1940, the first year in which this levy worked, the management of that factory was notified that the levy towards this insurance pool would be 9d. per pig slaughtered.  In the middle of the year, when the half-yearly meeting in June was held, and the accounts were audited and published to the shareholders, the little profit that was made, a couple of hundred pounds, was divided amongst the shareholders, leaving the till empty except for the few pounds necessary to carry on from week to week.  Three weeks later the management was notified that the original rate of 9d. was insufficient and that a further 2d. per pig slaughtered, amounting to £200, would be required. Obviously the accounts already published were immediately falsified, and a demand was made for money which had been already issued by way of small dividends to the shareholders. Towards the end of the same year and again it so happens when the second half-yearly audit had been completed a further notification was received that <Col N="638" /> a levy of 1/- for every pig slaughtered would be necessary in order to bring the pool up to a level to meet compensation. On that particular occasion the books showed a profit of £900 odd.  The demand of a levy of 1/- for every pig slaughtered amounted to £800 odd, turning a profit of £900 into about £70.</P>
    <P>The management of the factory did not object to the levy, or to its being made periodically, but they ask that on certain known dates throughout the year, say January 1st, or June 1st, they should be notified what their liability to the pool is, so that their factory could be run on businesslike lines. The levy itself and this insurance scheme would, I suggest, require very close scrutiny and investigation by the Department.  In the case of this particular factory, they have paid in, as it so happens, £2,000 a year so far into that insurance pool to compensate for carcases condemned, and they drew out of it for condemned carcases the equivalent of £500 a year.  The answer may be that that is a very healthy area and that there are areas elsewhere where a considerably larger number of pigs that are not healthy are slaughtered, but I am informed that every factory has the same complaint, that they are paying into that insurance pool considerably more than they are drawing out.  That may or may not be true, but that is what I am told.  If there is a leakage in that pool, or if the overhead charges of managing that pool are excessive, that is a matter that requires to be looked into.</P>
    <P>In general, the whole question of a national pool rather than each factory creating its own insurance fund is, in my opinion, questionable.  If I am to take it that, No. 1, the overhead charges are not too heavy and, No. 2, that there is no leakage; and if the figures given here are correct, that in one small farmer-owned factory they pay in £2,000 and get out £500&mdash;the figures show that 6d. for every pig slaughtered would compensate for the condemnations in that factory, but that that factory is subsidising a large, wealthy factory to the tune of £1,500 a year&mdash;then, that would not be <Col N="639" /> reasonable.  What it means is this, that where a factory is run on co-operative lines, where the shareholders are farmers and producers, and where they carry out all the advice and suggestions given to them by the Department of Agriculture and rear healthy pigs in hygienic surroundings with a minimum of condemned tubercular carcases among them, then because they are running their pig production on sound, healthy and hygienic lines they are getting their pockets picked by factories in other areas where the pigs are not reared under sound, hygienic conditions, and where a very high percentage of the pigs are condemned as tubercular.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the overhead costs of that particular insurance pool or fund should be looked into and that, if everything is found all right, these little factories in particular should have a rate struck and announced twice yearly, if necessary, but on known dates, so that books could be properly made up and real figures rather than temporary figures, which may turn out to be false, would be in their published reports.</P>
    <P>In the areas which have been affected by this foot-and-mouth disease there has been very serious loss, not only to the farmers who had the misfortune to have their farms infected, but to every farmer, particularly within the restricted area. The Minister is very well aware that there have been farms overloaded with stock, where there was an absolute scarcity of feeding stuffs and where the stock were going back in condition, day after day.  In many cases the farmer had alternative lands, and it was his custom, from month to month, to send out some of the stock from the central farm to other lands of his own or lands which he rented.  The standstill order made that transfer impossible.  I am not criticising the standstill order. Circumstances made it necessary to make that order, so that the movement of stock could not take place.  That farmer was losing heavily on the home farm by an overcarriage of stock.  He was losing also on the place abroad, either by way of out-of-pocket rent for <Col N="640" /> an empty holding, or by reason of the fact that he could not stock the holding.</P>
    <P>In a year of such exceptional disaster for farmers in certain areas, certain exemptions from overhead charges should be made.  The normal thing, as the Minister knows, for a farmer when he is called upon to pay the annual or half yearly overhead charges, such as rent, rates, or in certain cases income-tax, is that he realises on some of his stock that are fit for the market and with that cash he meets the demand notes for rent or rates or income-tax. I was approached within the last couple of hours by a farmer who must be a bit of a magician, because he was in a position to show me that in good years and bad over the last 17 years he was never a week late with rent, rates or income-tax, and in even the very worst years, no matter what he went without, he was never a week in arrears.</P>
    <P>This is the only time since he took over the farm from his father that he finds himself unable to meet the demands, and he is only temporarily unable by reason of the fact that on the home farm he has at the moment, or had up to a couple of weeks ago, three times as many cattle as the farm should carry, going back in condition, and elsewhere he had derelict land gasping for those cattle, but they could not be transferred.  In a year of such exceptional gravity, of such major disasters for all farmers, and of such particular disaster for those in particular areas, I urge the Minister for Agriculture, who is more conscious of this than any of us are, to suggest to his colleagues, whether in the Department of Finance or in the Department of Local Government, that where a case of extreme hardship and financial loss can be made by farmers within the affected areas, within the zone of restriction, the collection of this year&rsquo;s levy, whether for rates, annuities or income-tax, if it cannot be completely remitted, should be postponed at least until next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the question of the flour mills, but I should like to know the position <Col N="641" /> with regard to mills in general.  In 1933 a Bill, the Cereals Bill, was passed through this House, and under that Act millers were licensed to mill certain feeding stuffs.  There was an amending Bill passed the next year, and different orders were passed since. At the present time, we do not know exactly what is the position in regard to these mills but, anyhow, we do know that as a result of the present difficulties under which the farmers are labouring they had to sell grain at prices which were unreasonably low some six months ago and they were unable to carry on over the winter.</P>
      <P>At the present time these millers are selling some kind of stuff&mdash;they name it feeding stuffs, but I do not know what it is&mdash;at 2/10 a stone, which is equivalent to £1 2s. 8d. per cwt.  I have a sample of it here, which I shall show to the Minister or to anybody who wishes to see it.  I should like to have it analysed.  Perhaps the Minister can have it analysed and tell us what it is composed of and what is its value. It is ridiculous to see stuff like that sold at 2/10.  Anybody who would look at it would see that it is not worth even 10d. a stone&mdash;I myself do not believe it is worth that much&mdash;and that would be less than one-third of the price that is being charged for it.  At any rate, since we have a Department of Agriculture to deal with such matters, whenever there is any important matter to be dealt with that Department should see that the farmers are not robbed in order to make up a profiteering miller.  That is especially so when you remember that these are licensed millers, having a monopoly perhaps.  As I said, I do not know how the law stands with regard to those people, but the Minister should know, and he should see that if they are granted protection and privileges they should rise to their responsibilities and do that, for which they are protected, decently and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moran, when he was speaking, referred to Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s speech on a self-supporting policy.  There are many ways of dealing with this self-supporting policy, and I think that if Deputy Dillon had been quoted fairly <Col N="642" /> it would be seen that his policy is just as self-supporting as that of Fianna Fáil.  I do not say that Deputy Moran intentionally misrepresented Deputy Dillon, but it would seem that either he did not read the speech or was not listening to it.  He may have heard some of Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s speech, but not all of it.  Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s references to wheat growing were based upon just as self-supporting a policy as that of Fianna Fáil.  I am not defending it, because I do not know very much about it.  I am not giving any opinion whatever upon Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s scheme, as I do not know anything about barley.  His scheme, however, was to this effect.  He suggested that we should first come to an agreement with Great Britain&mdash;an agreement which he said could be made&mdash;to produce so much barley to be exchanged for so much wheat from them.  That was his scheme, and if that arrangement had been made there is no doubt that this country could supply sufficient barley in exchange for the wheat. As I have said, whether it would be a good scheme or not I do not know, but it was Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s scheme.</P>
    <P>It was put forward simply as a business proposition&mdash;as something which, if it could happen between two individuals, could also happen between two nations.  Of course, the agreement would be that the goods would be delivered by both sides.  Now, if it were more profitable to grow barley and exchange it for wheat, that would be just as sensible a self-supporting policy as the growing of wheat.  As a matter of fact, if we did not produce exactly what we wanted here, but produced something else and exchanged that for everything we imported into this country, if that were possible, that would be a self-supporting policy.  It may not be possible at the present time, but if that could be carried out on the lines to which Deputy Dillon referred in the case of wheat and barley, not only would we be as self-supporting even as we are at present, but we would be more self-supporting to the extent of over £17,000,000, which is the amount of the adverse trade balance, by growing or producing commodities in this country and exchanging <Col N="643" /> them for other commodities from other countries.  Accordingly, there is a lot of nonsense talked about a self-supporting policy.  It is all a question of which is the more self-supporting policy of the two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran asked, in this connection, where we were to get the shipping to import 278,000 tons of wheat, or where was Great Britain to get it. Where is Britain getting the shipping to import 100,000 tons more barley? Would not the shipping that would import, say, 400,000 tons of barley import 278,000 tons of wheat?  Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s scheme raised no difficulty with regard to shipping.  It did not mean that we would be less self-supporting in that event.  I do not know whether it would or not, but in listening to Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s scheme, as he put it forward, I think one would get the impression and must come to the conclusion that his scheme would be just as self-supporting as the other.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the foot-and-mouth disease.  It has become a serious problem for this country.  I was in a fair yesterday and saw cattle that would only realise £12, and they were worth £17 last November. That was £5 lost on a winter&rsquo;s feeding.  If we put down the winter&rsquo;s feeding at anything from £3 to £4, the loss would be from £8 to £9 on every beast in this country.  Mind you, Cavan is 50 miles away from any outbreak. Yet every animal is reduced by £7 or £8, and there is very little prospect of this disease being cleared up in time to get the cattle shipped, or in time to get them shipped when farmers would be likely to get their value.</P>
    <P>I believe that no matter what time the ports are opened now, that will represent the loss, because if the ports are not open before the autumn the British may not want our cattle and we may have to carry them over longer. Even if we do not, there will be such a glut of them that the loss will be as much, perhaps, as it is to-day&mdash;whoever is lucky enough to be able to sell them at all, but, of course, very few are able to sell their cattle at any price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> I know that the Minister is well disposed in the matter of dealing with this disease and that his Department is fairly interested.  I believe, at the same time, that this was something of an extraordinary disease.  There was something very unaccountable in connection with the way it spread at the start.  On the 14th February last, before it spread out of the district where it first started, I wrote to the Minister with regard to the disease, and I put down a question at the same time.  That was before the disease got into the County Dublin at all, when it was very easy to isolate it and to carry out stringent regulations without any serious inconvenience or loss to anybody. I told the Minister it was better, even if it were not necessary, to adopt the most stringent measures and that it was much better that he should make ten mistakes in taking extreme measures than that he should make one mistake and let the disease spread.  The Minister in his answer said that he had it well in hand and that things were going on well.  He was an optimist.  I got the impression that the Minister was not likely to deal with it because, rightly or wrongly, from my experience of the bad outbreak some 25 or 30 years ago, I was convinced that, if proper measures were not taken, the disease would spread, because I am afraid the people in this country do not co-operate in the same way as in other countries.  They are inclined to play fast and loose with the law, and, in many cases, it is very little harm, but in a case of this kind of so serious import to the nation&mdash;it means a loss of £10,000,000 or £15,000,000 to the country in a year, which the farmers, in the first instance, have to bear, but which falls eventually upon the nation&mdash;the Minister should have been very careful, before the disease got out of hand for a time, to confine it and to deal with it, as every isolated outbreak in Great Britain and Northern Ireland had been dealt with.</P>
    <P>If there was nothing extraordinary in this outbreak, how can the Minister account for the way it has spread and got out of hand?  The British Department of Agriculture are able to confine and deal with every case, and never let <Col N="645" /> it get out of hand.  It recurs there year after year and month after month. They have such intercourse with other countries in which the disease is prevalent at all seasons of the year that it is impossible to prevent occasional outbreaks. Yet, their people confine it and deal with it.  In our case, the Minister should have taken every possible step, even that of asking the advice of the British Department of Agriculture and, if necessary, asking them to send one of their special men, if they have special men, to assist the Department here, which, I am sure, they might do.  It is no use crying over spilt milk, but I ask the Minister now to take the strongest possible measures.  I am afraid he is not doing so, because, in those districts in which the disease is prevalent, notwithstanding all the damage it has done, we find sports meetings, horse races and dog races being held.  It would not be a bit of harm to shut up these sports meetings where there is any disease within a reasonable distance of them. I think it is the duty of the Minister to see that these people did not enjoy themselves until this disease was stamped out, and it might induce the people to give more co-operation.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many prosecutions there have been in connection with this disease, but the Minister told us that people were concealing it.  I wonder what he has done about those cases of concealment.  We have not heard of any drastic remedies being applied.  Yet the country has suffered to an enormous extent and yet these innocent people are allowed to suffer, while the guilty people go unpunished. The Minister might be too lenient in some directions.  He has the co-operation of 99 per cent. of the people in endeavouring to stamp out this disease, and he should not let down that 99 per cent. in order to be too lenient towards law-breakers and public enemies, for that is what they are.  Perhaps some of them did not realise the damage they were doing, but, if that be so, it was again the Minister&rsquo;s fault.  He should have made it clear to them, and should have taken stronger powers, if he had not already sufficient powers, to deal with them.  He should <Col N="646" /> have published, at the very start not in a little confined corner in small print, but in very large print at the top of the page, whatever he wanted to convey to the people in order to get them to co-operate with him in stamping out the disease immediately it broke out, and not when hundreds of outbreaks had occurred.  I hope the Minister will learn from past mistakes, that he will turn over a new leaf now and will make an effort to stamp it out at any price.</P>
    <P>At that time, there was great criticism&mdash;and it was the reason for my becoming alarmed&mdash;of the Department&rsquo;s policy of stamping it out, of slaughtering cattle and paying compensation. I asked the people who criticised the policy adopted by the Department what they would think if it spread through the whole country and if, instead of paying a couple of thousand pounds compensation, the country lost a couple of million pounds.  I met some of these people yesterday and they said I was right. They admit now that the country is losing £7,000,000 or £8,000,000, instead of £2,000, and it is better for the Minister to make known to such people as these that it is a serious offence, not merely to cloak or conceal the disease, but to attempt to cure it, or to recommend cures for it.  That is where the Minister failed.  He allowed such things to continue and gave the impression that it was a good thing to try to cure it and to save the cattle from slaughter.  That was very foolish. It would be all right if the Minister had decided to abandon the slaughter policy altogether, having decided it was wrong, but so long as he meant to carry out that policy, he should have allowed no other policy to compete with him.  He should have taken drastic measures in time to carry out his policy, and it would have been a simple thing then to deal with the disease.</P>
    <P>The question of credit for farmers has often been discussed, and I do not think there is very much use in discussing it now, because the real trouble about credit is that agriculture is not paying.  There is plenty of money to be got from the banks and from the <Col N="647" /> Credit Corporation, if farmers could give good security, but their farms do not constitute a good security because they are not paying.  Any company can raise plenty of money here if its industry is prosperous and paying, and if it is able to show good results.  Nobody questions the honesty of the farmer, but their industry is crushed and depressed, for one reason or another.  I do not want to go into these reasons. The Minister has heard them often enough and ought to know them well enough by now, but the fact is that farmers cannot get credit because they are not prosperous.  If the bankers believed that farmers could repay loans when they would wish them to be repaid, farmers would get plenty of money, but the fact that they believe that farmers will not be able to meet their obligations, that they will be kept out of their money for a long time, and possibly eventually never be able to recover, is the reason why they cannot get loans, or, when they do, that they get them at an exorbitant rate.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the first thing to do is to make agriculture more prosperous. That would go further towards a solution of the problem than any other steps that may be taken to provide credit for agriculture.  More than 50 per cent. of the tariffs imposed for the protection of industries of various sorts, such as those that manufacture farm implements and machinery, feeding stuffs and manures, and all the rest, is coming out of the pockets of the agricultural community.  Not only that, but the increased prices that those tariffs allow the home manufacturer to put on come out of the pockets of the agricultural community without any compensation being given to them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance wants all the money that can be raised on customs duties to help to balance the Budget. But, in justice, this money which is taken out of the pockets of the agricultural community in order to help other industries should go back either by subsidies or otherwise to the agricultural community.  The sum, I suppose, would amount to £5,000,000 or <Col N="648" /> £6,000,000 a year.  They are paying that amount in duties upon every article they are buying.</P>
    <P>There is another way of dealing with agriculture, if the Minister was in a position to do it, but I do not know that he is in a position to do that at present, although it is necessary that something should be done to help agriculture, and that is to give a decent price for whatever is produced, a price that will not only cover the cost of production, but give a profit, just the same as in any other industry in this country that is getting protection.  In an industry where there is an exportable surplus, subsidy is the only method of protection.  Whether you protect an industry by giving a subsidy or by imposing a tariff, it comes to the same thing.  But, as everybody knows, you cannot protect agriculture by imposing a tariff.  You can, however, protect it by paying subsidies.  Some scheme should be devised to get over the difficulty and to bring about a fairer balance as between different industries.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, after all, is our principal industry; it is the mainstay of the State in the long run.  Even in times of war or crisis the raw material for agriculture will not run short; agriculture can still produce and feed the nation.  Other industries are very good in their own way, but when we find ourselves in a crisis we are let down.  Some industries are not able to procure their raw materials to carry on, but agriculture stands by the nation at all times and it will do so now.  Notwithstanding that agriculturists have been treated as the stepchildren of this State for a long time, and are being so treated even now, they are prepared to carry on and feed the nation.  Notwithstanding what they are suffering for the time being, they are willing to help the country out of the crisis, just as their sons have always joined the defence forces and given service to the nation, as they always did.  I think they deserve better treatment from the Government than they have got for some time.  I hope the Minister will do his best to help them out of their difficulties and try to induce his colleagues <Col N="649" /> to do what they can for them, so far as we can afford it at the present time.</P>
    <P>We might talk here for the next 24 hours, and still not discuss all the disabilities under which the farmer labours.  I will just take one example. There are fellmongering factories in this country.  I do not know what protection they are getting; it may be 30 per cent., 40 per cent. or 75 per cent. They are getting that over and above the world price for what they produce. Their raw materials are sheepskins. Are they giving 75 per cent. over the world price for the sheepskins?  They are not.  In order that they would not be compelled to give the world price for sheepskins, an order was made prohibiting the export of sheepskins, which so far as I know is still in force. The result is that these fellmongers are getting their raw material which the farmers produce at less than the world price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the right track because it is still in force, as far as I know.  Deputy Corry referred to profiteering in seed wheat and to the question of credit, but I do not want to go into details on these matters. Deputy Ryan and others spoke of milk testing, Deputy Ryan recommending that it be made compulsory.  I would not agree with him because I do not see why farmers should be compelled to do anything that is not a paying proposition. How can farmers here produce milk at less than half the price farmers in Northern Ireland are getting for their milk?  In view of that, why should there be compulsory milk testing?  If high-class milkers were more profitable and farmers were able to purchase and get feeding for them, then I say the farmers would not be behindhand.  Speaking here as a practical experienced farmer, I am doubtful whether milk production pays at all.  Who can tell whether the 700-gallon cow pays the farmer better than the 400-gallon cow.  It all depends on how the cow is kept, so that if every item of cost is taken into account it is doubtful whether she pays as well as the 400-gallon cow?  I have known farmers who took prizes at shows and elsewhere for their cows as being the best milkers and they were not too prosperous, while the farmers who had not any of these prize cattle were prosperous. These things cannot be tested out by methods of compulsion, or by attempts to drive the farmers or any other section of the people.  The only way that a Government Department will succeed in these matters is by leading the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seven or eight years ago I introduced <Col N="652" /> a motion in this House, and recommended one way in which the Department of Agriculture could lead the farmers, and that was by establishing demonstration farms.  Under this Budget, and the Supplementary Estimates which are almost certain to be introduced later in the year, the House will, I suppose, be asked to vote at least £1,250,000 for the service of this Department, and yet in spite of that big expenditure it has not even one demonstration farm in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I think that is disgraceful. We have too much compulsion in the country.  What we want is a Department that will lead the farmers.  Out of this vast sum of money that I mentioned, I think it should be possible for the Department to run a few demonstration farms and let us see what results its officials will get.  The farms should be worked as ordinary farms, and accounts kept so that accurate costings may be obtained.  The Department might take a 200-acre farm in one county, 100-acre farm in another and a 50-acre farm, elsewhere.  Accounts, as I have said, should be kept so that we could know whether the farms were paying or not.  Each farm should be run in the ordinary way, calves being reared, pigs and other animals being fed on the land, and the usual crops grown.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Department to do that.  The Department, as I have said, is spending considerably over £1,000,000 of the taxpayers&rsquo; money, and should be able to demonstrate to the people some of the results that are being got for that money.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Government that they must first win the confidence of the people before they can lead them anywhere.  I have often heard it said that you can never drive the Irish. The Department should have known that long ago.  You can only lead them, and they are easily led if taken in the right way.  My suggestion to the Minister is: show the farmers that they are missing a fortune by not doing things in the proper way.  If you do that they will be jumping over one another to do things in the right way and make fortunes for themselves. <Col N="653" /> Their only trouble is that they have not so far discovered the road to prosperity, but if the Department shows them the road to prosperity I am sure they will all be very eager to travel that road.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry argued that the milking qualities of our cattle had not improved. Yet on the occasion of a debate here on a motion dealing with shorthorn cattle a Cork Deputy expressed the view that he thought the cattle in the County Cork could be utilised for the purpose of improving the strain of cattle in the County Cavan.  I think the cattle in the County Cavan are much superior to the cattle in the County Cork, and I think that explains why the cattle sent to us from Cork did not improve the quality of our stock.</P>
    <P>The farm improvement scheme is costing a good deal of money.  I hope it will do good, but I think it is not being put into operation at the right time of the year.  I think it should be started as soon as the autumn work is finished, and not in February or March, as it was this year.  I believe that three-fourths of these farm improvement schemes were not started until February this year.  That was a wrong time to start them because, instead of being engaged on that class of work, the farmer should then be busy getting the land ready for the sowing of the crops.  I know men who had to dismiss some of their workers in November last because they had no work for them to do.  That would not have happened if these farm improvement schemes were put into operation at that time of the year.  These schemes should be started when there is a good deal of unemployment and not in the spring-time, when the farmers are getting ready to sow their crops.  In conclusion, I hope the Minister will not lose sight of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters that I want to put before the Minister.  I wonder does he realise the serious condition of the farmers throughout the country.  I want to say to him in all truth and sincerity that their condition could not be much <Col N="654" /> worse than it is to-day.  The Minister must be aware of the reason for that. They have no money because no fairs or markets have been held since January last.  Consequently, they are unable to dispose of their stock.</P>
      <P>They have to go out and pay cash for everything they buy.  Credit is tied up.  They must pay cash for manures. Every Deputy who spoke here, or at least the majority of Deputies, made special reference to manures.  I believe that the Minister and the manure manufacturers are themselves responsible for the position.  When they were arranging the price of manure and the subsidy that would be paid for this season, the figures should have been calculated more or less on the basis of the whole manure season, say from October to May.  Instead of that, a circular was sent out last October giving the price for all classes of manures, and that price remained in force only until the end of January or the beginning of February.  A new price list was issued in February, and the price of some of those manures was substantially increased.  The hardship involved in that was that the wealthy people, who could afford to pay cash for the manures, got them at the lower price, while the poor man who was not in a position to purchase at that time had to get his manures in February or March or April at the higher price.  For that reason I feel that the Minister and the manure manufacturers are to blame for the position.  Now is the time to make arrangements for getting in the manures for next year&rsquo;s crop. Everywhere, the question is being asked: &ldquo;Will we get any manures at all next year?&rdquo; That feeling of uncertainty is having a bad effect so far as increased tillage is concerned, as the farmers are dependent on artificial manures to a large extent.  The Minister should make provision now for getting in as much raw material as he possibly can, and, when he is making arrangements with the manure manufacturers as to subsidy and price, those figures should be calculated to cover the whole manure season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that the <Col N="655" /> terms given by the manufacturers this year were very hard on the small farmers and on the manure agents all over the country.  In a year when the people were being asked to engage in extra tillage, I think the Minister and the manure manufacturers should not have acted in the way they did as far as terms are concerned.  Up to this year, extended credit was given to the agents, and, through the agents, to the farmers.  They got credit from January to May, or from May to the following January.</P>
    <P>This year the small farmers of the country, who are in the habit of getting credit on those lines, found it very hard when they were told this year: &ldquo;You must pay cash.&rdquo;  Those were the terms laid down by the manure manufacturers. I think the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Supplies and the manure manufacturers should have found a way to ease that credit situation, instead of insisting on the farmers paying cash in seven or ten days.  Under that system, only the people who had ready money were in a position to purchase manures.  The people who had not the ready cash could not get the manures when they wanted them, and by the time they had the money they probably found that all the manures had been disposed of.  I would appeal to the Minister to make arrangements now for getting in the raw materials for next year, and, when the price list is being sent out, it should cover the whole manure period. We should not have a repetition of what happened this year.  We should not have such a condition of affairs that a man could go into an agent in January for a bag of superphosphate, and be charged say 13/-, while another man who went in three or four days later would have to pay 3/6 more.  That is the sort of thing which has given rise to complaints that the Minister and the manure manufacturers are responsible for the position.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear this evening that in certain districts complaints have been reported as regards the purchasing and export regulations for eggs. <Col N="656" /> Such complaints may arise in certain places, but they certainly have not arisen in my part of the country, which is a very big egg producing district, and I believe we produce a good quality.  I know that as far as egg production is concerned in my part of the country the inspectors and every official in charge of the carrying out of the Act deserve the highest tribute for the way in which they do their duty. If you are not doing your work according to the regulations the inspector will make it very hard for you, but if you do your work my experience of the inspector and those acting with him is that they give you every facility and every assistance.  As far as the new system of dockets is concerned and the new regulation according to the Act which was changed about two years ago, it may be a bit hard.  In the beginning a number of shippers, exporters and egg buyers in general felt that those dockets and the new regulation would make it hard to keep within the bounds and to carry out the regulations, but my experience of it&mdash;and it is the experience of a number of egg buyers&mdash;is that it has worked out all right and that there is very little difference.  It has one great effect. Before the new system was introduced the responsibility for buying, exporting storing and carrying out everything connected with the Act was placed on the exporter, but since the Act was changed the responsibility is put on everybody, from the producer to the licensed retail egg buyer, and the licensed wholesale egg buyer.  It placed responsibility on all for doing the thing right or not doing it at all. I do not think that anybody who does his work right and carries out the regulation, which I believe is not difficult to carry out&mdash;and who complies with the Act, has any complaint.  I am certainly satisfied as far as the officials in my district are concerned. I pay them the highest tribute for the way they do their duty.</P>
    <P>There is one complaint I wish to make in regard to the production of eggs.  I believe that the Minister should have curtailed the sale of fowl <Col N="657" /> for the last three or four months, or that something should have been done. I may be told that they were all old fowl that were sold.  I question that. I believe, and I am told with authority, that a big number of egg-producing fowl were sold.  Of course, the prices were fairly good, but at the same time it would be serious if the egg production of this country disappeared.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I would like the Minister to make inquiries. I do not know the reason, but I believe that egg production is falling very early this year.  May was always a good month for the production of eggs.  The production in the month of May this year seems to be dropping more than is normal.  I have noted specially that the first-class quality egg seems to have gone off very much for the last fortnight. I believe that is serious. There is something wrong when the first-class quality egg is disappearing from the market.  There is some reason for it.  It may be that the better-class fowl is not there or it may be that food for fowl feeding is not up to the quantity required.  There is some reason why the first-grade egg is disappearing. As far as my part of the country is concerned, the number of &ldquo;specials&rdquo; is down to about half, while the quantity of &ldquo;standards&rdquo; has doubled.  I feel that is a serious situation.  The first-class quality egg of this country keeps the Irish egg in front of any other egg in competition on the export market.</P>
    <P>I believe that unless the Minister goes keenly into egg production and poultry keeping in general&mdash;and the same thing applies to pigs and bacon&mdash;you will see a terrible shortage of eggs and possibly a terrible shortage of bacon this winter.  I do not believe there will be any eggs for export.  It is possible that if things go on as they are at the moment there may not be sufficient eggs for home consumption.  That is a thing that should not be neglected until the winter.  I think the Minister should get his inspectors and everybody connected with this matter to find out if egg production is going to keep up to a steady level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> Another thing that has been mentioned by a number of Deputies is turf production.  I would suggest to the Minister that in districts where the people live in the bog areas mainly, for example, north County Mayo, where a huge part of it is bog, and where a big number of very poor families live in those areas&mdash;they may go away from time to time to earn something and come back for Christmas&mdash;the turf production should be left in the hands of those people who more or less own the bogs and that every assistance and help should be given to those people to produce the turf.  I believe they are the best people to produce it.  They know how to cut turf and how to handle and stack it and prepare it for the market.  They should get every assistance possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Deputies mentioned turf on the debate and that is why I mentioned it.  I am not satisfied either that the Minister is severe enough on the Minister for Finance. I believe the Minister for Agriculture should be more severe on the Minister for Finance, and should call on the Minister for Finance to put more money into agriculture, and to put more money at his disposal.  I feel the Minister for Agriculture is doing his best and would be anxious to do the best he could for everybody, yet, I think he should be more severe on the Minister for Finance, and should call on him in the same way as the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think he should not take these things as easily as he does.  There is one thing he should not have allowed the Minister for Finance to get away with.  He should have insisted on the Minister for Finance doing something for the rural people.  I do not know if I should mention it on this debate, but I do not agree with differentiating between dependants of widows and old age pensioners in the rural areas.  I think the Minister for Agriculture should not have allowed that differentiation. <Col N="659" /> There should have been a flat rate for all sections in the rural, urban and corporation districts.  There should be no differentiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, as far as the cattle trade is concerned, to make full provision for August, September and October, whereby there would be <Col N="660" /> some means of disposing of fat cattle, so that they would not be left on our hands when there would be no grass. I move to report progress.</P>
