      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will establish in the larger cities of Éire depôts from which supplies of coal, oatmeal, milk, fish and bacon can be purchased by the poor at prices which will permit of their securing sufficient supplies of nourishment for the maintenance of normal health.</P>

      <P>Special measures for assistance to certain sections of the community if employment should become more adversely affected are being considered.

      <P>I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he is going to take any steps to ensure that persons <Col N="1772" /> who are rendered destitute, or threatened with hunger, will get supplies of coal, oatmeal, milk, fish and bacon, and I now add in my supplementary, potatoes and sugar, at prices they can afford to pay next winter, and the Parliamentary Secretary says that it is the subject of bureaucratic discussion between several Departments. I am now asking: whatever bureancratic obstacles may be put in the way, can Oireachtas Eireann be satisfied that, ultimately, he will see that the people get these things?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Sheet Glass Supplies.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether any complaints of overcharging for sheet glass have been received by his Department during the past six months; if so, the number of such complaints received, and if he will state the names of the persons or firms against which well-founded complaints were made and what action was taken by him on such complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Four complaints have been received in my Department during the past six months regarding the prices charged for sheet glass.  In two of these cases <Col N="1774" /> it was found that the prices charged were excessive.  A refund of the overcharge has been obtained in one of the cases and the other is being pursued with a view to obtaining a refund. The other two cases were recently received and are still under investigation.</P>
      <P>I have given careful consideration to the Deputy's request for the publication of the names of the firms concerned in the cases where it was found that the prices charged were excessive. In certain cases and circumstances, publicity of this character may be desirable and necessary, but it is not so in all cases, and I am unable to commit myself to the publication of the names of firms involved in such cases, irrespective of the circumstances.</P>
      <P>With reference to the two cases mentioned above, one of the firms refunded the amount of the overcharge, and as I am satisfied that this firm is not making excessive profits on its total trade, I do not propose to take further action in the matter.  In the case of the other firm, if it should fail to take prompt action on the lines indicated to it by my Department, I will consider what further steps it is necessary to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it a proper way of dealing with profiteering and overcharging merely to require the profiteer to hand back ill-gotten gains?  Would the Minister not consider it very much better public policy to institute prosecutions in these cases, so as to show the public that there is somebody at least looking after their interests and that those who engage in profiteering in a war situation will at least be exposed as profiteers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question is in the negative and, to the second part, in the affirmative.  I think the circumstances of each case must be considered separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it unfair that a poor coal hawker should be prosecuted for <Col N="1775" /> giving short weight by a pound or half pound in the case of a large quantity of goods, while wealthy firms can apparently have the matter adjusted by making a refund.  There appears to be one law for poor street hawkers and traders and small shop-keepers and another for wealthy glass-selling people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, when the Government agreed with the British Government to purchase all the tea required in this country through the British Tea Control, there were other sources of supply and purchase open to the Government; If the arrangement to supply this country with 100 per cent. of normal purchases of tea was, when made, expressed to be binding for any specified period, and, if so, for what period; if any stipulation was made with or suggested to the British Government that in the event of shipments to the British Tea Control fluctuating or decreasing this country would receive the same percentage of normal supplies as Great Britain or if any fixed relationship was to hold between the allotments of tea to this country and to Britain; if representations have since 4th April been made to the British Government in connection with the reductions since mid-January of tea supplies successively to 75 per cent., 50 per cent., and 25 per cent. of normal purchases, and, if so, with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement to which the Deputy refers was an informal one.  Before it was concluded the bulk of the tea requirements of this country was being provided by the Tea Control of the British Ministry of <Col N="1776" /> Food, as this portion of the supply was ordinarily obtained through London agencies.  When the agreement regarding the balance of the requirement was made, other sources of supply and purchases were open.  Even at that time it appeared likely, however, that these other sources would not continue to be available, either because of an extension in the area of war operations or through lack of shipping facilities from the countries of origin.  In the event, almost immediately after the agreement one source of supply was cut off and the difficulties in regard to shipping from the other sources were substantially increased.</P>
      <P>The arrangement with the British Ministry of Food was made following an intimation from them that they were prepared to make themselves responsible for meeting all the tea needs of this country.  Discussion proceeded on the assumption on both sides that our tea supplies would not be restricted below normal.  There was no stipulation that, in the event of shipments to the British Tea Control fluctuating or decreasing, this country would receive the same percentage of supplies as Great Britain, or as to any fixed relationship between the allotments of tea to this country and those to Great Britain.  In July, 1940, after the introduction of rationing in Great Britain, I was informed by the Ministry of Food that it was not proposed to apply to the supplies to this country the reduction then being made in Great Britain, and I was notified that, for the present at any rate, this country would continue to receive allocations on the basis of 100 per cent. of our normal requirements.  No notification of intention to make a reduction in the 100 per cent. basis of allocation was received until the 18th January, 1941.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, numerous representations to and discussions with the British Ministry of Food have taken place since the reduction in allocations to this country began, and I am now satisfied that there is no course open to us which will increase, for the present, allocations of tea through that channel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there, in the Minister's view, no prospect of our getting more than 25 per cent. of our tea imports from Britain in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not point out to the British Government that they are getting valuable foodstuffs from us, and that they should reciprocate by giving us a fair allocation of tea, particularly in view of their early promise to supply our full requirements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider allowing tea to be distributed on <Col N="1778" /> the basis of the one ounce ration inasmuch as the distribution of tea on the basis of a half-ounce ration is making such supplies of tea as we have quite useless, and imposing an intolerable hardship on country people who have to come into town to purchase tea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that would be a wise course to adopt, but I am also satisfied that we cannot discuss this question by way of question and answer at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will give the statistical information as to imports of tea in the year 1940 with reference to his statement in the Dáil on the 4th April that (a) up to January, 1941, we were getting 100 per cent. our normal purchases of tea, and that (b) the quantity of tea imported and sold last year was substantially less than the quantity which we were entitled to get from the British Tea Control under our arrangement with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided that it is not at present in the public interest to publish figures of this country's import trade.</P>
      <P>The statement quoted by the Deputy at (a) in his question relates to the arrangement with the British Ministry of Food, under which allocations of tea by that Ministry to this country were to have been made on the basis of 100 per cent. of our normal supplies during the period from April, 1940, until notification of the intention to reduce the rate of allocation was given by letter received on the 18th January, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year referred to in the statement quoted by the Deputy at (b) in his question was that which ended on the 28th February last, and in that year the quantity of tea imported was substantially below the quantity which we should have received from the British Ministry of Food under the arrangement for allocation on the basis of 100 per cent. of normal supplies.  The Deputy will observe that I said that the amount of tea distributed in the 11 months ending 28th February, 1941, <Col N="1779" /> was 21,366,000 lbs.; this was actually more than the amount imported in the period of 12 months ending on the same date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if the warning issued by his Department on 19th April with the statement that there is only enough wheat and flour in the country to carry on for the next few months denotes any worsening of the wheat and flour position since April 4th; if a loaf of wheat and other cereals has been decided upon and is soon to be on sale to the public; and if the procuring of the extra supplies of other cereals so necessitated has been successfully attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no worsening of the wheat and flour position and provided the public co-operate by responding to my appeals for economy in the use of flour and bread, I do not anticipate that, during the present cereal year, it will be necessary to alter the composition of the loaf as at present on sale.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether he is aware that in spite of various assurances given by him that arrangements had been put into force to ensure that those in Dublin who supplied the poorer sections of the people with coal would get their full <Col N="1780" /> normal requirements, the bellmen and the smaller distributors of coal in the city have been unable to get their normal requirements, and have been suffering the gravest hardships in getting such supplies as they get; and if he will state (1) whether he has made any examination of the conditions under which these distributors are supplied, and the smallness of the actual supplies received by them; (2) what has been the cause of the dislocation and hardship; (3) what he has done to eliminate the hardship; and (4) what he has done to maintain the full normal requirements of these distributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the bellmen and other smaller distributors of coal in Dublin, who ordinarily serve the poorer sections of the people, have failed to get normal requirements to serve these people.  On the contrary, I am satisfied that bellmen and other smaller distributors have been supplied with substantially more than the normal requirements of the poorer sections of the people and that some dislocation occurred owing to the withdrawal by bellmen from the central dumps, which were specially established to supply the needs of the poorer people, of supplies of coal for sale to their larger customers.</P>
      <P>The position has been examined by officers of my Department in consultation with the Dublin coal merchants, who are co-operating with my Department in the matter, and certain measures have been taken which, it is hoped, will remove the grounds for complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the quantity of coal supplied from the dumps is larger than the quantity these bellmen ordinarily sold and that <Col N="1781" /> if there is any difficulty on the part of the poorer sections of the population getting supplies of that coal it is due to the fact that some bellmen instead of selling it to the poorer people are selling to the wealthier residents of the city.</P>

      <P>Between the time in February last when the price of bellmen's coal was fixed and April 7th there was an average reduction in the c.i.f. cost of all types of coal shipped to Dublin of approximately 3/- per ton. The prices fluctuated up and down in that period, but the general tendency was downwards in price.  It was decided to give the major part of the benefit of the reduction in the price of all coal imported to the coal allocated to the bellmen's dumps, the price of which coal was in consequence reduced by 6/8.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No forecast can be given of the extent of the probable deficiency of imported coal during the coming year and no estimate, therefore, can be given at the moment as to the extent to which extra turf can be cut and saved to meet the deficiency of imported coal used for domestic purposes.  The extra turf can only be cut during the normal turf-cutting season which, dependent on weather conditions, extends from March to August.</P>
      <P>By Emergency Powers Order authority has been given to local authorities to acquire turf banks by agreement or compulsorily and with a further power:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to exercise turbary rights over the turf banks so acquired, and</P>
      <P>(b) to let the bogs so acquired to any person for the purpose of cutting and saving turf for sale or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Simultaneously arrangements have been made with the Land Commission and the Turf Development Board to make available for the latter purpose during the coming season, at low rents, turf banks in their possession. The Turf Development Board is likewise taking steps to secure the maximum output of turf from the bogs under its control using for the purpose both mechanical and hand-cutting methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities in turf-producing areas and areas where turf is otherwise <Col N="1787" /> procurable are taking steps not only to meet their own requirements but to supplement supplies which are likely to be made available by private producers.  Furthermore, in counties where the conditions permit large-scale schemes of turf production, founded on the use of those staffs and organisation of the county surveyors, are being put into operation.  In one case at least contracts have been offered by the local authority to all turf cutters to take all the turf they are prepared to produce at terms stated.  Similar schemes are in contemplation elsewhere.  There is every reason to believe that this action by the local authorities will prove effective in increasing substantially future turf supplies.</P>
    <P>So far as parish councils are concerned, approaches have been made, both by circular letter and otherwise, urging each council, particularly in turf-cutting areas, to ensure that sufficient turf will be available for the requirements of the parish during next winter.  The duty has been laid on the councils of securing that every cutter in the parish was employed, that every face bank was utilised, and that at least two crops were cut from every face bank this season.  Generally, it was conveyed to parish councils that they would be expected to focus local effort on increased turf production and bring home, in whatever way the council thought best, the necessity for each parish in or near bog areas to harness individual and local effort generally.</P>
    <P>In order to remove any doubts from the minds of turf cutters that a situation might arise later in the season that their surplus turf might not be purchased, assurance has been publicly given and widely announced by advertisement and otherwise that the Government ensure a market for all surplus turf of good quality offered for sale.  This should remove any fear on the part of turf cutters that their product might not be disposed of.  Coal merchants and factory owners throughout certain parts of the country have <Col N="1788" /> been approached individually with an intimation that a serious shortage of imported fuel is anticipated and that, in consequence, each merchant and each factory owner should contract with turf cutters in their locality to cut sufficient fuel to meet their requirements.  Factory owners have been urged to make immediately such constructional alterations as may be required to adapt their furnaces to the burning of turf.</P>
    <P>My statement should indicate that every effort which could be made by the Central Government to meet the anticipated fuel shortage has been made.  The issue of exercising the powers given rests with the local authorities.  The responsibility of each parish, as well as of each coal merchant and factory owner, has been made quite clear.  An assured market has been given to each turf cutter.  I must repeat, however, that the results of our effort will depend to a very large extent on local effort and the cooperation and initiative of all those affected in the turf-cutting districts. I feel confident that we can rely on them.</P>

Further, is the Minister in a position to give any indication as to what amount of the road transport will be available for the distribution of the turf?

      <P>Representations are from time to time received regarding delay in answering calls to the four official numbers referred to, and the matter has been under close observation for some time past.  So far as calls to &ldquo;0&rdquo;, &ldquo;30&rdquo; and &ldquo;31&rdquo; are concerned, such delay as occurs is due to general growth in traffic, arising from emergency conditions, for which the equipment in the Crown Alley exchange is not wholly adequate at peak periods. The equipment cannot be supplemented on account of the exhaustion of accommodation in the exchange, but the position will be remedied when the new exchange in Exchequer Street, now in course of construction, is ready for service.  In regard to calls for &ldquo;39&rdquo;, trouble is now only experienced when the traffic is particularly heavy. Changes in operating procedure involving an increase of staff lately introduced have resulted in more expeditious answering, and the service on the whole is now reasonably satisfactory.</P>

On a former occasion, the Minister's predecessor&mdash;the present Minister for Justice &mdash;laid down that 15 minutes was a reasonable period of delay in the case of a trunk call.  That dictum had a very salutary effect when I think of how often the bell had to be rung before the Post Office answered &ldquo;0, 30 or 31.&rdquo;  On more occasions than one, it had to be rung 21 times before the officials answered me.  If the Minister would say that it should not be <Col N="1794" /> rung more than ten times or eight times, then we would have some grounds to make specific complaints when, on several occasions, the operators had failed to respond within the time limit set by him.

      <P>Having dealt with most of the points raised by various speakers last night, I do not intend to detain the House very long.  There are just one or two matters to which I wish to draw attention.  Several speakers on Opposition benches have directed attention to what they described as the reduction in the Estimate year by year.  I would like to emphasise that the amount of money being expended in the Gaeltacht is not being reduced. The gross expenditure&mdash;that is, the actual money being expended in the Gaeltacht&mdash;has been increased from year to year, as the following figures will prove.  In 1937-38 the gross expenditure was £126,527; in 1938-39, £143,427; in 1939-40, £177,786; in 1940-41, £212,487; and the current estimate is for £242,068.  That shows a progressive increase year by year and not a reduction, as has been alleged by speakers on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Book of Estimates give in that case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would examine the Book of Estimates more closely he would not need to put that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I see under &ldquo;Gaeltacht Services&rdquo; a decrease from £100,000 down to £96,000 and then down to £88,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy overlooked the facts which I will give the House in a few minutes, if he will allow me to proceed.  There have been increased receipts and on that account it is not necessary to bring in an increased Estimate, not only to maintain <Col N="1796" /> the services but to increase them. Our gross sales of tweed, knitwear, toys, etc., have shown a corresponding increase.  In 1936-37 the sales were £32,028; in 1937-38, £39,229; in 1938-39, £46,382; in 1939-40, £84,151; in 1940-41, £134,408; and for the current year, £155,000 is estimated as likely to be received.  Again, there is a progressive increase, if we take these items separately.</P>
      <P>On the question of tweeds, some Deputies referred to the improvement in quality.  There has been no improvement in the quality of the tweeds.  No improvement was possible, as the tweeds are now and always have been manufactured of absolutely pure wool, and it is impossible to improve the quality of wool.  That being so, there has been no improvement in quality: what has been improved is the design, the patterns, workmanship and anything that could be improved by human endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wool is wool: that is not a very safe thesis in the drapery trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a complaint that the range of patterns was not varied enough.  Despite certain limitations and difficulties, 27 new ranges have been added this year, involving 378 shades; and that, in my opinion, ought to satisfy even the most fastidious tastes.  Our sales of tweeds have been very satisfactory.  For the past five years they were £13,360, £15,020, £14,457, £28,391, and for the year just ended, £45,400.  That again shows a progressive increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to knitwear, the sales have gone up from £17,079 in 1936-37 to £62,800 in 1940-41.  I next come to toys. This is another important and new section of the industry.  As I have already explained to the House, the factory in which the toy industry was first established was burned down some time ago and it became necessary to erect a new one in its place.  That was done in probably a record time by our own staff.  It was done in the course of about six months, and a few days ago we entered into possession.  The sales of toys have been very satisfactory. The first year for which there is <Col N="1797" /> a record was the year 1938-39&mdash;the opening year&mdash;when the sales were £2,905. In 1939-40, sales went up to £10,488, and in the year 1940-41, they reached £24,600.  That is a very valuable addition to our industries.  Perhaps the most satisfactory aspect of it is that a foreign market is being developed for these toys and that, I think, ought to satisfy Deputy Linehan on the question of price.  If our prices were not satisfactory these markets would not be available to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question straight away.  The price of the toys is made up of labour costs, the cost of materials and a certain percentage added to cover overheads; but in our peculiar system of bookkeeping it would not be very easy for me to answer straight away whether this particular section of the industry is making a profit or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it is not being overlooked. The next important item I have to deal with is one which was subject to considerable discussion last night&mdash;the question of seaweed and kelp.  Deputies, particularly those representing maritime constituencies, are aware that a large quantity of seaweed is used every year by farmers as what I may describe as a substitute for farmyard manure, and this weed is considered <Col N="1798" /> by the Department of Agriculture as equal to farmyard manure.</P>
      <P>Because of its bulky nature and its weight it cannot be transported over long distances inland.  The cost of transport would kill it straight away. Some Deputies pointed out that some 25 years ago or so larger quantities of it were used, and they were anxious to ascertain what could be done by way of transport now.  I think 25 or 30 years ago very few of us were thinking in terms of motor cars or motor transport. People were able to transport it then. The roads are at least as good now as they were then.  The question of transport is in no worse position to-day than it ever was.</P>
      <P>Seaweed is also being used for other purposes.  In recent years two new firms have come into the industry, one at Ballina and, more recently, one at Kilrush.  These firms are taking considerable quantities of seaweed and drying it and I understand it is being used as an admixture in cattle food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question on which there was most discussion last night is the question of kelp, the production of kelp and its use as a fertiliser.  Many years ago, when the factory was in operation in Galway iodine was being extracted from kelp.  Unfortunately, owing to competition from Chilean Nitrates Syndicate, that factory was unable to remain in production.  The owners were driven out of business because of the drop in the price of iodine.  That being so, kelp must now be used mainly as an admixture in manure because of its potash content.  The Irish Fertiliser Manufacturers' Association made an offer of £3 16s. 6d. a ton for kelp, having regard to its potash content of from 16 to 18 per cent., but my Department has entered into an agreement on much more satisfactory terms with a certain firm in the West of Ireland.  In accordance with the terms of that agreement all the kelp produced will be utilised.  It will be taken from the producers at what may be considered a reasonable price, having regard to the use to which it is to be put, that is, for the manufacture of manures, and the price which the farmers can afford to pay for it.  Incidentally, <Col N="1799" /> on that subject, I think it was Deputy Childers who asked a question as to what it would be likely to cost at Athlone.  Having regard to the cost of production, transport, etc.&mdash;and incidentally, I take it, the firm concerned would expect a reasonable margin of profit&mdash;by the time it would reach Athlone the selling price would probably be in the neighbourhood of £9 to £10 per ton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>For what percentage of potash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely hypothetical inasmuch as I am not aware that the firm has sold any kelp to Athlone for that purpose, but I take it they would be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  I thought he referred to profit. Sixteen to 18 per cent. would be the potash content.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary happen to know&mdash;it may well be he does not&mdash;is it in the form of muriate or sulphate of potash?  That is a matter the Parliamentary Secretary may not know at the moment.  It is a technical point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to inform the Deputy on that technical subject.  I do not think there is anything to add on the question of potash except to say, as I told the House last night, this matter was the subject of a conference on the 28th November, 1939, something more than 18 months ago, so that we did not wait until last night to have the matter examined.  Deputy Brodrick was anxious when I began to-day to ascertain why the Book of Estimates does not show an increase this year. The Appropriations-in-Aid would be the answer.  They have been growing. I will give the figures for the past few years as an indication.  In 1937-38, the Appropriations-in-Aid were £40,574; in <Col N="1800" /> 1938-39, £51,738; in 1939-40, £75,594; in 1940-41, £131,220, and this year, we estimate £153,600.  These were the receipts, as the Deputy may know, from the sales of the various commodities and the more these are increased the less necessity there is to draw upon the Estimate.  In addition, I am afraid Deputies are inclined to forget that mine is not the only Department dealing with the Gaeltacht. Practically every other Department of State has dealings there.  I will give some figures which will illustrate to the House the amount of money that is being expended in the Gaeltacht in addition to the amount provided by Gaeltacht Services: The Department of Education expends £72,365 in the Gaeltacht; the Department of Agriculture, £145,960; the Land Commission, £221,070; the Office of Public Works, £201,276; the Department of Industry and Commerce, £172,674.  In addition, there is, of course, the Department of Local Government and Public Health which expends a very large sum in old age pensions which has been roughly estimated at something over £1,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have said sufficient to indicate to the House that the interests of the Gaeltacht are not being neglected or overlooked.  I think, on the whole, the industries are showing a very happy trend.  In recent years there has been an interesting development, and I doubt very much, despite all the criticisms that may be levelled at Government Departments&mdash;and sometimes I am as sharp a critic as anybody else in that respect&mdash;despite the many handicaps under which the Department obviously has to labour, there has been satisfactory progress shown during the past few years, particularly since the industries were reorganised by my predecessor some five or six years ago. Our business has been growing.  New industries are being examined.  At least, the prospects of having new industries established are being carefully examined, and everything that can be done is being done to induce people who would be interested or who might be interested to establish new industries in the Gaeltacht.  We go out of our way to make arrangements with <Col N="1801" /> any such firms who might be interested. I think I have covered every point raised by the various speakers.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a question in regard to toys.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary was labouring under a misconception as to what I meant last night.  I did not question the wholesale price.  I questioned the retail price.  First of all, I want to put two questions to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Does he really consider the toy trade is a luxury trade, because I think it is not?  It could not be called a luxury trade because the poorer people in the community will buy toys at Christmas as well as everybody else. I questioned the retail price, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate it.  I am satisfied the Gaeltacht people are charging a proper wholesale price.  I would also ask the Parliamentary Secretary is it a fair price to charge 6/6 for a rag doll, stuffed with sawdust, 15 inches high, with a <i>papier maché</i> face?</P>

      <P>All toys made by my Department are branded &ldquo;Erris Toys&rdquo;.  I am glad the Deputy has drawn my attention to that, so that it may go forth and that the general public will know Gaeltacht products, because they are all branded &ldquo;Erris Toys&rdquo;, and any toy carrying that brand should be sold at a reasonable figure.  In my opinion, they are being sold too cheaply, and, as I indicated last night, I would much prefer to see the toys perhaps a little dearer, but to ensure that the profit would go to the workers who are manufacturing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not go in for a very cheap toy. <Col N="1802" /> That is, perhaps, a side of the industry which will have to be considered. There are very cheap toys on sale, some of them imported from outside, perhaps, and we shall have that matter considered with a view to seeing whether or not a small cheap toy can be put on the market.  With regard to the question of whether a toy is a luxury or not, I think that in these days anything that is not essential to support human life or to maintain us, is really a luxury, so that from that point of view toys may be regarded as a luxury.  In saying that, however, I do not want to argue that the price of toys should soar to such an extent as to be beyond the reach of a poor child who, perhaps, has more need of toys than the children of wealthy people.  I should be long sorry to see the children of the poor deprived of their toys which, as I say, would be probably a greater source of delight to them than to the children of the rich.  At any rate, the question of the production of a cheaper toy, which could be sold at 6d. or something like that is being examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be permitted to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a couple of questions.  First, I should like to say that if such vast profits are being made on the Gaeltacht toys, then the Parliamentary Secretary should provide for an extra supply, because thousands of merchants will romp into the Gaeltacht if they think they can gain these immense profits.  However, I never saw these immense profits lasting very long.  I must say that I think this textile business has improved out of all knowledge, and the officers of his Department, in my opinion, who were responsible for the design and production of textiles are deserving of high praise. Will the Parliamentary Secretary, however, be a little more careful in future, in speaking of wool being wool, because there are all sorts and qualities of wool, and one of the things which has made his textile business so much more successful is that the quality of the wool employed has been materially improved in the last few years. Secondly, would the Parliamentary <Col N="1803" /> Secretary not consider communicating to the House, at regular intervals, the profits and losses on this industry? That is a very important matter when one comes to determine the value of a business.  I do not think the House would be desperately shocked to hear of a small loss being made in one year if we could be assured that we were making a profit over the whole period. I think we would be gratified to hear of any profit at all, because, admittedly, under the conditions under which the enterprise is being carried on, modern efficiency is not the first desideratum but rather the desire to provide work for the people in these areas.  We should not lose sight, however, of the profit and loss of the enterprise because, otherwise, we might get into very deep water as, I think, we did in the past.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to say something in regard to the kelp potash which was referred to.  Here is a manure which, by volume, contains 16 to 18 per cent. of potash.  Now, that is not as useful as sulphate of potash or muriate of potash which we employed pre-war, but it is very useful none the less, and particularly for the flax crop, the beet crop and the potato crop, in that order of importance.  It is a useful manure for every crop, but for these three particularly.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary going to get from the Department of Agriculture the £1 a ton bounty paid on this manure that is paid on manure manufactured from African phosphate rock? I ask that because I think he ought to. And I think the Parliamentary Secretary should tell us now what we may look forward to in regard to that matter and, secondly, what actual price is going to be paid to the men for the kelp they burn.  The all-important thing, if you want our people to produce something, is to tell them, positively and with certainty, what they are going to get.  There is no use in telling them that they will get a good price and that the kelp will all be taken from them.  You should tell them that on the day the kelp is burned they will be given a certain price at a certain place.</P>

      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the question of the carrageen industry in the Glenbeigh district of County Kerry.  About two years ago, officers of the Industrial Research Council made investigations and carried out experiments in that area and found that a certain type of weed growing on the rocks down there was poisonous. They allocated a small grant for the eradication of that type of weed from the rocks along that part of the coast, and rendered great service to the carrageen business there and to the industry in general.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would carry out further investigations in that direction with a view to further development and improvement of the industry in that district?</P>

      <P>In answer to the Deputy who has just sat down, and any <Col N="1805" /> other Deputies who may be interested, the kelp is being purchased by a well-known firm in the West of Ireland, which has been engaged for many years in the manufacture of manure, and I take it that whatever bounty is going will be carried with the potash made from kelp as well as the manure that is being made from phosphate rock, to which Deputy Dillon referred.  Now, we purchase all the kelp that can be manufactured.  By arrangement with this firm, the kelp, when purchased by us, is being re-sold to that firm and being utilised by them in the manufacture of fertilisers.  I could not, at the moment, say exactly what amount is likely to be produced this year.</P>

      <P>Well, perhaps, but even going on to the £6, I take it that the cost would be passed on to the consumer who is ultimately the Irish farmer, and his interests have to be had regard to when fixing a price.  I should like to correct an impression which might be created by Deputy Dillon's remarks about excessive profits. I do not think it is correct to describe the small margin of profit which appears in our accounts to cover overhead costs as excessive profits.  We are not out to make profits.  We have no interest whatever in making profits from these industries.  Our main object is to make money available for the people engaged in the industries. The goods have to be sold at a certain figure, otherwise they would not be sold at all.  If they are sold at a reasonable figure, there is no question of excessive profits.  The whole idea of establishing the Gaeltacht industries was inspired more by a desire to improve the social welfare <Col N="1806" /> of the people rather than to make profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to thank the Minister in regard to one particular aspect of his Department. It is connection with a matter which I raised on the Estimate last year and on the Estimate in 1939.  I am quite sure that the Minister will recollect it, and will not be aggravated because I raise the point again.  It is the question of his interpretation of the provisions of the Land Act of 1933 as regards the repayment of annuities, and my interpretation of it.  On the occasion of this Estimate last year I went as fully as I possibly could into <Col N="1810" /> my interpretation of the Land Act of 1933.  I contended that the Minister's Department were not carrying out the interpretation which the Government had put upon the Land Act of 1933 as regards the repayment of annuities and as regards the halving of the capital charge on the farmers.  The reason I say I wish to thank the Minister is that I gave the Minister very short notice on the occasion of the Estimate last year, and he went to the greatest possible trouble in looking up the point.  He was kind enough to write to me very voluminously on his interpretation of the Department's interpretation of the Act.  I must say he went to the greatest trouble and detail in explaining the point.  The only thing I regret is that, the Minister having gone to all that trouble to explain his interpretation or his Department's interpretation of the 1933 Act in that respect, we are as far away from agreeing as ever.  I am very much afraid that the real difficulty arises from the fact that, as far as even a legal interpretation of the 1933 Act is concerned, you will not get any two people to agree on an interpretation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My whole point is this, and I think I made the Minister aware of it last year, that the Government interpretation of the Act showed that on the halving of the annuities the capital charge was halved.  That is one interpretation of the spirit, at any rate, if not the letter, of the 1933 Act.  It is the spirit and the letter of the 1933 Act as regards certain types of annuities. But the defence for the present interpretation is based entirely on the provisions of, I think, Section 22 of the Land Act, 1933.  When the Minister gave me his interpretation last year, I could quite see how he based his argument on the Act, but my difficulty is that his interpretation and his Department's interpretation are in direct contradiction of the entire policy both of the Government and of the Department over a period of years prior to the passage of the Land Act of 1933 and subsequent to it.  The difficulty is this, that even though they may be right in their technical interpretation of the reduction of the capital charge <Col N="1811" /> on the farmers they are definitely not right in their legal interpretation.  I contended last year that, if the repayment value of an annuity was £50 five minutes before the Land Act of 1933 was passed, the repayment value of the annuity should have been £25 five minutes after the Land Act of 1933 was passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I say that the Department officials and, we will say, the people who are dealing with the figures are not in agreement about the calculation.  That was my interpretation of the Minister's policy.  If that interpretation is correct, the Department is wrong.  Of course, I quite understand that where the little clause is in about an annuity containing a funding annuity a different question arises, but if the capital liability was halved on the passing of the 1933 Act the repayment value of the annuity after the passing of the Act should have been exactly half what it was immediately before the passing of the Act.  But that is the technical interpretation of it.  The normal way of looking at it is this, that if you or I or the Minister or anybody else is buying a farm we will naturally assess the price we will pay for it on the value of the farm free from incumbrances.  The position at the moment is that if the farm was purchased in 1903, the advance on that farm being £1,000 and the annuity roughly £20 a year, the annuity by the operation of the 1933 Act has been reduced to roughly half of £20, something in the neighbourhood of £10 a year, but as far as the Minister's examination or my examination of the incumbrances on the farm is concerned the land certificate on that farm still includes a charge for the full amount of the advance originally made under the particular Land Act, whether it was 1888 or down to 1933.  If the Minister is correct in the statement he gave to me, I think a very simple way of solving the difficulty&mdash;where it appears on the land certificate that a farm is <Col N="1812" /> subject to an annuity of so much until an advance of so much has been paid, and where the original advance still appears on the face of the documents of title&mdash;would be that a note should be entered on the land certificate and in the register that that liability does not exist, and that the correct liability which exists at the moment under the 1933 Act should be ascertained, so that it would be made quite clear to any purchaser of land or any person who may be asked to advance money on the security of a land certificate exactly what is the capital charge due to the State by the person who owns the land.</P>
      <P>I myself contend that the departmental interpretation of the halving of the annuities is entirely wrong.  I take one specific instance&mdash;a small figure and an easy figure to deal with&mdash; an annuity of roughly £5 per annum prior to the passing of the 1933 Act. This was a holding purchased under the 1903 Act.  The original advance was £131.  The repayment value of the annuity immediately prior to the passing of the Act of 1933 was £113.  If the declared policy of the Government as regards land annuities is correct, and if the interpretation stated time and again by various Ministers for Lands in this House is correct, if the annuity was £113 one second before the Land Act of 1933 was passed it should have been £56 10s. one second after the Land Act of 1933 was passed.</P>
      <P>But that is not the position.  The position as regards that particular annuity is that the figure which it would take to redeem that annuity at this present date, eight years after the passing of the Land Act, 1933, is far in excess of the sum of £56 10s. which I contend is the correct figure.  I would go further and say this, that when the figure was certified by the Minister's Department under the Land Act of 1933, the question of crediting the annual payments since the Land Act of 1933, should be dealt with on an entirely different basis from that on which it was dealt with prior to the Land Act of 1933.  The Minister will understand what I mean by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the Land Act of 1933, the land annuity was meeting a certain specific object.  A proportion, varying <Col N="1813" /> according to the number of years the annuity was being paid, was going in interest and the balance was going to the sinking fund.  The redemption value depended on the amount of the annuity going into the sinking fund in each year.  When we passed the Land Act of 1933, so far as the tenant purchaser was concerned, we wiped out any question of sinking fund and interest.  Under the 1933 Land Act the position is that any moneys collected by way of revised annuities are passed by the Minister for Lands to the Minister for Finance and put directly into the Exchequer.  The Minister cannot contend that the State is meeting the obligation to pay the interest, because the Government bought them out for £10,000,000.  If that is the position, there is no claim for interest outstanding, except one might be argued in so far as the sum of £10,000,000 is concerned. If I am paying an annuity of £20, every penny of that, I suggest, should be credited to me by way of capital reduction of the amount outstanding on my farm.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is no liability for interest.  The Minister has not taken over the liability to pay interest under the Acts prior to 1922.  Every annuity paid by a tenant purchaser where moneys were advanced under any Act prior to 1922 has been bought out for £10,000,000, and there is no liability on the Government to pay interest on the money advanced and neither should there be any liability on the tenant purchaser to pay any interest.  Even though we may decide that some liability should be on the tenant purchaser to pay off the £10,000,000, apart from that every penny that the tenant purchaser pays should be credited to him by way of reduction of his capital, and it should not be reduced on the old system of 4¾ for interest and ¼ for principal.  If this Act were to be interpreted properly, the Land Commission should alter their views; they should adopt the Government's interpretation of the Act.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I have written to the Deputies concerned informing them that I purpose ruling out of order amendments Nos. 1 to 6 inclusive, 8 to 22, 24 and 25, 30 and 31, 34, 40 to 43 inclusive, 49 to 51 inclusive, and 54 to 60 inclusive.  I had some doubt about 35, 36 and 37, but owing to the alterations that are being made and the proposed change in the definition of a time of war, I have decided to give Deputies the benefit of the doubt and allow the amendments to be considered.  I am also allowing two other amendments as being analogous to a provision in this Bill under Reference 10 and being ostensibly textual.  I am ruling out the amendments, since I am treating this as any other amending Bill and following the established procedure regarding such Bills, according to which amendments unrelated to the provisions already contained in the Bill are not allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little further clarification.  We have what purports to be an amending Bill&mdash; it calls itself such&mdash;and it is a Bill which brings more changes in the Constitution.  I suggest there is no principle whatsoever in this Bill.  I am putting it to you that there is no principle in the Bill beyond what is contained in the preamble.  There are quite a large number of amendments already in the Bill as it went through Second Reading.  There are amendments to 16 separate Articles in the Constitution.  Beyond the fact that these Articles are in the Constitution, there is no organic connection between them.  I see the difficulty of knowing precisely what we are to do with a Bill presented in this form; but, on the other hand, I understand the general rule on which our practice has been based is that amendments must not be out of touch, so to speak, with the principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad if you could inform me what is the principle of this Bill, beyond the purpose to make certain amendments in the Constitution which are dictated to us by experience.  I suggest that experience is not, as the Taoiseach might suggest, confined to <Col N="1815" /> Government Departments.  He based his desire on the fact that he had learned from various Government Departments that there were certain things that did not work smoothly or satisfactorily, and he wanted to change these while he still had some respite from a Referendum on amendments, no matter how trivial.  The experience of other members of the House is at least as important.  We all have had experience of the methods adopted in the Seanad election.  I will take that as an example, but I am not going to discuss it under the guise of asking you to consider this.  My experience is that, in an attempt to draw up a satisfactory Seanad, we were shackled unnecessarily by the restrictions imposed upon us in the Constitution.  My suggestion is that an amendment of that particular matter is much more strongly dictated by personal experience than by some of the amendments, trivial or important, that are already down.</P>
    <P>You have 16 Articles of the Constitution being amended.  I am not prepared to discuss what amendment is important and what is not.  I take it that in this so-called important document every amendment ought to be important.  It is, so to speak, the basis of the whole nation.  Though I confess I do not know what it means as a result of various interpretations given to it in the courts and elsewhere, I must accept it as a fundamental document.  I put it that now that as the Taoiseach is availing of his last chance of quietly amending this measure, a similar latitude should be given to members of the House.  I do not think there would be an unnecessary strain on the rules. When there is no principle in the Bill, I do not see why our amendments should not be considered.  Otherwise your ruling, Sir, would practically confine our amendments to the amendments proposed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Taking your ruling as to the nature and the number of our amendments, that you feel compelled to rule out of order, I confess I do not see how the change from 60 days to &ldquo;sixtieth&rdquo; affects the matter.  There are other <Col N="1816" /> amendments of a similar character in the Bill.  There are amendments almost as important&mdash;for instance, an extension of &ldquo;in time of war&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Army&rdquo; and &ldquo;the cessation of the war&rdquo;.  They are much more dangerous than the useful amendments my colleague and I put down.  Therefore I ask you to reconsider the matter on the ground that there are only two ways of getting at what is the general principle of the Bill. One is to find no principle whatever in the Bill.  The only other way is to go to the Title and Preamble: &ldquo;And whereas experience has shown that certain amendments of the Constitution are desirable.&rdquo;  I agree.  It was on that invitation my colleagues and I troubled to put down amendments.</P>

      <P>As regards the principle of the Bill the Deputy seems to contend that it is an omnibus measure.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the exceptional character of this Bill I have given long and careful consideration to the matter.  Though from the mere number of clauses or references in the measure and the number of Articles of the Constitution affected it might be styled an omnibus Bill, it is not such in essence.  We have had similar amending measures affecting, for instance, the land code and the local government code.  In those cases, some going back many years, amendments were disallowed as being outside the scope.</P>
      <P>That is the norm by which I have been guided.  The principle of the Bill is to be gathered not from the title and preamble alone, but from the scope of the Bill.  The Bill contains only two clauses of a fundamental nature.  I do not imagine that the Deputy was serious in his contention that many of the alterations proposed in the Bill are radical or fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confirmed in my opinion by the tenor of the Second Reading debate, on which it was stated that the majority of the proposals are trivial <Col N="1817" /> and that not more than two are fundamental.  Some half a dozen of them would merely improve the Irish text.  Many others are proposed for clarification or to secure closer conformity between both texts.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that such an amending Bill does not throw open the whole Constitution for amendment.  It could not be reasonably contended, for example, that a proposed minor verbal alteration in the Irish text entitles Deputies to endeavour to make fundamental alterations in the Article concerned; nor would it be reasonable, or in accordance with established procedure to move amendments radically affecting the powers and privileges of the Uachtarán, the electorate for and the method of his election, the method of election and the constitution of the Seanad or the abolition of the Referendum; matters which are not in any way affected by the proposals submitted to the Committee.</P>
    <P>I have therefore come to the definite conclusion that established procedure should be followed, and I am not prepared to allow the amendments in question.</P>

I find that difficult to understand.  Another thing that puzzles me is this: why it is that amendments are not put in in English as being translations of Irish rather than <i>vice versa.</i>  If there was any mistranslation it would be from the Irish to the English.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have an explanation of the different numbers.  I think the Taoiseach knows my inability to deal with the national language.  I therefore consulted a number of people as to that small change, and they consulted some dictionaries. My difficulty is that some people say there is no difference between the two words, while others say there is, and that the word &ldquo;cios&rdquo; is much more restrictive than &ldquo;revenues&rdquo;.  I am in the unfortunate position of not knowing whom we are <Col N="1819" /> to follow, and I may say that I am under the uneasy impression that, as the Irish text is to be the governing text in future, we shall be at the mercy not of what the House decides but of the official translator at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to this change is that the word &ldquo;fághaltas&rdquo; in Irish is regarded as having a wider meaning than was intended.  It would be regarded as including Appropriations-in-Aid.  Looking through the text, we find that a word with a more restrictive sense, that is, &ldquo;cíos&rdquo; occurs and the word &ldquo;cíos&rdquo;, therefore, is proposed to be substituted as a word which will give more directly the idea of revenues that come into the Central Fund and not in the sense of Appropriations-in-Aid. &ldquo;Fághaltas&rdquo; might be regarded as including Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>The other point is: how does it come about that the amendments are to the Irish and not to the English text?  Suppose the two texts disagree.  Surely it is the English text that ought to be amended to bring it into harmony with the fundamental text passed by the House and not <i>vice-versa.</i>  If it happened in one or two cases, we might say that the English text in this instance happens accidentally to convey our meaning, but when I see it happening in every instance, with all the amendments on one side and none on the other, I confess it puzzles me.  It might seem as if we had passed the English text and that the Irish text is a translation, which is something I find it extremely difficult to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I explained about these two texts originally is that they were prepared concurrently. There were certain ideas which had to be expressed in the form of a written document and these ideas were expressed both in Irish and in English. Nobody is going to suggest at the moment that there are not terms in English which, over a long period of time, have acquired very technical and definite meanings.  We have not got the same definitencess in regard to certain <Col N="1821" /> words in Irish, but we are gradually getting it through the series of Acts passed here and the translations made of these Acts.  We are gradually acquiring a technical meaning in law for certain words.  They are becoming more and more words of art in law, if you like.</P>
      <P>There was a question of expressing &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;fághaltas&rdquo; as meaning that which comes into the State and is secured by the State was used.  It would be a natural word for &ldquo;receipts&rdquo; or &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;, or what is got in, but as the word &ldquo;cíos&rdquo; has been used in the translations of statutes and in the document here in a more precise term-of-art sense, it was thought it would be an improvement and bring the words used in the Constitution more in conformity with the words used elsewhere in Acts of Parliament in regard to revenue.  That is really the point at issue.  What happened is that, when the State was established, a Translation Department was set up.  They had very few precedents to follow and they had to build up a legal phraseology for themselves slowly and bit by bit.  We have had the experience of a number of people working in that Department who know the work that has been done already and are acquainted with the precise terms used as terms of art in this matter.  The real point is that, in the opinion of those working on this over a period of years, the word &ldquo;fághaltas&rdquo; had better be substituted by the word &ldquo;cíos&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>With regard to reference No. 2, the point is that, in the original form of the Constitution, no provision was made for holding a fresh election for the office of President, in the event of the death or resignation of the President, or the establishment of his permanent incapacity, between the date of his election and the date of his entrance upon office.  The amendment provides for such a contingency. It is possible that, when the President had been elected, between the date of his election and his taking up office, he might die, resign or become permanently incapacitated, and the purpose of the amendment is to provide for that.  You have the phrase &ldquo;whether occurring before or after he enters upon his office&rdquo; and, in order to get that in the Irish text, it is necessary to take out one portion and insert another.</P>

    <P>In reference No. 3, the Irish text of Article 13 refers to communication <Col N="1823" /> by the President with the Oireachtas, which includes himself. In the Irish text, the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; was printed where it really should have been &ldquo;two Houses&rdquo;. Further, the use of the word &ldquo;chun&rdquo; suggests that the President is precluded from personally addressing the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The substitution of the words &ldquo;fá bhrághaid Tighthe&rdquo; is, accordingly, regarded as necessary. The use of the word &ldquo;teachtaireacht&rdquo; in the Irish version is regarded as implying that the President may not directly or personally address a message to the nation&mdash;for instance, by means of a wireless broadcast.  That is not intended and the substitution of the word &ldquo;aitheasc&rdquo; is recommended. That is giving the broad sense to &ldquo;message&rdquo; which you have in the English.</P>

      <P>Article 14 of the Constitution provides for the exercise of Presidential powers and functions in certain circumstances by a commission consisting of the Chief Justice, the Ceann Comhairle, and the Chairman of Seanad Eireann.  Under the present wording, it would appear that only those functions and powers which are conferred on the President directly by the Constitution may be exercised or performed by the commission.  It is necessary to amend the wording so as to ensure that the commission will be empowered to act in place of the President in respect of additional powers and functions conferred on the President by law.  The words &ldquo;by or under this Constitution&rdquo; are, accordingly, being substituted for &ldquo;by this Constitution&rdquo;.</P>

Here the Bill itself prescribes three days.  We want to say that it is unnecessary to wait three days, and we put down an amendment for the deletion of the words &ldquo;not earlier than five and&rdquo;, but we do not extend it at the other end.  Might I ask you, Sir, if you will be kind enough to explain to me how that particular amendment, namely, amendment No. 25, is not related to what is in the text of the Bill.

      <P>If I might explain. There is an amendment by the Deputy, I think, with reference to referenda.  If referenda did not exist then the need of delay would not be so great for a petition to be presented to the President and to enable him to consider that.  There is also the question of whether or not he would refer a Bill to the Supreme Court.  I do not know, of course, what was in the mind of the Ceann Comhairle.  It seems to me that he regarded it as consequential; that he decided that the amendment with reference to the deletion of referenda could not be accepted and it had to be ruled out of order, and, consequently, the other, which in a sense would be consequential upon it, would go with it, because it seems to me that he regarded it in a sense as consequential on the removal of referenda. In this No. 10 the real point is to give the President time for consideration and also to allow the necessary time for a petition under one of the Articles to be presented.</P>

      <P>In regard to reference No. 11, Article 25 (4) of the Constitution provides that every Bill signed by the President shall become law on the day on which it is signed and shall then come into operation unless the contrary intention appears. The section further provides, for the promulgation of Bills by the President, the enrolment of the signed texts in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court and the issue of official translations. No provision has been made, however, for the possibility of a Bill being passed in both the official languages.  The amendment deletes the existing Section 4 of Article 25 and substitutes a new section dealing with the same matters and, in addition, providing for the case in which a Bill is passed or deemed to have been passed in both Irish and English.  I think the only case in which we passed or considered any measure in Irish and English was that of the Constitution. But clearly that is a practice that might possibly grow, and this provides for the signature of both these texts and, in the case of a possible clash, or if there is any doubt, then the Irish text would prevail.</P>

      <P>That will only cause confusion.  Let us be clear on one point at a time.  If the Deputy wishes I will deal now with reference No. 11. The point is that English is the language that is chiefly used here since it is the language that the great majority of the members of the House understand and debate in.  Ordinarily, Bills are passed in English, and the English text is signed.  The only exception was in the case of the Constitution itself. That exception was made for a good reason.  As I have said, the English text is signed.  As soon as possible afterwards, an official translation is prepared by the Translation Department. That is issued with the Bill, but it is not contended that it should have priority as far as the texts are concerned.  It is a translation, pure and simple, and it is valuable from the point of view of the language.  One of the effects of doing that is that we have rapidly reached the position in which we have people who are now experts and have got well-defined terms and phrases in Irish in legal matters. It is preparing the way for the day on which it may be possible for this House to deal with these matters solely in Irish.  In the Constitution, as it stood, no provision was made for the possibility of having a Bill passed in both languages.  As I have said, the only exception to that was in the case of the Constitution itself.  When this amendment is made, you will have Bills passed in both languages.  It is quite <Col N="1830" /> possible, if there is a sufficient development of the language, that the text of a Bill would be passed in Irish alone. We are making provision here for the possibility of having the same Act passed in both languages.  If it is passed in both languages, then both texts will be signed, and, should there be a conflict, both will be authoritative texts, either of which can be appealed to.  If there should be a conflict between the two texts, then in that case, and in that case only, the Irish text would prevail.  That is what is being provided for in reference No. 11.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;5º As soon as may be after the signature and promulgation of a Bill as a law, the text of such law which was signed by the President or, where the President has signed the text of such law in each of the official languages, both the signed texts shall be enrolled for record in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and the text, or both the texts, so enrolled shall be conclusive evidence of the provisions of such law.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>I take it that what is involved there is the question of enrolment.  If the President signs one that is enrolled, and if he signs two they are enrolled.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment adds a new section to Article 25 providing for the preparation from time to time, under the Taoiseach's supervision, and the enrolment in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, <Col N="1831" /> of a revised text of the Constitution embodying all amendments made therein.  Some remarks that were made the last day would seem to suggest that there is a misunderstanding here.  The point is that you want to know what is the authoritative Constitution at a particular stage. Amendments to it have been passed, and you want to have a clean text, a text which will indicate what the Constitution is after it has been amended.  The function that is being given to the Taoiseach here is to see that such a clean text is prepared.  I am using the word &ldquo;clean&rdquo; in the sense that you will then have the Constitution as it appears after it has been amended.  That clean text, when prepared, will be a guarantee that it represents the Constitution as it is in force at a particular moment, with the amendments included.  It will be a guarantee that it is the text which is to be signed, first of all, by the President, and, as it will represent the law as it exists, when such amendments have been passed, the Chief Justice's is added as a further confirmatory signature.  From the remarks the last day it would seem to be suggested that the Taoiseach could somehow revise the Constitution.  That is not so.  This text must represent the Constitution as it is at the moment.  It was suggested that the Chief Justice should not be brought into legislation.  He is not being brought in.  The legislation actually has taken place, the necessary amendments have been passed through the House and the text is in definitely ascertainable language.  It is only a question of preparing that text, just as occurs when we pass a Bill in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has to prepare the text for enrolment from the time it is passed here until it is enrolled.  Of course, we could get a certain document and have it brought before the House as a final stage in legislation, when the House would be presented with the actual copy to be signed by the President, and that one single copy would be handed round to the members of the House for inspection or to a committee set up to make certain <Col N="1832" /> that the text represented what had been passed by the Oireachtas.  We do not do that at present: we assume that that work has been done properly, that the amendments have been properly inserted and that the text, as passed, is the text presented to the President for signature.  The suggestion that the Taoiseach could do something with it is exactly the same as the suggestion that after a measure is passed by both Houses it could be altered by somebody charged with its preparation for presentation to the President for signature.</P>
    <P>This deals with purely the preparation of a text and the guarantee that the text is the authoritative one, representing what was passed, is first of all the guarantee of the signature of the President, and then, secondly, the counter-signature of the Taoiseach, who would be aware of the changes made in the text.  He would take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that the copy presented for enrolment was precisely the Constitution as it stood at that date.  I feel that the amendments that have been proposed have been largely due to a misunderstanding as to what was intended or to a hasty reading of the present proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>He should not, and that is our contention.  It is quite obvious, by bringing him in, that the Taoiseach does envisage the possibility of somebody misusing his position&mdash;<Col N="1833" /> by mistake or deliberately&mdash;to produce the wrong text.  There is no guarantee, unless that is a reasonable possibility; as there cannot be a guarantee unless it is a guarantee against something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be something to be assured against if he is brought in, and that something is that the actual text might not correspond to the amendments.  In the ordinary law there is a certain safeguard, there is an amending Bill passed by this House on the one hand and the original Bill on the other hand. In the present instance, however, when the Taoiseach has finished the result is that neither of the Bills is left, but an amalgam of both.  We have no such procedure or precedent up to the present. Instead of having an Act and an amending Act, there is an Act and an amending Act which by somebody else&mdash;and not by this House&mdash;is amalgamated into one and then the Act and the amending Act pass out and the amalgam prepared by a person not under the control of the House takes their place.  To me that principle seems to be wrong.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as far as the language is concerned, I am not a lawyer and, therefore, I have to discuss what is here.  In the case of an ordinary Bill, it is sent up to the President by this House and if it does not in any way prove repugnant to the Constitution he must sign it.  Reading this section, there are two possibilities apparent to me.  Either the Chief Justice has a function or he has not, no more than the President has in signing an ordinary Bill.  If we are to follow the actual texts, he must sign, and the Chief Justice must countersign.  There is no suggestion that he must examine it.  So far as the actual wording is concerned, he is a mere rubber stamp. That is a reasonable meaning to take from the text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see, however, that that is what the Taoiseach meant.  He meant something else&mdash;that is, to see that a trick is not played on the House by whoever is Taoiseach.  That is the purpose of bringing in the Chief <Col N="1834" /> Justice.  There could be no other purpose, unless bringing him in is entirely gratuitous and, in that case, why bring him in?  If it is to give a guarantee to the Oireachtas, that guarantee must be against something and that something is, I say, the possibility of a trick being played on the Oireachtas by the Taoiseach.  The text says that the President shall sign it, and that the Taoiseach shall countersign it.  In the ordinary way, the President would sign any Bill put before him.  In the same way, the Chief Justice must countersign this, whether he believes in it or not.  That is one possible interpretation and there is no use in saying that it is not a possible interpretation.  I hope that, if that is not what the Taoiseach means, he will clarify it, and say: &ldquo;If he is satisfied that the text does represent the Acts, then he shall sign it and when so signed it shall become law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the ordinary words stand, it seems to me that he is a mere rubber stamp for the purpose of countersigning. If you take the other meaning, that he need not sign it&mdash;if he refuses to sign because he thinks the text does not represent the two Acts&mdash;then he is being brought in as a kind of watch on the Taoiseach.  I suggest that the normal way to get the full sanction of the Oireachtas is that it should come before the Oireachtas.  We are scrapping two Acts and putting the texts of two Acts, and something else, in their place.  I think that certainly should come before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised.  Perhaps I should take the last one first.  There seems to be a difficulty.  What is to come before the Oireachtas?  A single copy.  This is the thing that is going to be enrolled. It is passed from member to member, with the remark: &ldquo;Here you are.  This is the copy that is going to be signed by the President.  We are going to send this copy up.&rdquo;  Suppose that from the time the Oireachtas saw it to the time it got to the President it was changed, and the new copy was not in fact the copy handed around, but the copy presented for signature.  I do not think you can do it that way.  The thing is that the amendments will be: &ldquo;Delete <Col N="1835" /> such-and-such and insert in its place so-and-so.&rdquo;  The function given to the Taoiseach is to see that the deletion and the insertion are carried out, and that a clean text is prepared.  It is a text of what?  Of the Constitution as it is at the moment it has been passed.  It has already been passed and signed by the President.  The amendments have been signed by the President. They have become the law.  The Chief Justice is naturally brought in as a person to see does this text that he is going to countersign represent the constitutional position as it is at the moment.  In other words, he would take these two Acts that Deputy O'Sullivan has been talking about, the original Constitution on the one hand, and the amending Acts, and put them side by side, and see whether the deletions and the insertions were carried out, and that the text was a clean, proper and full text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot provide against every possibility. In fact, with the best will in the world, sometimes a mistake may come in and it is useful to have more than one person to check it before the thing is finished.  The Deputy has made a statement and I am wondering if it is true.  Certainly, if I happened to be President and I was presented with a copy of a text of a Bill which was different, if I had been following the legislation I would hold it up.  In all probability the President, if he were presented with a text which he saw was not the text of the Bill that had been passed, would certainly hold it up until he had got in touch with the Clerk of the Dáil or the Ceann Comhairle to find out what was the meaning of this.  Surely it is the Bill that is passed by the Dáil that he is supposed to sign.  He is not supposed to sign a spurious document.  I believe, in a case like this, if the Taoiseach prepared, or even by mistake, a spurious document eventuated somehow, that spurious document would really not be in accordance with the text here at all or with the provisions of the Constitution here at all.  I think it must be in fact the authoritative text and you want to have somebody responsible for its preparation, to supervise its preparation, and then, as a final check, <Col N="1836" /> you have the Chief Justice who is a man versed in the law and who would be able to see whether this text does represent the law as it is.  It occurred to me&mdash;I do not know whether it would help in any way&mdash;that it might be a further safeguard if you associated, perhaps, the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in the countersignature.  Another point raised by the Deputy, which I will look into, is whether our text leaves it discretionary for the Taoiseach or the Chief Justice to refuse their signatures.  I certainly think they should refuse their signatures if the text was not what it purported to be.</P>

I would like to examine it somewhat more carefully to see whether the discretionary power seems to be taken away, whether the &ldquo;shall&rdquo; there is imperative and whether, when the text is signed by the President, the others have got to countersign it or not. &ldquo;Shall be countersigned&rdquo; are the exact words there.  We may have to amend, that.  I am very glad that was pointed out because the intention was that when the text was signed that was taking with it the assurance of the signatories that the text was what it purported to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>For purposes of law, it is the text of a new Act because it is the thing that will be operative in the courts and will be decisive.  In the ordinary case we see what is being passed.  We do not see any complete text of this whole thing as it stands.  I do not want to see the actual copy of the thing that is signed but surely we get the text or what is a copy of the text of every Bill passed through this House by various stages. In this fundamental document, we do not get it.  The real thing that ultimately becomes the operative law will be the amalgam framed by people outside this House possibly under the supervision of the Taoiseach.  I put it to the Taoiseach that if he followed the ordinary practice in connection with the amendment of Bills and of the laws there would be no trouble at all.  Why are we departing from the ordinary practice?  There is an Act of Parliament and, so far as it affects the lives of the ordinary citizens, much more important, possibly, for them than the Constitution, but no effort is made that I know of, to get the Principal Act and several amending Acts and make a clean copy out of them.  It has never been done in that way so far as I know. This is completely revolutionary, and these are Acts that&mdash;I put it quite seriously,&mdash;no matter how important you might think the Constitution&mdash; affect the daily lives of the people much more intimately and much more often than the Constitution does, and yet there is no suggestion that we make a clean text of these, bringing in the Taoiseach and the President and the Chief Justice.  Why are we not following the ordinary practice here?  We have Acts passed by this House amending the Constitution. Leave it at that.  There is no justification for this new procedure that is being adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy, on a little reflection, will see that there is considerable justification for it.  As a matter of fact, we have been considering <Col N="1838" /> whether we should not get consolidation of a number of Acts of Parliament where we have amendments and amendments of those amendments, and so on.  We have had an example, as the Deputy knows, in the case of the university statutes.  Frequently when you have amendments of amendments it is extremely difficult to know exactly what is the existing position.  You almost want a lawyer to interpret it. You are getting perpetual consolidation. You are getting a clean text.  It is desirable that a person, who is not necessarily a lawyer, can see what is our Constitution at this moment.  He takes up the text, reads a clean, straightforward text.  That text had to be brought about in this way, that the amendments to delete so-and-so and insert so-and-so have to be passed here in the House as in the case of any ordinary Act, and the function of the Taoiseach is this, to see that the insertions are put in and the deletions are carried out, and that you do get the text as it is at the time.  Surely, the signature of the Chief Justice, who is apart from any political considerations or any, desire to treat the matter except from its purely legal aspect&mdash; and I am anxious that he should have discretion not to sign, unless it is the text&mdash;should be a guarantee that the work has been carried out as was directed by the Legislature in its Acts, and that this text, this actual document which is there, is the document in question.  I am quite prepared, if it will add to the assurance, that it should also be authenticated by the signatures of the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad at the time.  I think these signatures ought to be sufficient, but I do hold it would be a great advantage to have such consolidation, and if we could do it in the course of ordinary law&mdash; although it might be difficult&mdash;it would simplify considerably the position of the law because then, with regard to amendments to amendments, and so on, you would know what is the exact legal position.  The Constitution is supposed to be a popular document, in the sense that it was passed by the people, and, in regard to amendments to the Constitution, it is a document <Col N="1839" /> which the ordinary man in the street ought to be able to understand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ascertain the precise meaning of the two clauses here.  We have heard of the desirability of having a clean copy. The Taoiseach does not want, apparently, to have a thing of rags <Col N="1847" /> and tatters, so much talked about, presented to himself.  One can well understand from the background why he is so anxious about that.  The text that has been passed has to be revised by the Taoiseach.  Then it must be signed by the Uachtarán and, as the Constitution stands at the moment, it must be signed by the Chief Justice.  The whole initiative lies with the Taoiseach. When it goes in that form, even though it may be something that would excite the anxiety of the Uachtarán, if he has a right to be anxious about anything, and even if it is a text which the Uachtarán does not think is a conclusive text, still, once it is signed, it supersedes everything previously enacted.  Why not let the courts have the interpretation of the text?  There are people there accustomed to striking out passages and inserting substitutions. Let them have the authentic text as passed by the Oireachtas and not some revise that is done outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the object of the Taoiseach is to have a popular document that will be suitable for the ordinary man in the street.  I understand that is the main purpose. I suggest that purpose could be served without giving it any binding and legal force.  When the text goes to the court the judges and lawyers will give it careful consideration and a proper interpretation.  The man in the street will have what the Taoiseach might describe as a clean copy, and the judges and lawyers will deal with the text as passed by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I doubt that, but I will have a closer examination of it. Here is the text:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall be lawful for the Taoiseach, from time to time as occasion appears to him to require, to cause to be prepared under his supervision a text (in both the official languages)</P>
      <P>&mdash;because we are passing the Constitution in both languages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>of this Constitution as then in force having regard to all amendments theretofore made therein.</P>
      <P>What he has to have prepared is an authentic text of this Constitution as it is then in force, the amendments having been taken full account of&mdash;that is, the deletions and insertions properly carried out.</P>
      <P>A copy of every text so prepared shall be signed by the President and countersigned by the Taoiseach and the Chief Justice and, when so signed and countersigned, shall be enrolled for record in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Once the copy is prepared it has of necessity to be signed.  That was not the intention.  As I read it, it would appear to have the interpretation which has been put upon it by Deputies on the other side&mdash;that is, of necessity this would have to be signed.  That was not the intention.  The intention was that the signatures were to carry with them the assurance of the people who signed that the text was what it purported to be, namely an authentic copy of the Constitution as then in force.  I will have it examined to see if it can be amended to make the matter quite clear.</P>
      <P>The copy so signed, countersigned, and enrolled which is for the time being the latest text so prepared shall, upon such enrolment, be conclusive evidence of this Constitution and shall for that purpose supersede all texts of this Constitution of which copies were previously so enrolled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You might be dealing with a piece of legislation passed <Col N="1849" /> by one method.  Take what happened where the first amendment was passed only in English.  Supposing that happens again, it is lawful for the Taoiseach to prepare a new version of the Constitution, translate it into Irish in a Bill passed only in English, and then the Uachtarán and Chief Justice must sign that, and that becomes conclusive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>If we can get clear as to the intention, it will be a question then of expressing that in such a way that there will be no doubt.  I hold that is the wise thing to do.  The intention is that when amendments have been passed, with deletions, that it shall impose upon the Taoiseach a duty.  That is an assurance that the text does what it purports to do to the Constitution then in force.  Before each is enrolled and regarded as conclusive evidence of the text, it shall have to be signed by the Taoiseach on the one hand, and the Chief Justice on the other hand, and should have the signature of the President.  The question is at what stage the President's signature is to be obtained, whether it should not be properly signed by them as being authentic, and then signed by the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In endeavouring to carry out that, would the Taoiseach advert <Col N="1850" /> to this, that the language is rather odd?  All that is intended is to have a revised version without making a solitary change.  I suggest that the language is open to ambiguity.  The second question is whether it is clear that the Uachtarán, in addition to the Chief Justice, is to be given some discretion; or if it is intended that he is tied under the Constitution.  At times he is thrown on his own discretion, but when anything is said he must act on the advice of the Government.  If he was presented with a text that was flagrantly bad, and advised by the Government to sign, he must sign.</P>

It is clear that if there were a number of amendments as at present a clean text would be advisable.  After passing an amendment like this it would be advisable to have a clean text.

In practice, it frequently happens that a Bill is not presented to the President until a day or two after it has been passed, and the time for consideration of the question of a reference to the Supreme Court is thus unavoidably encroached upon.  In order to give the President the maximum time for consideration of the important question of a reference to the Supreme Court and to allow time for the convening of a meeting of the Council of State, it is proposed to extend the period to the seventh day after the date on which a Bill is presented to the President for signature.</P>

    <P>The object of the proposal in the Bill is to ensure that there shall be only one judgment delivered by the Supreme Court.  Article 26 provides that, on the reference of a Constitutional matter of this kind to the Supreme Court, the decision of the majority of the court is to be the decision of the court.  It is now proposed that there shall be only one judgment.  I recognise that the proposals in the Bill are in accordance <Col N="1854" /> with what actually happened in the Supreme Court on the occasion of the reference made some time ago, that, in fact, only one judgment was given, but it was announced by the Chief Justice, in delivering the judgment of the court, that the judgment of the court was the judgment of the majority.  That, of course, was in accordance with the provisions of Article 26, but it gave rise to a considerable amount of speculation as to whether or not the judgment of the court was, in fact, unanimous, and I think that most of the speculation developed rather into certainty that there was one or perhaps two of the judges of the court who had not the same view as the majority.</P>
    <P>I assume that the reasoning on which this amendment is put forward is analogous to the reasoning on which only one judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal is given in a case where an appeal is taken on behalf of a person convicted of an offence and the appeal comes before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The reasoning underlying that particular practice, as I understand it, is that it is undesirable that there should be any doubt as to the validity of a conviction and sentencing of a particular individual, and, therefore, when the matter comes before the Court of Criminal Appeal, if there is a division of judicial opinion, it is deemed not to be desirable that such a division should be made public, although, in fact, if such a division does occur, it is pretty apparent in the course of the argument in court how the conflict of judicial opinion is likely to lie.  I think I am right in saying that the reasoning in relation to the Court of Criminal Appeal practice is the reasoning on which the present amendment and the practice adopted by the Supreme Court on the only reference so far made to it under Article 26 is based.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that it is desirable that there should be only one judgment in a matter of this kind.  It is clear from the Article of the Constitution that it is the majority judgment of the Supreme Court which is to prevail. Everybody will know in a case which involves public interest whether or not a particular judge or judges of the <Col N="1855" /> Supreme Court, in the course of the argument, were inclined to adopt a particular view which may not be the view which ultimately prevails, and that will lead to rumour and speculation. I think that there will probably be more doubt cast upon the ultimate decision than if each judge were to give a judgment on his own in accordance with this amendment of mine and Deputy McGilligan's, because very often in the course of argument in court, a particular judge, for the purpose of clearing his own mind, puts a point to counsel arguing the case which, if taken at its face value, might appear to indicate that the judge is against the contention which the particular counsel is putting forward, whereas, in fact, in very many cases, what he is really doing is testing the argument by putting arguments against those being put forward by counsel.  But if, in the course of consideration of whether or not a particular Bill is constitutional, that practice is adopted by a particular judge, and subsequently it is announced that a decision of the court is a majority decision, speculation will arise as to whether that judge dissented from the majority judgment of his colleagues, and it may very likely be that he is one of the persons who has concurred in the majority judgment and, of course, there will be speculation as to whether A, B, C, D, or E constituted the majority.</P>
    <P>That particular point is not, I think, of any great importance.  It is a matter that should be considered and weighed in determining whether the balance of public right or public convenience is better served by having one judgment or five judgments.  I think it must be faced that in this country there is very little interest in constitutional matters, even amongst the professional people.  In the course of time, I presume that, in our law schools, the students will get a pretty good schooling in constitutional law and in the provisions and implications of our Constitution.  It will be a necessary part of the training, I should imagine and hope, of every one of our law students of the future.  I do think that there is a much better chance and <Col N="1856" /> opportunity of having greater interest in constitutional matters and greater appreciation of constitutional affairs if, when a Bill is referred to the Supreme Court for its judgment, there should be made public the different considerations which weighed in reference to the matter with the different members of the Supreme Court.  Two judges may take a different view from that of their colleagues, and, if each of these judges sets down in writing his own views on constitutional matters, they will be a subject for study by students and by the professional men engaged in court, and, in the course of their business, it may be necessary, in considering the decisions of the Supreme Court, not merely in reference to the particular Bill but in reference to future Bills, to have before them the various reasons that impelled each of them to come to the conclusion to which he came.  The Taoiseach will, probably, agree with me that an opinion is only worth the reasonings on which it is based.  You can only get good reasoning, in my view, if you have a man sitting down and giving his opinion in the open, or giving his reasons in writing at least, for the conclusion to which he has come.  A person in considering a particular constitutional problem can come to a conclusion by instinct as to what the proper construction of a particular Act is.  He may say that it means so and so, and what is the use of arguing about it.  If he has to sit down and give reason after reason, which will be the subject of consideration by constitutional lawyers not only here but elsewhere, he will take much more care before coming to a conclusion.  If he knows that his judgment will be scrutinised in this way, then he will take more care than he would if he has merely to concur.  I think there would be much more interest in constitutional matters, and that the cases which come before the Supreme Court would get far greater consideration if each judge were bound in open court to deliver his judgment.  Nobody will accuse me&mdash;least of all, I think, members of the Supreme Court&mdash;of making reflections upon that court, but I do urge that the matters I have referred to require consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> I have no particular interest in urging this amendment save a belief in the points which I have raised.  If each judge has to give a written judgment, you are likely to get a better judgment than you will if one man delivers the judgment.  The individual who delivers the judgment will be endeavouring, in some cases at all events, to give a sort of common form to his judgment.  If there is disagreement, he will be endeavouring to deliver his own judgment and the judgment of those colleagues who agree with him.  That may be of interest, but I do suggest that it is of less interest than if the five judges gave judgments stating the reasons for the conclusions to which they came. That would lead to greater interest in the subject matter and to development of Constitutional thought.  It would afford greater education to students of Constitutional law than would one judgment which may be, on occasions, laconic and not deeply reasoned.  The law students, so far as Constitutional questions are concerned, will have to rely on the text of the Constitution. They would get a wider education on Constitutional law and its implications if they had judicial judgments on which they could rely.  These judgments would stimulate their own thought and provide them with a wider knowledge of Constitutional matters than they would have from the mere reading of the text of the Constitution and bald judgments by a single judge upon it.  For these reasons, I think this amendment should commend itself to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>In an early draft of the Constitution there was a provision such as this but it finally disappeared. I have not been able to find how it got out.  The original proposal was that there should be only one judgment, and it is quite true to say that the analogy with the Court of Criminal Appeal had something to do with that.  It is desirable in the case of the Constitution to have finality, and it is thought that this will be best secured by a single judgment. From an educational point of view, the proposal stressed by the Deputy would, no doubt, be valuable but, after all, what do we want?  We <Col N="1858" /> want to get a decision as to what the Constitutional position is in regard to a particular matter.  The more definite the position is the better and, from the point of view of definiteness, it is desirable that only one judgment should be pronounced.  The speculation referred to will go on.  That cannot be helped.  I have heard lawyers who were pleading before judges arguing as to what view certain judges were likely to take, having regard to their attitude during the hearing of the case and the questions put by them.  I found that these lawyers were wrong as often as they were right as to the view taken by particular judges.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When a single judg ment is given, nobody will know what was the ultimate view taken by any of the judges.  Even if a judge puts questions which suggest that his mind is moving in a certain direction, these questions may be put merely to clear his own mind and they are not an indication of the point of view which he may take.  I have no doubt that, very often, a judge is converted from his own view to the views of his colleagues when he sits down with them to consider the case.  This speculation will not, therefore, amount to anything.  It will, certainly, not be a cause of disturbance. The important thing is that there should be no doubt about the decision.  It was suggested here on one occasion by a Deputy that because judges of the Supreme Court were divided on a certain point of view there was as much to be said for one contention as for the other and he tried to show that the position was one of uncertainty.  We want to have these decisions as certain and definite as possible.  Cases may arise in which the public interest would be badly served, indeed, if doubt were thrown on the final judgment.  While I am willing to admit the value of the other procedure from an educational point of view, I think that, from the point of view of the public interest, it is better to have a single judgment pronounced and no indication given that other judges held a different view.  I do not know to <Col N="1859" /> what extent the judgment would, in itself, be an educative document in contrast with a series of judgments.</P>
      <P>I am not sufficiently acquainted with the practice to form any definite opinion on that.  I certainly would not presume to think that my opinion on the matter would have the same weight as the Deputy who has spoken. The one thing I am looking for, and which I think we ought all to look for here, is that there should be a definite decision; that it should not be bandied about from mouth to mouth that, in fact, that decision was only come to by a mere majority of the Supreme Court. Then you would have added on, perhaps, the number of judges who dealt with the matter in the High Court before it came to the Supreme Court, as might happen in some cases.  You would then have an adding up of judges and people saying: &ldquo;There were five on this side and three on the other, and therefore the law is the other way.&rdquo;  That would be altogether undesirable.  While there might be advantages on the other side, I think, on the whole, we ought to keep it here to a single judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim here is quite a simple one; in fact, what is to be achieved is quite simple.  We are dealing only with Article 26.  The one question to be posed to the court and answered is: &ldquo;Is the proposed measure repugnant to the Constitution or not?&rdquo; There must be a clear-cut decision on that.  There can be no question about the decision.  But the reasons for the decision are considered very valuable. In other situations it might be possible to count the heads of judges and say that there were so many in the High Court on one side and so many in the Supreme Court.  But this is a case that will only go to the Supreme Court consisting of five judges.  There must be a decision, and any decision in the end has to come down to what each judge's opinion is on the point: is the proposed measure repugnant to the Constitution or not?  That is a simple and clear issue.  This proposal about judges delivering different judgments might have <Col N="1860" /> application elsewhere.  It is possible for people to say that there were three judgments in the High Court, two on one side and only one against, and that in the Supreme Court the decision was reversed by three to two.</P>
      <P>You have the peculiar situation that speculation will still go on.  We gain nothing by a pretence of unanimity by this device.  It is a complete falsification as far as reality is concerned.  The situation is still there.  People will hear the judges asking questions of counsel. In the main, it is easy to know when a judge is putting a point because he wants it cleared up and not because he accepts it.  A point put by a judge because he believes in it is generally one which is tenaciously adhered to.  It is easy at most times to calculate whether a judge is radically in disagreement with his colleagues.  As to this pretence about having one judgment delivered, those who are in court or who hear about it will be able to form an idea as to the situation.  The issue is decided.  Three judges must determine whether a Bill is repugnant to the Constitution or not.  There are the two positions.  On the one hand, there are people who think that there is value in having what is called a clear decision. There are people who think that there is some value in having the pretence that a clear decision is arrived at by the whole court.  You are not going to get anything more than a pretence.  As against that, there is the decided advantage to be got, as any practitioner knows, from having judges canvassing points of view and indicating the strong points that have weighed with them in coming to the final decision, whether the Bill is or is not repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague referred to the lack of enthusiasm and interest in Constitutional matters.  One of the difficulties in speaking to students about Constitutional matters is that there have been so few cases thoroughly canvassed in court and so few occasions on which judges have given a point of view about particular Articles in the Constitution.  What field could be more fruitful of argument and expression of points of view than this, where some piece of legislation is referred to <Col N="1861" /> them to know whether it is or is not repugnant to the Constitution; where you may have a great many Articles brought into the argument, fine points revealed, and a decision taken?  We in this country are still in a system in which we believe in argument and that things are carried through by reason. The only way in which you can get a measure commending itself to the public is when you get a clash of points of view among those who have to decide the matter; not merely a statement that somebody agrees and somebody disagrees, but the reasons why a judge has accepted the final decision that it is repugnant to the Constitution or a judge has accepted the decision that it is not repugnant to the Constitution. There is a big field open and it is a pity that on this, one of the few occasions on which there is a possibility of getting enlightening material, not only for students but legislators, it should be closed by this pretence of having unanimity when everybody will know there is no such thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's remarks brought back to my mind a theory that was held by one of the writers in jurisprudence which I learned in my student days&mdash;that it was better for the law to be certain than just.  Apparently, the one thing that the Taoiseach wants is to have certainty. This particular school of jurisprudence apparently thought that certainty was even a higher virtue than justice.  The Taoiseach, I think, by his proposals will attain neither certainty nor justice.  The British common law, <Col N="1862" /> which I think everybody will recognise as of enormous importance from the point of view of a juridical system, developed from judge-made law and, I think, if the Taoiseach got some of his legal advisers to spend such spare time as they may have looking up the number of times that dissentient judgments were the foundation of subsequent legal reforms he might have a different view from the one he has at present.  Certainly the dissentient judgments in various branches of the law have been the bones on which students, so to speak, metaphorically sharpened their legal teeth.  A dissentient judgment on Constitutional matters may be as valuable from the point of view of Constitutional theory and the stimulation of Constitutional thought as the judgment of the majority; in fact, sometimes it may be very much more valuable.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, of course, is looking at the problem, if I may say so without any suggestion of offence, from the position at the present moment.  But it might be that in future times a majority judgment of a court might not be such as to be really conducive to the public interest.  Supposing there were on some future Supreme Court a majority of judges who took, say, a particular type of view of a Constitution. Their judgment in all good faith might have very serious results. The Taoiseach will probably realise that, in the approach to the interpretation of a Constitution, a number of minds may take different views.  We may take the view that the Constitution is nothing but a statute and bring to the consideration of any problem arising out of the Constitution the same rigid ideas of interpretation as are usually brought to the interpretation of a statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if that particular mentality at any particular period prevails, certain results inevitably follow.  But, on the other hand, if, by some fortuitous circumstances, three judges get on the Supreme Court, all of whom have a particular type of mental approach towards the interpretation of the Constitution, the basis of which is a liberal interpretation, to regard the Constitution as something setting down headlines <Col N="1863" /> rather than as being merely the equivalent of an ordinary Act of Parliament, and that it is, therefore, a document which requires an approach to its interpretation entirely different from the approach which a judge brings to the interpretation of an Act of Parliament, then in that state of facts an entirely different construction of the same document will be given. It may be that a rigid interpretation of the Constitution, based on the rigid canons of legal interpretation, suits a particular situation at some time, but in another situation later on, when a more liberal method of approach to constitutional interpretation is in vogue, it will produce an entirely different result.  It will produce a certain result, the certainty that the Taoiseach requires, the certainty which a particular Government at some time may not like.</P>
    <P>My interest in this arises from my interest in constitutional matters.  I do happen to have some interest in constitutional matters.  The Taoiseach will not misunderstand me when I say that even among lawyers there is often very little interest in constitutional law and constitutional matters.  I think that the stimulation given to legal thought and legal theory from differences of opinion is extremely valuable.  You are shutting out that stimulation to legal thought, legal theory and constitutional theory if you shut out from the consideration of constitutional lawyers and constitutional students the different ideas given, even in concurring judgments, on something affecting a vital matter in the Constitution. It is, I think, very valuable, even where three judges concur, to have their judgments, to see for what reasons each of the three came to the concurring judgment.</P>
    <P>Judges very often arrive at the same conclusion by widely different roads. Even if you were only to give the concurring judgments, and to leave out the dissenting judgments, a considerable advantage might be gained, but, in the proposal as it stands at the moment, you are getting what may eventually amount to a mere &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; The result of this may be that <Col N="1864" /> some future Supreme Court may say: &ldquo;Our job is to give a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; answer, and it would be undesirable to give the reasons for that; therefore, when we are put this question, we always say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo;  You get there great certainty.  You also get something that may be productive of very great damage to the Constitution, and to the constitutional position.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his effort to get certainty, to avoid, as he says, speculation, and the counting of heads may, I think, rather lead himself into the position that he is desirous of avoiding. I had the somewhat unique experience of appearing in a case in the Supreme Court where there were, I think, five judges.  As far as I could hear, the whole five decided against me, and yet, by adding up the different parts of their judgments my client ultimately won his appeal.  That was a very interesting case from many points of view. Such a thing might occur in a constitutional matter.  Five different minds are going to bear upon a problem.  They arrive at their conclusion by various roads.  The reasons for their arrival are, I think, of vital importance.  I have no particular interest in urging this upon the Taoiseach except the one that I have already given, namely, that I am interested in constitutional matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to concede to the Deputy that he has made a very excellent case for the amendment from the educational and, if you like, the intellectual point of view.  There is a great deal to be said for the point of view he put forward about stimulus to thought and so on, but that is not the purpose of sending a case to the Supreme Court.  If it were possible for us to get language which would be absolutely unambiguous, about which no group of two or three people could fail to come to the same idea, that would be the ideal to aim at.  It would be the ideal type of Constitution in the sense that there could be no speculation as to what it meant: that the meaning one took from it was the only meaning that could be taken from it. That would be the ideal document from my point of view, but it might be a very unsatisfactory document from the point of view of the lawyers, or from <Col N="1865" /> the point of view of intellectual or mental exercise.  From the point of view of the Constitution, what we want is to get a decision and not to have individuals trying the matter out again for themselves.  What we want to arrive at is the decision: &ldquo;This is the law and that closes it.&rdquo;  I am anxious, when that has been decided, that there can be no further argument about it. If the decision leads to public inconvenience then, as in the case of any other law that leads to public inconvenience, the Legislature will have to take steps to amend it.  The Deputy engaged in a very interesting&mdash;I do not like to call it a game&mdash;mental exercise, in a speculation on the meaning that could be taken from phrases according to one's approach to them.  That is not what we want.  First of all, if it were possible to have a Constitution which would not be questioned in court at all &mdash;that it would be regarded by all as being so clear that anyone reading it would have no doubt about it&mdash;that, of course, would be the ideal position. The next best thing is that when the matter is raised in court there should be a decision, and that that decision should be regarded as final.</P>

      <P>I agree.  It may be all very well for the Deputy, who is a lawyer, to say: &ldquo;These are the arguments in this way and these are the arguments in that way.  If I were one of the judges I would balance them in this way and give a decision differently. The fact is, there are five men who have been charged with the responsibility of giving a final decision. The majority have come to a particular decision, and that is good enough for me.&rdquo;  It may be all right for the lawyer to take that view, but, on the other hand, the average citizen may feel that, because there was another interpretation possible, he has been aggrieved and, consequently, he is not prepared to take the legal view of what the decision means.  I think that from the point of view of public advantage, the advantage lies in the single judgment. I am not going to go further into the arguments that were put forward in support of the amendment.

      <P>The absence of exercise means either of two things: that a person is lazy, or that a person is going to get very flabby.  I think there are people in the background of this Constitution who have, in fact, accepted the cloistered life.  They do not want anything but security.</P>
      <P>We must recognise only two divisions of people.  There are people who rejoice a little in the hurly-burly of practical affairs of life and practical affairs of law and would rather see advancement even though it may mean that people may question a decision in the courts. There is a valuable point of view in opposition to this&mdash;the point of view that through, exercise you get growth and that applies mentally as well as physically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain the position.  Those two amendments, Nos. 16 and 18, taken together, provide for the possibility that a Bill referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 may be the subject of a petition for reference to the people under Article 27; that is, both Articles 26 and 27 may concurrently apply.  Should this happen, the President will have power to defer the reference of the Bill to the people until the Supreme Court decision has been given, so as to avoid the possibility that the Bill may be referred to the people, and then referred to the <Col N="1868" /> Supreme Court and found to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court reference comes first.</P>
      <P>If the Supreme Court decides that the Bill, or any provision thereof, is repugnant to the Constitution, the President must decline to sign it, and the question of reference to the people under Article 27 would no longer arise. If, on the other hand, the court decides in favour of the Bill, the President can then consider whether it contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon should be ascertained.  One is a question of legality and the other a question of importance in regard to its being put before the people or not.  The President will have six days after the date of the court decision in which to make up his mind.  Originally, there was the possibility that there may be a Bill of a very important character, and two questions in connection with it&mdash; the first, whether it is Constitutional: that would be a matter for reference to the Supreme Court; the next, whether it is of such importance as to need reference to the people.  The first thing is to have the question of the constitutionality decided on, and that would be done by the Supreme Court. When it gets back, the President has to consider the other question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the time points in Article 27 still remain; that is, within four days after the Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, a petition, if any, must be presented and under Section 3 of Article 27 the President <Col N="1870" /> must consider it and must pronounce a decision within ten days.  He can do that while the petition is lying with the Supreme Court.  I do not think there is any amendment that changes those times.  I understood the reason for the amendment was that Article 26, as it stands, says that if the Supreme Court say the Bill is repugnant the President shall not sign it.  There seems to be a peremptory flavour about the sub-section which says that he shall sign it.  In other words, reading Article 27, if it were only a matter of enlarging the time, it would be necessary to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>Look at the English text of that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2º If the Bill or any provision thereof is or has been referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of this Constitution, it shall not be obligatory on the President to consider the petition unless or until the Supreme Court has pronounced a decision on such reference to the effect that the said Bill or the said provision thereof is not repugnant to this Constitution or to any provision thereof, and, if a decision to that effect is pronounced by the Supreme Court, it shall not be obligatory on the President to pronounce his decision on the petition before the expiration of six days after the day on which the decision of the Supreme Court to the effect aforesaid is pronounced.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>In other words, even although, as was done in the case of the Offences Against the State Bill, it was announced clearly that the Bill was one that was thought should be referred to the Supreme Court as to whether it was repugnant or not, nevertheless, if a majority of the Seanad and one-third of the Dáil <Col N="1871" /> decide that it is a thing they ought to present a petition about, they, although the Supreme Court may in fact declare the Bill to be unconstitutional, are still put to the trouble, inside four days from the Bill having been passed, of getting a petition?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question is, is it necessary?  Quite irrespective of any action that the President may take with regard to its constitutionality, there is this question which is the one about which the petition is to be made; it is an independent question. The group may say, &ldquo;We do not know what the position may be or what attitude the Government may take with regard to the constitutionality of this, but clearly to us it is a question of such importance that it ought not to be passed here without reference to the people or become law without reference to the people,&rdquo; and they put in a petition on the basis that it is an important matter.  I think that would be the primary thing in their minds.  It would be quite a secondary and incidental thing if they advert to the question of its possibly not being in accordance with the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The stimulus to their action should come immediately the Bill is passed through the two Houses. The petition is originated by members of the two Houses.  We presume those who will sign the petition have been fighting against the measure.  They are wroth that it is passed.  They immediately say: &ldquo;This is a shame; this is a thing that ought to be referred to the people, we will put a petition to the President.&rdquo;  The petition comes along.  The President looks at the Bill from two points of view.  First of all, <Col N="1872" /> he looks at it from the point of view of its constitutionality and, secondly, from the point of view of the petition. Both of these aspects will have to be considered by him.  If there is a question of its constitutionality he gets that settled first.  But it is absolutely necessary to lengthen the time for him.</P>

      <P>I am trying to put it briefly.  Machinery is here in the Constitution for having Bills referred to the people.  That machinery has to be started by a group of people, not less than the majority of the Seanad and one-third of the Dáil.  That Bill about which they may seek to move that machinery is one that may be also referred to the Supreme Court for decision as to its constitutionality. Although it is going to be referred to the Supreme Court, nevertheless, you insist that that group of the representatives of the people will get moving and get a petition and send it to the Uachtarán within a certain time.  It has gone to that stage.  What is then to happen?  You have put a whole lot of people to a considerable amount of trouble.  The next step is that the one individual whose main function is to do this sort of thing, has to call the Council of State and say whether this is of such importance that it ought to be referred to the people.  You will not bother him until you see whether the Supreme Court decides as to its constitutionality, but you will bother the majority of the Seanad and one-third of the Dáil.  I think, if you are going to enlarge the time for the one, you ought to do it for the other.  You ought to say: &ldquo;This Bill is going to be referred to the Supreme Court. After their decision has been pronounced then your four days and 10 days start.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is this question, as the Deputy knows.  Suppose a Bill is going through.  Members of the Oireachtas are talking about it and taking an interest in it for the time being.  If there is a period elapsing in which there is a decision of the court, they may not all advert to it and it may be difficult to get the necessary group.  They are on the spot at the time the Bill is passing through.  They are on the spot immediately after its passing and it is much easier to get a petition signed.  In all these cases there will be some people who will take the initiative and get the thing done.  It is much easier to get it signed immediately after than it would perhaps if they were down the country.</P>

Refinements may be brought out in argument before the Supreme Court and the group necessary to get the machine moving might say: &ldquo;This is dangerous.

As far as I would judge it, it is the only one that has been put forward that would suggest a reason for the change but, even there, is it likely that something that occurs in the case as pleaded before the Supreme Court is likely to indicate its importance as a measure? Surely its importance as a measure, from the point of view of the welfare of the people, will already have emerged in the discussion in the Legislature? I think it is extremely unlikely, and I think it would be hardly worth our while to change it on that account.</P>

Did anybody believe before the Offences Against the State Act went to the Supreme Court that there was likely to be a decision which in fact&mdash;I suggest this in a general way &mdash;had the result of obliterating the Constitution and making it subservient to law?  That is the full effect of the result of the Offences Against the State Act.  I do not think the point was adverted to, when this measure was passing through the Dáil, that a piece of legislation, as long as it is properly passed, could override the Constitution.  I think if that point had been adverted to there certainly would have been an appeal.</P>

However, let it be, for the moment, admitted that this may be taken as an exaggeration, but supposing that was the effect of the decision and that it became clear, in the course of a court argument, that that was implicit in the legislation passed, would <Col N="1875" /> you not get a considerably greater number of people moved and stirred up about it than by the ordinary humdrum matter of the passage of a Bill?</P>

However, again, I am quite prepared to give the matter further consideration with a view to seeing what would be the consequences of giving the four days after the decision.  From the point of view of convenience, of ordinary convenience, I should say that it should be let stand as it is, but I shall consider the point put forward by the Deputy, to see if it is sufficient to make it desirable to have four or five or six days running at the same time.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37 are put down here in order to clarify certain things in connection with the Constitution. I do not like to use the word &ldquo;clarify&rdquo; continually, but I have some doubts in regard to the Constitution. We are dealing here with the part of Article 28 of the Constitution which allows the Constitution to be suspended, and the phrase that is in sub-section (3), Section 3, of Article 28, is: &ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion.&rdquo;  What I want to ask is, what is the repercussion of that phrase &ldquo;in time of war or armed rebellion?&rdquo;  Is it that nothing shall be invoked in time of war or armed rebellion that would invalidate an Act passed by the Oireachtas, or that nothing shall be invoked at any time that would invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas in time of war or armed rebellion, or is it simply that nothing in the Constitution can be invoked at any time to invalidate any law, even before a war has broken out? <Col N="1879" /> Which of these positions is intended to be the true one, I do not know. Perhaps I might put the doubt in another way.  Does the phrase &ldquo;in time of war or armed rebellion&rdquo; govern the whole clause or just the particular piece of legislation which, even in the piping time of peace, is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State, or are you merely prevented from invoking the Constitution in time of war or armed rebellion?  Or again, is the position that what you found yourself upon is a piece of law enacted during a time of war or armed rebellion?  I should like to have some direction on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the thing as it stands originally.  The sub-section says that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion, or to nullify any act done or purporting to be done in pursuance of any such law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is as it stands, is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Now, let us see the meaning of it in the ordinary run:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion, or to nullify any act done or purporting to be done in pursuance of any such law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is the most general way in which you can have it, namely that the law has to relate to a time of war or armed rebellion and the Constitution cannot be invoked for the purpose of nullifying anything done under that law at any time.  We have to consider the question of a law which is passed in advance of the time for which it is <Col N="1880" /> intended.  Suppose a law is passed and related to acts at that particular time, I take it the law will hold during the time at which it is passed, even though it is intended to operate during a time of war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And you could not go into the courts under the Constitution and apply for relief from that law even though there may not be a state of war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you are giving it the widest possible interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that is the interpretation as it stands.  After the war is over, you cannot invoke the Constitution to prevent the passing of an Indemnity Act if a question arose of indemnifying officers in respect of acts of good faith done during the period of the war.  I think if the amendment which the Deputy has suggested were adopted it would be narrowed to such a point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the amendments down merely to find out what was the exact impact of this phrase on the suspension of the Constitution. I gather now that it is intended to have the widest possible reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the interpretation, as I read it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Say that after the Munich crisis this country made up its mind that a war was coming, it could have, in the month of January, 1939, passed legislation expressing that to be for the purpose of preserving this country in a time of war.  Say that it ran the gauntlet of this House and that it was passed by the end of January, 1939.  Although the war did not break out until September, 1939, nobody as between January and September could have gone into court to raise the Constitution as against anything done under that law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that is the position but nothing would be done under it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose something were done in preparation for a time of war.  Suppose an Emergency Powers <Col N="1881" /> Act were passed and that this Act was expressed to be for the preservation of the State in time of war.  One of the things put into the Emergency Powers Act was to allow the Minister&mdash;it is rather ironic to think of it now&mdash;to gather in supplies for a time of emergency. All that could have been done under the Emergency Powers Act passed in January although the war did not start until September.  I want to know if that is what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should read it again:</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

I may be wrong but I shall find out what is the legal opinion on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The pivot of the whole thing is that the law carries its own justification on its head.  If there is a preamble to say that it is an Act expressly for the purpose of preserving the State, and if you pass it months ahead of a time of war, then you can immediately proceed to take land or to confiscate property under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put down these three amendments to find out how it is intended to operate legislation of this kind from the passing of the Act.  I want to find out what is intended.  Depending on what is intended, other amendments may be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that nobody could object to legislation being prepared in advance of war, but people could object to legislation so prepared being put in operation before the time of war came?  It is quite possible that certain conditions which might emerge during times of disturbances should be throttled before they actually broke out.  There is a danger in waiting until the actual time of war or armed rebellion comes but, at the same time, this is an amendment of the Constitution under which the whole Constitution is simply lifted and put on one side.  We have enlarged the phrase &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; under the Act already passed, and we are going to enlarge it still further to include a time when war is obviously not in existence.  That might be a considerable time prior to the outbreak of war.</P>

      <P>We are going through very strenuous times at the present moment, and that is the reason I am not debating this at any length, but surely our difficulties, which are problematical to a large extent at the present time, will not be by any means problematic immediately after the war. That, I assume, is the justification for the extension.  But there is no limit; it may last for years, and I think there should be some other action required on the part of the Dáil or of somebody.  I see certain difficulties in fixing an arbitrary period of, say, six months.  Somebody will say: &ldquo;Why not say three months, or why not say nine months?&rdquo;  What I object to is a completely undefined and unlimited extension of what I might call, I think without exaggeration, the suspension of what remains of the guarding Articles of the Constitution so far as personal liberty is concerned.  I am not at all for a moment denying the problem that <Col N="1885" /> arises, and what may be its seriousness and urgency, but I do not like the wholesale, unrestricted and uncontrolled power to abolish what remains of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>As I understand your argument, it is that it is hard to know when the time of war has gone, but in your amendment to the Constitution you pivot on &ldquo;time of war&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The period is referred to.  There may be a court decision as to whether or not it is exactly a time of war, but a difficulty arises as far as any extension from the particular time of the end of the war is concerned.  The period of the war is a general sort of thing from which no evil consequences will flow unless you are going to take action with regard to the two ends of it.  If we had an amendment in terms of the end of the war, then we would have somehow or other to be able to define the end.  There was a line which I was thinking about, because I dislike this general extension too; it was that we start from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a beginning, namely, when those resolutions have been passed, and when it has been decided by both Houses.  Then you could possibly proceed this way, namely, to have it last for some period like three years, with the need of having similar resolutions at each particular period of, say, a year or six months after that if you want to continue it, that is, you would have a re-determination of the situation after the beginning, that is after the first period.  But there are all sorts of difficulties. It is quite possible that it would be difficult to get Parliament together to pass those resolutions at the time when they would be needed, and it is doubtful if you could anticipate even to such an extent as to say: &ldquo;Very well; you have a period of three years, and, if you want to extend it for <Col N="1887" /> another period, do not wait until the last moment, but try to get some suitable period a couple of months in advance.&rdquo;  I think it would be extremely difficult in that case to be certain that some particular crisis might not exist which would make it impossible for the House to meet and to pass those resolutions.  On the question of extension or restriction, on the whole it seems to me that if we have to choose between two evils&mdash;either to bind the Legislature constitutionally, preventing it from taking action in the crisis, or leave it free and take your risks&mdash;it is wiser to depend on the Legislature of the day rather than to preclude it in advance, by a Constitutional enactment, from taking action when the safety of the State or the whole existence of the State may be in question.  If I could not get a fairly certain way of shortening the time I would prefer to proceed as we are proceeding here, that is simply to depend upon the Legislature of the day, the two Houses, to resolve that the situation has passed and that normality has supervened, rather than to bind them.  I think it would be a very unwise thing to bind the Legislature by a constitutional enactment and prevent them from taking necessary action in time of conflict such as we are speaking about here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the right of restriction, but taking the point of view that the extension is required I do want to give this warning. I think the Constitution has got into a definitely difficult position owing to the hurried piece of legislation that was passed here as an amendment to it, because the amendment that is here turns on a resolution about a national emergency.  There are three positions that have to be attended to.  One is a time of rebellion.  The second is a time of war in which the State is participating, and the third is a time of war in which the State is not participating. A national emergency applies only to one of those three, and only to the third of them.  You cannot, therefore, have a national emergency in respect of a rebellion inside the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot have a national emergency in respect of a rebellion inside the country, nor can you have a national emergency in respect of a war in which the State is participating.  What, then, are you tied to?  You are tied to something done in time of war or armed rebellion. You may extend artificially, by the national emergency resolution, the period of war in which the State is not participating, but you have not extended by this amendment beyond the period in which a revolution takes place.  A court decision will say that a rebellion is over or that a state of war has finished.  If you want to enlarge it, you will have to go further than what you are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, if there is an emergency which has to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason behind the enlargement is that a situation which calls for the suspension of the Constitution may exist after the date on which hostilities have actually ceased.  But it is also very logical to argue that a situation demanding a suspension of the Constitution may exist after a rebellion has been crushed or after a war has finished.  You enlarge it on the pivot of the phrase &ldquo;national emergency&rdquo;.  The amendment I have down, amendment No. 39, tries to meet the situation.  It was extremely difficult to draft.  I am not so worried as my colleague over certain fundamental articles, because they can be changed by law.  I am worrying about the provisions relating to confiscating property and controlling prices and the general effect on ordinary life, apart from grabbing people and putting them into jail, or breaking into houses, all of which can be met by the ordinary law, arising out of a court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain latitude given with regard to the suspension of the ordinary law.  We had one bad example in connection with the farmers' strike.  That could be dealt with under provisions inside the Constitution. There are other cases which <Col N="1889" /> have been referred to a special tribunal. We do not want a continuance of that a day longer than is necessary; but once you get a suspension of the Constitution you can do all these things.  I think it would be wise to take the view of the House from time to time.  Let us suppose the emergency resolution is enlarged to cover all types of armed conflict and rebellion. There is an Article in the Constitution which talks about abridging the time for the consideration of matters in the Seanad.  The period runs for 90 days, unless there is some agreement to the contrary.  I moulded that to this position.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  It is provided in the Constitution that if a piece of legislation is brought forward&mdash;not a resolution&mdash;and if a group of representatives of the country, numbering a majority in the Seanad and one-third of the members of the Dáil, think of objecting to it, they can put it up to the President that he should send it by referendum to the people.  I do not see why we should make any difference between a piece of legislation and this type of resolution suspending the Constitution.  If you brought in a piece of legislation to suspend the Constitution, it would fall under Article 27.  I have no doubt that a measure that is going to suspend the whole Constitution would automatically have to be sent to the people for their view.  I propose, as a try-out, that you get the view of both Houses from time to time and that you get such a majority as would prevent the application of Article 27, namely, that you get a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann and not less than two-thirds&mdash;something more than one-third&mdash;of the members of Dáil Eireann. You are, therefore, within your machinery, because you preserve yourself from the impact of Article 27.</P>
    <P>Surely, in such a vital matter as suspending the Constitution, there ought to be certain limitations?  So long as a conflict is on, nobody can object to a resolution being passed, but after the conflict has ceased, when there is peace or when a rebellion has been crushed, then I suggest there should be an appeal to the House and you should try to get a particular <Col N="1890" /> majority and have the resolution holding only for a certain period.  If the Constitution is of any value or importance to the citizens, you should not allow a majority in the two Houses to suspend indefinitely, by one simple resolution, the whole of the Constitution. There ought to be some care taken in that matter.  We should at least pretend to have some reference to the Constitution to that extent.</P>
    <P>Getting a majority in each of the two Houses is in most Constitutions regarded as a particular safeguard. Under our machinery you have brought about a situation in which the Seanad will nearly always be a duplication of the political atmosphere of the Dáil. It is elected at the same time and its members are affected by the same political considerations.  Then again, the head of the new Government is allowed to nominate to the Seanad. You have made it absolutely certain that the Seanad will have the same political views as the Dáil and therefore the safeguard of the two Houses is somewhat weaker than if the Second House were constituted on a different basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach raises a difficulty as to a more formal extension of the time.  He indicated that the Dáil may not come together. Let us say the rebellion is over.  Why could not the Dáil meet?  If we are in a war, certain measures are taken. Supposing that war is over, surely the House can meet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the war is over the members of the House can meet.  There is no difficulty, therefore, in the House meeting in order formally to extend this provision.  I do not think that is a real difficulty.  It is purely a theoretical difficulty.  Candidly I am not sorry to see it.  I think you ought to have a Constitution that protects.  I was struck by the argument put forward by the Taoiseach, which was practically in favour of not having a Constitution owing to the danger into which it brings you.  There <Col N="1891" /> is the choice.  I remember that on one occasion the advice given was that if you wanted to have a Constitution it should be written on one sheet of notepaper. Possibly we are coming to the point when there is a lot to be said for that.  In principle I think the Taoiseach has largely arrived at that view.  We are now getting into the position of making a Constitution which, in reality, can be swept aside, in so far as it has not been already swept aside.</P>

      <P>If it was of sufficient importance to need another Bill we might have to face it.  I have not considered that.  If there is a rebellion I wonder if the need for continuation of the period would be as great as in a war with an external power, with which the State was engaged.  It is very hard to visualise all the possible things that might happen in case of rebellion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach look at the beginning of the part re-referring to rebellion?  It is only in case of actual invasion that the Government is armed to take the necessary steps. They are not empowered to take the necessary steps in case of rebellion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look at the second part, you will see that the <Col N="1892" /> Government is empowered to take whatever steps they consider necessary to protect the State in the case of actual invasion.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will see if that is necessary.  With regard to extension, it is possible that that ought to be covered. too.  Some such set of circumstances might arise.  The question is whether it is covered in any way now. We will have to revert to that to see if it does not call for another amendment. The present one was dictated largely by existing circumstances. Generalisation has to deal with cases other than those in which we are immediately involved.  The difficulty is as to how we could provide for the period after the actual conflict had ceased.  I do not think we could indicate any precise moment, when the conflict had ceased, that will be agreed upon. If there is an armistice, there may be a period fixed and an effort to make peace, but if the situation is such that two parties to the conflict were prepared to renew it, then it would be undesirable to imagine that the conflict had ceased at the armistice.  If there are several parties to the war, there might be peace between some, and possibly between parties which affect the interest of this country in the first instance, but, while the conflict continued, the particular interest which justified the passing of a resolution might have passed and the conflict continued. If you are bent on fixing a period of time, the only approach feasible is to say that after a period the first resolution would hold good for two or three years or whatever period was considered right&mdash;but would cease at the end of that period.  The putting aside of the Constitution would cease definitely at that time unless there was a resolution renewing it for a shorter period.  The difficulty is what period of time to take in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> No one knows how long a war is going to last.  You might think it would last three years but it might last only a few months.  When you fix a period you will have somewhat the same difficulty.  It would not be the same because it is for an indefinite extension. If the House is satisfied I will be prepared to try an amendment on that, starting by saying that there will be, in the first instance, a period of, say, three years.  I would be inclined to take three years, unless prior to that the House resolved that it should end then, and that a continuation would be possible only by having a resolution of the same type as the first resolution.  If that would give more general satisfaction I am prepared to try it.  On the whole, I am afraid in a time of crisis to bind the Legislature.</P>

      <P>We are now getting well on to two years.  The question is whether it is advisable to be discussing a matter like that.  It would be always open to move a resolution that it had come to an end.  I take it that it is always open to do that within the procedure of the Legislature.  I have given a great deal of thought to the two things proposed, and unless there was a strong feeling on the other side I would be prepared to let this stand. If it would meet the views expressed on the opposite side to approach it from the other end I will do so.  I am prepared also to consider whether we can within the rules of the House, and the decision of the Chair, get liberty to bring in an amendment to the other portion with regard to the extension as far as armed rebellion or war in which we are actually engaged is concerned.  Could I get from Deputies an expression of opinion on that?</P>

      <P>Unless brought to a termination earlier, and it would have to be ended more speedily by this resolution that the emergency has ceased to exist.  Will the Taoiseach consider this point?  It is quite likely that one of the undesirable sequels of this war will be that there will not be any armed conflict in this country but that there may be a shockingly bad economic situation.  How long is it to be considered that that national emergency of an economic type has lasted? Is it going to be until somebody muddles through, so to speak, with a solution?  Surely this national emergency ought to be tied more to what brought it about, the armed conflict, because one can see this Parliament being prolonged almost to eternity in certain circumstances.  What is the national emergency?  It is not defined in terms of war, but is defined here as an emergency affecting the vital interests of the State.  Is it considered, in respect of a stale representative assembly, so to speak, because the Seanad will remain as long as the Dáil remains, without the people getting any chance to say: &ldquo;You people have not done your job and we want a completely new Parliament,&rdquo; that it is possible, on account of there being a national emergency of an economic type lasting after the war, for it to be able to sit on for ten or 15 years?  We are putting it in our own power, or&mdash; let me put it this way&mdash;we are putting it outside the power of anybody else, to say that we should get out, and that is an undesirable situation.</P>

      <P>What brings it about is either war outside the country affecting the State or rebellion within the country.  That is what brings the whole situation about.  This House, somewhat stale, is taking this opportunity to say that the provision of the Constitution as to the life of the Parliament will not operate until such time as we ourselves vote that the national emergency, which some people say we brought about ourselves, had ceased, and it may be a purely economic emergency.

      <P>Any of us could allow our imaginations to run riot and speculate on all sorts of things which it would be nearly impossible to provide against.  We are constantly making provision in regard to certain things being done by the Government and so on, but the fact is that the Government would not go on, as we know it, in the circumstances against which we are seeking to make provision.  I do not think that Parliamentary institutions would continue to exist at all, if they were going to operate in the way the Deputy suggests, until the whole thing had ceased to have any real meaning and the people were driven to rebellion, or something else, to put an end to it. In other words, they would cease to have authority at all, if they continued abusing their position in the way indicated.  I think that occasionally when we try to foresee all the possible things and make provision against them, we are, to a large extent, unreal, and not thinking of the situation as it is almost certain to be, because if there is a situation in which people are going to do these things, they will do them otherwise.  The circumstances will be such that they would have the desire and the power to do them, except that they would not be covered by the cloak of constitutionality.  I admit that, and it is necessary not to allow them to be covered by such a cloak, if they are acting in a way in which it was never intended they should act; but you are trying to do things to defeat absolutely the ingenuity of human beings, and I do not think you can do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Give an opportunity to the other point of view to emerge. As the Constitution stands, it can be suspended and kept suspended as long as the rebellion or state of war is on, and we have enlarged &ldquo;state of war&rdquo; to mean a war in which the State is not participating, but which affects the vital interests of the State.  So long as a war inside or outside the country, or armed rebellion, is raging, the Constitution can be suspended for that length of time.  That is a satisfactory situation and one that ought to be permitted.  We are moving now to the other point&mdash;after the war is over&mdash;and it is easier to start a war than to bring it to an end, and the outbreak of war is much more easily defined in point of time than the time at which peace emerges and hostilities cease; but, in the doubtful period, there is at least leave for the Government to carry on with the Constitution suspended.  They are only approaching danger when they come to the point at which hostilities have so clearly ceased that there may be a decision of the court that the conflict has terminated. That is all you are providing against. If it is hard to find out when war has ended, inside that period, the people who want the Constitution suspended are safe.  The point of danger comes for them only when hostilities are so clearly over that the court will say so.</P>
      <P>We want to enlarge that time, and I agree that it should be done and that provision should be made for permitting it in certain circumstances.  All I say is that, instead of the onus being all one way, it should be the other way, and that it should be set out that it will not be continued, unless a resolution is passed carrying it forward again, and that that resolution shall have currency only for six months, unless carried forward once more, and once we carried forward a resolution, inertia would prevail.  I suggest, as a proper approach to this, that as we are only dealing with this at a time when hostilities have clearly ceased, the onus should be upon those who want the suspension of the Constitution continued, and that they should bring forward a resolution and get it affirmatively voted by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is so.  It is only a question of the particular time at which you would have to bring it forward, because some of the dangers we are trying to prevent would continue to exist.  I should like to make one remark now which I intended to make earlier with reference to the point of having some number other than an ordinary majority to decide certain things.  I am afraid that would lead us into all sorts of difficulties, because, if the Government is to carry on, it can only carry on on the basis of governing by a majority.  Something which may be <Col N="1898" /> absolutely vital from the Government point of view, the policy point of view, for carrying on may be involved in a matter of this sort, and, if you bring in something other than a majority, you will have the curious situation that the Government will be supported by a majority, but will be prevented from doing something which may be regarded as vital, to such an extent that the Government in question may have to say: &ldquo;You are depriving us of the power to carry on, although we are entitled to carry on by reason of having a majority of the House,&rdquo; and you would create a very awkward situation, so that I am afraid any figure like two-thirds coming in to remedy a situation like that, or any definite figure more than a simple majority, would not be workable. There is really a genuine difficulty which both sides of the House appreciate, and I am anxious to get the greatest degree of agreement I can on this matter and, without prejudice, to get the best solution.  I know the proposal put forward by the Deputy and I shall consider it side by side with the idea which I have been pursuing myself as to whether we could not get a better result by commencing with a definite time and then have it cease unless there is a further positive resolution by both Houses.  That will not completely obviate the difficulties referred to by the Deputy because it will mean that the Legislature will be able to continue its existence.  If a majority want to use an emergency, or the pretence of an emergency, to serve its own purposes, then it will be possible for that majority to continue in power.  If the matter is left over, I shall consider it again.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that, if that provision is inserted in the Constitution, it may have wider application than is intended.  A case may commence in the Circuit Court, or even in the District Court, and, in the course of the hearing, an issue may emerge involving a question as to whether the law supposed to govern the case is valid or invalid, having regard to the Constitution.  Because that case is within the jurisdiction of the <Col N="1900" /> Circuit Court, that point cannot be raised there.  Although the case may be governed by a law which, in other proceedings, may be declared to be invalid by the High Court, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, the party involved in the proceedings in the Circuit Court may find himself decreed or may lose his action because he is not at liberty to raise the point.</P>
      <P>Up to the present, the practice in matters of this kind was that if a party to proceedings in the District or Circuit Court raised a point as to the invalidity of a law governing the case, proceedings were stayed or adjourned until the issue was determined by the High Court.  That course cannot be adopted under this provision.  The case must go on in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Courts of Justice Acts, particularly the Act of 1936, the practice is fairly rigid.  The law laid down in these Acts to secure that cases within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court are heard there and are not brought in the High Court is given rigid application.  Under this provision, if it emerges in the course of the hearing of a case in the Circuit Court that the real issue turns on the validity of an Act, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, that issue must be left out of consideration.  In other words, a party may override a Constitutional provision by bringing his case in the Circuit Court.  Suppose there is a case involving a sum of £301&mdash;I take this as a fortuitous example &mdash; the person claiming that money may say: &ldquo;If I bring proceedings in the High Court, the other party will raise a question as to the validity of the law.  I will drop £2 of my claim and bring the case in the Circuit Court for £299 and I have caught my opponent under an unconstitutional Act.&rdquo;  That appears to be the effect of it.</P>

That is the fallacy in the Taoiseach's argument, because, although he is a judge of the High Court on circuit, he is not the High Court. He is a judge of the High Court on circuit, exercising statutory jurisdiction. Supposing he is a Supreme Court judge&mdash;Supreme Court judges also go on circuit&mdash;he is a Supreme Court judge on circuit, and, therefore, the point could not be raised.  Assuming it was raised in the example I have given, and instead of bringing an action for £299, the man brings it for £10.  He is then within the jurisdiction of the District Court.  By no possible procedure can he get the decision of that court into the High Court.  The only appeal from that court is to the Circuit Court. It appears to me, therefore, that the effect of this will be that certain people will be caught under an unconstitutional statute and cannot get the point decided in the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that there is delay.  If, for instance, it was the other way round, and a person knew that it would depend on a Constitutional point, the intention is to make him go straight off to the High Court.  I am assuming that it was the other way round&mdash;not the case put by Deputies.  If it were the other way round and I was bringing a case and was choosing which court to go to on a matter which depended on a Constitutional point, the intention is that that would be taken to the High Court and decided there.  That is all right. If it were a case in the lower court, to hold up a case until a decision is taken by the High Court is a different matter. I think it would be very much better if we precluded the lower court from considering these cases at all and taking that point.  If it is to be raised, it should be raised in the High Court.  If there is some decision given in the lower court which might not have been the decision given, so to speak, if this point could have been taken, the remedy would lie in the person who thought he was aggrieved taking the matter to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised if that can be done in all cases.  My understanding was that in all cases you could seek your remedy, if the law under which the penalty was inflicted or a particular decision arrived at was in fact invalid; that the person who felt that the decision should have been otherwise because the law itself was invalid could go to the High Court and obtain a remedy.  If we could get agreement on that, I would prefer the procedure that the lower court should not touch it and that the matter should be decided definitely by the High Court.  I do not know myself whether there is a remedy in all cases. If there is not, I will admit that a case has been made by the Opposition. <Col N="1904" /> But, if there is a remedy in all cases, and I am informed that there is, then the procedure proposed here is much better.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 53:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Na focail &ldquo;nó don bhreitheamh sin di&rdquo; agus &ldquo;or such judge thereof&rdquo; fé seach do scriosadh as fo-alt 2º i gColúin 3 agus 4 ag Uimh.  Thagartha 25 agus na focail &ldquo;agus d'aon bhreitheamh agus do gach breitheamh <Col N="1907" /> di chun a ndéanfar an gearán san&rdquo; agus &ldquo;and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made&rdquo; fé seach do chur ina n-ionaid.</P>
    <P>At Reference No. 25 to delete in sub-section 2º in Columns 3 and 4 the words &ldquo;nó don bhreitheamh sin di&rdquo; and &ldquo;or such judge thereof&rdquo; respectively and substitute the words &ldquo;agus d'aon bhreitheamh agus go gach breitheamh di chun a ndéanfar an gearán san&rdquo; and &ldquo;and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made&rdquo; respectively.</P>
    <P>The amendment is intended to make quite clear that the complaint of a person that he is being unlawfully detained may be made in the first instance to any and every judge of the High Court and that upon refusal by one or more judges the application may be renewed before the other judges or any of them.  In other words, that you may make your application for a conditional order which is usually the first step in a <i>habeas corpus</i> application to the various judges of the High Court in succession.  That is to meet a point that was made by some speakers on the other side on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>The second step when a conditional order has been granted, is to have a careful judicial inquiry carried out into the legality of the detention.  It has been suggested by Deputy Costello that before 1922 there was a right to go from judge to judge after the legality of the detention was inquired into, and established.  I think he will find on consulting the Law Reports that this right was to go from court to court and not from judge to judge.  There must be some finality even in a <i>habeas corpus</i> proceeding and it is expected that under the Article, as amended, a decision by the High Court that a detention is legal will determine the matter so far as that court is concerned, but will leave it open to the applicant to appeal to the Supreme Court.  That was the old position which prevailed and it has not been disturbed by this amendment.</P>

      <P>But the Taoiseach is not pretending that there is no change being made from the present position?  Are we not going to have this position now: A person gets a conditional order of <i>habeas corpus</i> from one judge, whereupon the President of the High Court can call together a court of three judges, excluding from it the judge who gave the conditional order?  That is not the practice now.  Under this, the President of the High Court can say: &ldquo;I am going to have a court of three judges, but Judge X, who gave the conditional order, will not sit on it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Supposing the judge happened to be sick or for some other reason was unable to act, he naturally would be excluded.  The point is that, in practice&mdash;I am sure the practice will continue&mdash;the judge who gave the conditional order would be a member of the court.  I cannot imagine anybody determining the constitution of the court excluding him.  I do not think he would be excluded in the future.  At the same time you should not say explicitly that he shall be a member of the court because for some reason he may not be able to act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there was such a power, but that it was never exercised.  As far as I know the position was this: that, in important cases, the ultimate determination was generally made by a court of three judges.  Some one had to constitute the court.  I have never heard that there was an obligation on the person constituting the court to have one judge more than another on it: that it was obligatory on him to have the judge who gave the conditional order on it, but, as a matter of practice, he did it, and, as a matter of practice, I believe it will happen in this case, too.  There is no need to lay that down explicitly, because I think the President of the High Court, in selecting the members of the court, would advert to the importance of having the judge who heard <Col N="1910" /> the application in the first instance a member of the court.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is making a new piece of law now.  When I asked on the last occasion if it was considered desirable to give the President of the High Court the power to exclude the judge who gave the conditional order, the Taoiseach said he wanted to confer that power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not answer it that way.  The Deputy asked, would it be possible under this for the President of the High Court to exclude the judge who gave the conditional order.  I say, from the reading of this that it would, but that if he were going to take upon himself the responsibility for doing so, it would be against the usual practice, as I understand it.

      <P>That is not the context in which the remarks were made. The Taoiseach was making a great play with the fact that the amendment was quite simple, and only meant that he wanted a court of three to decide an important <i>habeas corpus</i> application instead of a single judge.  I said: &ldquo;Very good, it is a suitable amendment,&rdquo; and I asked: &ldquo;Does the amendment not carry with it the implication that it seemed to give the <Col N="1911" /> President of the High Court power, when forming the court, to exclude from that court the judge who gave the conditional order?&rdquo; and I was told that it was desired to give him that power.</P>

      <P>On this amendment, and on the Article to which it is an amendment, it has been stated that somebody from this side of the House made a statement.  The statement was made by Deputy Costello from firsthand knowledge of a case which came before the court here.  My recollection of what he said was that they had gone from judge to judge and gone to the last judge&mdash;the late Master of the Rolls, God rest his soul&mdash;in the case of Egan v. Macready; and on the date prior to the date fixed for the execution of Egan they got from the Master of the Rolls a conditional order&mdash;from the last judge in the last case.  That was the law in 1921 and that law was preserved, mainly through the work of the late Chief Justice Kennedy, in the first Constitution of this State.  It is now about to be altered, to the detriment of the individual.  I propose to vote against the alteration.</P>

      <P>I rise to propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a Select Committee consisting of five Deputies to be nominated by the Committee of Selection and with power to send for persons, papers and documents, be appointed to investigate publicly and report to the Dáil on the wholesale and retail prices charged for coal in the County Borough of Dublin, and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and to make recommendations:</P>
      <P>That the quorum of the Committee be three.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are very few sections of the people to-day that are not experiencing very great difficulties.  Through the increasing costs of everything, and the increasing difficulty in securing their incomes, they are, as I say, meeting with one kind of difficulty or another.  That is particularly so in the case of the poorer sections of the people, but everybody is affected, and I feel that in many matters to-day Deputies have duties and responsibilities from which, as in the case of soldiers in the presence of danger, or doctors in the presence of sickness and distress, they must not run away.  To see some of the injustices and to see some of the hardships that are being wrought to-day by administrative actions, and to stand by and do nothing about them, would be, from my point of view, a shameful thing, just as shameful as the soldier who ran away in the face of danger, or the doctor who turns his back on his patients or on sick or disabled people. No matter what may be said here or pointed out as to what are the objects of Deputies like myself in bringing forward these things, I have no intention whatever of turning my back on them or running away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appealed to the House before, in connection with other matters, that the business that it is the responsibility of this House to do, ought to be done systematically and carefully, and I have no intention here, in connection with this matter of coal&mdash;and never had any intention&mdash;but to ask that obvious <Col N="1913" /> facts in connection with the situation, obvious hardships and obvious injustices, should be looked at carefully and systematically, and that the necessary steps should be taken to remove these injustices and hardships; and I would ask the Minister for Supplies or any other Minister or Deputy who thinks otherwise, to give me credit for the moment, when presenting the case to the House, for approaching it in that way, and to look simply at the facts I put before them.</P>
    <P>My reason for raising this matter, as it has been raised by Deputy Alderman Byrne before and as it was raised by Deputy McGilligan, in the way in which the question now arises, is that certain facts show definitely that the prices charged for coal in the City of Dublin are higher than they should be. I want to submit to Deputies that the figures I propose to show here with regard to the position indicate a <i>prima facie</i> case that in the eleven weeks from the 18th January to the 6th April there was charged at least £71,000&mdash;and it may be £100,000&mdash;more for the coal that was issued here than was just or reasonable according to the prices charged, say, from August to November last.  That is, assuming that the prices charged from October to November last in the City of Dublin were reasonable, in the eleven weeks from the 18th January to 6th April at least £71,000 in excess of the reasonable profits of the previous months were charged during that period.  I say, at least £71,000, because that is not taking into consideration that persons who got their coal other than through bellmen or the small retailers were charged more as a matter of excess than were the persons who bought their coal through the bellmen and the small retailers.</P>
    <P>In discussing the question of coal a lot is heard about bellmen.  One principal reason why one hears so much about bellmen and the present cost to them in connection with the sale of coal is that they are a class of people in respect of whom we can readily get the prices they are charged.  The quality they get is a fairly standard quality and there are not the very <Col N="1914" /> elusive differences in the prices charged by the bellmen for coal as in the case of the ordinary householders who buy direct from the coal merchants. Now, the present position is that in December the bellmen were charged 53/- a ton for their coal; on the 10th January they were charged 52/- for about a week, and on the 18th January they were charged 58/-.  The Minister admitted to the House here that he had approved of the increases made at that particular time and approved of them in order to meet increases in freights and pit-head prices. On the 18th February, by Order, he further increased the prices that bellmen were charged for their coal to 63/-, and in the case of the small retailers to 68/-.</P>
    <P>In discussing the question as to whether the price charged for coal since January is excessive or not, I relate my arguments to the price charged to bellmen because they give you a regular, systematic, running line of prices, month by month, and I relate them to the import price of coal c.i.f., given by Parliamentary answer to this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This question was raised by Deputy McGilligan who asked on the 11th March whether an explanation could be given of the fact that while the import price of coal between January and February was raised by 1/3, the price charged to bellmen had risen from 52/- in the middle of January to 63/- in the middle of February.  The Minister for Supplies on the following day dealt systematically and thoroughly with the whole question in regard to the fixing of prices as related to the general position.  After he had dealt with it, I asked him could he deal with the question raised the night before and the Minister's answer simply was that I was endeavouring to stir up disturbance and unrest in the City of Dublin, that he knew what I was after, that I was disseminating lies, that I could put on the red hat of revolution if I wished to do so, but that I was not going to get very far with it.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister had some reason for suggesting that it would be <Col N="1915" /> easy to stir up feeling and disorder and, for that reason, I would ask him to treat this motion here seriously and to do something to get it carried into effect because if people sit down in committee to examine information systematically placed before them by the Department, if they exchange views in committee quietly without any heat or argument, there cannot be any unnecessary stirring up of feeling.  The truth must come out and, coming out in that way, it can be faced and the matter can be settled without any confusion, irritation or noise.  The Minister's answer to my motion was that it would be ineffective and that it was illegal.  On that point I want to say, that the motion is simple in form.  If there are any lies, the committee will deal with them, and if they are restricted in any way by the lies, they will come up against them.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied yesterday that he had recently made an offer in this matter and that if I had accepted it, the thing could be quietly settled in a few hours.  This motion appeared on the Order Paper almost immediately after our debate on the 14th March. On the 2nd April the Minister intimated in writing to me, through the Parliamentary Secretary, his views to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Motion re Coal Prices.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Supplies intends to inform the Dáil that the motion, in its present form, cannot be accepted owing to legal barrier to the disclosure of information furnished by private firms and other reasons.  He will state that he is prepared to accept a motion which would not require disclosure of confidential information and the purpose of which was to establish a committee to investigate whether coal prices now being charged in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire are reasonable. He will propose that the motion before the Dáil be withdrawn and that there should be consultation between the Whips as to the form of motion which might be accepted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was of opinion that the inquiry did <Col N="1916" /> not necessitate going into any unnecessary confidential information, and on the following day I sent back to the Minister a redraft of the motion.  I stated that I would be satisfied with a motion such as this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a Select Committee consisting of five or six Deputies, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to investigate whether the prices charged for coal in Dublin or Dun Laoghaire since the 1st January, 1941, are reasonable and to report to the Dáil, the quorum of the Select Committee to be three (or four).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wanted an inquiry without going into confidential documents or anything of that kind.  I wanted to go back to the 1st January, 1941, because between the 1st January, 1941, and the date that the Minister made this offer, which he says will settle everything, and which was only four days before he took 6/8 off the coal price himself, there had been an increase of 6/- a ton dating from the 18th January, which he stated here in February he had approved, and there had been an additional increase of 5/-, bringing the price up to 63/- per ton from the 18th February.  I consider this unreasonable and unjust.  On the basis that 30,000 tons of coal per week are sold in the City of Dublin, and assuming the August prices to be reasonable, I claim that there has been an overcharge of £71,000 at least.  That amount has been collected from the people on the wholesale price alone in these 11 weeks.  Therefore I was not satisfied, and did not think it reasonable, that the Minister would set up a committee on terms of reference which would prevent the coal position being looked at from the 1st January.  I did not want to go back any further.  Inside an hour of my submitting the motion to the Minister, he informed me that there was no purpose in going back, wasting valuable time of busy people, and added that the question was whether present prices were right or wrong.  The Minister, in fact, at the time he made the proposal to me, must have been actually in process of reducing the price of coal by 6/8 because, <Col N="1917" /> inside four days, it was reduced by 6/8.</P>

      <P>I told the Minister I was relating my argument to the price charged to bellmen and the excess price taken from bellmen.  I was applying that to the sale of coal in Dublin as a whole, even though the price charged to people other than bellmen was greater than that charged to bellmen, so that when I say £71,000 is the excess price, calculating that on the price charged to bellmen, I am being rather generous to the Minister. I just want to document my argument, because this is a matter simply of facts. The import price of all coal coming into the country placed alongside the quays, plus freightage, insurance, etc., for the month of July, 1940, was 40/7. In August it was 39/4; in September, 38/9; in October, 38/3; in November, 40/1; in December, 41/6; in January, 44/8; in February, 45/11, and in March, 4/68.  The prices charged to bellmen for the same months were, in the beginning of July, 49/-; from the 22nd July, 50/-; August, 50/-; September, 50/-; October, 50/-; November, 50/-; and December, 53/-.  At the beginning of January it was 53/-.  It was reduced to 52/- on 10th January.  It was increased to 58/- on 18th January, an increase which the Minister approved.  It was increased to 63/- on 18th February, and it continued at 63/- until 7th April, when, by another Ministerial order, it was reduced to 56/4.  The Minister mentioned that the price of 63/- to bellmen <Col N="1918" /> was a subsidised price.  He said, as reported at column 781, of 14th March, 1941:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The margin between the c.i.f price of coal sold to bellmen, and the price charged to them was normally 14/- a ton.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Official Records, at column 781, state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: The margin between the c.i.f. price of coal sold to bellmen, and the price charged to them was normally 14/- a ton.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to give certain figures as being the cost of certain things and states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The difference between 8/6½ and 14/- is 5/5½,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>so that there is more than a double-dyed error in the Official Reports if the Minister says 14/6.  However, it is not very material here whether it is 14/- or 14/6, but I am taking the Official Reports.  I say that that is not so, and I have told the House what the import price of coal was, and what was the price charged to bellmen over a certain period of months.  It is necessary to see what exactly the margin between the import price and the price charged to bellmen was during those months. The difference between the price charged to bellmen in the earlier part of July and the import price for July was 8/5.  From 22nd July, it was 9/5; in August, it was 10/8; in September, it was 11/3; in October, it was 11/9; in November, it was 9/11, and in December, it was 11/6.  From 1st to 10th January, it was 8/4; from 10th to 18th January, it was 7/4; then when the increase to 58/-, of which the Minister approved, came along, the margin was 13/4.  At the beginning of February it was 12/1, and from 18th February, when the Minister approved of the increase in price to 63/-, it was 17/1. During the month of March, it was 16/4.  That means&mdash;if we take the period July, August, September, October and November, when, over a steady period of something over four months, the price charged to bellmen <Col N="1919" /> was 50/- and the average import price was 39/5&mdash;that the margin between the import price and the price charged to bellmen was 10/7.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have plenty of time to do it.  There is no desire on the part of anybody in the House to restrict the Minister in dealing with this matter in the most thorough way.  The invitation, in fact, is that he should sit down together with a group from the different Parties in the House to discuss it, and to discuss it with all the facts put in black and white in front of us.  Again, I must say that the average price per ton for coal landed alongside the quay, with insurance and freight paid, during the five months July to November was 39/5.  The price charged to bellmen over the same period was 50/-, and I say that the difference between the import price and the price charged to bellmen over that period was 10/7.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's old kind of tactics.  The Minister can pursue them here if he likes. As well as to the Minister, with his predilections and his attitude in this matter, I am speaking to Deputy Tom Kelly, Deputy Breathnach, Deputy Lynch, Deputy McCann, Deputy Cooney, Deputy Briscoe; I am speaking to those Deputies in the House who have an interest or who ought to have an interest in standing up to their <Col N="1920" /> responsibilities, and who, when they see an aapparent wrong being done, should at least desire to sit down together to discuss that wrong and to stop it.</P>
      <P>I say that the difference between the price charged to bellmen in the months of July to November, over the c.i.f. price as given by the Minister, was 10/7 a ton.  When we come to the position as it existed in January, February and March of this year we find that from 18th January to 1st February there was an additional charge of 2/9; that from 1st February to 17th February there was an increase of 1/6 over that 10/7; that from 18th February to 28th February, the increase was 6/6; that the increase from 1st March to 6th April, when the Minister reduced it by order, was 5/9; that was the increase in the price charged to bellmen.</P>
      <P>The Minister has actually told us that, when he put on an additional 5/- on 18th February, he was allowing the merchants to charge persons buying coal other than through bellmen an additional 1/- in order to subsidise the price of 63/- to the bellmen, so that if the bellmen were overcharged in that particular way the public outside who bought through the merchants, and not through the bellmen, were overcharged even more.  But assuming that the overcharge to those who were buying coal in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire in that period was only the overcharge made to bellmen, then I say the increased overcharge in the period, on the assumption that there are 30,000 tons sold weekly in the City of Dublin, is £71,000.  When I take into consideration all the things that could, in addition, be allowed for, then that overcharge might run nearer to £100,000.  I base that statement on the fact that the margin between the import price and the price to bellmen over five months last year was 10/7, and that margin was substantially increased with the permission of the Minister on the 18th January and again increased by the order of the Minister on the 18th February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the Minister's attitude, I <Col N="1921" /> have been endeavouring, by means of Parliamentary Questions, to get further information on the subject.  In reply to Parliamentary Questions to-day I got information that I must regard as fantastic.  If I relate all the information supplied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the price at which coal is in the country, it may explain to me why the vagaries of the Minister for Supplies are so extraordinary, but it does not make my mind any more satisfied that an injustice is not being done; in fact, it intensifies my dissatisfaction and my concern in regard to the position.  The Minister has stated repeatedly that he has allowed increases in prices only because of increases in costs outside this country, either in pithead costs or in freights.</P>
    <P>To-day I asked him two questions. I asked him on whose advice he increased, by 5/- a ton, the price of coal to bellmen to 63/- a ton from the 18th February, 1941; what were the changes in the cost of imported coal which warranted this increase, and what were the grounds for his stating that this price of 63/- was a subsidised price. The reply given to me was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The price of coal to bellmen as from 18th February, 1941, was fixed after an investigation by my Department. The increase was less than the average increase in the c.i.f. cost of all coals arriving in Dublin at the time, the actual amount of which was 7/-.  On the basis of the c.i.f. cost at the time the price of coal supplied to bellmen would normally have been at least 65/-.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the way in which he explains why he allowed an increase of 5/- a ton and why he stated that the price of 63/-, to which the increase of 5/- brought the price of coal, was a subsidised price.  The reason given is that the average increase in the c.i.f. cost of all coals arriving in Dublin at the time amounted actually to 7/-.  He is explaining an action taken by him on the 18th February, but the c.i.f. price of coal for January was 44/8, and for February, 45/11, an increase of 1/3.</P>

An explanation was given here to-day that the Minister allowed an increase of 5/- per ton because the c.i.f. cost of coals arriving in Dublin was 7/- at the time and the increase in the c.i.f. cost in February over January was 1/3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to put myself as right as I could and through the medium of Parliamentary Questions I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to say what was the average import price of coal in the months of January and February and the Minister told me that the price was 44/8 over the month of January <Col N="1923" /> and 45/11 over the month of February, and I am figuring out by the ordinary rules of subtraction that the increase was 1/3.  In the middle of February the Minister for Supplies puts on an increase of 5/- and his explanation is that the average increase in the c.i.f. cost of all coals arriving in Dublin was 7/-.  That answer does not reassure me.  It does give me some kind of explanation of the vagaries of the Minister, but no assurance that the Minister is dealing with the matter properly.</P>
      <P>The other question I put to the Minister requested him to state what were the changes in the import cost of coal which caused the reduction in the price charged to bellmen of 6/8 a ton from the 7th April, 1941.  The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Between the time in February last when the price of bellmen's coal was fixed and April 7th there was an average reduction in the c.i.f. cost of all types of coal shipped to Dublin of approximately 3/- per ton. The prices fluctuated up and down in that period, but the general tendency was downwards in price.  It was decided to give the major part of the benefit of the reduction in the price of all coal imported to the coal allocated to the bellmen's dumps, the price of which coal was in consequence reduced by 6/8.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells me that the average import price of coal, c.i.f., in February was 45/11 and in March it was 46/8, an increase of 9d.  The Minister for Supplies balances off his phantasy of an increase of 7/- in February as against 1/3 by an apparent reduction of 3/- a ton as against an increase of 9d.  If prices are going to be controlled in that particular way, the Minister ought to have some definite explanation.  I think everybody would wish that the prices charged would run along in normal sequence and that the increase, if any, that is allowed would be an increase that could run in normal sequence in the same way as the average increase in the import price <Col N="1924" /> indicated by the figures the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave.  If we are to have jerks in prices, and if that is the way the Government is going to have it, very good, but do not let us have jerks that in a period of eleven weeks mulct coal consumers in the City of Dublin in a sum that represents between £71,000 and £100,000.</P>
    <P>We have a grave responsibility here and we ought to meet it in the most sensible way.  If there is any matter in respect of which irritation or wrong statements, even by persons like myself, can give rise to difficulty, then they should be stopped in the most systematic and effective way.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, and in the serious difficulties in which every class of the people find themselves, I do not know any Deputy who is not prepared to accept a fair presentation of facts.  I am presenting facts obtained from official figures, as far as the price of coal is concerned, and from men who paid these prices and showed me their books.  If any of these sets of figures have changed, looked at in any kind of way, the Minister has very elaborate machinery to show whether they are right or wrong. If the Minister in these circumstances will not allow a committee of this House to be set up to examine carefully, systematically and privately the case that is put before it, or that is put before it by his Department, then he is neglecting his duty.  It is he who is creating disturbed conditions. When I state superficial facts, knowing the circumstances of people in the city, I am not going to be prevented from raising my voice here and appealing to Deputies in every part of the House to do their best to get this thing stopped, and to clear my mind, and the minds of others, if we have got a wrong impression, either from the official figures or from the facts.  I take that responsibility seriously.  It is above politics, above personal inconvenience, above anything we might have to face, either abuse or misrepresentation. The situation we are dealing with is much too serious for people not to take their responsibilities seriously, and as members of the Dáil to be deterred by misrepresentation or abuse.  I am not <Col N="1925" /> going to be prevented from doing my duty.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks there is any danger in my presence, or thinks there is ignorance of the facts, then I put it to him it is his responsibility to put me right.  I am quite sure from questions that were raised in this House, that I am not the only person who is disturbed with regard to these facts, and that the Minister will find plenty to support my request that a Select Committee should be set up to examine this matter.  The Minister pointed out that my motion is not workable because it seeks to contravene the law.  There is nothing in that. It is in the common form of any resolutions of the kind put before the House. The committee will be circumscribed by whatever laws are there.  I should like the House to understand that, when that point was made by the Minister, I waived it completely.  The superficial facts are sufficient to establish the case and they can only be explained away to the committee in a systematic and official way by the Minister and his Department.  I do not believe they can be explained away.  I believe that an enormous sum of money has been taken from coal purchasers.  I know that while the poorer classes may have paid the smaller amount, what they have paid came very heavily upon them, and I consider Deputies in all Parties will be failing in a really serious public duty unless they support the motion to have the question examined systematically and thoroughly by a committee.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy made the statement that coal consumers in Dublin have paid from £70,000 to £100,000 in excess of the fair price for the coal they received during some recent period.  That is the type of statement which will get headlines in certain newspapers to-morrow morning, and I presume that is what Deputy Mulcahy wants, irrespective of the accuracy of his statement <Col N="1926" /> of the facts to support it.  I want to say here, with all the authority of my office, that that is utter nonsense. It is not merely utter nonsense but grossly unfair that any Deputy should make such a statement unsupported by facts, a statement which charges a body of coal importers in Dublin, who have been carrying on under circumstances of great difficulty, with very much less than normal supplies of coal, selling at prices fixed by me, prices which did not contain any element of excess profits much less permit of gross profiteering.  That charge is utterly unfounded and I think it is important that I should intervene at this stage to make that statement, because there are foolish and reckless people who would seize on Deputy Mulcahy's allegation for the purpose of creating trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in the most explicit manner that the statement has no foundation of any kind.  It arises entirely from Deputy Mulcahy's inability to understand the simple figures given out by the Government.  Will Deputy Mulcahy get it into his head that it is not possible to make a comparison between the average price of all coals imported at all the ports in the country over a whole month with the price of one class of coal imported on one day at one port.  There is no relationship between one and the other Deputy Mulcahy's error arose out of an attempt to compare an average price with the individual price.  Such a comparison is not possible.  If the Deputy wants to know what is a fair price for coal sold to bellmen in Dublin he has to find the c.i.f. cost of coal sold to bellmen or imported at Dublin. No other figure would enable him to determine what a fair price is. Deputy Mulcahy takes the average price of all coal imported to the whole country, say, last July, a period during which high-grade gas coal, high-grade volatile household coal was imported as well as low-grade steam coal, inferior classes of household coal for bellmen, and a number of other classes at varying prices, in varying districts, imported under varying conditions at <Col N="1927" /> various ports.  He takes that average price and compares it with the price then charged for one class of household coal imported at Dublin, and says the difference represents the margin of profit on the cost of importing that particular type of household coal at Dublin.  That is a complete fallacy. Does the Deputy understand that now? Is it possible to make the Deputy understand that?</P>

      <P>I will do my best.  I will take a simple sum in arithmetic. If the price of coal during the first week in January is £2 a ton, in the second week £4 a ton, in the third week £4 a ton, and if in the last week it falls to £2 a ton, what is the average price for the month?  £3 a ton.  Does the fact that the average price is £3 per ton mean that coal imported during the second week at £4 a ton must be sold at £3 a ton?  That is what Deputy Mulcahy is trying to argue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  Does the Deputy understand now that the average price of coal for the month of February has nothing whatever to do with the price of coal on 18th February?  If the Deputy is going to persist in his fallacy of comparing the average price of all coals imported into the whole country with the selling price of one class imported into Dublin, will he at least give the average price for the whole month for that one class?  Why does he compare the average import price for the month with the selling price on a particular date?  Why not compare it with the average selling price for a month? Surely that is commonsense and surely not to do so is to walk into an obvious error?  It did not occur to Deputy Mulcahy to do so because it did not suit his argument and because, if he had done so, he could not have made this fantastic statement about £100,000 excess profits.  That is his only reason <Col N="1928" /> for not doing so, or else he does not understand the elementary considerations which one must take into account when reading official statistics.</P>
      <P>I want to speak briefly about the motion.  Deputy Mulcahy is apparently under the impression that I am in some way inclined to shirk an investigation of the price of coal in Dublin.  On the contrary; I am willing to facilitate and anxious to procure an impartial investigation into the prices being charged for coal in Dublin, because I am satisfied that not merely will that investigation prove that the system of control in operation is effective, but it will dispose, once and for all, of this unfounded allegation of profiteering. Since coal prices have come under the control of my Department, there has been a systematic investigation of the costs of importing and distributing coal by skilled accountants employed in my Department.  Prices have been fixed by order.  Does the Deputy allege that I fixed these prices for the purpose of allowing the coal merchants to make excess profits?  Is that the purport of his allegation?  Surely he will at least admit that the efforts of the Department were directed to ensure that no excess profits would be made, and we are satisfied, from a continuous examination of the facts, that no excess profits have been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing, of course, not with figures which have no relation in the circumstances existing in Dublin.  We are dealing with the ascertained facts, procured from an examination of the records of the merchants, from their accounts, from the certificates of their auditors and from the documents they are made to produce.  There is no possibility of the coal merchants having withheld vital facts, and I want to say this, that at no time since my Department took this situation under control has there been any attempt on the part of coal merchants to withhold relevant facts.  On the contrary; the coal merchants of Dublin have co-operated wholeheartedly with my Department, not merely in the matter of making effective our system of price control, but also in the matter of <Col N="1929" /> administering the system of rationing in operation, and particularly in this matter of procuring a supply of good coal at the lowest possible price for the poor of the city.  I think it is a shame that these men should be blackguarded in the way in which they have been blackguarded, and I think it about time that somebody made a protest against this attempt, for purely Party purposes and to cause mischief, to represent that body of men as having engaged in profiteering.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that some of them would not engage in it, if they were allowed.  None of them was any friend of mine, politically or personally, and Deputy Mulcahy knows that, but I want to testify here that these men have assisted my Department and cooperated with me in every way they were asked to do so.  They have never hesitated to produce any information we desired, or to come to my Department for consultation when requested. A number of them have acted upon the board of Fuel Importers, Ltd., without any remuneration, for the sole purpose of building up a reserve of coal in Dublin to serve the needs of the poor. They have acted upon advisory committees established in consultation with my Department, committees which take a great deal of their time, and for which they received no reward, not even thanks up to the present, and they as well as any other section of the community are entitled to a fair deal in this House.  I have allowed this agitation, this false agitation, about the price of coal to proceed for some time, but it is about time it was checked.</P>
    <P>Let me say these few words about the bellmen in the few minutes left to me.  The situation in relation to the Dublin bellmen can easily develop into a ramp.  I have met these bellmen; officers of my Department have met most of them, and they are reasonable men.  They understand the difficulties and appreciate what is being done for them.  They are willing to assist my Department in making effective the arrangements we have brought into force, but it is inevitable that if <Col N="1930" /> men, no matter how reasonable, are led to believe that by creating an agitation they can get more and more of what they want they will be induced into undertaking that agitation.</P>
    <P>They have been led so to believe by the efforts of Deputy Mulcahy to create in their minds the impression that he, and he only, was responsible for the institution of these arrangements which guarantee them, firstly, a supply of the best coal available, secondly, an adequate supply of that coal, so long as it can be procured, and, thirdly, that coal at a subsidised price.  I think it is known to every Deputy, and should be known outside the House, that these arrangements were brought into force by my Department without the knowledge of Deputy Mulcahy or any other Deputy, and that this House learned of these arrangements only when they were brought into force.  They were brought into force for the purpose of ensuring that the poor of Dublin, those who buy their coal from the bellmen, would be guaranteed a supply of the best coal available at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>I want it to be understood, not merely by Deputies but by the bellmen, that these arrangements were made for that purpose, for the purpose of securing coal for the poor at reasonable prices.  These arrangements of central dumps and subsidised prices, and the allocating of portions of all cargoes to the dumps, were not made primarily for the benefit of the bellmen, and I know that some of these bellmen are getting out of these dumps at present more coal than they distributed in normal circumstances.  I can give figures if they are required. I also know that some of them are not giving that coal to the poor of the city, but that they are bringing it out &mdash;and any Deputy who cares to make the journey can find it out&mdash;to the roads in the residential parts of the city and selling that coal to wealthy ration-dodgers, people who have already got their quarter-ton ration from their own merchants, but who do not hesitate to buy an additional supply from bellmen when they can get it.</P>

      <P>I want it to be understood that these arrangements were not made for that purpose.  I want the bellmen to understand it, and I want those concerned with the interests of the bellmen to understand that, if that practice should continue, these arrangements will have to be changed.  When we made the arrangements, we intended that each of the bellmen being supplied from a central dump would furnish to my Department a list of the customers he intended to supply, a list of the customers he ordinarily supplied. The purpose of that list was to ensure that the coal would go to the people for whom it was intended.  Only two of the 500 bellmen in Dublin have as yet supplied that list, and there appears to be some organised movement amongst them to deter bellmen from supplying it.  It may be necessary, if the requirements of my Department are not met, to make arrangements that will ensure that only bellmen who comply with that condition will be supplied from a central dump. Whether by that means or some other means, it is my intention to ensure <Col N="1932" /> that the coal specially provided in these dumps at subsidised prices will go to the people who I intend, should get it, the poor of the city, and to nobody else.</P>
