      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware that considerable trouble and loss has been sustained owing to the delay in introducing an Act of Indemnity to legalise the judgments of the Land Settlement Courts; whether there are not a great many cases affected, and whether receivers appointed by the Land Settlement Courts are still in occupation of lands, and if he will state what action he intends to take in the matter.</P>

      <P>Out of some hundreds of cases which came before the Land Settlement Courts and which were still unsettled in 1922, there are now not more than one dozen cases <Col N="932" /> outstanding.  The balance has been satisfactorily settled by the parties concerned. I am hopeful that most of the outstanding cases will still be settled, and the Land Commission have been intervening in some of those cases for that purpose.  If, however, the Land Commission are unable to make final arrangements in any of the outstanding cases owing to the unreasonableness of the parties or otherwise, the necessary legislation will be introduced to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have no information as to the user of the lands by the members of the Society, but have asked the Land Bank for particulars of the lands referred to for the purposes of the Land Act, 1923, and when received the lands will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been drawn to the report of the Auditor of the accounts of the Monaghan Urban District Council, dated the 21st February, 1924, in which the weekly wage of 47s. 6d. paid to the Council's employees is described as &ldquo; extravagant,&rdquo; and a surcharge is threatened if such payments are found at the next audit to have been continued; whether he is aware that workers employed by private persons in Monaghan Town as railway labourers, builders' groundmen and hodsmen, etc., receive wages of 45s. 6d., 47s., 48s., and 50s. a week; and whether he considers that the fact that an Auditor differs from the local authority in his judgment as to what constitutes a normal, reasonable or expedient payment is sufficient to constitute a payment &ldquo; unfounded&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 12 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1871.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>I have no information as to the rates of wages paid to the employees mentioned in the second part of the question, but it is of course open to any interested party to bring any material information under the notice of the Auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> Under Section 12 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1871, an auditor is empowered to disallow and strike out all payments, charges and allowances which are made contrary to law or which he deems to be unfounded, and he has full power under the statute to review all payments which he considers to be excessive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The 15th July is the earliest date on which the elections could be held on the new Register now approaching completion, and if it is generally desired they can be held on that date.  It may possibly be considered feasible to alter the date in the course of discussion on the Local Government Bill, 1924, which is being introduced. It would be desirable that the law concerning election procedure and abuses made applicable to the Dáil elections in the Electoral Act, 1923, should be extended to local government elections, but it is doubtful whether a measure to this effect can be included, having regard to the extent of the current legislative programme.</P>

      <P>I wish to place on record my dissent from the second of these two proposals.  It is with great regret that I would oppose any recommendation of a Committee which has gone very carefully into a matter that has been referred to them by the Dáil, but I do very strongly feel that it is my duty to oppose this recommendation. The reference to the Committee arose, I think, from a proposal to introduce into the Standing Order recognition of an Associate of the Royal College of Science.  To that personally I should have no objection whatever, but I fail to follow the Committee in their <Col N="941" /> accompanying that by a withdrawal of a recognition which they had previously granted to university graduates of practical experience and practical standing. It seems to me to be quite a wrong line to take.  We support universities; they have been endowed and given certain powers and functions. One of these functions is to give qualification for professional work, provided such qualification is accompanied by practical work in the profession under consideration.  This one is the work of engineering.  It seems to me to be a mistake to give such a function to a university on the one hand, and then to withdraw it on the other as soon as ever a case arises in which that qualification might be put to practical use. I know it will be said in reply that the university graduate can get such recognition by joining one of the societies that are mentioned in the remaining part of the Standing Order, but I do not know whether all the members of the Committee think that they ought to sit on the Labour Benches and belong to trade unions.  I personally am not supporting&mdash;in fact I am disapproving of any such hidden attempt to compel professional men to belong to their own Trade Unions.  It seems to me the effect of this proposal of the Committee will be that it will compel university men, before they can get proper advantage from the qualifications they obtained, to become a member of one of these societies.  The societies are very good, and I am a very strong advocate of these societies, but I do not believe in that sort of compulsion being put on engineers or any other professional men to join such societies.  I do not know what kind of support these views will get in the Dáil, but I do believe it is incumbent on me to give such expression to them as I can give, and to express my own very strong dissent from this recommendation of the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg for leave to move the introduction of the Local Government <Col N="942" /> Bill of 1924.  This Bill introduces various reforms in the law of Local Government, which our experience has proved to be necessary or desirable. The main object of the Bill is the unification of the administration of various local services with a view to greater economy and efficiency.  The two main portions of the Bill are those dealing with roads and public health.  Modern developments in transport make a complete change in our policy with regard to roads highly desirable, if not absolutely necessary.  Accordingly, we propose to make various changes in the law, changes which will be looked on from the point of view of the nation, rather than from the parochial standpoint, which was the point of view from which most changes in the law relating to road administration were made previously.</P>
      <P>The public health portion of the Bill provides for the placing of the administration of health services in the county, both curative and preventive, under one body.  Heretofore, the administration of health services was divided between various authorities&mdash;Boards of Guardians, County Council Committees, Rural District Councils, and various other authorities.  This change, it is hoped, will do away with a great deal of confusion and numerous anomalies, and make for much greater simplicity and much greater efficiency in the administration of our public health services.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for certain changes in the law relating to superannuation. The law of superannuation was in many respects very indefinite heretofore.  It also makes various changes of a miscellaneous character in the general law of local government.  I do not think there is anything further to say at this stage, I will go very fully into the matter on the Second Reading, but I would bespeak for this Bill in its passage through the Dáil, the cordial co-operation and friendly criticism of the Deputies, many of whom I know have very valuable and enlightened views on matters relating to public health and local government, views derived from practical experience in the administration of local authorities.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, shall, in the case of a person dying on or after the 1st day of April, 1924, be read as if there were added after paragraph (d)  thereof the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> (e)  Any personal or moveable property situate out of Saorstát Eireann taken as a <i>Donatio mortis causa</i> made by any person dying domiciled in Saorstát Eireann, or taken under a disposition made by any person dying domiciled in Saorstát Eireann and purporting to operate as an immediate gift <i>inter vivos</i> whether by way of transfer, delivery, declaration of trust, or otherwise which shall not have been <i>bona fide</i> made at least three years before the death of the deceased, and any personal or moveable property situate out of Saorstát Eireann taken under any gift, whenever made, by any person dying domiciled in Saorstát Eireann of which <i>bona fide</i> possession and enjoyment shall not have been assumed by the donee immediately upon the gift and thenceforward retained to the retire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(2)  That in the case of property passing on the death of a person dying on or after the 1st day of April, 1924, sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, shall be read as if there were added thereto the words &ldquo;or but for the provisions of Section 38 of the Stamp Duties (Ireland) Act, 1842, or of Section 18 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It simply means that these gifts that were made by a person within three years of his death were, if situated outside the late United Kingdom, not liable to estate duty.  The Acts have been adapted so that Saorstát Eireann is substituted for &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; and that means that property of that nature in such circumstances outside Saorstát Eireann is not liable for estate duty.  For instance, if a man within three years of his death gave a certain amount of Guinness's shares, as Guinness is a British Company, registered in England, that would not be liable to estate duty.  If, however, he gave Great Northern shares, the company being within the <Col N="945" /> Saorstát, the amount would be liable to duty.  It is to remove what is an anomaly and to restore for all practical purposes the position which obtained before the Treaty.  It will bring in property not previously liable, that is property outside the late United Kingdom, but that is of little consequence, when we have regard to property situated in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and owned by people who may die in the Free State.</P>

      <P>That in the case of property passing on the death of a person who dies on or after the 1st day of April, 1924,</P>
      <P>(a)  Section 47 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, shall not operate to exempt from any taxation to which but for that section as adapted it would be liable, the capital or interest of any of the securities therein referred to so long as they are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are either domiciled or ordinarily resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Section 63 of the Finance Act, 1916, shall not operate to <Col N="946" /> exempt from any taxation to which but for that section as adapted it would be liable, the capital or interest of any of the securities therein referred to so long as they are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are either domiciled or, being British subjects, are ordinarily resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This resolution is to remove exemption from estate duty which exists on British war securities when they are owned by a person domiciled or ordinarily resident in the late United Kingdom. There is no reason why this particular exemption should remain, and, in fact, we are removing all this exemption from taxation which British war securities enjoy.  We did so in the main case last year, and we are in this resolution completing that.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> This repeals exemption from estate duty, &ldquo;of common seamen, marines or soldiers who are slain or die in the service of Her Majesty.&rdquo;  We feel that there is no reason for exempting the property of British soldiers from that duty in this country.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in the said Resolution&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Section 53 of the Finance Act, 1921, from the beginning of the section down to the words &ldquo; Finance Act, 1920, and&rdquo; (being so much of the said section as enacts that the interest received by a company on certain British Government securities shall not form part of the profits of the company for the purposes of corporation profits tax) be repealed as regards any accounting period ending after the 31st day of March, 1924.</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
      <P>This is another case of exemption of British War Securities from certain practices.  The Finance Act, 1919-1920, provides for the purposes of the Corporation Tax that the dividends on these British securities shall not be reckoned as part of the profits of the company.  There is no reason why that exemption should be retained, and, as I have already said, we are removing that.  As I also said, it is really a matter that should have been done in the Finance Act of last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that this particular tax is on all fours with the others.  Most people are agreed that the Corporation Tax is really a war tax that should have been repealed long ago.  That being so, I think it is hardly fair so long as the tax is continued to withdraw certain easements in connection with that tax.  The Corporation Tax has long been a source of irritation <Col N="948" /> to commercial men, both in this country and in the sister Isle.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the sister Isle was more willing to consider the views put forward by the commercial community in connection with this tax, and he agreed that the reasons that had been put forward for the abolition of this tax were reasonable, so much so that he abolished fifty per cent. of the tax in the Budget of last year, and abolished the whole of the tax in the Budget of this year. It was pointed oat to the Minister for Finance here that if he could do something in a similar direction it would help to revive industry and reduce the number of unemployed, but instead of in any way relieving this burden he proposes to withdraw under the resolution certain easements in that tax. I take it from the wording of this resolution, assuming a company had some of its reserves invested in the War Loan, and the interest derived from these investments was brought in as profits heretofore, that the interest arising from those, which would really be part of the profits of a limited company, was exempt from this tax.  Instead of easing the burden, the Minister is going to make it heavier by withdrawing those easements.  I would press this matter on the Minister, and remind him that we are getting to a stage at which the commercial community is being loaded with a load which it can hardly carry.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this will necessarily impose any burden on the company, because they can exchange those securities.  Any company that feels that it does not want and ought not to be burdened unduly can sell these securities at prices which will take into account the fact that they are exempt from this particular tax.  They can sell securities at that price and buy others which are not exempt, and I believe that they will be able to gain something in income by the exchange which will compensate them.  It seems to me that it is quite impossible for this Government to give exemption from taxation on securities other than its own securities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not quite accurate in what he states, that money can be transferred into other securities. In cases of the kind mentioned those particular moneys must be easily available. In those particular securities it must be money you can change into cash at a few moments' notice.  With all respect to the Minister, there are very few Irish securities you can do that with, at the moment, without suffering serious loss.  That is a serious matter for business firms.  I am sure if the Minister were to consult a large number of commercial men he would get the same story from the whole of them.  We invest in a security which we can transfer into cash at a few moments' notice.  That being so, I do not think the reasons put forward by the Minister are quite adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Resolution there is one word I would like to say which deals with what Deputy Good said a few moments ago.  The commercial community is beginning to feel itself overburdened, and, therefore, the suggestion is that some of the taxes which fall most heavily on the commercial community should be lightened. The agricultural community say, too, that taxation falls heavily upon them. They are overburdened and they cannot afford even what they are at present called upon to pay.  The general working classes realise, as consumers, that they are excessively burdened through the taxation upon so many commodities which they consume, and if there is any lightening of taxation we claim that it should come through those ordinary necessaries of life and common luxuries in general consumption. Who else, then, is there?  If Deputy Good's plea cannot be acceded to, or, if, on the other hand, Deputy <Col N="950" /> Good's plea can be acceded to, to whom does he think the Minister should look to bear this burden?  Is he willing to suggest to the Minister that there is a source of income that has not been sufficiently brought into operation to fill the Treasury, and that is the ground landlords of urban areas?</P>
      <P>I suggest that if the information is not at present in the hands of the Minister, it would be well to have immediately set on foot an inquiry into the possibilities of drawing into the National Exchequer a very large proportion, if not the whole, of those values which have been created by the community, but which hitherto have been enjoyed by the ground landlords of the towns and cities.  Perhaps Deputy Good, realising that neither the commercial community nor the agricultural community, nor the working-class community can afford to continue bearing the present burden, would agree with me that we should look to this small section of the community, which has for long been enjoying privileges which legislatures, chiefly manned by landlords, were able to impose upon the community for the benefit of ground landlords. I wonder would Deputy Good and those associated with him agree in pressing upon the Minister the necessity of looking in this direction for some of the funds which are required to relieve commerce, agriculture, and the general consumer of some of the present burden of taxation.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether there is, at present, available all the information regarding the sums yearly drawn by ground landlords from the cities and towns of the Saorstát, and to what extent is that annual income taxable and taxed; what is the revenue which he derives from taxation on the ground rentals of the towns and cities of the Free State, and if he cannot give that information, whether he will institute an inquiry, public or private, into the possibilities of revenue from that source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to proceed very slowly in the direction in which Deputy Johnson is anxious he should proceed. This is only a veiled form of capital levy that is suggested by Deputy Johnson, <Col N="951" /> and which some people, possibly not incorrectly, call confiscation of property. Whatever may have been said on that particular point, which Deputy Johnson has urged, a great number of years ago, when the matter was very much more questionable than it is today, a great many people in recent years have invested money in ground rents.  It was an attractive form of investment, and why it should be now proposed to attack that more than any other form of investment I have yet to get a reason.  I think this idea that is floating around the Dáil, and that is in the minds of many in the country, that we are doing right in attacking investments, is doing an immense amount of harm and injury to the country.  We are anxious in this State to establish confidence in this community, and if we proceed along the lines suggested by Deputy Johnson, I am afraid we will not do either of those things.  Most of the members of the Dáil will agree that the direction I have indicated is the direction we should follow in the national interest.</P>

      <P>I have only to say in this matter that we realise very fully that the system of taxation which we have inherited was a system devised with reference to the needs and conditions in another country, and that it is not necessarily in many important respects suitable to this country, and in other respects is clearly unsuitable. We are having investigation made in several directions with a view to seeing what changes can be made so that the incidence of taxation shall give the best opportunities and the best encouragement for development here.  We feel it is a matter on which sudden changes should not be made, or changes that have not been well thought out, and for that reason we are looking into the whole system of taxation at the present time.</P>

      <P>Before the amendment is put let me say it deals with Sections 23 and 24, and is a proposal to abolish both sections and to substitute instead this one section.  I note that it has been described by the mover of the amendment as an attempt to get an immediate decrease by way of a revision of rates.  I may point out that, as drafted, it will not achieve its aim, because it definitely states &ldquo;fares, tolls and dues, charged by the amalgamated company,&rdquo; and that will have the effect of postponing any preliminary revision of fares or rates until the amalgamated company comes into existence.  The amalgamated company does not come into existence until the 1st of January next. Consequently under this amendment so far from there being any hastening of revision of fares, there would be actually a postponement.  The object of this Section is to have immediately on the passing of the Bill a preliminary revision of rates.  This amendment if passed frustrates that main object.  For that reason I urge against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to substitute the words &ldquo;any railway company&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;amalgamated company&rdquo; wherever these words occur in the amendment?  The amendment would then read: &ldquo;the rates, fares, tolls and dues charged by any railway company,&rdquo; and so on.  In that case then the railway company would have the right to reduce their rates and tolls at once, whereas otherwise we would have to wait until the formation of the amalgamated company.  I am only making a suggestion.  I am not the mover of the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy overlooks the fact that the amendment seeks also to give the companies the right to increase their rates.  I rise, however, to ask the Minister why the Bill only deals with rates so far as the amalgamating <Col N="953" /> or absorbed companies are concerned. How is it that he has left out of the Bill any question of the revision of rates by the companies that cross the Border line or the companies that have their headquarters inside the Free State, seeing that the Tribunal has the power to revise rates for that section of the railways not amalgamated where the mileage is inside the Free State?</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Davin that the material point he has just raised is dealt with in a later section&mdash;Section 30&mdash; which deals with rates and tolls of companies who are not in the scheme but portion of whose line is in the Saorstát.  As regards Deputy Wilson's suggestion to put in the words &ldquo;any railway company,&rdquo; that would remove one objection I have urged, that the mere putting in of the words &ldquo;amalgamated company&rdquo; would postpone automatically any revision of fares until the first of January.  This amendment has to be looked at in comparison with Sections 23 and 24, and I hold, and I would like to impress on the Dáil that Sections 23 and 24 give room for the immediate, almost compulsory, revision, of rates.  This amendment would leave it to the good graces of the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendment is put I would like if the Minister could give an answer to the last Deputy, because this question of rates has been under consideration, in fact it has been expected for some considerable time.  The position is this: that on the 1st of January of this year the railways in the Northern area made a reduction in freights and in the ordinary rates, bringing them down to 75 per cent. over pre-war figures, and there was at the time, I understand, an intention on the part of several of the companies in the Free State to make a considerable reduction in their rates. <Col N="954" /> I do not know whether they intended to go as far as the Northern group have gone or not.  But it was conveyed to them that possibly a more fitting opportunity would arise for them if they held up or delayed making that reduction until this Act would be passed, when it might possibly lead or help to popularise the Act after it had been passed, as one of the things that had been brought about.  But as we found out in commercial circles, it has been holding up for six months all those reductions that we expected or anticipated would come into force on the railways on the 1st of January last.  I am sure the Minister has considered this matter with the officials concerned, and perhaps he would give us some information as to when we may expect the reduction referred to here in clause 23 and 24.  I think that clause provides that within three months of the passing of the Act the Tribunal would consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

      <P>If Deputy Good would consult his friends in railway managerial circles, especially the managers who are likely to come under the lash of this Bill, he would find that he has not actually stated the position as it exists.  I understand on fairly good authority that the last time the revision of rates was suggested at an Irish and English traffic conference, which is the authority dealing with such questions, it was put up to the Irish companies who are now coming under this Bill that if there was to be any concessions to the trading community in the nature of relief of rates, that the Irish companies should reduce their local or internal rates.  They positively declined to give way in any respect in regard to any reduction of rates internally, with the result that any reduction of rates which was in the nature of ten per cent. was by way of subsidy to the Irish railways in the southern area.  I am sure Deputy Good, as a trader, should be well acquainted with all these things, especially as he has experience with railway companies.  If that is the position, it is an indication to me at any rate that the companies he is now concerned with, and to whom he makes an appeal for a reduction of rates, are not going to deal in that direction until this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> The reason is because this threat of unification, or, if the Government had the courage, nationalisation, has been hanging over their heads and they were very anxious to accumulate as much funds as possible, so that they might be in a stronger position when it would come to a question of making a bargain.  That is the real reason that they have done nothing.  Perhaps if Deputy Good happened to be on a board of directors he would be in a position to give that explanation to the Minister&mdash;an explanation that I say is the proper one.</P>

      <P>Well, he is supporting an amendment the very purpose of which on the face of it, and as was explained in the last discussion, is to allow the railway companies to raise rates and prevent reductions until after the amalgamated companies are formed and have had time to approach the tribunal, and until the traders desiring reduction have a chance of also approaching the tribunal, all of which means delay.  That is the purpose of the amendment&mdash;to prevent reductions in railway rates until the tribunal is set up, until the amalgamated company is formed and until the traders on the one hand and the company on the other have had an opportunity of pleading their case before that tribunal. The purpose of the amendment which Deputy Good is supporting is to prevent a reduction in railway rates before January next. <Col N="956" /> That is the proposal of Deputy Hewat, and it is also the proposal of Deputy Alfred Byrne, who is not here.  That is the intention of every Deputy who supports this amendment.</P>

      <P>I expected that my colleague would be here to deal with this matter and to take the burden on his own shoulders.  I have not had the pleasure of hearing what the Minister had to say on the subject, but I thought on the last occasion that we had arrived at a point when we had almost convinced the Minister that there was good reason for the amendment being adopted.  It is true that Part 4 of the amendment does give the railway power to apply to the tribunal for an increase, but that is only <i>per contra</i> as compared with the powers that it tries to provide for the railway tribunal being asked to reduce the rates.  I would be sorry to see the railway companies coming with the proposal to increase the charges.  I do not think it is likely, and I think it is even less likely that such a proposal would be considered favourably by anybody.  It is a fair clause and it is based on exactly the same lines as clause 30, which refers to non-amalgamated companies.</P>
      <P>At a later stage there is an amendment in my name to delete the section, so I can hardly argue in favour of the retention of the clause at all.  I do think that the companies should be in a position to ask the Tribunal to reduce the rates, and at all events that the business community should be in a position to immediately approach the Tribunal.  If the railway companies are not willing to reduce the rates, it is for the business people to come forward and demand that the rates shall be reduced, instead of waiting for a very long time until the various processes which are embodied in this Bill are put into operation, transforming the whole method of working the railways out of the position they are in into a sea of uncertainty.  I would urge upon the Minister that the amendment would be an improvement on the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I have a very good reason, which I stated before in Deputy Hewat's absence, for not accepting the amendment.  As the amendment stands, the use of the words &ldquo;amalgamated company&rdquo; postpones until the 1st January next any reduction which might take place.  There can be no reduction under the amendment until the amalgamated company comes into being.  It is now proposed by Deputy Wilson to insert &ldquo;any company&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;amalgamated company&rdquo; wherever that phrase occurs.  But then there is the phrase &ldquo;the appointed day.&rdquo;  What is that?  Does Deputy Wilson propose any further amendment to get rid of that difficulty?  I suggest to the Dáil that instead of tackling this piecemeal and whittling it down they should attend to Sections 23 and 24.  I think the wording of Section 23 has not been attended to.</P>
      <P>As regards the statement about the English companies reducing rates, they did voluntarily do so.  If the companies here are anxious voluntarily to reduce rates it is in their power to do so.  A question has been asked in reference to my expectation as to when a preliminary revision would take effect.  I can answer that better on Section 24. If the Ceann Comhairle agrees to have one simple statement made here, inasmuch as the amendment deals with both sections, I can simply point out again that the charges now enforced arose mainly through the general percentage order made by the Ministry of Transport in 1920, and that the increase of 120 per cent. was made mainly on this consideration: That a deficit was accruing and that charges were so established that in eleven months a revenue would be derived to make up for a deficit accruing over a period of sixteen months.  That being the basis of the percentage order of 1920, it is quite obvious that there should be almost immediately a reduction in the rates immediately after the passing of this Bill.  I have no definite information as to when that reduction will take place.</P>

      <P>Yes.  But unless one is to assume right off without any examination that the charges of the non-amalgamated companies are all as right as right could be the provisions regarding these companies are not as satisfactory as they should be, particularly to those who expected a reduction immediately, as will be the case with the amalgamated companies. Under Section 30 the rates to be charged by those companies outside the amalgamated companies shall be such as were in operation at the time of the passing of the Act.  They shall not be subject to any review or reconsideration except that representative bodies of traders apply, or any trader interested in any particular charge, and the hearing has to take place and the whole procedure has to be published.  All that may be perfectly right if one were justified in assuming that the existing charges of these companies outside the amalgamated companies were satisfactory. There may be companies in addition to the Great Northern which will not be brought in under the terms of this Bill as at present drafted, and their rates will not be subject to review. Is it intended that they shall be allowed to charge their present rates <Col N="959" /> until the regular procedure is followed before the tribunal, and why should they be placed in an advantageous position over the amalgamated companies. I suggest that the omission of these companies from its review as provided under Section 24 requires some justification from the Minister.</P>

Meantime the Tribunal may put in force a reduction in rates that could not be altered before the appointed day.  If these rates were put in force by the Tribunal within three months of the passing of the Act, that might possibly mean a reduction which would to some extent <Col N="960" /> endanger the stability of the companics themselves and these rates would have to be carried on for a very considerable time, and in fact an indefinite time.

      <P>I did not catch what Deputy Hewat said, but apparently he was not prepared to take his courage in both hands and move his amendment. Although I have agreed to withdraw the amendment standing in my name, I feel certain, though I hope I will be disappointed, that the work which this Tribunal will be called on to do in connection with the operation of Section 24 cannot be done in a satisfactory <Col N="961" /> way within the time laid down in the Section.  Deputy Good has laboured the point here on several occasions in regard to the attitude of the Northern companies in reducing their rates so much below the figure in operation in the Free State area.  When the Railway Commission was sitting and dealing with the question of railway reorganisation, two of the small railway companies which are now outside the terms of this Bill came before the Commission and stated definitely and frankly that if the existing rates of wages and working expenses at that time were to continue they would have to close down.  The railway rates at that particular time were the same all over Ireland.  These companies, strange to say, have reduced their rates to the same figures as are in operation in the North of Ireland, and they have not closed down.  The rates of wages have not been altered from what was in operation at the time they made that statement before the Railway Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can Deputy Good tell the Dáil where the subsidy is coming from which enables these companies to carry on now in view of the statement they made when giving evidence before the Railway Commission?  It is obvious that they must be getting a subsidy from somewhere, or else the statement they made before the Railway Commission could not be correct.  This section states &ldquo;that with a view to the modification of such charges or any of them having regard to the circumstances under which increased charges were authorised from the 1st September, 1920, and to any reduction in working expenses since that date.&rdquo;  I feel that is the rock on which the Tribunal will fall in their attempt to carry out the work in the period laid down in the section.  I have made the statement here, and I repeat it, though it has not been dealt with by Deputy Good, that the reduction in the rates of wages and working expenses for all the Irish railways since wages and working expenses reached their peak point, extended to a sum of three millions a year.  If the railway companies who come within the terms of this Bill were so anxious to facilitate the public in regard to fair and reasonable rates, <Col N="962" /> I think that Deputy Good on their behalf, or someone else acting on their-behalf, should explain why they did not make some reduction out of the great saving they effected in reductions in wages, costs, coal, and other materials. If there was any desire on their part to give reductions, they had the opportunity of doing so when the reduction in wages and working expenses took place, but they did not avail of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good said that labour can do a great deal in regard to assisting the tribunal to bring about that very desirable result, namely, a reduction in rates to the trading community.  When the question comes to be settled and decided by the tribunal statements will be made presumably by the people who are anxious to get reductions.  The companies will come before the tribunal with the assistance of experts, and no doubt they have many experts in regard to the figures which they prepare from time to time, and try to counteract the case that I have stated. That will take time, and I believe it will take such a long time that the three months laid down in the Bill will not be sufficient to cover the period necessary to review the rates in a satisfactory way, and in the way that we look to see them reviewed.  I now come to deal with the question of the reduction of wages and the assistance which it is alleged the Labour Party and the Railwaymen's Trade Union can bring to bear on that and which Deputy Good is so anxious to secure.  The representatives of the Irish Railwaymen entered into agreement with the Associated Railway Companies in regard to wages and conditions of service. At the time that agreement was entered into the bonus system was in operation, and the railwaymen agreed that the bonus should be reduced in accordance with the cost of living figure which is published from time to time by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  That agreement has been faithfully carried out, with the result that £1,500,000 has been saved by the railway companies.  I do not know what more Deputy Good can expect from the railwaymen than that, and if the railway companies are not anxious to take advantage of what they secured <Col N="963" /> in that bargain I say they have made no case for the further reduction that Deputy Good is anxious to secure.  I hope that disposes of that particular argument so far as Deputy Good is concerned until at any rate he puts up some more effective argument than the one he has already brought forward. I hope when the railway tribunal comes to deal with the question of the revision of rates and fares that it will take into consideration the fact that railway rates in this country have been so framed as to be in the nature of a tariff upon the food and produce consumed at home, while they act as a preference on the food which England imports from this country.  That is an aspect of the question which I hope the railway tribunal will take into consideration that the railway rates inside Ireland will not place on the home consumer a more unfair burden as regards the cost of the commodity than they confer on the English people who consume the surplus exports from this country.  Railway rates generally on food products are three or four times greater internally than they are in regard to through rates that are in operation for food exported out of the country.  That is a very important question which I hope the tribunal will not overlook when it comes to deal with this question in an exhaustive way.  There is another question, and that is the increased rates which the railway companies derive under the operations of the Ministry of Transport Act.  Under that Act there has been an all-round increase of four, ten, or even one hundred per cent.  I hope when the tribunal comes to consider the question that is referred to in this section, particularly in the initial stages, that it will give all the consideration it possibly can give to the question of an immediate reduction in rates on food and other articles which may be termed necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>I make the point for this reason, that any general reduction in railway rates, so far as food produce consumed within the country is concerned, should have a very great effect on the cost of living.  For that reason I hope the Tribunal will give the question of rates on food produce consumed within <Col N="964" /> the country as much consideration as they possibly can when they come to decide this question within the next three months.  It was because I was convinced that the work could not be done within three months that I put down my amendment.  I hope I will be disappointed in believing that the Tribunal cannot do the work within the time laid down in the Bill.  I am sure it will give general satisfaction to everybody, including Deputy Good and those whom he speaks for, if the Tribunal can, within the limited time given in the section, bring about any effective reduction in railway rates, especially so far as they have a bearing upon the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I have to dissent from the argument of Deputy Davin regarding the effect of railway charges upon the price of food commodities, and through them upon the cost of living.  I think that any reduction in railway charges, whatever benefit it may be to the trader or farmer, will have very little, if any effect upon the cost of living.  On this section there are two points I would like to draw attention to.  The first is to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; inevitably means reduction.  May it not mean an increase?  If the Tribunal happens to look upon this question from the point of view of the railway companies they may say that modification should mean a greater charge.  I therefore, suggest that we should substitute the word &ldquo;reduction&rdquo; for &ldquo;modification,&rdquo; so as to leave no loophole. Further, this section provides that the Tribunal shall, not later than three months after the passing of the Act, review the existing charges of the amalgamating and absorbed companies with a view to reduction, having regard to the circumstances under which the increased charges were authorised as from the 1st day of September, 1920, bearing in mind the amendment that has been adopted, and any changes in these circumstances, including any reduction in working expenses. Changes in the circumstances may be argued to be at the cost of the companies, and, therefore, to justify an increase.  But this provision only <Col N="965" /> applies to the amalgamating and absorbed companies.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there would be left out of this provision the Great Northern, the Cavan and Leitrim&mdash;which is wholly, I think, in the Saorstát, or perhaps there is a small portion of it in the Six County area; the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore, the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties, the Castlederg and Victoria Bridge Tramway, the County Donegal Joint Committee, the Strabane and Letterkenny, the Derry and Lough Swilly, including the Burtonport extension and the Carndonagh extension. These are all companies portion of which is within the Saorstát, or the whole of which is within the Saorstát. Yet, there is no intention apparently to review the rates charged within the three months by these companies. I think we require to have some justification for that exception.  I should not have quoted the Cavan and Leitrim, but the other companies have all been allowed to raise their charges, and they all should come under review. Unless there is some very good reason adduced why they should be allowed to retain their present rates without review until the setting up of the Tribunal, until application is made by traders and the whole procedure of examination into every specific claim is gone through, I cannot support the proposal. I would suggest that it would not do any harm to Part 3 of the Bill if the Minister would allow these words &ldquo;amalgamating and absorbed&rdquo; to be deleted, or if the section itself were amended in such a way as to allow a review of all the existing charges of all the companies within the Saorstát.</P>

I am afraid I cannot answer Deputy Davin's points in detail, because they left me under the impression that he was speaking mainly against Deputy Good, though apropos of the section.  It is only in connection with a small portion of his remarks, dealing actually with the section, that I have anything to say.  In so far as they deal with the section he seeks again to put me into the dilemma with which Deputy Johnson has already faced me, that is to say, either the revision is <Col N="966" /> meant to be an exhaustive one&mdash;and we are told by Deputy Davin that it has taken a Tribunal in England three years and that they are not yet finished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is a medium between these two things.  We do not seek to have the general charges and the standard rate established within the three months.  That is left to the twelve months, starting on the 1st January next.  But we do hope immediately to have a modification that will give a considerable relief in the way of reduction in rates.</P>
      <P>I find it essential to repeat again how these rates arose.  In September, 1920, certain matters were taken into consideration.  One of the matters was that the standard revenue was insufficient and deficits were accruing over a certain period.  That was to be looked into and increased charging power was to be granted to make up for that deficit. Those charges were not allowed to be put in force until after the expiration of some months, and the position eventually was that the present rates, the result of the 120 per cent. increase since September, 1920, were based mainly on the fact that in an eleven months' period you had to make up deficits accruing over a 16 months' period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose we were to say, through the terms of this Bill that we insist that the charges so established in 1920 for that purpose should be left, and the railway companies precluded from dealing with them, until whatever date Deputy Davin has in his mind as necessary for this work, say six months instead <Col N="967" /> of three months, I think the first storm would arise in Deputy Davin's quarter over my allowing the railway companies to keep in force for the six months the increased charges which were built up on the basis of providing in eleven months for what had become a deficit of over sixteen months' period.  On that fact alone, if that item only were taken into consideration, there should be a reduction in the first three weeks instead of the first three months.  That is not the only factor to be taken into consideration.  There are other factors, and they are allowed consideration under the terms of the amendment moved by Deputy Duggan and accepted by the Dáil&mdash;certain things, &ldquo;and particularly reduction of working expenses since that date.&rdquo; Remember that is only subsidiary.  The main thing is the circumstances under which the increased charges were authorised in September, 1920.  Those circumstances are what I have related, that General Percentage Order of 120 per cent. Increase allowed in a certain way.  There is a case immediately for modification, a very considerable modification, and in a very short period. Deputy Davin used the words &ldquo;there can be no examination in an exhaustive way.&rdquo;  There is no examination of an exhaustive nature intended in the preliminary revision.  That waits for the year starting the 1st January, 1925.  In the twelve months thereafter there is going to be a scientific examination of rates and the setting up of the standard charges.  With regard to the two points raised by Deputy Johnson, the word modification may mean increase. It does not preclude increases, and if a case for an increase is made out that increase will have to be conceded.  On the facts I have stated, how there is going to be any case for an increase made out passes my comprehension. With regard to the other point, that the words amalgamating and absorbed companies should be expanded and extended to bring in railways partly working in the Saorstát, we have already made allowance in Section 30 for a revision in certain conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not make allowance for a preliminary revision in the first three months of these other lines for a very good reason, that the effects of such preliminary revision are already here.  In all the railways partly in and partly out of the Saorstát, there has already been a reduction of rates corresponding to what we hope to attain in the first three months under Section 24.  That is the reason, simply because the fact is there, the reduction sought to be attained under the preliminary revision is operative already.  If there is anything further to be urged, arguments can be pressed under the terms of Section 30.  For that reason the section, as it stands here, is confined to the amalgamating and the absorbed companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the explanation why railways partly in and partly out of the Saorstát are not included.  If all the companies in question have reduced their rates in the manner desired by the Minister, that justifies their exemption from the section. I would like the Minister to explain the position after this review has taken place.  Assuming that the railway companies have been reasonably justified in their contention&mdash;it might be a far-fetched assumption, and Deputy Good, Deputy Hewat, Deputy Wilson, not to speak of Deputy Davin, may not agree with it&mdash;that on their present earning powers, and their present costs, they could not afford to make a reduction, the tribunal within three months has to consider the case for reduction.  It reviews the position to-day as compared with the position when the increase was allowed, and presumably it will hear and consider what the railway companies have to say, notwithstanding any judgment that the Ministry may have already arrived at.  What I would like to find out from the Minister is, whether in reviewing these charges that Tribunal will have regard to the intentions of the later portions of this Act, as it will then be, which say that the standard charges which will be eventually fixed are to be such as will bring in a certain standard of revenue.  If that is to be taken into account, as I suggest is <Col N="969" /> almost obvious&mdash;otherwise the Minister suggests it is not obvious&mdash;they would not be called upon, in his view, to take into account the possible results on revenue of an immediate reduction in charges.  Otherwise, what is going to be the effect of the loss which would accrue to the companies owing to this immediate review and reduction? What is going to be the effect of that loss on the standard charges for next year?  It seems to me that unless the review is going to take into account the whole intention of the Act, which will be to secure for this year, and for next year, the standard revenue, standard profits, provided by the Act, the standard charges of the subsequent year will have to be higher to make up for the current year's loss.</P>

      <P>The contention of the railway companies is that they have taken out all that is possible in the way of expenses.  Deputy Good may make up his mind that the chances of reduction in expenses of the kind he is thinking of, and only thinking of, are very small, indeed, unless some very great changes take place in other directions.  It is quite useless for Deputies and the public to look to a reduction in wages as the means for reducing prices and freights.  They will have to look elsewhere, and not to a reduction in wages.</P>
      <P>But will the Minister give us an assurance, based upon his knowledge of the Bill, that when the Tribunal revises the present rates and reduces them, the cost of that reduction will not inevitably fall upon the rates to be charged next year after the revision.  And could he with any confidence say that the tribunal, which is to be a judicial body, and not to be influenced by the Ministry, will not take into account the necessity for fixing rates and charges which will ensure to the companies' shareholders a standard dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has not made any case as to why the non-amalgamated companies should be excluded from this preliminary revision.  If the Bill seeks to protect <Col N="970" /> the various ports in the Free State area, then I say it should be concerned with the operation of any uneconomic rates that would divert traffic from ports in the Free State area, traffic that would in the natural course of events go in that direction.  For that reason, which I think is a very good one, I think at any rate he should seek the power under this particular clause to make a preliminary revision of the rates now in operation by the non-amalgamated companies which operate within Free State territory.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking before I think I pointed out that there were two companies, with the greater portion of their mileage in the Free State area. They appeared before the Railway Commission and gave evidence that they would have to close down at that particular time unless there was a reduction in wages and working expenses. They did not close down; there was no reduction in wages at any rate, and if companies such as those I refer to have agreed to a general reduction of rates, and if their previous statement is true, a subsidy must be coming from some other source, probably from some wealthy company inside the Northern area, so as to assist in diverting the traffic from its natural route. For these reasons alone I think the Minister should seek power&mdash;he may not go into the question very exhaustively&mdash;to deal with these companies in the same way as he would deal with the amalgamated or absorbed companies, from the point of view of the general question of a revision of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I stated when I was speaking before that any reduction in railway rates, so far as it would apply to food produce or the general necessaries of life, should be passed on to the consumer. I do not say it has been passed on to the consumer, but I do contend that any increase in the railway rates so far as they apply to a particular commodity&mdash;food of any kind&mdash;were passed on to the consumer in a far greater degree than they should have been owing to the manner in which those engaged in the work of distribution were disposed to fleece the consumer. For instance, I know where a <Col N="971" /> 4 per cent. increase in rates was brought into operation.  The traders generally passed that increase on, not at the rate of 4 per cent., but at the rate of 25 or 40 per cent.  I hope when the Profiteering Bill which we are looking forward to with a great deal of pleasure will be introduced, it will prevent these things happening to that extent. At any rate, I do not think the Minister has made a good case for not including the non-amalgamated companies, so far as the question of the revision of rates is concerned, in the same way as when dealing with the amalgamated companies.  I put it to him if there is a case in a particular area where an uneconomic rate is in operation and where the company is perhaps being subsidised by some other company outside the area and diverting a considerable amount of traffic out of its natural route, such as is happening at the present time in the West of Ireland, that that is a very good reason why he should do as I suggest.  If he does not do so, I ask him what powers has the Tribunal to deal with the question of unfair diversion of traffic, if it is due to that cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>We may as well be candid about it.  If we do not get the rates on the railways in the Free State down to the level of the rates prevailing at the moment in portion of the Free State, though they do not come within this combine, traffic will naturally go northwards.  What we want to see as a result of this Bill&mdash;and one has some difficulty in seeing it, particularly in view of the statements that have been made by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Davin that they do not hope to see any economies&mdash;are economies, and if we do not get the economies under this Bill that trade and commerce are calling for their traffic will find other routes.  The point that has been put up by Deputy Davin is one that should have the consideration of the Ministry and of the tribunal.  What I cannot <Col N="972" /> follow is why reductions have not taken place already in that area where competition is going on at the moment and has been going on for the past five months.  Deputy Davin has pointed out that by reason of these reductions traffic from the West of Ireland is going over the Northern railways, traffic which, in the ordinary course, should go over the railways in the Free State.  If that traffic is carried at a rate of 75 per cent. over the pre-war rates, while in the Free State the rates are equivalent to 120 per cent. increase on pre-war rates, the bulk of it will go over the railways in the Northern State.  I think it will be up to the tribunal to see how economies can be effected, because it is quite obvious that economies must be effected in order to get these rates down.  I hope the tribunal will deal firmly with the subject and effect these economies, because except we can get, as has been pointed out here several times during the discussion of this Bill, rates reduced to such an extent as will enable those who have to deal in export trade &mdash;and export trade forms a very large volume of the trade within the Free State&mdash;to compete on practically the same terms as those they have to compete against on the other side, we are going to do them a serious injustice. That is the object that the Minister ought to have in view and that this Dáil ought to have in view.  It ought to be the duty of all those in the House to try and co-operate in the national interests in effecting such economies as will enable rates to be reduced to the figure they stand at on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I put to the Minister a short time ago was, could he give us any reason as to why these reductions have been delayed in the rates in the Free State.  It is fairly common knowledge outside this Dáil that but for this Bill reductions would have taken place on the railways in the Free State on the 1st January last, when very large reductions took place on the railways in the Northern area.  I would like some definite statement from the Minister on that point.  It may be that commerce has been burdened for the last five or six months with these heavy rates in the Free State in order to enable those who are in favour of this <Col N="973" /> Bill to make a great flourish of trumpets when it comes into force, or a short time after it passes, by saying: &ldquo;Here is the first fruit of this measure; we told you that immediately it came into operation it would do such things, though those who opposed it told us it would not.&rdquo;  Instead of being the first fruit it is late fruit.  It is the fruit that would have accrued in the ordinary course on the 1st January last.  I am quite satisfied that it would have accrued in the ordinary way if this Bill had not been on the tapis.  Instead of being a first fruit it has been a burden on commerce.  I would like some information as to why these reductions have not taken place.  He has already explained to us on more than one occasion that the increases which took place on the 1st December, 1920, were increases that were to produce in the eleven succeeding months a sufficient revenue to make up for the deficiencies of the preceding sixteen months.  They should have terminated on the 1st August, 1921, in the ordinary way, and yet those rates are still in force.  Some information ought to be given to us on that particular point as to why reductions have not been made.</P>

He asked if I could give an assurance that losses to the companies subsequently to form the amalgamated company, accruing as a result of a preliminary revision, will not be made up by increased charges on the standard rates when they come into force.  On that, I can say definitely that what the Deputy forecasts is not possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to give such an assurance on behalf of a tribunal which, if so minded, might do all sorts of ridiculous things.  But I go on to the point that Section 52, more or less, gives the terms of reference to the tribunal with regard to the adjustment of charges to revenue, and that section states:</P>
      <P>The standard charges to be fixed in the first instance for the amalgamated company shall be such as will, together with the other sources of revenue, in the opinion of the Railway Tribunal, so far as practicable, yield, with efficient and economical working and management, an annual net revenue (hereinafter referred to as the standard revenue) equivalent to the average annual aggregate net revenue for the three years of account ended next before the 1st day of January, 1914....</P>
      <P>There are certain additions then made to it, but there is no provision whatsoever for taking in losses this year or next year.  I do not see, with these terms of reference before them, how the tribunal could possibly take losses this year or next year into consideration. As far as we have been able to do it by settling definite terms of reference for the tribunal, we have precluded their taking any such losses into consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin is still of opinion that no case has been made for not including the railways partly in and partly out of the Saorstát.  I thought I had explained, to the satisfaction of the House, that; inasmuch as all railways partly in and partly out of the Saorstát had definitely made reductions corresponding to what we hope to achieve under Section 24, that was sufficient reason for not including them.  The Tribunal, Deputy Davin thinks, is overloaded with work in having to make a preliminary revision for the companies in the Saorstát in three months, and nevertheless he suggests that we should place extra work upon it by including the railways which are partly in and partly out. Deputy Davin, after stressing the point with regard to insufficiency of time, should be the last Deputy to seek to throw an additional burden on the tribunal.</P>

I find it difficult to discover what particular argument Deputy Davin desired to make in respect of &ldquo;statements by the railway companies.&rdquo;  I do not know whether Deputy Davin desires us to believe that what the railway companies say is true, because I am sure it is utterly abhorrent to Deputy Davin to accept what the railway companies say as true.  I do remember that he spoke of unfair diversion of traffic by means of reduced rates on railways operating partly in and partly out of the Saorstát.  Any unfair diversion of traffic is met by Section 29.  Section 29 represents our opinion as to how unfair methods of diverting traffic can best be countered.  If Section 29 does not satisfy Deputy Davin, he can show his dissatisfaction on the point when we are dealing with the section.

That is what we hoped to get within the three months' period, but after that, when the standard charges come to be put in force at a time when the economy which we are hoping to gain by unification becomes operative, the hope is that they will be materially reduced from those at present obtaining.  The point I was developing was in answer to Deputy Davin, that a more economical working of the amalgamated undertaking, when that has been achieved, will place the undertakings under the amalgamated company in a position to compete on good terms with the railways partly in and partly out of the Free State.</P>

      <P>No, that is not correct.  Things must not go on as they are.  Immediately we hope to have a preliminary modification which will bring us into a position of being on as good and possibly better terms than <Col N="977" /> the railways operating partly in and partly outside, and then when we get the final standard charges they ought to put us on better terms than these railways.  As o the big question raised by Deputy Good, whether I can say what prevented the railway companies from bringing into force the reductions already brought into force on other lines.  Deputy Good has himself used the argument that the reductions which the railway companies intended to make of their own accord were held up by somebody in order that later on they could be pointed out as being the first fruits of this Bill.  It is an interesting change on the part of Deputy Good to find him looting forward to such reductions so surely that he seeks to take away credit from this Bill by saying that these reductions would have taken place in January last only for some particular person saying to the railway companies: &ldquo;Do not bring these reductions into force at the beginning of the year, but keep them until after the Bill is passed.&rdquo;  I doubt if Deputy Good can point to one single company and say with assurance that that particular company had intended to bring down its rates on the 10th January, but that they were held up by reason of this Bill.  If I am asked to go further into that and state why the railway companies did not bring down the rates from the 1st January it would lead me into an indictment of the railway companies which I could possibly make better from the benches on which Deputy Davin sits than from these benches.</P>

      <P>The apparent conclusiveness of the Minister's reply to my statement in regard to the possibility of making up in standard charges next year or the year after, what is lost by the reduction in the present charges&mdash;the answer to that by reference to section 52 is not as conclusive as it seems on the face of it. We must bear in mind that the standard charges to be fixed are to be such as will, in the opinion of the tribunal, yield an annual net revenue equivalent to the average net revenue for three years.  I suggest that it is not at all improbable that if this percentage cut all round that he foreshadows is taken <Col N="978" /> by the railway companies to be one which they cannot afford, and they then continue to defer expenditure on work which has already been too long deferred and spend it in subsequent years it will be brought before the tribunal as an expenditure reasonably due on those years, and therefore will make the charges against the gross revenue higher, and will make it necessary to have a higher gross revenue to produce a net revenue required by the Bill.  It may well happen that you reduce rates by a stroke of the pen without consultation with the companies and in defiance of the matured opinion of the company.  I say that under Section 52 they will be able to recover, from future standard charges, the cut that is imposed on the companies in the ensuing three months because they will be saving working expenses, expenditure on necessary work which has been too long deferred.  They will defer it for another year, impose it on the charges for another year, and consequently prove to the tribunal that the charges against gross revenue are so much higher than otherwise they would be.  In that way they will be able to transfer to future standard charges the cut that has to be taken into review three months after the passing of the Act.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: In line 32 to insert after the word &ldquo;fit&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and shall differentiate in favour of agricultural produce grown in Saorstát Eireann and articles of food manufactured therefrom.&rdquo;  This is an amendment to indicate to the rating tribunal that the national policy ought to be towards carrying the goods produced in this country in a manner which will give them preference over the goods of any other country.  It is not with a view to appointing a tribunal and telling them to do so-and-so, but with a view to indicating the general policy which ought to be pursued, and as evidence that such a thing is necessary.  I will merely quote to you the fact that foreign produce is carried at a lower rate than that which applies to the produce of this country. Take American bacon, for example. It is sent from Liverpool to Mullingar at a cheaper rate than bacon produced in Dublin is sent to Mullingar.  I do not think that is fair treatment to the produce of this country, when you come to consider the value of the article.  Take, for example, a ton of potatoes.  Five pounds would be a high valuation to place on them.  A ton of flour produced from Canadian corn would be worth £20, and yet the railway freight for both is the same.  I think the Minister should give preference to Irish produce.  In order to show you that the same idea applies to England I have here a cutting from the National Farmers' Union, and in one of the items they ask permanent Government action.  They want the development of the method of transport and sufficient control over carrying companies to ensure preferential treatment for English produce.  That will show you that the same idea is <Col N="980" /> exercising the minds of the people in England.  I believe a fair case can be made out for treating our produce so that we will not be charged a greater rate than is charged to the produce of our competitors.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy in moving this amendment has opened up the real vista that faces us in connection, with the adoption of this Bill.  The proposal here is that the tribunal should be instructed in the first instance that a system of preferential rates should come into force.  In other words, we are now developing the idea, from the farmers' point of view, of bounties and the protection of industry. There is where you get into an examination of the results of the Bill. You are passing way from economy. You are going to have the farmers asking special rates for produce.  The railways are going to be protected in connection with their shareholders. The business man, I suppose, will have to look after himself.</P>

The amalgamated companies are going to be called on to carry traffic at rates at which it cannot be carried economically. The burden to be placed on that preferential treatment in connection with carrying is going to be placed on somebody else, and there exactly is the old snowball again: &ldquo;Who is going to pay for it?&rdquo;  Of course, the consumer is going to pay for it someway or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Not much of it, I think.  We see to-day that the burden of high rates and everything else is settling upon the farmers and making the cost of production relatively high.  They, on the other hand, are unable to get the increased cost in a competitive market.  Now they come along and say, &ldquo;We want something out of the amalgamated company.&rdquo;  We want preferential rates.  Where is it going to end?  I am not objecting at all to the farmers' demand, but to what is <Col N="981" /> going to develop out of the Bill, which is simply on the road to the nationalisation of the railways.  Supposing the farmers are going to establish their rates.  They are going to get their goods at the cheapest rate irrespective of the cost of carrying them.  They want, in other words, a subsidy.  What is to prevent the manufacturers having still a stronger argument that their goods have got to be carried at an uneconomic rate?  Is not their case unanswerable? If the farmers have to get it why not the manufacturers? Where is the railway company to be? Who is going to bear the burden?  It must pass on to somebody else.  It is laid down in the Bill that capital shall get a certain amount of remuneration not worse than pre-war.  I am sorry Deputy Davin is not here, because he was in an aggressive mood while he was here.  Labour says &ldquo;you are not going to cut down our wages.  First bring down the cost of living, and then we will think whether we will reduce our wages or not.&rdquo;  Where are your railways going to be under those conditions? Where is your tribunal going to be?  Look at the wilderness of argument that is going to lead up to the tribunal.  If the tribunal gets through its work in our lifetime it will be doing very well as far as I can see.  This particular Bill is needlessly going on a road which, as far as I can see, has no end.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat has been arguing on economic rates, and never said a word about uneconomic rates.  He never explained why a ton of sugar can be conveyed from Glasgow to Ballina <i>via</i> Dublin for £1, and that the same ton of sugar cost 29/- to be taken from Dublin to Ballina.  I suppose a ship went in there once a month and the railway company wanted to carry the goods for nothing in order to capture the traffic.  As a matter of fact, the railway companies, in order to capture this through traffic, are penalising the local traffic and the uneconomic rates they are charging are adverse factors against us.  The through rates operate against us in respect of the cost of living in this country.  If the through rates were in the past economic there is no question at all that the <Col N="982" /> others were too high a charge on the local rates.  They were uneconomic. They put their loss on the one hand on to the local traffic, and Deputy Hewat did not point that out.  I do not see why he should object to carrying Irish bacon at the price at which he would carry American bacon and American produce.  That is what I wanted to know.</P>

      <P>You do; it is by means of the combination of shippers and railway companies that pour American bacon into this country and it is brought along to the exclusion of our products, and is charged a preferential rate on our railways.  It is fed in America by the offals of the American flour which we consume here, and we do not get the offals to feed pork, and on the two sides we are beaten in what he calls Protection.  We are asking for nothing out of reason; we ask that the Government should indicate to the tribunal that the proper course to adopt would be to give preference to the products grown in this country and not to outsiders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the amendment will do what Deputy Wilson desires, but I want to support the general view that he has expressed and to point out that Deputy Hewat, notwithstanding his constant insistence upon the desirability of allowing the railway companies a free hand, and while reprimanding in a mild manner Deputy Wilson for suggesting that agriculture should get a preference, seems to forget that in through traffic the importer competing with Irish agriculturists does as a matter of fact get a preference; that under this very system allowing the railway companies to have a free hand they did in fact give preferential tariffs.  So that what Deputy Hewat condemns in the farmers' demand he inferentially approves in the case of the foreign trader.  They get a preferential tariff by the free action of the free railways, but he condemns the control of the railways because it may give preferential treatment to the home producer. I would ask Deputy Wilson and those who act with him to ask themselves this question&mdash;what are railways for? <Col N="983" /> Deputy Hewat says they are to enable the man with money to get a return on his investments.  That is the object of railways, to enable the person who has saved money to invest in something that is likely to give him a return! Incidentally it may be serving the public, but the purpose of these railways is to bring a return to the investor. Does Deputy Wilson agree with that view of what the railway is for?  Does the Government agree with that view of what the railway is for? They suggest that they would rather not, but they are afraid of the consequences of taking any other view.  If they say &ldquo;no, the railway company is not in existence for the purpose of bringing a return in income to the investors; it is in existence to serve the public,&rdquo; then they are afraid that the whole outlook of this problem will be changed so radically that they will have to come to a different conclusion as to the methods of treating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the railway companies are intended to serve the Irish public as a system of transportation, then you will treat the problem as a whole, and you will deal with it as an organisation of transport with a definite purpose in view.  But unfortunately you are bound by the old-fashioned conception, by the Deputy Hewat conception, of what a railway should be&mdash;an instrument for extracting profits from the railway workers on the one hand and from the public on the other hand in order to enables the shareholders to get a dividend. Having that conception in mind that that is the primary purpose, then you have to adjust railway rates and conditions and everything else to this primary purpose, and consequently Deputy Hewat's colleagues complain of railway charges, Deputy Wilson's colleagues complain of the railway charges, and the Government complain that it has had to solve the problem which it need not have been called upon to do if people years ago did their work with a better view of what was due to the public, and we have to complain of the consequences of the same evil conception that the railway companies have been used to exploit the workers on the railways in the interest of the shareholders, forgetful all the <Col N="984" /> time of the public needs.  Now, I suggest to Deputy Wilson if he wants to ensure that agriculture in Ireland is to be served and if the railways are not to be used as a means to pay interest to the shareholders as a primary function, that he would look upon this railway problem with a different eye altogether and he will find, unfortunately too late, that the only possible way of serving the purpose he has in mind is to see that the railways shall serve the public and that the public will get what is required, whether it is going to bring 6 per cent., or 5 per cent., or 4½ per cent., or 3 per cent., or whatever it may be: that is purely incidental. The public must be served. Deputy Wilson is afraid to take that view; he would rather not be in that position because it might be called socialism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again intervene in this debate on account of what Deputy Wilson and Deputy Johnson have said.  Incidentally Deputy Wilson referred to the question of through rates.  Now what industry is benefited to a larger extent by the operation of through rates than the cattle industry in this country?  Cattle have been brought from all parts of Ireland to all parts of England at exceptionally low through rates.  Deputy Wilson refers to the carriage of sugar and these commodities carried at through rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for that reason. I will allow you to introduce it.  This question of through rates are the rates arranged between the various countries. The Government have already put protection for the public into operation in various ways.  Deputy Wilson altogether ignores the fact that if sugar is brought down to Ballina for 20s. a ton. or whatever the freight is, its result was to provide sugar in that district at a price which was very much lower than it would be if the through rate had been higher.  Now, Deputy Johnson has referred to the <Col N="985" /> fact that the existing railway shareholders get a dividend.  Might I suggest to him that if the public wanted a railway the public could build a railway. In this particular case the railways were put there by the subscription of money by shareholders who built the railways, and in building the railways I maintain they took the risk of loss as well as of profit.  As far as profit is concerned, I do not think the railway shareholders get a very considerable return.  Let us adopt for one moment Deputy Johnson's attitude to this matter.  Will he go forward with the proposition and ask people to subscribe money to build a railway, and to run it purely for the benefit of the public&mdash;a philanthropic concern&mdash;with his dictum behind it, that the railway company is to do what it is told, no matter whether it loses money or not. After all, is not the railway built by the shareholders' money, having first got an Act of Parliament which protects the public as far as is necessary? The Socialist idea is that because these railway concerns were built by private money, and because they served the public, the confiscation of their property is a justifiable proceeding.  Now if he develops that argument I do not think he will get very many people to engage in building railways or anything else.  As far as I am concerned, if I have any money I will keep it in a stocking rather than put it into such railways.</P>

However, we are getting away from the subject matter of the amendment, which has this infirmity about it, that one could say it meant a half, a quarter, or seventy per cent.  To that extent it falls short of a definite characterisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to differentiate in favour of agricultural produce and articles of food.  I should say that the idea underlying this particular clause affects, <Col N="986" /> along with other things, what Deputy Wilson had in mind in his amendment, though it is not expressed.  It is a matter which would be very difficult to express when giving a direction to the Railway Tribunal, and the Railway Tribunal in its particular operation or operations ought to have as a primary consideration the general economy of the country, and would be bound, if it reflects the opinion of the country, to give the most favourable consideration &mdash;and that is what Deputy Wilson has in mind&mdash;to articles grown or manufactured in the country.  I am informed that the particular instance referred to by the Deputy of getting goods from Liverpool to, say, Mullingar, at a cheaper price than goods sent from Dublin to Mullingar is scarcely correct. It is at a cheaper rate.  The actual mileage charge may be less, but the actual cost is not less.</P>
      <P>If it were, it would be obviously the business of the tribunal to take that into account and to regulate the charges of transit from Dublin to Mullingar, in accordance with, or bearing a very large relation to, the cost of sending a similar class of goods from Liverpool to Mullingar.  As regards the case of Ballina, it is fairly well known that shipping charges are less than railway charges, and to that extent it is scarcely a fair case to put. This amendment, if adopted, might be read differently by the members of the tribunal.  I would suggest that the amendment would not be pressed and that either we would consider the matter between this and the Report Stage to see if the clause is not fool-proof, or, in the alternative, that the scheme would be given a trial for twelve months or two years.  Then, if found to operate to the disadvantage of agricultural or manufacturing interests, it would be obviously as much the business of the Government to bring in an amending Bill to remedy its infirmities, should they materialise, which I doubt, as it would be their business when considering a Budget, to see what particular items there are which, when taxed, will place as light a burden as possible on the people and yet will bring in the amount required, while at the same time an eye would be kept on the vital interests of the country.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to Deputy Wilson that this section does not deal with rates at all, but with the classification of goods, and that his purpose would be served, as far as this section is concerned, by relying rather upon Deputy Heffernan's amendment (10) which, I think, might well be accepted by the Minister?  That amendment would go very far to meeting the requirements of Deputy Wilson so far as classification goes.  The matter of preferential rates would have to be considered independently of this section.</P>

      <P>There is this much further to be added in regard to Deputy Wilson's amendment: In so far as he dealt in detail with his own amendment it turned on a question of through rates, and they are a matter for argument under Section 28 and not here.  I would like to point out to Deputy Wilson that it is the desire and the intention under this Bill to have the whole economic condition of this country reflected in the grouping of traffic for rating purposes, and all the parties interested and desirous of being heard must be heard by the tribunal, and if there is such a strong case to be made out for differentiation in favour of agricultural produce or even by way of classification, then all the agricultural folk have to do is to send somebody vehement, say, like the Minister for Agriculture, to argue their case.  Surely, if they have an overwhelming case the tribunal is certainly not going to be prejudiced against their case from the start?  I would suggest what the President has put as his alternative had better be adopted with regard to this.  Let the tribunal be given a trial and see how far the classification of the rates reflects the ordinary economic situation in the country and if it be not properly done, there will be a case for amendment afterwards. As it is, there is every opportunity given to get the trade into touch with the tribunal on the matter of classification and on the matter of rates.</P>

You will find that in actual practice I am right.  It is the accepted and the best method of going about things.  Having regard to what the President said, and the sympathetic speeches we heard from the Government side I am willing to wait until, between now and the Report Stage, we see if we can hammer out something which will make the clause fool-proof.  Then after that we will see what will happen.</P>

      <P>The amendment which is in Deputy Heffernan's name reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 36, after the word &ldquo;merchandise,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;the classification of agricultural produce and agricultural requirements in countries similarly situated.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Wilson has not made the use of the amendment that he might have done.  There is a case for this amendment quite apart from the question of rates.  The suggestion in the amendment is that the classification of agricultural products varies very considerably, and to speak of agricultural produce being classified and charged at a certain rate is very misleading. Agricultural produce may be classified variedly, and, I take it, it is reasonable to suggest that some consideration should be given to the manner in which such products are classified in other countries so that there may be something like a fair level as between different products in different countries. I do not know what was in the <Col N="989" /> mind of the Deputy who put down the amendment, but I think it is very desirable that potatoes or wheat or bacon should be in the same classification as they are in competing countries when carried over the same railways in the country of consumption.  I think that is very desirable.  I suggest it is a quite reasonable proposition and should be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, and I cannot see any reason why the Minister cannot accept it.  There is nothing in the wording of the amendment but that account should be taken of the classification in other agricultural countries which are exporting their products and competing against us here who are farmers in this country.  We cannot at any time disregard the cost of transit in our industries, and it is one of our main complaints to-day and one of the great difficulties that the farmers in Canada, South Africa, or elsewhere get more favourable consideration by the railway companies than we receive here.  That is placing us at a disadvantage, and a very considerable disadvantage.  In consideration of these facts I think it is certainly not too much to ask that this amendment will be accepted by the Minister and that he will insist that the Railway Tribunal will take this fact into account and see how the farmers benefit under classification in other countries.  They must take into account how agricultural produce is classified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Much the same difficulty exists in regard to this amendment as in the case of the last one.  What exactly is the meaning of classification of agricultural produce and agricultural requirements in countries similarly situated?  Take a man in Denmark or New Zealand. We have no information with regard to railway matters and agricultural rates classification in these countries, but if between now and the Report Stage we were put in possession of any information respecting that then we will see whether or not the amendment would be desirable to the section as it stands or whether this particular amendment would suit the purpose.  As <Col N="990" /> far as we are advised at the moment, this amendment will place you in no better position and might place agriculture in a worse position.  In substance it will come to this, that it could be claimed that we should send a commissioner or some other person to some other countries to examine these problems and if in the meantime the classification of agricultural products were to be held up you can see at once that the vital results that we are hoping for in a short period from this Act might not be achieved.  To this extent I suggest that the amendment might be left over until we get particulars regarding agricultural classification of products in other countries and then we can examine this amendment to see if it suits the purpose.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the real object is that supposing classificaiton, for instance, is varied in Great Britain and they put on a certain large export from here in one classification and if we had in the Free State another classification it would make a difficulty in the way of getting a through rate, and I think the more one looks into this the more useful help it will be to the tribunal, because I take it that no matter what tribunal is set up its primary object will be to help as far as it can the main industry in this country.  I am sure it will help the tribunal, but supposing that alteration is made in Great Britain in classification at any time the addition of these particular words mentioned in the amendment would enable our tribunal on this side to adjust that particular item so that our side would not be hampered.  I really think that that is the object behind this, and I think in accepting it the Government will not be in any way weakened but that on the other hand they will strengthen the hands of the tribunal in dealing with this particular matter in the way I mention and with which apparently the President is in accord.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know, but I take it, that this amendment will also have consideration on the Report Stage.  Twopence per ton per mile should be placed as the maximum charge for Irish produce. In placing such a limit we had regard to the fact that this country is bound to pay 4.12 per cent. to the companies.  If I were to tell the Minister the rates operating in the Dominions of which we are supposed to be a co-equal partner, but with whom we have to compete, I am sure he would be startled.  Just imagine a sack of maize being carried 1,700 miles for 1s., 300 miles to Bulawayo, and shipped at Port Elizabeth for 1s.  Now you can <Col N="992" /> understand the advantage that the farmers of these co-equal dominions to which we belong have over us, and, therefore, I ask the Minister to give this amendment consideration on Report.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Wilson was anxious to endeavour to convince the House on this amendment it should read that it would in no way interfere with the working of the tribunal or its duties on the one hand and that it would in no way interfere with the revenue of the amalgamated company on the other.  Although one may not like to dictate to the tribunal there might be reasons why it should be accepted. But what I rose to ascertain was this: if Deputy Wilson, who is the <Col N="993" /> acknowledged financial expert of the Farmers' Party, the future Minister for Finance, if I may be pardoned for anticipating what may happen in the future, would give the House the benefit of his experience in one of the Dominions, as to how the farmers were treated by the railways, whether under private ownership or State control, it would be very useful information.  Deputy Wilson has some information, and in dealing with a Bill like this if he would give us his experience of railways in other countries it would be very useful.  The President referred to the fact that the Government had not any information at their disposal as to how the farmers in Denmark or other countries were treated in this matter. I put it to him that it is the duty of those in charge of Government Departments at the present time dealing with the railways to ascertain the exact conditions and terms for commodities charged to people in foreign countries. so that when the tribunal comes on to consider railway rates inside the three months' period they will have all the information, which it is eminently desirable that they should get, at their disposal.  If Deputy Wilson has any expert knowledge as to how this 2d. per ton per mile worked out in practice it would be very useful information for the House to get if he is willing to give it.</P>

      <P>I will be quite content to take two districts like Rathdrum and Dublin.  In pre-war days we had a rate of 3/9 per 6 ton lot of potatoes for 38 miles, whereas the present rate is 16/-.  I maintain that if you allowed 6/4, or double the pre-war rates as the present rate, that is 2d. per ton per mile, it would be reasonable.  Mullingar is 50 miles from Dublin.  The rate upon a ton of potatoes would be 8/4 pre-war; it was 6/8, and I am not asking anything unreasonable when I ask for 2d. per ton per mile.  I do not know what the present rate is.  Rye grass from Dundalk pre-war to Enniscorthy was 16/8; the present rate is 57/11. Talk about 120 per cent!  Rye grass is an Irish product produced in the North of Ireland, and it is extensively used by farmers in the Saorstát, and consequently Irish rye grass has to be exported <Col N="994" /> to England and brought back to Ireland because the railway companies wont carry it at a reasonable price.  Rye grass from Dundalk to Cork pre-war was 20/-; at the present time it is 52/6, and via Glasgow&mdash;it has to be sent to Glasgow and back&mdash;the amount is 27/6.  Of course, there are things that are causing railway freights to be so enormous.  The railways will not give a reasonable rate. While I do not want to take away the business of the Railway Tribunal.  I say it is our business to fix maximum rates here now.  Railway rates are quite simple if you only understand something about them.  They charge so much per ton per mile, and if that is not too exorbitant that is all we want. I contend that 2d. per ton per mile is a fair rate, and I know that in the Dominions the railways are carrying produce at ½d. per ton per mile, and that has been reduced lately to one-eighth of a penny per ton per mile.  I must say there is a deficit in the working, but I do not want to talk about these small things.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson's idea of running a railway is to run it on a flat rate, and that is a very common fallacy.  Anybody who knows anything about the working of railways knows perfectly well that the main object of a railway is to get long haulage, and the longer the haulage the better the railway is pleased.  Deputy Wilson's idea of a flat rate of 2d. per mile might work out very high in some cases and very low in others.  The railway companies take all the surrounding circumstances into account.  There are various special rates and arrangements in connection with the carrying of traffic.  If the Tribunal is a real Tribunal it must recognise all those differences and be very expert in railway management. It will have to take into consideration, not only all the complications that railway managements have to take into consideration, but to co-relate those to the demands of the various bodies.  As far as the tribunal is concerned, I wish them joy of their job.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 16, to delete the words &ldquo;contribute to and&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;retain or.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In connection with the through rate operation, the Clearing House distributes the proportions of a through rate to the various companies concerned.  It is largely based on the proportion of the mileage over which the goods are carried.  The words &ldquo;contribute to,&rdquo; I think, are quite wrong in this case, and I suggest that the words I propose to put in are better than the words in the section.  It would bring it more in accordance with practice.  It may be that the amalgamated company would claim to retain a larger percentage of the through rate than it would be entitled to under the mileage rate, and the amendment is to provide that the amalgamated company shall not claim to get more than its relative proportion of the through rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very serious proposition.  I wonder if the Minister realises what it may lead up to.  On a previous section we moved an amendment that the amalgamated companies should carry over their existing rights, including representation in any conference arrangement in future.  The Minister stated that, rather than give statutory power in a Bill of this kind, regarding existing rights and representation, he would prefer to leave it to the amalgamated companies to arrive at an arrangement on a voluntary basis.  This section gives very arbitrary power to the tribunal to set up an arrangement which may cut out in future any hope of voluntary agreement in regard to the vital matter concerned in the section. Assuming that the tribunal proceeds to carry out the powers given in the Bill, and there is a through rate from a station on the Great Northern Railway to another station in the North of England <i>via</i> Belfast, the tribunal only has power to deal with the rates of the amalgamated company, and with that portion of the non-amalgamated companies' mileage that is within the Free State.  How is it proposed to deal with the division of a through rate from a station on the Great Northern, that will be concerned with a mileage outside its jurisdiction? That is, I think, what is claimed in sub-section (2), when it says: &ldquo;which the amalgamated company shall contribute to and receive out of any through rate or fare.&rdquo;  Assuming that an unamalgamated company, such as the Great Northern, as regards its mileage outside the jurisdiction of the Free State, and a British company, agree to a through rate to the North of England, by taking these powers you are going to cut out any hope of a satisfactory arrangement on the question of through rates, unless the principle of voluntary agreement is accepted.  If the Great Northern or the British company, as a result of any decision of the Railway Rates Tribunal, say that they will not agree to the division laid down by the tribunal, it will mean the cutting out altogether of a through rate, and necessitate local bookings to the Border line on the Great Northern.  This principle, if applied, <Col N="997" /> may not work out in the way that it was thought it would.  It may cut out, in a case such as I have mentioned, any possibility of agreement on the question of through rates, especially outside the territory over which the tribunal will have control. I ask the Minister to consider the effect of disagreement with the division that may be laid down in an arbitrary way by the tribunal under such circumstances.  I think he will see the effect will be disastrous for the trading community who derive advantage from the operation of through rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of understanding Deputy Davin's argument, may I put it a point further? Does the Deputy hold that this Bill should take compulsory powers regarding through rates, <i>via</i>, for instance, some English port?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it going to be possible for the railway tribunal to bring into force a through rate <i>via</i> some port outside our jurisdiction. Surely that has always to be a matter of agreement.  We are now back on the old question of representation on the Irish Railway Clearing House, and I get back to the point I stated as to the functions of the Clearing House, that representation there, in so far as it meant voting power, meant nothing, as voting power is useless in matters that depend upon agreement.  I cannot understand Deputy Davin's apprehension with regard to these through rates.  We have in this section power to determine the amount which the amalgamated company shall contribute to and receive out of any through rate or fare.  We recognise that we cannot insist on through rates.  Through rates are a matter for agreement, that is, through rates to some station in the interior of England. That depends on an agreement between the amalgamated company and the shipping company and railway company concerned.  There is no compulsion possible.  That is a matter for agreement.  We are only interested in <Col N="998" /> the amalgamated companies' end in the Irish Free State, and we take power here that the tribunal shall determine the amount which the company shall contribute to and receive out of any rate or fare.  That is a big step in advance of anything that has ever been in existence in this country.  We have a provision here for the tribunal to look into these two rates, and find out whether any proportion that the amalgamated company receives from or contributes to a through rate in any way prejudices local traffic, which will have to bear the increased cost if you give a preference by way of a through rate.  As regards Deputy Hewat's amendment, I cannot see that it is any improvement on the wording which is here.  The words here are &ldquo;retain or receive.&rdquo;  The difference between &ldquo;retain&rdquo; and &ldquo;receive&rdquo; is very slight. It seeks to delete an essential point, that the amalgamated company shall &ldquo;contribute to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Again it is &ldquo;retain&rdquo; or &ldquo;receive.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Deputy that the word &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; is a necessary one in this section.  It is not practicable for the tribunal to deal with the proportion the amalgamated company shall receive and retain out of the through rates unless they are authorised to deal with the company's contribution to the compilation of these through rates.  The word &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; I suggest is necessary in the context.  To cut out the word &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; would damage the section materially.  If the Deputy suggests to leave in the word &ldquo;contribute,&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;retain&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;receive,&rdquo; that is a different matter. I do not know if the word &ldquo;retain.&rdquo; adds very much to the section, but the word &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; is absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be a bit dull, and in that way may not have explained what is in my mind, or perhaps the Minister does not see the effect of the arrangement suggested in the sub-section.  If the Minister only intends to deal with the portion of the through rates for the amalgamated <Col N="999" /> company that operates within the Free State, there is not much in the argument that I have tried to make.  However, if he proposes to confer these powers on the tribunal as regards existing through rates outside the jurisdiction of the Free State, I hold he has not answered the case I put up.  Let us assume that there is a through rate at the present time in operation from Dundalk via Belfast to Newcastle or to some other point.  Under the existing system of railway organisation that is a matter for agreement between the G.N.R. Company and the British company on the other side as to what division would be fair to both sides.  When this scheme comes into operation the tribunal will have power to deal with rates only over that portion of the Great Northern Railway up to the border line.  The Great Northern Company can do what they like up to that point and so can the British company if they wish to smash the existing arrangement.  If the proportion which the tribunal decides to give to the Great Northern Company in connection with the carrying of a particular commodity from Dundalk to the border point is unfair, and if the Great Northern or British company disagrees, they can smash the existing arrangement, to the disadvantage of the trader by compelling the trader to book to the border point, beyond which they can set up any rate they like.  I cite that as a possible case if there is disagreement or difference as to whatever powers the tribunal may exercise.  If they agree to give an unfair proportion to the Great Northern Company for its services inside the Saorstát, or from any station of the amalgamated company to one outside the Free State.  I suggest that it would be to the disadvantage of the trader, as if there is disagreement we lose the concession given on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>It appears to me the explanation is perfectly sound.  If, for example, any material is sent from Dublin to Belfast, and that as far as Dublin to Dundalk, or to the boundary line, is concerned, the rate is 2/- per ton, and that the corresponding charge for the delivery of the goods from Dublin to that particular destination alone is 5/-, that is obviously a case to go before the Tribunal, to see that the incidence in respect of the one charge bears relation to the incidence of the other charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Cases, I take it, will not be gratuitously brought before this Tribunal.  There must be a strong case to bring it before the Tribunal. What does the section say actually?  It says &ldquo;by any party interested, or by the Minister at any time.&rdquo;  It gives a regular list of reasons which ought to animate anyone bringing a case.  I take it that there will not be any unreasonable cases of that sort coming before the Tribunal.  If there is a case for rectification, what we seek is power to enable the Tribunal to consider it.  To that extent I think the section is sound and that you could not do without it. It is necessary to keep it in, in order to retain that authority of the Tribunal, in so far as any power we have over through rates is concerned.  We have the power up to the point where our jurisdiction extends.  We seek also in connection with the through rate from that, that it should be a case for consideration by the Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the amendment is concerned, I think it is a question altogether of wording&mdash;&ldquo;retain&rdquo; or &ldquo;contribute.&rdquo; Although I should say they are different in substance, absolutely different, one would imagine that &ldquo;receive&rdquo; and &ldquo;retain&rdquo; were the same, but I think it is better that we should <Col N="1001" /> have &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; in.  The word &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; should be put in because some people would say we did not intend to give anything at all.  The Deputy had not that in mind, I know, because he evidently meant to retain some portion, not the whole of it.  But there are people who think that we are not doing justice in this case, and in order to make their minds easy, if it were nothing else, we put in &ldquo;contribute.&rdquo;</P>

I think it is desirable, at the same time, to get an enlightened explanation of the Minister's point of view, because that may not be quite so clear to me as to him.

I agree that perhaps the word &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; should have gone in, but it is based on the usual practice of the Clearing House, to show that the collecting company retains, and, in connection with the next amendment, it is really to secure that the amalgamated company should not retain more than its mileage proportion.

      <P>I have not been able to follow this discussion very clearly, but I would like to have some assurance from the Minister as to whether I am right in assuming that sub-section (2) is intended to prevent the amalgamated company from using any of its lines to the disadvantage of this country, and perhaps to the advantage of another country and another company; that it will give away service at a low rate on the possibility that it will get some counter-advantage in some other way.  If there are possibilities which this sub-section is directed against, that the company may, in respect <Col N="1003" /> of one direction of its service, cut through rates to an uneconomical level, and cut them so low as to mean practically no return to the company for the purpose, perhaps, of serving another interest, such a proposal ought to be brought before the Tribunal.  But suppose that a non-amalgamated company proposes to do the same: let us assume that the Great Northern Railway, for instance, say from Drogheda, is prepared to carry goods to Greenore or Newry for nothing for the purpose of getting traffic, of cutting out possible competitive routes, are you retaining power in the Bill to meet such a case as that?</P>

      <P>It is not the point that has been already discussed, I agree, but it is a point I see in this sub-section. It seems to me that giving power to the Tribunal to intervene in through rates not only gives them power to intervene with regard to the proportion on the high side of through rates but the proportion on the low side.  I can conceive interests, perhaps, in an amalgamated company being so powerful within that company as to divert traffic from certain points in Ireland by a certain route, by a through rate, the proportion of which through rate accruing to the Irish company will be too small, and, therefore, wasteful, and only used for the purpose of diverting traffic into an unnatural direction. If that is possible and has to be guarded against in respect of the amalgamated company, ought it not to be guarded against in respect of a non-amalgamated company?  Ought you not take power to protect, shall I say, the country as a whole, against the use of certain lines by a company which may be partially in and partially out, to cut rates in respect of the Saorstát lines excessively with a view to diverting traffic.  Under this section that power does accrue so far as non-amalgamated companies are concerned, but I do not know whether, in any other part of the Bill such power is given to the Tribunal.</P>

      <P>The point mentioned by Deputy Johnson comes in more under Section 30 than under this particular section.  It is a strong point, a point upon which it would be difficult to frame regulations that would protect all the interests concerned, and even if we were to consider them, it raises the other question, which Deputy Johnson addressed himself to at some length, but in an entirely different form; if, for example, there is an area with agricultural experts round about Drogheda who see an opportunity of sending out their goods, does it matter to them through what particular port they pass?  What really concerns them is the cost at which they can be sent out.  The rest of the country is not affected by the particular ports to which the products go unless there is a port within the Saorstát which might benefit through sending out those goods, but whose charges may be, perhaps, higher than those of Greenore, the very case the Deputy mentioned.  If it were the case that farmers round about Drogheda were in a position to load trucks with cattle, at a cost of practically nothing, that the railway companies through some arrangement with the steamship company paid all the railway charges, I take it that in order to protect the other ports it would be necessary for us to have some prohibition with regard to that.  I see great difficulties in the way of doing that.  I really do not see how it can be done, even in an Act of Parliament.  The fact is that it is unlikely. All that can be said about it is that it is very, very unlikely to happen.</P>

I can conceive of railway companies and pork <Col N="1005" /> curers making an arrangement whereby through rates on Irish lines may be varied in such a way as to induce pigs to be sent North, and you may by the association of pork curers and railway companies subsidise the Northern curing establishments at the expense of the Southern.

    <P>(1)  All the terms, conditions and provisions of any agreement or statutory enactment which, at the date of this Act. are in force and binding on any amalgamating or absorbed company, by which the forwarding of traffic is affected, or for any other purpose, shall continue in full force and effect, save in so far as the same are rescinded or varied by this Act; but no such agreement or statutory enactment shall be construed as affecting or extending to any part of the railway of the amalgamated company or the traffic thereon which was not at the date of this Act subject to or affected by such agreement or statutory enactment.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subject to the provisions of this Act the amalgamated company shall not by the rates or fares charged, whether through or local, the facilities provided or the accommodation afforded by it, or otherwise, place any one port in Saorstát Eireann at an undue disadvantage as compared with any other port in Saorstat Eireann to, from, or through which traffic is or may be carried.</P>
    <P>(3)  No rebates, commissions, or agency or other allowances shall be given by the amalgamated company to traders at or using any port in Saorstát Eireann which are not given by the company in similar circumstances to traders at or using any other port in Saorstát Eireann, and the word &ldquo;traders&rdquo; shall include any incorporated railway or steamship company.</P>
    <P>(4)  If any dispute shall at any time arise under the provisions of this section or as to any matter or thing under this section, or as to whether the amalgamated company are fulfilling their obligations hereunder or taking all reasonable or necessary steps for that purpose, <Col N="1007" /> the same shall from time to time be referred to and determined by the railway tribunal.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... any agreement or statutory enactment which at the date of this Act are in force and binding on any amalgamating or absorbed company by which the forwarding of traffic is affected ... shall remain in full force and effect save in so far as the same are rescinded or varied by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What my amendment proposes is in effect to exclude any such agreement or enactment which would be of the nature of preferential treatment for any one port in the Saorstát over another.  I do not think it will altogether come as a surprise to the Committee that there are such agreements in existence.  There is one agreement in particular which I beg to take special exception to, that is what has been termed the Rosslare agreement. This agreement took place between the Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland and-the Great Western Railway of England in the year 1898, and it was subsequently embodied in the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Act of 1899, Schedule 7, Section 17.  The agreement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" />&ldquo;The Companies, parties hereto of the second and third parts, will on the opening of the railway between Rosslare and Waterford forward by the Fishguard and Rosslare route and in the meantime via Waterford traffic of all descriptions that they can control between such portions of the district served by their respective systems in the South and West of Ireland and the South and West of England, including London, as may be hereafter agreed between them and as can in the interests of the public be most conveniently forwarded by Waterford.  Rosslare and Fishguard routes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to state&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They shall afford all reasonable facilities to induce passengers between the said districts to travel via Rosslare and Fishguard as soon as that route is opened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That agreement was made between an English railway company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy say what is the date of that agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The date of the agreement is 1899, and it was embodied in the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Act of 1899.  That agreement was made between two of the principal railway companies, one the Great Western of England and the other the Great Southern and Western of Ireland.  That agreement was made with a certain object, and the object is perfectly clear from the wording of it, namely, that these two railway companies should do everything in their power to favour one port, that port being Rosslare, to the detriment of other ports.  Perhaps the Committee is not aware that Rosslare is what is known as a privately owned port.  It is not like the Port of Dublin or the Port of Cork, or the Port of Waterford. It was made and is owned by a railway company.  Therefore, the principal enshrined in this agreement is not only vicious from the point of view of dealing out preferential treatment to one port in the Saorstát over another, but it actually favours a privately-owned port over existing public ones.  This agreement is still in existence, and if this section passes, as at present <Col N="1009" /> worded, it will be perpetuated.  What I am seeking is not that all existing agreements should necessarily be scrapped, but that any agreement which embodies, as I submit this one does, any principle of this nature, should be hereby cancelled and repealed. It may be said&mdash;in fact on a previous occasion it was said&mdash;would that be equitable.  This Bill is unlike all previous railway Bills in connection with Ireland.  It is not dealing with railway companies as such; it is proposing a new system in regard to the control of railways in this country. Only the other day I noticed that when it was proposed that a certain existing agreement in relation to, I think, the representation on the Board for a certain railway company, should be perpetuated, it was received in rather a different way by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must intervene for a moment.  I would like the Deputy to explain whether that was a statutory enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  I believe that was not a statutory enactment. I would not suggest it was. But it was an agreement&mdash;I would not be positive that it was not a statutory enactment&mdash;and it was a well-known agreement.  If it is possible to rescind that agreement with equity&mdash;because I am dealing with equity now, and not with a question of law&mdash;I do not see why a statutory enactment could not also be equitably rescinded.  The fact that this particular agreement is a statutory enactment, I do not think prevents the Dáil in dealing with it in the manner I have suggested, either legally or equitably. The two companies&mdash;the original parties to this agreement&mdash;will not be in the some position either in regard to one another or in regard to the two countries in which they are, in the future, that they were in the past.  As far as statutory enactments are concerned, there is another agreement actually portion of another statute, in regard to this very same port&mdash;the port of Waterford and Rosslare.  It is contained in Section 70 of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Act of 1899.  That agreement takes this form in the statute&mdash;Section 70:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Great Western Company <Col N="1010" /> shall, unless and until Parliament shall otherwise determine, continue to provide or afford a daily service by steamer between Waterford and either New Milford or Fishguard as efficient as that provided by them at the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>and so on.  Now, that agreement is also in existence.  That agreement is also a statutory agreement.  That agreement is embodied in an Act of Parliament. But that agreement is not in operation. That agreement, unfortunately, has been allowed to lapse, and to this day, to my knowledge, the Great Western Railway Company of England do not carry Out the terms of that agreement and provide a daily service from Waterford by steamer to either of these ports.  What I ask is this: Either let both agreements be put into operation. or let both agreements be rescinded and repealed.  What I do complain of is that it should be proposed that one agreement, the one I referred to first&mdash; the direction of all possible traffic via Rosslare&mdash;should be kept in operation, and that the other agreement&mdash;the sailing of a daily vessel from Waterford to New Milford or Fishguard&mdash;should be allowed to be inoperative.  I would be perfectly prepared to have this agreement contained in Section 70 of the Act of 1899, dealing with the daily sailings from Waterford, repealed.  This latter agreement was really put into this Act in order to safeguard the port of Waterford when the further agreement was made between these two companies that all possible traffic should be diverted via Rosslare.  Now, we are in the position that this section of the Bill provides that all these agreements are to be perpetuated.</P>
    <P>We are also in the position that this agreement concerning the daily sailings from Waterford has been allowed to lapse and is at the present moment not in operation.  Therefore, in the interests not only of the particular port I have mentioned, but in the interest of the public at large, I am desirous of inserting this amendment, that all agreements may be perpetuated save and only such as deal out, as undoubtedly, this one does, preferential treatment to one port&mdash;in this case a privately owned port&mdash;over another port&mdash;in this case a public port.  It <Col N="1011" /> may be said, and it has been said, that the traffic in this case is confined to unconsigned traffic.  That may be so. But what the percentage of unconsigned traffic is, I have not been able to discover.  It may be said that it is large, or it may be said it is small.  I think it has been said that it is very small.  If the amount of unconsigned traffic&mdash;traffic which has not got a particular route marked on it, for I presume that is what is meant by unconsigned traffic&mdash;is particularly small, then I do not see what very great hardship it would be to do away with these agreements.  If, on the other hand, the amount is particularly large I think that the carrying on and continuance of this agreement would be an unwarranted hardship for one Irish port to the advantage of another.  I hope that the Government will see its way to accept either this amendment or something of a similar nature.  I do not think that it is asking very much.  It is only asking that this Bill shall not perpetuate agreements which undoubtedly may have been all right at the time they were made between the different railway companies, but which should not I think in the minds of most reasonably minded people be included in a Bill such as this providing for the control of railway companies in a different manner and by a different system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on the amendment, because in substance it embodies the principle we find in clause 29. The main object of that clause as marked in the margin is protection for ports, and it carries us on to another clause at the back which really nullifies the benefit.  As members of the Committee will recognise, I am responsible for the amendments put in by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and this amendment is not out of keeping with them.  I think I may say that I would not be a party to scrapping contracts.  I think the House will have to take into full consideration the pernicious effect of the Act dealing with Rosslare as a competitive port with Dublin.  Let us be clear on this matter.  When I say that the agreement is a pernicious one, I do not base the statement altogether on a <Col N="1012" /> clause in the Act of Parliament.  There was an agreement between the Great Southern and Western Railway Company and the Great Western of England, whereby the Great Southern Company undertook to influence traffic in all directions.  Do not let us be making any mistake about this.  It is not unconsigned traffic, except in so far as they were not able to influence consigned traffic.  This agreement lays down that the Great Southern Railway Company should influence traffic from Dublin via Rosslare.  Everything they could send from Dublin via Kilkenny to Rosslare, the Great Southern Company, under obligation to the Great Western Company, were bound to send it that way, and they have done that. Is it natural to send goods from Dublin to a port in competition with the port of Dublin?  I say it is unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; that being the state of affairs and we, dealing with a Bill to reorganise the railways, can you as a Committee take responsibility for the continuance of that?  If so, well and good, but I say you must shoulder the responsibility for it.  A common argument is being used, that the London and North Western Companies, now the London, Midland and Scottish, had another agreement with the Dublin <Col N="1013" /> and South Eastern.  We dealt with that in amendments put forward the other day, and they were thrown out.  The London, Midland and Scottish asked for a continuance of agreements that were in existence, or rather the money that they put down under agreements, which they held, are embodied in the Act of Parliament as between the Great Southern Company and the Great Western of England.  I say that that is an intolerable injustice to the port of Dublin, and that this Bill must make provision that such an unfair state of affairs shall not continue to exist.  Up to the present we had an alternative more or less in our own hands, or at all events that could be influenced by us. To-day, however, you are taking away all that and you are putting an amalgamated company in the place of certain undertakings that exist, and surely you will recognise the danger of having agreements in existence that will practically close the port of Dublin so far as this Bill is concerned.  If the Minister is going to do justice he will have to consider the protection of these ports in a broader spirit than he has done so far.</P>

      <P>I looked up the list of amendments dealing with one side of this case, and so far as I can make out something like seven amendments have been put down dealing in some way or another with one English company largely concerned in our traffic, and there has not been a single amendment seeking to do justice, if I may say so, to the other English company which is affected.  We had a string of amendments.  I do not know if they were from the Dublin Port and Docks Board, but they were in Deputy Byrne's name.</P>

      <P>The Port Board of Dublin we are told is a public body, but we know that it is far from being a democratically controlled body.  Any of us who have had dealings with it know that well.  The case that is put up is, is there going to be no other port board than that one?  I am as long in Dublin as the average Deputy in this House and my interest would be entirely for Dublin, but I think we must do justice to all parts of the country.  We must keep our name clear and clean.  This particular agreement was entered into and sanctioned in another place over which I had no control, but perhaps the Deputy moving the amendment may have friends who had control there and who were responsible for it in some way or another. <Col N="1015" /> Deputy Redmond, as far as I know, had a number of friends who were in the place where this agreement was made and although we have a big job, surely we are not to remedy all the difficulties of that particular body.  A bargain is a bargain, and this one was made between an Englishman and an Irishman.  It is the duty of this House to maintain this bargain.  Only to that extent have we an interest.  There is a bargain made between a national and a non-national in this State and that non-national would have a serious cause of complaint if we now broke that agreement.  With reference to the case made here by Deputy Hewat's friends in connection with the London Midland and Scottish Railway I can quote another statement made against them in this.  We were told that we were going to frighten capital and that Englishmen would never sink a penny again in this country.</P>

I gave them no undertaking that I would not be prepared to stand over here.  We discussed the case at great length, this particular clause being one of the matters in dispute. <Col N="1016" /> I convinced them that it was a matter over which I had no control, and told them that there are certain things we can do and certain limitations to things which we can do.  This is one of them.  I may be wrong, but I think we are not entitled to tear up that agreement.

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the President is anxious to do justice to all, parts of the country.  Those, are the very motives which actuated me in proposing this amendment, because, according to this existing agreement, justice is not done.  This is preferential treatment for one part to the detriment of the other parts, and it is for that reason that I am anxious to place all parts upon an equal basis.  The President has said, and I agree with him, that a bargain is a bargain, and if that bargain was made between&mdash;I think he used the term man and man&mdash; Corporation and Corporation, is this to be the only bargain which is to be insisted on?  My objection is that the second bargain I refer to, namely, that contained in the Act of 1898, Section 70, which provides that a daily service of steamers shall be run by the Great Western Railway Company, should be enforced.  If the President assures me that he can enforce, and that he will enforce Section 70 of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Act of 1898, whereby a daily service is to be run from the port of Waterford, I will be satisfied to withdraw my amendment.  It is true that there were friends of mine in another place at the time of the passage of those Acts, but the fact that they were there does not make them responsible for the passage of the Act.  It is also true that this agreement of preferential treatment for Rosslare would never have passed through if this second agreement, that there should be a daily service from Waterford, was not also inserted, and it does seem hard that when there are two agreements affecting a particular port embodied in two Bills, that one agreement is to be allowed <Col N="1017" /> to become inoperative, and that the other agreement, because it is a statutory enactment, is not to be interfered with.</P>
      <P>That is the position to-day, and I would, therefore, ask the President if he can assure me that Section 70 of the Act of 1898 will be enforced, and that if that is not enforced, upon what grounds it can be said that the other agreement must be allowed to stand?  Undoubtedly, these two agreements hang together, and possibly, I do not say actually, one agreement was allowed to be made because of the other.  I do submit that in all fairness, if an agreement giving special treatment to the port of Rosslare in preference to the port of Waterford is to be allowed to stand, that the other agreement insisting upon a daily service of steamers by the same company from the port of Waterford, should be insisted upon.</P>

I think that amendments in the Dáil, irrespective of whom they may be put up by, should be considered and dealt with on their merits, and I think the President should have more regard for the merits of the amendment than for the places where these agreements were made or by whom they were made.  It is a new thing in Irish life, and perhaps not a bad thing, to come forward now, on this occasion, and say that simply because an agreement was made in the British House of Commons at a particular time that we must stand over it.  That is the effect of the President's argument when he taunts Deputy Redmond and his friends with being a party to an agreement which he says is binding for that reason.</P>

      <P>If agreements were made in the British House of Commons which, as a result of experience, we know are going to be to the disadvantage <Col N="1018" /> of this country, we must pay regard to the facts and to what suits Ireland at this particular moment rather than have regard for the time when these agreements were made, when they were entered into, and by whom they were made.  Dublin is, I hope, and will remain the capital of Ireland and not of the Free State. The fact that it is at the moment the capital of Ireland and how long it will remain the capital will depend on the amount of trade which flows through its port.  I would not be a party to the existence of any arrangement or agreement which would deprive Dublin of its premier status as a port, and perhaps take the risk of Belfast being placed in the first position, Rosslare in the second, and Dublin in the third.  It is quite possible that might happen and that it could be the effect of the operation of this clause, unless there is a distinct understanding, and an undertaking given, that the tribunal will look at the matter purely from the point of view of preserving Dublin as the premier port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must understand that the Tribunal which is going to be asked to deal with any disputes arising out of the question of the diversion of traffic is a body superior to this Dáil, by reason of the powers that you are conferring upon it.  At a later stage, if it is considered that the tribunal is not doing what it should do to preserve the status of the port of Dublin, the Dáil will not have much right to interfere unless they take the responsibility of dismissing the Tribunal as a body or amending the present Act.  Deputy Redmond quoted from some agreement with which I am not very well acquainted; but I think there are many agreements dealing with the very same question.  I have a copy of an agreement which was produced at the Canal Commission in 1917 and which, I think, has clauses far more serious and perhaps far more disastrous to the port of Dublin, if they are not dealt with in some way or amended.  I have a copy of an agreement entered into on the 20th July, 1905, between the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Co. (hereinafter called the &ldquo;Fishguard Co.&rdquo;) of the first part, the <Col N="1019" /> Great Western Railway Company (hereinafter called the &ldquo;Great Western Co.&rdquo;) of the second part, and the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway Co. (hereinafter called the &ldquo;Great Southern Co.&rdquo;) of the third part.</P>
    <P>The agreement states: &ldquo;And whereas this agreement is intended to be supplemental to the said agreement of the 27th May, 1898, so scheduled and confirmed as aforesaid,&rdquo; and it goes on to say: &ldquo;In order so far as possible to secure the success of the through service via Fishguard and Rosslare all unconsigned traffic from stations on the Great Southern Railway situate South and South-West of Limerick and Limerick Junction (inclusive of Limerick and Limerick Junction) and railways beyond in Ireland and on the Waterford and Central Ireland and Waterford, Limerick and Western Railways, and on any new railways that may hereinafter be constructed or acquired in the South and South-West districts of Ireland, the stations on the Great Western Railway and railways beyond in England, south of an imaginary line drawn through the towns of Ruabon, Stoke-on-Trent, Ilkeston and Boston, shall be forwarded <i>via</i> Rosslare and Fishguard, when that route is open, and in the meantime <i>via</i> Waterford and New Milford.&rdquo;  That is the opening clause and then there is the really important one: &ldquo;The Great Southern Company shall also use all reasonable endeavours and shall afford all reasonable facilities to induce passengers between the districts mentioned in Article 1 to travel <i>via</i> Rosslare and Fishguard as soon as that route is open.  (3) The Great Southern Company shall also forward all traffic they can secure from Dublin and the line between Dublin and Kilkenny, inclusive of the latter to stations on the Great Western Railway and beyond <i>via</i> Rosslare and Fishguard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is the most important and the most serious clause in the agreement, if that agreement is going to be taken over with the meaning that you attach at present to the amalgamated company.  Deputy Hewat or Deputy Good&mdash;I confuse them because they are always using the same arguments&mdash;said a railway company was always anxious <Col N="1020" /> and desirous to secure traffic for a long haul.  It does not always depend on the long haulage; it depends on long haulage plus a heavy load.  It will be the business of the company to see that all unconsigned traffic will be sent from Dublin city viaâ Rosslare to any competitive point across the Channel.  When the Great Southern and Western Railway Company dominate the amalgamated Board it will be to their advantage. That will be a considerable advantage to the Great Southern and Western Railway Company or to the amalgamated company, because in the division of receipts the amalgamated company will get its proportion based on the mileage over which the traffic is brought.  It can do that quite irrespective of the fact that the traffic may not get via Rosslare and Waterford, the service which it could get if the traffic was brought by the port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Government was not so much to set up a system of railway reorganisation which would mean a certain dividend to the amalgamated company, as that the system of reorganisation should provide the most expeditious and the best service for carrying on the traffic.  That should be the real intention of the Act from the Government point of view, and I suppose it is.  Now, through the port of Dublin, you have several competing shipping companies.  You have eight or nine services per day as against one service daily via Rosslare.  I say it is not in the interests of the development of trade in this country that an agreement of that kind should allow the amalgamated company to carry traffic from Dublin to Kilkenny inclusive, via Rosslare and Fishguard unless they are in a position to give as expeditious a service as through the port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate a case which may happen under the terms of this Bill. The Dublin South Eastern traffic from Bray to Birmingham, which is a competitive point, can be sent via Rosslare and Fishguard or by Dublin at the same rate.  Under the terms of the Bill the Dublin South Eastern Railway becomes part of the amalgamated company. Under this agreement the proposal would be to send traffic from Bray to Birmingham via Rosslare. From Bray to Rosslare the distance is <Col N="1021" /> 90 miles and the distance from Bray to Dublin is only 12 miles.  Unless the companies concerned can prove there is a better service via Rosslare and Fishguard, the Government should not allow traffic being sent in that way.  I know many cases where traders have reason to complain of delay in getting traffic to a certain point.  The result has been in many cases loss of trade, and to send traffic out of this country. If sending traffic via Rosslare and Fishguard means that traffic will arrive later than when sent via Dublin, I say that that state of affairs should not be tolerated by the passing of any such clause as Clause 29 of this Bill.  I quite agree with the Government in this, and I believe that they have this in their mind in framing the Bill.  Their desire is to create a keen competition amongst cross-Channel companies that are looking for Irish traffic, a cutthroat competition if you like.  Where there is competition under ordinary circumstances the result is a benefit to the trade of the country.  The existence of the agreement has an opposite effect. There is no necessity for the Great Southern and Western Company to compete for traffic when they have an agreement which enables them to have the traffic sent by this route.  There is nothing in the Bill which enables the company to quote through rates by alternative routes.</P>
    <P>In the natural state of things this agreement will allow the Great Western Railway Company of England to secure this traffic without any competition whatever.  If the President can explain where competition is involved by the carrying out of this agreement I will be agreeably surprised.  He refers to the fact that the volume of unconsigned traffic would not amount to more than 10 per cent.  I would like to know where he got his statistics from.  I do not know, and I cannot find out, where any return has been rendered by the Irish Railway Companies to the Clearing House or to anybody else or where returns have been collected so that he shall know what was the amount of unconsigned traffic. Again I say I would like to know where he got his information.  I am informed that traders are very reluctant, foolishly, perhaps, in their own <Col N="1022" /> interests, to make out consignment notes.  I think that is a disadvantage to the traders who are in the habit of sending traffic.  When they come to find out the disadvantage of not sending traffic by a particular route, then they will come to realise that it is to their advantage to make out consignment notes.  The trade of this country with England and the development of that trade depends upon the railway and transport services and the facilities that can be given by the railway and shipping companies to get trade commodities to the British market in the shortest possible time.  I wish to say that the existence of the agreement which I have referred to, and which the President has treated so lightly, destroys that very competition, which will help to develop the trade of the country.  I think the President has dwelt in opposing the amendment&mdash;if he has done so&mdash;on where this agreement was made and by whom it was made, rather than face the actual facts that are created as a result of carrying over the existing agreement to the amalgamated company, which will be detrimental to the amalgamated company in the future.</P>

      <P>I want to supplement what Deputy Davin has said in regard to this agreement.  The President has referred to the agreement entered into prior to the Act of Parliament, which contained a general consent to confirm it.  He makes the argument that because that agreement was entered into by an Irish national with a British national it was confirmed by the British Act of Parliament, forgetting, by the way, that so far as nationals go, they were both the same so far as the law goes.  That argument does not hold, especially when we are dealing now with a legal enactment in a new situation.  But this agreement, as has been pointed out, was supplementary to that Act of Parliament, and one wonders, in view of the apparent ignorance of the existence of this agreement, whether there are other agreements of a similar and more binding kind.  The Minister says &ldquo;no.&rdquo; How does he know?</P>

      <P>Well, then, it was disingenuous of the President to refer to the agreement embodied in the Act of Parliament.  This agreement was more binding and more detrimental to the general interests, no matter how it may serve the general interests of the Great Southern and Western Railway. It is not quite correct to say, as Deputy Davin did, that this agreement only deals with unconsigned traffic. Section 1 is as follows, and I am going to trouble the House with it, because it is quite important:&mdash;&ldquo;In order, as far as possible, to secure the success of the true service via Fishguard and Rosslare all unconsigned traffic from stations on the Great Southern Railway Station situate south and south-west of Limerick and Limerick Junction (inclusive of Limerick and Limerick Junction) and railways beyond in Ireland and on the Waterford and Central Ireland and Waterford, Limerick and Western railways, and on any new railways that may hereafter be constructed or acquired in the south and south-west districts of Ireland to stations on the Great Western Railways beyond in England south of an imaginary line drawn through the towns of Ruabon, Stoke-on-Trent, Ilkeston and Boston shall be forwarded via Rosslare and Fishguard when that route is open, and in the meantime via Waterford and New Milford.</P>

      <P>Their powers are implicit enough not to use their endeayours upon customers, either not to consign or to consign by Fishguard, even from Dublin.  But they can persuade people by a little hoodwinking.  It is quite possible for railway companies to say to a customer, you need not consign it that way.  We will put it through all right.  You need not indicate the route.  And in that way they could secure traffic from many points from Dublin South, and they could secure that every penny's worth of these goods be consigned <i>via</i> Fishguard.  I agree that there should be no consent from this Dáil to allow this amalgamated company, which is obviously going to be dominated by the Great Southern and Western Railway, to retain in existence this agreement which binds the Great Southern Railway to use its influence to divert traffic <i>via</i> Rosslare.  As Deputy Davin has pointed out, unless the customer is going to choose which is the quickest and most expeditious route, and to do half of the work of interpreting the routes, which the railway company ought to do, the railway company is bound to send the goods by, perhaps, the longest and, possibly, the least efficient and least expeditious route. Surely we ought to be free to tell the railway company, &ldquo;Here is a consignment which we desire to be delivered at Leicester at the earliest possible hour, and by the safest and the most effective route, and to be delivered perhaps on the best conditions as well as in the shortest time.&rdquo;  Surely we ought to expect the railway companies to do that for a customer.  But, no, this agreement says unless you have decided and found out by your own inquiries which is the best route, and the most satisfactory route for that particular class of commodity, the Company is bound to send it <i>via</i> Rosslare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that is not satisfactory for the trading public.  And when we are doing for the railway companies, as, I <Col N="1025" /> submit, what we are asked to do under this Bill, we ought at least to deprive them of the power of doing things detrimental to the public interest, simply because they bound themselves in years gone by to do a thing when they were in some kind of association with a British company in rivalry with another British company.  I believe that this is quite a critical section in the Bill, and this is a critical amendment, and we are bound to insist that the Dáil should not allow this agreement to be continued, and should not insert a section in the Bill which says that any agreement of that kind that has been entered into must remain in force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGARRY</NameTxt>
      <P>The last few points in the speech of Deputy Johnson covered those I wanted to make on this matter with regard to unconsigned traffic.  Every member of the House will admit it is vital for people consigning goods out of Ireland to get these goods to their destination as quickly as possible.  You cannot expect the people of a business community to look up routes and details as to how long it will take by this or that or the other route.  You do not consign your stuff by any direct route. You trust the railway company.  And you expect the railway company when you give them the goods on trust to deliver them by the most expeditious route. How can you take them on trust if you know there is this agreement, and I do not know how many other agreements&mdash;but, at any rate, this definite one&mdash;that prevent the railway company sending stuff to England from this country by the most expeditious route.  That seems to me a most important aspect of the situation.  I have some experience in these matters. Some members of the House who have no experience wonder why it is that the Great Southern and Western Railway, with an outlet of its own in Dublin, can send stuff south by Rosslare. The fact of the matter is that the Great Southern and Western Railway do it themselves to a great extent, because people shipping from Dublin, or other places in the neighbourhood of Dublin, take the railway company on trust, and take it for granted that they are sending the goods by the most <Col N="1026" /> expeditious route, which they cannot do under that agreement.  I think that not only that agreement, but any other agreement entered into by any of the companies that will form the amalgamated company with cross-Channel companies, should be laid before this House, and that we should not be asked to accept an agreement like that.</P>

      <P>I gave notice that I would raise this question of the treatment of ex-Service men by the Government on the motion for the adjournment. I am not raising it in order to make a personal attack on the Minister for Defence or any of the other Ministers, but simply because of the amount of distress that prevails amongst demobilised officers and men.  Long ago some voice should have been raised here in order to try and get from the Minister some kind of satisfactory answer as to what the intentions of the Government are concerning these men who have sacrificed so much in the interests of the country.  Demobilisation was started in the end of 1922 or the beginning of 1923, and at that time hundreds of officers were sent to the Curragh for supposed training.  These officers were paid for twelve months at the Curragh, and at the end of that period they were demobilised.  Personally, I think, it was a waste of money to pay these officers during that time, and what I think should have been done was to put the amount of money they received at the Curragh into their hands at the outset, because that would have enabled them to start some kind of business.  If that had been done, it would have saved many of them from the brink of starvation, on which they are at present.  A re-attesting scheme was started in the Army at rates varying from 12s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. per week, with 17s. 6d. to men <Col N="1027" /> who were in the Army and who reattested, and with an extra 2s. for tradesmen.  There was no provision made for paying dependents' allowances. I wonder did the Government think that they were going to get men to continue serving in the Army for 17s. 6d. a week, and 19s. 6d. in the case of tradesmen.  In my opinion, the Minister for Defence should have a little more thought for men who had served the country so well and so faithfully, and should not have expected them to continue their service in the Army at rates up to 19s. 6d. per week.  In the case of wounded men&mdash;and there was a large number wounded&mdash;gratuities of ten, fifteen and twenty pounds were paid to them, but they were given no pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1923, when the Army Pension Act was going through the Dáil, we were told that justice was going to be done to these people who went out and sacrificed everything they had in order that Deputies might meet in this Dáil, and that the Government would be put in a position to govern.  What is the position to-day?  You have an Army pension scheme, but as far as the great majority of these men are concerned, it is not an Army pension at all, but only a farcical sketch of a pension, something like the Old Age Pensions Act.  To give a sum of £15 to a man disabled because of his Army service is not, I say, a proper thing.  Some of the dependents of deceased Army men are not in receipt of anything, as their claims were rejected. I want to find out from the Minister for Defence whether it is the intention of the Government to amend the Army Pension Act so as to give better terms, better gratuities and better pensions to the men who were disabled during their service in the Army.  I also want to know from the Minister whether it is his intention to have inserted in that Act a provision that gratuities will be given to men who were disabled, not through getting wounded, but because they contracted disease while serving in the Army, and as a result of which they are at the present moment unfit to take up their usual occupations in civilian life.  It is quite true that we have not the whole of Ireland in the Saorstát at the present moment, but men from <Col N="1028" /> every part of Ireland served in the National Army.  You have in the Six Counties at the present moment men who served in the National Army. Many of these are disabled, not because of wounds they received, but because of disease that they contracted.  Some of them are tubercular, due in some case to pure neglect on the part of their superior officers in not looking after the men properly.  In some cases they got bad food; in others they were provided with bad clothes, and got hardship when out during the day and the night. I think these people are entitled to some recognition from the Government. I find that something like 40,000 men were demobilised.  Of that number, I understand that about 5,000 are in some kind of employment under the Government.</P>
    <P>What, I ask, has the Government done for the men who left their regular employment, whether it was in the workshop, on the roads or on the land, to join the National Army, to see that they obtained reinstatement in their former positions?  The President, of course, sent out a letter to practically every employer in the Saorstát asking them to reinstate ex-Army men who had been in their employment prior to joining the Army.  Naturally, the employers' reply was: &ldquo;His place is filled, and I have as good a man, and if I dismiss the man I have there will be one more added on the Labour Exchange list, and you might as well have a national soldier on it as a civilian.&rdquo; I think the Government should see that artisans who joined the Army are reinstated in their former positions.  I know it is hard for the Government to look after the large number of men who were demobilised within a very short period, but surely it was not all planned in the one night.  I am sure the Army Council did not decide in one night that they were going to demobilise 40,000 men inside of six months. They took more than one night to plan it, and when they planned and plotted, because it was a plot, they should have made some provision for these men. But what happened was that 40,000 men were thrown out on the streets to starve with their families.  These men were discharged on 28 days' leave. <Col N="1029" /> They were at home for these 28 days, for which they got paid, and then the Government was finished with them for ever, at least, until the country called them again, if they are fools enough to come back and answer the call.  I would also like the Minister to say why men who have served two years in the Army are not entitled to unemployment benefit.  Under the Unemployment Insurance Act before a person is entitled to benefit he must have at least 12 weeks' contributions on his card, and the demobilised soldier who has not 12 stamps on his card prior to attesting is not entitled to benefit, notwithstanding the fact that if he served for two years in the Army he would have 24 stamps on his card, one for each month.  The Government did not stamp the cards each week, but only each month.  I presume that was for economy purposes.</P>
    <P>Men who were interned for twelve months before the Truce and who afterwards joined the National Army are also debarred from getting the unemployment benefit.  Surely, these cases should be taken into account.  In some parts of the country men have to walk six and eight miles to the Labour Exchanges. When they get there they are told to come back on the following Friday. That goes on for seven or eight weeks.  In the end, they are told that their cards have not come from the Government, that apparently they were not employed before they joined the Army, and were, therefore, not entitled to benefit.  A large number of demobilised men are under notice of eviction.  In Dublin I know of 30 such cases. Throughout the country the same thing is happening.  Naturally, the landlord must get his rent, but the tenants are not able to pay.  If such a case comes before a magistrate it will not do for a man to say that he has served in the National Army and has received nothing.  That will not be taken as an excuse.  He must pay the rent.  How is he going to get it if those whom he has served do not assist him?  This is a sample of letters I have been receiving. I am sure Deputies have received hundreds of such letters from all parts of the country.  This is from a man in Athlone.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have not paid rent for the past <Col N="1030" /> four weeks.  I am now noticed to quit.  My wife and two children have been sick for the past ten days.  I have no money to pay medical expenses, and the only chance I have of saving their lives is to send them to the County Home to be an incumbrance upon the ratepayers.  We are, at the present moment, in semi-starvation. This is what I have achieved for fighting for the National Army.</P>
    <P>Surely, it is time for the Government to do something for these men.  I have written to several Ministers with regard to cases throughout the country where men are not allowed to work because they have served in the National Army.  The employers who engaged the men receive threatening letters, and if they do not dismiss the men they are approached at night time or in the early hours of the morning, and told that if they do not dismiss them they will have to suffer the consequences.  I have given the facts regarding one such case.  That man wants nothing from the Government only what they owe him, so that he can leave the country and take his wife and two children with him.  Otherwise his life may be forfeited at any moment. We have other cases of men who had to arrest some of their own chums, who were not in agreement with the Government. National soldiers in some country districts had to go out and arrest their own school chums.  As a result, I know of several men who dare not go near their own native place, and they are living like rats under a ditch.  Deputy Gorey would not laugh in 1922 when these men were out risking their lives in order to see that Deputy Gorey's and other Deputies lives were saved.</P>

      <P>I see nothing to laugh at in the phrase &ldquo;living like rats under a ditch.&rdquo;  Some of them are living in hovels because they cannot go back to their homes.  If they attempt <Col N="1031" /> to go home they are met by a body of men and told to clear out.  I can produce proofs and bring these men forward if the Minister doubts what I have said as to the way in which their lives are threatened.  It would have been much better for the Government when they demobilised those men to have given them their passage money and a few pounds for expenses, and told them to go to another country, as there was no room for them here.  I do not say that the Government have not tried to do justice.  I am sure that every Minister realises the services that these men have rendered to the country. I do say, however, that something better could have been done for them. I do not ask charity on behalf of these men, but I do not want them to be going to the Labour Exchange with their hands out for alms.  They do not want that themselves.  If seven hundred men are demobilised in one town, and if they are eligible for a dole of £1 each, in seven weeks that would amount to nearly £5,000.  Would it not be better if that £5,000 was put into some industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I see a large number of the people of the Saorstát do not want progress. We are not a progressive race at present.  No, we like to go back to the &ldquo;Paddy-go-easy times at the lazy corner.&rdquo;  The demobilised men do not want to be going to the Labour Exchange. All that the ex-Service men of the National Army want is work and a satisfactory wage.  We are told, &ldquo;We will reduce the wages in this county and that county as there are any amount of ex-Service men glad to take 30s. a week.&rdquo;  It is a wrong system to try and make strike-breakers or &ldquo;red-legs&rdquo; of ex-National Service men by forcing them into positions at a wage below the existing rate.  I can send the Minister the names of the thirty people that I speak of who are to be evicted in the City of Dublin, and also the names of the landlords.  In addition, I can send the receipts for rent that has been paid by the Association of ex-officers and men of the National Army. I want to criticise the provisions of the Pensions Act, of 1923.  Will the Minister for Defence allow an independent referee with a panel of civilian doctors? <Col N="1032" /> If he does, the men will have some chance of getting justice.  The British Government, bad as it was, treated their ex-Service men who are now living in the Saorstát, well.  There are Boards of Referees to which the men can make application.  I like tradesmen to get tradesmen's wages, but it would be something to go on with if handicraft schools were established here.  Any man who had served twelve months or two years to a trade before joining the Army, might be assisted by the Government in that way, so that he could serve the remainder of his time, and come out as an improver until qualified as a tradesman.  The Minister for Defence will no doubt tell us that there are no finances, and that the country cannot afford the expenditure to relieve distress amongst ex-officers and men of the National Army.  If the Government even started a subscription list and headed it with £5,000, surely every person in the Saorstát who could afford a £5 note, would be only too glad to send it in to relieve the distress amongst men who, at the risk of their lives, had saved property.  What has the Government done for the relief of distress amongst these men?  To my mind they have done nothing.  If trouble started again to-morrow there would be a cry for volunteers.  Recruiting would be started and men would be got together like a flock of sheep and sent to the danger point.  When the trouble is over the men would again be told that there was no further use for them.</P>

      <P>I do not know any member of the organisation of which Deputy Lyons has spoken.  At the present moment I do not think any man <Col N="1033" /> in the Dáil knows as many demobilised officers and men as I do.  I do not know one of them who is a member of this Association.  I think demobilised men can be divided into two classes, men who were in the Volunteers and in the I.R.A. previous to the Truce, and men who joined subsequently.  I will deal with the men who served previous to the Truce first.  These are the men to whom the present Government owes its existence.  As this is the first opportunity I have had since these men have been demobilised, I want to say now that these men have been shamefully treated.  It would seem that those responsible for demobilisation deliberately set out to cut these men off from the Army.  Without the work of these men in the troubled times these people could never have reached the positions they hold.  It would seem to the onlooker as if they sat down deliberately, calmly and coolly to knock these men out of the Army.  These men were transferred from the I.R.A. to the Army when the Saorstát was formed; some of them had been for six, five, or four years without payment. They fought all the time and bore the brunt of the struggle, and they are thrown out, most shamefully, I say.  With regard to the 40,000, we did not hear much about the 40,000 prior to the Truce.  There are, I suppose, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30,000 men demobilised.  They came in mostly because they were unemployed, the Army gave them a job, a risky job, if you like, they carried out the work in the Army as well as they would have carried out their work in any other job, they took risks appertaining to the Army, and some of them suffered, and they are entitled to consideration. But a number of these men would never have been in the Army if they had not been unemployed.  The unemployment was not caused by the present Government, and I do not want to blame them.  I have a lot of things to blame them for, but I do not want to blame them for anything they are not responsible for.  They were not responsible for the unemployment that caused these men to join the Army, and the absolute fact of the matter is that instead of their being unemployed for two years they got employment from <Col N="1034" /> the Army for two years, and then went back to where they were in the beginning. That is exactly the position.  I want to be fair to the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Government have received complaints from ex-Army men who could not get back to their positions under local government bodies, because they served in the Army; in some instances they were requested to come into the Army.  But I do know, and the President knows, that men were taken from positions, men who had been working with us from 1914 to the time of the Truce, who were willing to carry on in the civilian positions in which they work for us and their employers as well.  These men were taken out of their employment; they were used as long as they were useful, and then they were thrown on the streets in such a condition that it was impossible for them to get back to their former positions, even if their employers were ready to take them.  I am sending the President the names of these men; I spoke to him about them before.  I believe that apart from special cases, wounded men and men with special distinctions and service, that the demobilised men should be dealt with under a general scheme for unemployment, and I am very, very sorry to say that in the feeble attempt the Government made to tackle the unemployment question, they never got further than what I heard described as &ldquo;charity roads.&rdquo;  I believe that the first time we heard of that kind of thing was in 1847, and it was a policy in augurated by the British Government The British Government, in 1846 and 1847, made respectable, upright, hardworking, honest men into paupers, and we are following in their footsteps. Every man who goes out to work on your unemployment scheme, on your charity roads, believes that he is going out with the stigma of charity on him. Are we going to balance our Budget in two years and make paupers of our population?</P>

      <P>If that is the way you are going to balance your Budget I hope I will never see the Budget balanced. I think it is nearly time for the <Col N="1035" /> Government to sit down and give a little thought to the fact that we are faced with an unemployment problem. The same thing is happening now as happened when the Army crisis was coming on; so long as the Government cannot see danger, the danger does not exist.  But let them knock about; let them mix with the people; they are all in dug-outs here; you have got to pass an army before you can get at them. Let them knock around the streets, go through the country, hear what is being said, and see what the distress is like. There is not a man in Government Buildings who has the faintest idea of the distress, and the only thing we are offered is charity roads.  I would not mind if the people that we are putting on the roads had the slightest idea of how to make them.  People are working on the roads who worked in offices, who never handled a pick or a shovel in their lives, blistering their hands, and doing about an hour's work in a week, because their people are starving. Read the papers for the last few days. You have robberies all over the place. You have robberies in Drumcondra and in Grafton Street yesterday, the principal street in the city of Dublin, the capital of the Free State.  If the unemployment problem is not tackled, I am afraid you will have more than robberies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons on Friday expressed the hope that every Deputy in the Dáil would express his views on this question.  If every Deputy does so at the same length as Deputy Lyons, the Government had better give up any idea of progress with their business this week.  I wish to deprecate, first of all, the methods by which this question has been brought before the Dáil.  I, in common with others, have received what might almost be described as a threatening letter from an association saying: &ldquo;We shall remember those who support us and we shall remember those who do not,&rdquo; and, in addition, I believe there was a demonstration of some kind in Kildare Street to-day.  I have the greatest distaste for methods of that kind, and I am not influenced by them; I do not believe that the Dáil, as a whole, is influenced <Col N="1036" /> by them, and they would almost have prevented me from supporting Deputy Lyons to-night if I had not been convinced that the claim of these men is so strong.  What has the Government done?  As Deputy Lyons said, they have sent out circulars, not merely to those who had National Army men in their employment before, but to those who had not.  If sending out circulars was all that was needed to meet the situation, they have done admirably; I have got more circulars than I employ men.  If Deputy Hewat got them on the same scale Deputy Hewat must have felt himself under a snowstorm.  The Government has given road grants; I will say no more about that.  They have suggested that money voted for compensation for malicious injuries should be used on reconstruction work, but they have not set an example in using such money themselves.  Government buildings have been destroyed as well as private property.  The Customs House is a ruin; the Four Courts are in ruins, and the G.P.O. is a ruin since 1916.  Presumably we shall need law courts in the future; presumably we shall need a Post Office.  If the Government think that things are so unsettled that it is not safe to rebuild, how can they expect a private individual to do so? Then, again, they have set up a Resettlement Branch of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; that Resettlement Branch succeeded in finding jobs for one man out of every ten demobilised, according to the Minister's statement to me.  If he wishes to correct me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely a fair presentation, unless all that is implicit is realised.  It is quite true that only one out of every ten demobilised secured appointments, but one out of every four who applied to the Resettlement Branch did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts remain that 30,000 men have been demobilised, and jobs have been found for 3,000.  I do not want to blame the Resettlement Branch, but I think the reason that such a comparatively small proportion applied was that they had such little confidence in it.  Then a great many men <Col N="1037" /> thought, as the British soldiers after the Great War thought, that they were entitled to unemployment benefit.  I have many letters from men who thought they were going to get unemployment benefit, but because their cards were not stamped they could not get it.  Then when men have been entitled to money there have been serious delays in payment.  I have heard of cases where demobilised officers had to wait for weeks, before getting the three months gratuity, and civilian clothes. That grant for civilian clothes ought to be paid before the man leaves the Army at all, because most of those officers have neither credit nor capital.  They have to wear old clothes, and everybody who knows anything, knows what a handicap old clothes are to a man who is looking for a job.  A man wants to look his best and smartest if he wants to get a job.  The whole thing has been handled unimaginatively.  I am not going to differentiate between men as Deputy McGarry has done.  Once the Government employed a man, once they put him in uniform, they undertook a responsibility towards him.  There has been no adequate expression of appreciation of the services that these men rendered to the State.  I am not aware that men demobilised received any message of thanks from the President, or the Minister for Defence, or from any quarter.  It might have been a very good thing to have had a parade of the demobilised men in the Phoenix Park, or the Curragh, and to have the President address them and thank them.  All these things strike the public imagination, and would have made it easier for the men to get work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a few practical suggestions: the first is, that the Government itself should set the example in undertaking reconstruction work, and the second is that an independent Pensions Appeal Board should be set up at once, and not to wait until another 1,700 cases have been disposed of, when there will be a glut of appeals to be heard and the proceedings will stretch out almost to the end of time.  It should be started at once with an independent referee and civilian doctors, not under the control of the Minister for Defence, for rightly or wrongly, probably wrongly, the men have no confidence in <Col N="1038" /> doctors still in the Army, as they think that they have to obey orders.  The Resettlement Branch should have its scope extended, and something like a Soldiers' Friend appointed, who could advise men on all matters, not merely in obtaining jobs, but in obtaining unemployment benefit, difficulties with landlords, and all the difficulties that confront these men in returning to civil life.  Army life does unfit men for civil life, and they do need help over the transition period.  I believe that to be absolutely necessary&mdash;I will not follow Deputy Lyons, who is always generous with figures&mdash;but there are 30,000 or so, demobilised, and they are demobilised with a sense of grievance, and it is dangerous to the State to have in it a body of men who feel they served it well, and feel they are not properly treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not occupy the Dáil too long in this matter, but I want to say in respect of that portion of Deputy Lyons' statement, followed as he was by Deputy Bryan Cooper, regarding pensions and the treatment of these demobilised men, with wounds, dependents, disease, and so on, that I think the Ministry is bound to take notice of the representations that have been made in that respect.  I think a very fair case is made on behalf of the men in respect of the pensions, and the review of pensions by the Appeals Tribunal.  We have been promised that the Ministry will bring forward an amendment to the Pensions Act.  We look forward to that with interest and hope, and with the expectation that it will remedy some of the grievances.  There are some grievances that may be amended without a new Act.  I think the question of the Appeals Tribunal is one, and also the provision for civilian doctors, but in respect of the employment of demobilised soldiers, I agree with Deputy Cooper about the not merely injudicious but very wrong circular which was sent out to members of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that that kind of solicitation will not be repeated by any organisation of any kind which requires sympathy, assistance, or notice.  But behind the distasteful and undesirable method of the presentation of the case, there is something to be said, and I <Col N="1039" /> think that the Ministry must take warning of the rising tide of agitation and discontent that is showing itself, and that not only amongst demobilised soldiers.  I would very much prefer that the question of employment would be treated as a problem of unemployment, whether the men were soldiers or not.  The man who worked in the Army had pay in the Army, while his brother outside was still hungry. If there is any preference to be given in that respect, I say that it is for the man who has been unemployed for the longest time and has the greatest number of dependents, but I say this problem of unemployment must be dealt with in as far as respects the demobilised soldier, and in so far as respects the civilian, who is unemployed, in a much bigger way than has been thought of or at least attempted by the Government up to now; otherwise you are going to see very grievous trouble, and I put it to the Government and to the members of the Dáil, supposing that the trouble you faced two years ago arose again, what would you do? Would you endeavour to organise a new Army to save the country?  This evil of unemployment requires just as much attention, just as earnest consideration, and ought to be dealt with in the same way&mdash;to organise a civilian army to do productive work&mdash;and if you have to call on the future, then call on the future for peace service just as you would call on the future for war service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to occupy too much time, or to delay the Minister for Defence in replying, but this discussion is of such vital importance that I do not think it is absolutely necessary that we should be confined in the discussion to 9.30.  There are only a few points which I think are of considerable importance that I want to draw attention to, and in doing so I will be as brief as possible.  I believe that one of the main grounds for complaint of the ex-service men is the provisions of the Army Pensions Act of 1923.  A Committee of the Dáil should be set up to inquire into its defects, and report on them, and, so far <Col N="1040" /> as I have been able to ascertain, there are very considerable defects.</P>
      <P>For instance, a man is entitled to a pension if a limb is so injured that it has to be amputated, but there is no provision for the loss of the power of that limb if the injury is not sufficient to necessitate amputation.  There is also lacking a provision for what is known as body wounds, unless these lead to total disablement.  These in themselves are serious defects, and I think call for some inquiry.  Further, there is no provision for treatment of wounds after demobilisation if the wounded soldier requires such treatment&mdash;no provision for medical attendance. Paragraph 2 of Section 5 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, provide, for any officer or soldier to whom a wound pension, whether temporary or permanent, has been granted under this Act, such vocational training, either free of charge or at a reduced charge, as such officer or soldier shall apply for, and the Minister shall consider suitable to his case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understand that not in one case has that particular part of that section been put into operation.  The men who would come under that section and who have been demobilised have not been circularised by the Government Department concerned, that such provision is available for them, and it would be interesting to know if the Government proposes to so inform them.  I do not wish, as I say to occupy the time to such an extent as to prevent the President or the Minister for Defence replying to the comments, but I do think there are sufficient grounds for a Committee of Inquiry, such as has been suggested by these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to make.  I believe that some time ago £10,000 was allocated to the Dublin Corporation for work that would employ such men, and that it was refused.  I understand that the Dublin Corporation is going to suffer a well-earned rest, and that certain Commissioners have been appointed to discharge its functions.  I do hope that these Commissioners will not treat that proffered grant in the same way as the Dublin Corporation, and that that £10,000 <Col N="1041" /> be made available for relief of unemployment of this kind.  I do not want to take up time further.  There are, I think, sufficient grounds to warrant an inquiry to ascertain what other defects of the Pensions Act there are; and so furnish the data for an amending Act that will remedy those defects.</P>

Deputies must realise their sense of responsibility when they get up here in a despairing and doleful tone, seeing before them every danger, seeing despair on every hand, pointing out all the infirmities that are in the national character, and then saying nothing can be done, and nothing will be done.  That is not the way to give a lead to anybody who has any respect for a lead at all, and that is one of the things which is, perhaps, our principal trouble at the present moment, those doleful, disastrous, despairing stories which Deputies themselves do not believe when they are speaking.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I understood the Deputy to say that there was no provision for soldiers who require certain operations or medical attention, or that they did not know anything about it.  Well, there they are.  Only this week I had representation from the Finance Officer that those men had no money and he wanted to know if he could supply them with cigarettes and tobacco.  That is evidence that they are there, but they are not getting paid.  I have not heard regarding the complaints concerning men in Local Government positions, but if there are such complaints I will undertake to do what is possible to get the men restored. Eleven thousand and fourteen men were on the register, and there were placed to date 3,127 by the Re-Settlement Branch.  I do not know whether there is included in that figure a couple of thousand men who, since this time twelve months, have been taken into the Civic Guard, quite a considerable number of men who are employed in clerical positions in the Government <Col N="1044" /> service, and a number who have been taken into the D.M.P.  We propose to open recruiting on Monday next for some thousands of soldiers&mdash;three or four thousand, or possibly more.  We have paid over five million pounds for compensation within the last two years, and a very small amount of that has been put into bricks and mortar. We have paid two million pounds on roads.  We have paid between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 in soldiers' pay and dependents' allowances.  We have provided £300,000 for housing. We gave £100,000 early in 1922 for unemployment. We gave £1,000,000 for housing generally over the country during those two years.  I want to know what Government there is in Europe, with the same revenue as we have, who have spent so much money in one way or other relieving unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>You are welcome. It has been suggested that we should rebuild the Four Courts, the Custom House and other places like that.  I have had some association with housing, and I am informed that any such activity on our part would militate against building houses for the working classes.  The Minister for Local Government is not present at the moment, but I understand <Col N="1045" /> there will shortly be accepted, on behalf of the Dublin Corporation, a tender for the construction of a couple of hundred houses.  I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be in conference with the Minister for Local Government in connection with a scheme for building something like four hundred or five hundred houses in the city during the next twelve months.  If we start on those other buildings there is no great advantage derived by the ordinary public.  There is only the employment. In the other case there is real advantage. In the first place there is employment, and in the second place there is the enjoyment of some sort of decent life on the part of those people. There is a Committee at present sitting which has been considering, I believe, for a fortnight, certain amendments to the Pensions Act.  I have not received a report from them yet.  I expect it, and I hope it will be possible to persuade the Minister for Finance to agree to such an amendment as I intend to move or as they will recommend.</P>
      <P>I have not heard cases of complaint as to the amount that was awarded by the Medical Board, and I do think that it is scarcely just to say that because an Army doctor does not make a recommendation, an outside doctor would make it.  If there is one class of people I know who are soft-hearted, and who must be soft-hearted by reason of their peculiar profession, it is doctors.  I have never heard of a case where a doctor, seeing suffering or anything of that sort, did not do everything that was possible to alleviate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any experience of those cases.  But in our case is it to be thought for a moment that a doctor, who would derive no benefit, good, bad or indifferent would not seek to get for a man everything he would be entitled to.  It might be supposed that the Minister for Finance would frown on him.  But the Minister for Finance does not come into it; it is the Minister for Defence.  And surely the Minister for Defence would <Col N="1046" /> not raise any objection to expenditure on foot of a really sound case such as that.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I said that this was the belief on the part of those men, that it was probably wrong, but that as it existed it should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that. There may be also complaints regarding the demobilisation of officers.  A large number of them were demobilised on one day.  In consequence there was some congestion in dealing with their cases.  But I think that is rapidly clearing away and that there is a good deal less cause for complaint now.  On Sunday last, and on the Sunday previous, I was engaged for four hours dealing with those cases&mdash;simply signing a number of documents that came up before me, dealing with pensions arising out of the Army Pensions Act, wound pensions and demobilisation grants. One can form some idea of the number that comes up when it takes four hours on Sunday to sign them, and that does not mean the whole of the week's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many times it has been mentioned here that there should be an Appeal Board in connection with these pensions. That is a matter, I think, it is fair should be considered, and I shall consider it.  About the Resettlement Branch, it was recommended that its scope should be extended.  I think that is a fair case.  I am prepared to consider that also.  I am not disposed to agree with Deputy Milroy regarding the necessity for amputation of a limb before getting a pension.  But if that be the case&mdash;and it is disputed by one of the officers of the Army&mdash;I will undertake that that also will be brought to the notice of the Committee dealing with pensions.  Somebody mentioned tubercular trouble.  I believe there were some cases of men suffering from tuberculosis.  There was no question of disease being mentioned in the Army Pensions Act.  That ought to have been mentioned last year.  One of the difficulties of dealing with a case of that sort is to trace its origin.  If it occurred in the army, if it was as a result of army service, if its ravages were seriously increased by reason of army service, <Col N="1047" /> then a case should lie against us. But if a man brought it in, it is not our liability.  There was no medical inspection coming in.  It can, of course, be claimed that a man would not be taken in unless he were medically fit, but one can understand that if disease is brought in&mdash;the question is at present under consideration by the Committee I mention&mdash;it must not be inferred. that the State is to accept liability for all the disorders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think when the Bill was going through the Dáil last year that the matter of disease contracted in the army was mentioned, and I think the Minister for Defence promised that provision for it would be made in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been mentioned here last year, but it was not embodied in the Act, and one can see at once how wide or extensive the Act might become if we included disease. We are, however, considering two diseases, and probably three.  The most dangerous of all diseases was not in the Act, namely, insanity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCARTHY Mr. McCARTHY">

      <P>Would the Minister say if the £10,000 grant to the Dublin Corporation will be handed over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government were to be in conference as to the housing scheme, and I take it that would be the best method of giving employment in the city.  The roads in the city do not require an expenditure which would give any sort of reasonable employment, but the development of a site for building might take in the same class of man and be much more useful.  That £10,000 would be now available for the consideration of the Commissioners, and I should say a considerable sum in addition. If there are cases where it is alleged that injustice has been done by <Col N="1048" /> the Pensions Committee, I am open to receive any communications on the subject and to go into them personally.  I should say that the Pensions Act has been criticised in a way that is scarcely just to the Government.  I mentioned here on more than one occasion within the last week or a fortnight that 1,700 cases had still to be considered.  A large number of people applied who had got no equitable claim and in consequence considerable delay was occasioned. People may think that they have a claim, but the fact that there is a large number of claims such as that naturally leads to congestion.  Two or three months ago I approached the late Minister for Defence with a view to speeding up the machinery of that particular Act, and he agreed.  A short time ago the former secretary became ill and another secretary was appointed. They are now speeding up the cases so much so that they come in piles of six or eight inches to be signed. I think there is now no unreasonable delay, and I have endeavoured to expedite the hearing of the 1,700 cases. I hope, before the Army Vote comes up, to be in a position to give a more favourable record of the proceedings.</P>

      <P>That was a matter considered here last year and put into the Bill dealing with the Defence Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Deputies had an opportunity to raise the point at that time.  I do not know anything about that item, and it would be useless for me to try and give the Deputy an explanation.  I understood from the Minister for Defence at the time that he dealt with the matter fairly and justly.  If that is not the case I am open to receive representations on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Only two claims appear to have been received from Mr. O'Dea.  One was for £16 0s. 6d. in respect of motor hirage.  The liability was incurred by Irregulars, and therefore cannot be discharged from Army funds.  The other was in respect of a Chevrolet motor car commandeered by troops.  The Deputy was informed, in reply to a similar question on the 15th January last, that Mr. O'Dea did not yet get delivery of the car, and that therefore a claim from him did not arise.  Mr. O'Dea was informed on the 7th February that compensation had been paid to the Connaught Motor and Cycle Works, Castlebar, to whom the car belonged.</P>
