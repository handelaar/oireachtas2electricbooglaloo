      <P>asked the President what are the intentions of the Government with regard to Civil Servants and other employes paid out of funds voted by the Dáil who were arrested and interned during the years 1922-23, and afterwards released without charge or trial; whether he is aware that several of these have not yet been reinstated, and that some of those who have been carrying on their work since release have not been paid their salaries; and, further, if he will say whether the practice adopted by the British during the period 1919-21 with regard to ex-interned public servants will be followed by the Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state how the National Debt Commissioners invested the sinking fund paid to them under Section 36 (2) of the Irish Land Act, 1903, for the year ended 31st March, 1922, and how much of the sinking fund was: (1) applied to the purchase of stock, (2) invested in further advances under this Act, (3) temporarily invested in the purchase of securities approved by the Ministry of Finance, and the approximate yield per cent., respectively, in the above-mentioned alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. E. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the published account of the Irish Land Purchase Fund, which is available to the public, the greater part of the Sinking Fund receipts for the year ended 31st March, 1922, were applied towards the making of fresh cash advances to tenant purchasers.  The actual figures were: £707,300 utilised in the latter manner, and £114,628 applied towards the purchase of stock, leaving uninvested a balance of merely £399.</P>
      <P>The Sinking Fund invested in the cancellation of stock yields a percentage equal to the current market value of money, about 5 per cent.  If disposed of in the manner described at (2) in the question, and sanctioned by Section 36 of the Land Act, 1903, the apparent yield is less, but the difference is made up in the saving effected in such cases by the non-issue of Excess Stock, the interest and sinking fund on which would be borne by the general taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the District Court at Ballineen is held once a month in the place stated.  I have not received any complaints as to the alleged inconvenience.  It is the duty of the Cork County Council to provide accommodation for the Court; my function in the matter is, in effect, to accept the accommodation offered, if it is reasonably adequate, or, in the alternative, to abandon the Court, and the latter course would probably cause more inconvenience locally than does the occasional occupation of the school.</P>

He could not, therefore, be regarded as a permanent official, and as he did not hold a pensionable post, he is not legally entitled to compensation.</P>

      <P>The late Michael Gallagher made application to the Estates Commissioners as the representative of his uncle, Patrick Gallagher, deceased, who had been evicted from a holding at Traeneerla, on the Clanricarde Estate. The late C.D. Board, on acquiring the lands, proposed to provide Michael Gallagher with a holding.  On the death of Michael Gallagher applications for the lands were made by several persons: (1) Thomas Gallagher, brother of Michael Gallagher, who resided in New York; (2) Michael Gallagher, a cousin of the deceased Michael Gallagher, whose mother is a tenant purchaser of another holding on the Clanricarde Estate; (3) Thomas Gallagher, another cousin, a shop assistant in Aughrim, and (4) Patrick Hardiman, with whom the deceased Michael Gallagher had resided until his death, and who forwarded a copy of a will of the latter, leaving him any rights he had to the evicted holding or any holding granted in lieu thereof. Moreover, the Thomas Gallagher who resided in Aughrim, stated that the deceased Michael Gallagher had, a few days before his death, made a will in his favour, and that he had defrayed the burial expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estates Commissioners, in the exercise of the discretion vested in them, decided to take no action in respect of any of these applications, and the holding was sold to another evicted tenant on the property, whose former holding <Col N="1007" /> was not available.  The Land Commission do not propose to take any action as regards these applications.  It is, of course, open to them to reconsider the case when lands in that neighbourhood are acquired under the 1923 Act.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment by Mr. Duggan to Section 6.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 58, to delete the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; and to add in page 4, at the end of the sub-section, the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the total value of such assistance, as determined by the Minister, shall not exceed the value of the grant payable by the Minister in respect of that house.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in dispute when progress was reported yesterday was as to the taking out of the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; and leaving the local authority an option to grant all or any of the items mentioned under sub-sections <Col N="1009" /> (1) of Section 6, (a), (b), (c) or (d).  I explained that the proposal which was outlined in the amendment was put in by the Government in the sub-section and was to the effect that we calculated the maximum amount of value in the nature of a contribution from the local authority would be £100. That was not taking into consideration Part II of the Schedule: that is the relief from rates over a certain period. Some objection was made by certain Deputies on the ground that we were restricting the local authorities by not giving them an option to give greater advantages if they thought fit, and I stated the Government side of the case. I do not know whether Deputies wish to say anything more with regard to the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the President was to look into this matter of the value of the work which the local authority was presumed to do under this Bill, because we pointed out yesterday afternoon, while we were discussing this clause, that the local authority was limited in its contribution. The total value of the assistance given by the local authority is limited to the equivalent of the grant given by the Government.  The grant given by the Government in the case of a three-roomed house, as one can see by reference to the Schedule, is a sum of £60, and it is pointed out that if the local authority was limited to a sum of £60 it would not be able to provide the different items necessary if houses are to be erected at the rates provided in the Schedule.  I understood, on the adjournment last evening, that the President was to look into that particular aspect of the case.  In the limited time that has elapsed since, and the difficulty that a Deputy has of getting at figures which are readily accessible to the Government, one has not an opportunity of inquiring as fully as one would like into this particular item.  But in the local authority that I happen to be connected with and which is engaged in erecting twenty-eight cottages on one site&mdash;the other cottages on another site are practically finished, and they are erected on land that was already the property of the local authority, so that the question of the purchase of the land <Col N="1010" /> did not arise at all&mdash;the cost of the land works out at £35 14s. 3d. per house.  Only three-roomed houses are to be erected on this particular site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That land was purchased by agreement, so that the cost would be much lower than if the land had been acquired compulsorily.  Even purchasing by agreement and avoiding all the other expenses, it works out at £35 14s. 3d.  The development of the land will cost another £35 14s. 8d. It costs practically £1,000 to purchase the land, and the estimate for the development of the land&mdash;that is, including the different items we were discussing yesterday&mdash;amounts to another £1,000.  In fact, it did amount to £1,100, but I understand that it has been reduced to £1,000, so that between these two items we have an outlay on this particular scheme of £71 8s. 11d. Then you have to add to that the expenses of the local authority.  I have put them down at the exceedingly small sum of £5 per house.  I happened to be looking through some figures in connection with the Government scheme, and to show you that £140 in connection with that site is small, I notice that in the Fairbrothers' Field scheme&mdash;and I must be cautious about this matter, because I am speaking about the Dublin Corporation in the presence of Deputy Byrne&mdash;the local costs were computed at £27 10s. per house, so that I think the Dáil will agree that I have taken a reasonable figure.  This does not include any provision for interest and sinking fund on the money that is being provided by the local authority, and I think that is absolutely essential, because you will find in the amendment proposed by the Government the words: &ldquo;Provided that the total value of such assistance, as determined by the Minister, shall not exceed the value of the grant payable by the Minister in respect of such house.&rdquo;  So that it is only reasonable to infer that that must include all the expenses of the local authority.  I quite agree with the President when he says that the remission of rates is not included in this particular item, but in this connection, as in many other clauses in the Bill, I would like to see words added to that effect, because <Col N="1011" /> local authorities are not lawyers, and if they see in a particular clause that the total value of the assistance given by the local authority is limited to so and so, they are very apt to think that total assistance means assistance of all and every kind.  The figures I have given in connection with that particular scheme hardly constitute a fair example, because out of the twenty-eight houses in that scheme, eight adjoin the public road: consequently, no development at all is necessary in connection with eight, and the £1,000 for development should really be applicable to the others.  That would mean £50 per house, but I have not taken it on that basis. That means that per house the expense of the local authority there would be approximately £80.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the utmost to which the local authority could go would be a sum of £60 per house.  I think that proves very clearly what I stated last evening, that the provision proposed by the Government is wholly inadequate to meet the expenses that the local authority would have to incur.</P>

      <P>It has just occurred to me to suggest that Deputy Johnson and Deputy O'Mahony might accept the Government's amendment and withdraw theirs, if the President agrees to add: &ldquo;This to be exclusive of any site at the disposal of the local authority.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a weakness in the amendment.  &ldquo;At the disposal of the local authority&rdquo;&mdash;does that mean at the present moment at their disposal, or if they were to wait for three months and then acquire a site, would that also be covered by this amendment?  The amendment has a certain ambiguity about it that would open a very wide avenue of experiment <Col N="1012" /> to local authorities.  If the intention were simply to include sites at present in the possession of local authorities, it would certainly be unfair to a Council anxious and willing to provide a site, but who are prohibited by reason of the fact that they have had no inheritance, such as the Council has that is in the happy position of possessing a site.  I do not know that that would be very acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>You see the intention. The President understands what I mean, I am sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but still we have to contrast the various costs, not one particular item of cost alone.  If we take it that in the town of Gorey, for example, the local authority has a site, which it is willing to provide, and that the building costs in Gorey are relatively less than, we will say, in Timbuctoo, and that a greater case could be made in respect of the latter place as against Gorey, obviously in that case the Bill would lean favourably towards the more favourably circumstanced case, and would deal harshly with the town not so favourably circumstanced. I do not think in equity there would be a case for the acceptance of the amendment.  I think Deputy Good will plead guilty to having some knowledge of the cost of sites and cost of development, and how much they vary.  With regard to those local authorities generally, they pool the whole lot with regard to the costs of the site.  In other words, if you take the cost of a site in Dublin you cannot start in alphabetical order running down the costs of the various sites acquired since the Housing Acts came into operation, but one would be able to say at a moment's notice what would be the average price.  Deputy Good has mentioned one case in which the cost of acquisition for virgin soil was rather high.  I could have told him of two other cases where the cost of acquisition of virgin soil in the City of Dublin was relatively low, amounting to something like £300 per acre, and the cost of development bore a favourable comparison with the cost of development of other sites.  If I were Minister for Local Government and if I were asked <Col N="1013" /> to determine what the value of this particular Section meant, I would put down a certain figure which I would earmark for a site, and put down a certain figure for development in places like the City of Dublin.  The fact that it costs more would not weigh with me very considerably if I had the average amount.  It is no advantage to a person who is going to occupy one of these cottages to know that it costs the local authority, as it did in some instances, £10,000 per acre, as against cases where they were lucky enough to get the soil at £300 per acre.  What is the difference to the occupant of the house, whether it is the former or the latter?  None whatever.  With regard to development, the Deputy's figure was rather high.  Development cost might be run up from more causes than one.  It might not be a well-developed site, or might have been developed expensively, or the lay out may not have been considered with due regard to the economy which ought to be practised in matters of this sort.  That would be the concern of the local authority, and I do not see why if they spent more money than would be reasonable the occupier or builder should be called on to suffer on account of that.  I do say the Minister should have some discretion with regard to the cost of development in certain cases.  With regard to the general question, £100 for a five-roomed house can be divided into various different compartments.  There might be a free grant of a portion of the £100.  The cost of acquisition might in many cases approach a figure of £40, and development £20.  There would then be a case for a grant of £40, where the cost of acquisition and development may be £60.  If the Minister were to ear-mark a sum of, say, £60 for the site, and £30 for development, then the local authority would be able to subscribe £10.  I do say that in the majority of cases in large cities, such as Dublin, Cork, Waterford, and other places, the Minister should certainly put down a figure which he would estimate as the value to a builder of the site that he would get and of the development cost of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If the President would alter the Section so as to leave it in the <Col N="1014" /> discretion of the Ministry, I quite agree, then, that the Section will be a workable one, but as it stands it is an unworkable one.  The President has referred to the example that I have taken as possibly being an excessive cost, that is £35 14s. 8d. per house for development. If I might again refer to the Corporation, I may say they are carrying out a scheme at Marino, and I do not know whether the President is aware that the development there amounts to £53 15s. per house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, and I think, if my recollection is correct, that the original valuation of the cost of development in that particular case was even in excess of that sum.  I pointed it out when the Report first came before the Corporation for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

You will find it in the records of the Council for the year 1910 or 1911.  These are isolated instances.  At the moment I would not like to express an opinion as to how this Marino site was developed, but I would like to know whether there is not a road joining Drumcondra with the Malahide Road, and if the cost of that highway, that has nothing whatever to do with the houses to be constructed is included in the cost of development.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No; to the extent of 50 per cent. of the value of the grant as determined by the Minister.  I am inclined to think that the amendment as drafted meets the point that Deputy Good asked me to insert; that is that the Minister should have discretion. It is mentioned that the Minister should determine the value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think the power of the Minister is limited.  I am afraid there is too much, what we might call in ordinary language, ambiguity about this Bill.  I am afraid it will keep our new Courts of Justice busy for some time.  I am not very experienced in the drawing of legal documents, but from what I have seen of the Bill, except some of those who have been engaged in drawing it up are present, there will be some difficulty in interpreting it in future.  I think that is exceedingly unwise.  This is another one of the ambiguous Sections.  It reads as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that the total of such assistance as determined by the Minister shall not exceed the value of the grant payable by the Minister in respect of that house.&rdquo; As to whether that particular wording gives that discretionary power, that one is anxious that the Minister should have, is exceedingly debatable to my mind, reading the Section as it stands. If the Minister will undertake that any ambiguity will be put right, as far as I am concerned, I am quite satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has cleared up some matters of detail which I had intended to raise.  One was that in cases in which the combined value set upon the site and the development of the site did not reach the equivalent of the Government grant of £100 in value, would the person applying for the grant then be entitled to draw on the local body for the balance represented by the £100 grant?  The President has said yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1016" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to qualify that by saying that the local authority &ldquo;may, with the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;  It is not mandatory on the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment further on which, in the event of refusal on the part of the local authority, would give the person applying for the grant the right to appeal to the Minister to get a decision on it from the Minister.  In urban areas it will be found that, as a rule, the free grant of a site by the local authority and the relatively small amount of development in such cases will by no means reach £100.  If it were optional with the local authority, under such circumstances, to repudiate any further liability, then persons intending to build would be at a serious disadvantage and loss.  It may be urged that they have the alternative of applying for the grant of £100 in lieu of these concessions. But, in some cases, even though the grant of £100 may represent more than the actual value of the land and development, it may not be possible for the person desiring to build to secure land for the purpose.  Therefore, even though land and development would have a combined value of considerably less than £100, the fact that the person applying for the grant would be unable to get a site, will compel him to accept the site and the development associated with it, though they represent substantially less in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, after all that has transpired, that it would be possible to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Duggan provided that in the event of the site value and development not reaching £100 the person applying for the grant would get an additional sum to make up the £100 in value, and in addition placing no value on the concession with respect to rates, and no value on the provision of a loan I suggest, though it might not be possible now, that the President should insert a Section entitling a person applying for the grant to get the equivalent of £100 even if it be necessary to make that up by raising the site value, development value or money grant and making it clear that <Col N="1017" /> no value will be placed on the concession with respect to rates, and also on the concession with respect to raising a loan to the extent of £200.  We might come to an agreement to accept that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I am in order in discussing the matter that has been raised by Deputy O'Mahony, but I should like to point out some grave difficulties that would arise in the event of that particular amendment passing into law.  In order to keep within the strict rules, perhaps I had better not touch upon that aspect of the question now.  The Minister for Local Government is here and I think in the absence of any statement to the contrary that his interpretation of this Section is governed by what I have stated&mdash;that is, in the case of large urban districts, or even small urban districts, he would himself assess the particular value for a site upon which a house is to be constructed under this Act, and a certain sum for development. Then I think most of the fears and apprehensions of Deputy Good would vanish.  This is not a matter which will be interpreted in Court.  It will not and need not be the subject of legal argument by Counsel.  It is a matter at the discretion of the Minister who is responsible to the Dáil, and not to me or the Executive Council. It is his discretion that will be exercised in interpreting this particular Act.  If the Minister has no objection to what I have stated as to the interpretation he will put upon it then I do not see what fears Deputy Good can have on the point.</P>

Is it a proposal of this character: that A intends to build and gets a lease of a site, and that he desires the local authority should then come in, and acquire that particular land?  If that is the intention&mdash;to acquire the land after building has started, and after a bargain has been made between A and the landlord, I do not think a good case would lie there for the local authority acquiring the land, in the circumstances.  We ought to examine what is really meant by a proposal like that.  It would mean that A has made a bargain in respect of certain land and accepted it in good faith, and the only advantage that ought to lie, as far as A is concerned, is the commutation or purchase by agreement, for a certain number of years purchase, of the rent of that particular site.  In the Acts which provided for the acquisition of land, various scales are laid down for the valuation, and I think under the Land Clauses Act there was some small percentage allowed for disturbance.  In that case it is more than possible that A has paid for the disturbance already.</P>
      <P>He might be mulcted for a higher percentage for disturbance, the disturbance in such cases meaning the change of investments.  I do not think that it would facilitate the building of houses. It would be more in the nature of a purchase scheme for ground rents than one which would affect the Bill.  I think, on the whole, it might limit the opportunities that prospective builders would have of taking land on a lease, which might be much the easier way to acquire land for the purposes of building.</P>

If it is only put in an explanatory way, it would help laymen like myself to understand the Bill. Local authorities will look through the Bill to see how they can facilitate the erection of houses, but they are all laymen, and, consequently, in my opinion, the system which appears in the English Act could with advantage be adopted here.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 38, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (c), page 4, line 22, to add after the word &ldquo;applies&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and that nothing under this paragraph of the Act shall prevent local authorities from borrowing the amount required for the reconstruction of amalgamated workhouses into suitable dwellings, and that all rents be paid to said local authorities as part of repayment of the loan raised under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out that this amendment runs more or less in conjunction with amendment 23, which was discussed yesterday, and in connection with which the President agreed to send an Inspector to inquire into these amalgamated workhouses, to see if they are suitable for conversion into dwelling-houses. If this amendment is accepted local authorities will have power either to make gardens out of the land attached to these workhouses, or to allow other people to build on them where sites are scarce.  There is a large number of these amalgamated workhouses in the country, and if each of them only house 30 people, I am sure you would find accommodation for two or three hundred people.  In Westmeath and Longford we have three or four such institutions which would be capable of housing 110 or 120 people at least.  The amount of money raised by the local authorities by way of loans will not fall on the ratepayers, as the rent of such dwellings will go to repay the loan.  I think it is necessary that such buildings should be utilised for some useful purpose.  In the near future I am hoping to see all the military barracks evacuated, and these, too, can be used for the purpose of housing.  If people in the locality were provided with housing accommodation in such barracks, it would be much less expensive than erecting new houses.  We have heard a good deal about the necessity of providing houses in the city of Dublin, and I am of the opinion that Deputy Good, Deputy Johnson and other deputies simply imagine that the whole <Col N="1022" /> of Ireland is condensed and compressed into the city of Dublin, and that they must get all the facilities in the city, while the people in the country must be forgotten.  These workhouses are situated in the heart of small country towns, and it is essential that the people in the country should be housed there. You may have a great number of people in the slums in the city, but the people in the country are suffering as much hardship as those in the city.  I do not see why local authorities should not get permission to have these workhouses converted into suitable dwellings for the accommodation of the people, and they should be allowed to raise a loan for that purpose.</P>

I think the Dáil ought not to be asked to pass an amendment so strangely worded as this.  Nothing can prevent you from doing something but who is to give you power to do it?  The Deputy is a member of a local authority.

      <P>To insert before Sub-section (2) a new Sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And should any local authority decline to do any of the foregoing matters outlined in paragraphs (a) (b) (c) and (d) the person or persons applying for the grant shall be entitled to appeal to the Minister, who shall have power to direct the local authority to grant any or all of the matters appealed on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is simply a precautionary one.  It is only intended to apply in cases that may arise where the majority of a Board opposed to an individual applying for a grant may refuse to give him the facilities provided for in this section.  Possibly, the occasion would be very rare, but at the same time to prevent hardship, it is only fair that if such a circumstance should arise, an appeal should be given by the individual to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much fear that in this case great complications would be likely to arise.  Everybody knows that the local authority must estimate, just before the financial year closes, its expenditure for the forthcoming year.  Everybody equally knows that the local authority which has not made provision in its estimates for any particular service, is not entitled to spend money on that service. Granted that is the case and no provision is made on the estimate, the question arises, what power has the Ministry to get the money which has not been struck?  That leads us into a veritable vista of difficulties.  You sue the local authority for a sum of money that has not been struck under its estimates. Our law prescribes it can only spend money for the purpose estimated, and if called upon to provide the money, their Treasurer has an excellent case for saying, &ldquo;Such moneys were not raised by us and cannot be paid by us.&rdquo;  How will you make them do it? By getting an order in Court compelling them to strike a rate.  Striking a <Col N="1025" /> second rate costs as much for striking one penny as for ten shillings.  The same machinery has to be used.  Whatever way a matter of this sort is looked at, we could not countenance here any provision in any Act compelling a local authority to pay money which it has not raised and has not got.  Usually what would be done is to see where funds would be at their disposal, out of which such charges might be made.  The British Government had a happy knack in the case of the Corporation of Dublin of prescribing that the sum should be paid out of the Borough fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there are few local authorities which have anything in the nature of a Borough fund.  A Borough fund is a sort of revenue that comes in irrespective of rates altogether, and in the case of Dublin it amounts to a sum of between £28,000 and £30,000.  When certain moneys have been expended out of that fund, the remainder goes in relief to the rates.  In the case of an Urban authority, unless it has an estate and has set aside or earmarked a portion of the revenue from the estate, I do not know of any other source from which it could get this money.  I think it would precipitate much the same sort of uproar as occurred here when the British Government did the same thing with regard to the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts of 1919 and 1920.  They in an evil moment, gave way to a very evil temptation to undo everything that they had spent twenty, thirty, or forty years in trying to do, and that was to make local authorities safe for democracy. I am satisfied that, in most cases, Urban and Borough Councils and other public bodies, will deal favourably under this Act, and I am satisfied it would be a very unpatriotic action on the part of any local authority not to render all the aid they possibly could towards facilitating the working of this Act.  It is in their own interests it has been put forward.  For something like ten, fifteen, or twenty years one of the duties of local authorities was to look after housing in their district.  For a great number of years they did that according to their means, in some cases rather well, in other cases badly; but, generally, the means of the local authority was one of the controlling <Col N="1026" /> impulses with regard to any facilities that it might provide or in the attempts it might make in the nature of housing.  We are coming in now to help.  We came in rather generously last year and the year before. It is brought home to everybody now that the cost of housing is a cost which ought to be reduced.  There is scarcely any other service in the State that requires reduction more than this particular one.  In that connection, I am sure local authorities will realise their responsibilities, and if they are not prepared to do so, I do not know that by a clause like this you are likely to compel them.</P>

He assents, but he desires the State to come down upon the local bodies and to compel them to be generous with their rates.  I was glad to hear the President express the view that he did about the local authorities&mdash;the development of their powers as one means of insuring the safety of democracy.  I commend that sentiment to the Minister for Local Government, whose views I would like to hear expressed on this motion.  If we had his views we might then have some clue to the state of his mind with regard to local authorities and their position in the State.  I think it is a very good thing that when local authorities are really negligent of their obvious duties there should be a supreme authority to interfere, but I decline to approve of this amendment, which says that the Minister for Local Government, whose mind we do not know, should have authority to come down upon a local authority and tell them that they must comply with A, B, C, D, or E in this Section under such penalties as he may have power to inflict.

In connection with this Bill, the President has appealed to us for our co-operation.  Many of the clauses in the Bill, in the nature of Deputy O'Mahony's amendment, will, I think, be fatal to the good will that is so necessary in the carrying out of this measure.  Deputy Johnson has not given very enthusiastic support to the Bill on the whole, but I hope that before we are finished with it his mind will have taken a firmer stand on the condition of housing for the working classes.

      <P>One would imagine from the statements of several Deputies that compulsory powers had not hitherto been exercised by public bodies in Ireland; one would also imagine that neither Minister nor Deputy had hitherto uttered a word of condemnation as regards the administration of their powers by these public bodies, or that it had not been necessary in more than one case to supersede these local authorities.  The first objection raised by the President was that public bodies could only dispose of such moneys as had been raised by them during one particular year for the purposes for which the money was earmarked during that year.  That is a doctrine or a maxim that is well known by everyone who has been connected, or in association, with the public life of the country, but surely it is equally well known that before this Bill comes into operation all, or nearly all, the public bodies of the country will have struck their rate, and that if the objection raised by the President to this amendment is valid it will also be valid as regards the provision of funds in those cases in which public bodies approve and make grants under this particular Section.</P>
      <P>I do not remember that I was present at the meeting to which Deputy Johnson refers, but this I do know that he is quite right in surmising that I am in active sympathy with the doctrine laid down by the Minister for Education as expressed by the Deputy when he said we should not call upon the State to spoon-feed in all things.  I have not asked the State to spoon-feed in this case.  I have drawn attention to the fact that it may be only in rare cases that public bodies, because of hostility to an individual, might refuse to grant facilities that they are entitled to grant under this Section and it is only in such cases, if such cases arise, that the Minister for Local Government would be called upon to exercise what I say is a legitimate duty that ought to be exercised by the State in such conditions.</P>

No one has addressed himself so far actually to what the amendment stands for.  The amendment operates only in a case where a public body, through personal hostility to an individual, refuses to grant to him the rights they would grant to gentlemen in more favour with them, and in such an event, which may be rare and indeed which may not occur at all, the individual would have the right to appeal to the Minister for Local Government to be placed in the enjoyment of the facilities granted to others under the operations of this Bill.</P>

Generally if the local authority does not enter into the spirit of this Act then the people of that district or town or city, as the case may be, would suffer a disability as compared with people more fortunately situated, but I do not know that the case would be remedied or improved by the amendment moved by the Deputy. But the case he has made is one with which I am in entire sympathy.  It would be lamentable if out of a hundred local authorities ninety-five are willing to grant these concessions and five were not, but I think local opinion ought to be able to exert sufficient influence to compel a local authority in a case like that to review any decision of that sort in a case of that kind.</P>

      <P>In regard to this amendment, I hope not to take up any more of the Deputy's time than is absolutely essential.  The facts are, as I stated, almost <i>ad nauseam,</i> that in consequence persons who are now under the disability of having to build a house or buy one suffer in comparison with persons who purchased or built houses ten, nine or eight years ago, and therefore a person coming forward to build a house now, deserves some consideration at the hands of the community. The State is giving a certain subsidy towards the building of houses.  This subsidy in this Section is a subsidy we are asking from the local authorities, and I think, if the Deputy examines the accounts of every local authority in the country, he will find, in the vast majority of cases, as those who have indulged in housing, pre-war, during the war, or post-war found, that it was not an economic proposition. Now I have proved my first premises, and, as to my second premises, I put it to the Deputy's generosity that the ratepayers should be called upon to forego some of the advantages conferred upon them by persons who build <Col N="1031" /> houses during the period mentioned, that is for the first year to the nineteenth year.</P>

But the President should have taken into account also that, relatively, the general wages paid ten years ago were low, as was the cost all round.  I do not think on a comparative basis that houses are more costly to-day in relative terms of money than ten years ago.  Wages have gone up 200 to 300 per cent., and I do not think the cost of erecting a house has advanced to such an appreciable degree.  In the measure proposed in this Bill the rates are to be relieved for a period.  I think the period is too long.  During that twenty years the fortunate occupants of those houses will not bear their full share of local responsibility, but will the remission of rates in the first year, amounting to 95 per cent., prove such a great boon to those people?</P>

      <P>A penny is often welcome, but is this a time when the State should set a bad example by giving doles when the Minister for Local Government has a penal Bill before the Dáil for the collection of rates, which means that many ratepayers are financially unable to meet their obligations? Under Section 7, however, their burden will be very largely augmented, because they will have to bear the rates remitted from the fortunate occupants of houses that are being erected.  Now let <Col N="1032" /> us examine what the position is.  What will the valuation of one of those houses be in Dublin?  For a five-roomed house it will not amount to more than £15. Even under the regime of the Dublin Corporation, about which we hear so much, the rates are not more than 20s. in the £, so that the normal rates of such a house would be about £15.  That is not a very large sum in rates.  However, it is the only contribution in rates, or contribution to local services that the inhabitant of such a house would make.</P>
      <P>If we take 5 per cent. of £15, it only represents 15s.  How can you build up a civic spirit with a man paying 15s. for one year, 30s. for a second year, and 45s. for the third year?  It is merely flooding the country with cheap voters.  There is even a larger principle involved.  The principle of doles and subsidies has been the ruination of this country.  Doles represent the incipient state of decay, but unfortunately in this country they have put us to the last gasp.</P>

      <P>Very well.  If we have to admit that some big contribution must come from somebody, and that the matter in dispute is that the State should bear the whole of it, then I understand the Deputy's position.  If this particular imposition ought to be put on the State, in addition to the £100, £80, or £60 of a grant, as the case may be, I quite understand him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President <Col N="1033" /> misunderstands my point, which is that the occupants should pay the rates in full and should not get any preferential treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is argued that the local authority, which is having £500 spent in the district, the expenditure of which sum improves its valuation and enhances the health of the citizen, the local authority thereby deriving more benefit directly and indirectly, should not be asked to forego its full pound of flesh in the very first year.  The Deputy apparently does not understand how far things have moved since 1914.  A house valued now at £11 would have been valued in 1914 at possibly £7 or £8, and the occupier of a house now will be at a potential and reversionary disadvantage by the end of twenty years.  From practically the fifteenth or sixteenth year he has to bear a valuation that his brother, who had a house built in 1914, has not to bear or will not have to bear during his lifetime.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I have made the point clear.  It is that a house built in 1914 bears a valuation of £7; the same sized house now would bear a valuation of £11.  The house constructed in 1914 gets the benefit of the Small Dwellings Act.  Houses valued at £8 and under were allowed off something like 33? per cent. of the municipal rate. In essence it comes to this, that some of the smaller houses which were built by the Corporation during the last twenty years paid in rates something like 1s. per week.  Houses built within the last four or five years, valued at £11, when the rates were 21s. in the £1, paid almost 5s. a week.  Just weigh in your mind what the respective liability is that has to be borne by two citizens, one of whom has the misfortune to be ten years younger than the other, and it is the young man I am speaking of now.  He must pay five times what the other pays.  I do not mean to say that it is a fair parallel. I would say that a parallel of 1 in 3 would be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are taking that into account in this Bill.  The house which now costs £500 could have been built in pre-war for something like £200.  We are not able to pay a larger subsidy than £100, <Col N="1034" /> but we are looking around to see who is.  I do not like to put on the Deputy's constituents, or on his particular section of the community, valuable as it is to the State, any undue burden, and I am restricting to the Urban Districts in which these houses will be erected, an ordinary small share of the liability of the cost of erection.  In essence it will not be a liability at all, because if it were not for the State subsidy they would not get the 5 per cent, and some of these people might be lodging in houses and might not be paying any rates whatever.  The local authority will benefit by such men and the families of such men.</P>

      <P>I recognise the case that the President has made, but I would prefer if the difficulty were met in some other form without establishing this precedent.  I do not know that it is a very wholesome precedent.  It leaves the door open to people who may find themselves aggrieved with regard to their financial position.  The case made by the President is that the occupants of these houses will be put financially in a worse position than the people about them.  They can make a case, and a case can also be made for most other people who pay rates.  I do not think that it is sound local finance, and I would like to see the difficulty met in some other way.  It will lay the foundation of many local agitations, and of cases being put up by people who consider themselves aggrieved.  I am in sympathy with the position the President has put forward, but I think it will lead on to unhealthy ground.  I do not like it, and I think the President will admit that it establishes a precedent that is not desirable.</P>

      <P>If the proposal were that for twenty years no rates would be paid, I would say yes.  It is, however, a gradually increasing burden.  The man who gets a house of this sort, if he has to borrow money, pays at a high percentage, something like 6 per cent., and an effort ought to be made to relieve him as much as possible so that he can reduce the amount.  The idea is that in one or two years the house he will occupy, as soon as it is built, will <Col N="1035" /> be coming down in value, because we hope and expect that the cost of house building will come down.  If he built for £400, in one or two years' time the value will be about £20 less.  What, then, is his compensation, or how can you compensate him unless by some gradual process like this, which enables him to see that even though the article he has purchased at a given time is deteriorating in value, nevertheless he has another advantage which will come by way of compensation to him?</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may at any time if he thinks fit, order a local inquiry into the cost (including the wholesale and retail prices, the transport, handling and overhead charges, and the margin of profit) in any county, county borough, town, district or other area of any materials or appliances used in the building of houses, and if he is satisfied, after the holding of such local inquiry, that the cost of such materials or appliances in that area is excessive and restrictive of output of building work, the Minister may by Order prescribe the maximum amount of the wholesale price or of the retail price which may be charged for such materials or appliances in that area or the maximum amount of profit and of transport, handling and overhead charges which may be included in the wholesale or the retail price charged for such materials or appliances in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose amendment 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 8 a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister is satisfied, by local inquiry or otherwise, that the erection of any buildings within any borough or urban or rural district is, or is likely to be, unreasonably impeded in consequence of any byelaws with respect to new streets or buildings in force therein, the Minister may require the local authority to revoke such byelaws or to make such new byelaws as he may consider necessary for the removal of the impediment. If the local authority do not within three months after such requisition comply therewith, the Minister may himself revoke such byelaws and make such new byelaws as he may consider necessary for the removal of the impediment, and such new byelaws shall have effect as if they had been duly made by the local authority and confirmed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the atmosphere that is being created, unintentionally, I am sure, by Deputies O'Mahony and Hogan, against any interference by the Dáil with any of the rights exercised <Col N="1037" /> by the local authorities, I have some hesitation in proposing the amendment that I have put down.  It is a new Section, and the object of the Section is, that in the event of any of the bye-laws requiring revision, that that should be possible.  Many of the existing bye-laws of some of our local authorities are antiquated, and some of them, at least, require revision.  These local authorities, seeing that these bye-laws have been in existence for a great many years, may be unwilling to alter them. Then the Minister would have the right, in order to get facilities for the erection of houses, to ask the local authority to alter the bye-law, and, in the event of the failure of the local authority, to take steps to have the bye-law altered so that housing facilities would be provided. It is only a power that will be exercised.  I am sure, in very few cases.</P>
    <P>But a little inquiry into the matter will show that it is a power that is absolutely necessary.  The Deputies will remember that, on yesterday, we had under discussion a very important question, the question of the time to be allotted for the erection of these houses; and some of us who have had practical experience in connection both with working local authorities, and also with the erection of houses, are quite satisfied that the time put forward in the Bill was wholly inadequate.  Twelve months was put forward as the time for the operation of the advantages under this Act.  After a great deal of pressure we succeeded in getting the President to go as far as extending that clause to eighteen months.  But he was adamant against going any further. I am quite satisfied, from my experience of this particular matter, that it will require all the co-operation that can be exercised between the local authority and those who build houses to get the houses erected within the stipulated time.  It is obvious, therefore, that if variations were necessary in some of the old and antiquated bye-laws of some of those local authorities, alteration should be made immediately; otherwise if there was any delay it would be impossible to have the houses erected within the time required by the Act, and, therefore, it would put that local authority outside the Act.  This clause is brought in with that intention. <Col N="1038" /> May I say, further, that it is taken word for word from the clause that is at the moment in operation in the new Housing Bill recently introduced at the other side, where they have just the same difficulty to deal with as we have here.  The bye-laws are not up to date. Building construction, and building materials suitable for the erection of houses, have altered very materially since many of those bye-laws were drawn up.  Consequently to erect those houses with modern materials would be contrary to the terms of the bye-laws in many cases.  I hope I have made it clear that this Section will only come into operation when absolutely necessary, and will not be, therefore, to the disadvantage of the local authority. I, therefore, move that this clause be added.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good asked me to support him.  I am afraid it is a case where friends fall out, or where thieves fall out, but I rise to oppose this amendment.  I oppose it on the same grounds as before.  I think Deputy Good makes a good case.  He turns this into supporting the local authority, but I do not agree.  It is putting in &ldquo;shall&rdquo; too often, making it compulsory on the local authority to do certain things, within a certain time, and if they do not do them the Government will step in and throw them out. Now, the local authorities are elected by the democracy; at all events, they are elected by constituencies which send representatives to the local authority, and all the pressure that is necessary on this housing question will be as acute in one local authority as in another.  But I think it would be a healthy state if the different local authorities were competing with one another to see who would build the most houses.  If the bye-laws of the local authorities are obsolete, then the sooner they start to work to amend those bye-laws the better.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the deletion of Section 8.  I have already drawn attention to Section 8 of this Bill.  It is, to my mind, a most drastic and far-reaching Section, and it establishes a most dangerous precedent.  I do not know whether the Deputies have read this Section.  I will not take up the time of the Dáil in reading it in detail.  But what it means is that the Minister may at any time, if he thinks fit, have a local inquiry made into the prices charged for any material necessary for the erection of houses. Furthermore, as the result of that inquiry, he may fix the selling price of these materials for the future, under a penalty of something like £100 for each breach of the decision arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that this is a most drastic and far-reaching clause.  I am not aware that such a clause has appeared in any Act before, either in this or the sister country.  This drastic section is not confined to the time during which the Bill will operate&mdash;in other words the operation of the Bill, as regards the assistance it gives to houses, is confined to houses erected in 18 months, whereas this particular clause is not so confined.  It goes on after the Act and the provisions of the Act have passed away.  What strikes one about this is, first of all, what does it hope to accomplish?  As I said before here, there has been no evidence of any kind of profiteering in connection with building materials, in this country.  I challenge anybody to give me evidence on that particular point.  Possibly, before <Col N="1040" /> we are done with this Bill we will know where the profiteering is in the building industry and who are the profiteers. But suffice it at the moment to say&mdash;and I have some knowledge of the subject&mdash;that there is no profiteering in connection with building materials. Having had a considerable knowledge of the trade, both in this country and in the adjoining island, I have yet to get any evidence of profiteering.  When no such evidence has been forthcoming, I cannot understand the reason for such a drastic clause.  On the other side they appointed a committee some years ago for keeping in touch with the prices of building materials.  That committee meets frequently, reports on any variation in the prices and the reasons for the variation.  That committee, with all the powers at its disposal, has not been able to bring forward, as far as I have been aware&mdash; and I have been in touch with its decisions&mdash;any evidence of profiteering in the building industry.  Nevertheless it keeps the department in touch with variations in the prices of building material and the reasons for such variations, which is of advantage to the department.  If the Government had set up such a committee, one would not have taken any exception to it, but to take the drastic step that it has, without any evidence of profiteering, is exceedingly unwise.  I say so because I am quite satisfied that the clause will do no good, but will do an infinite amount of harm.  Capital is exceedingly shy; men will not invest a large amount of capital in any industry when the Government can walk in at any moment, hold an inquiry, and fix a selling price for the output of that particular industry.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I was approached in the hall of the Dáil and asked if I would use my influence towards establishing a cement industry in Skerries.  I was possibly one of the first to draw attention to the necessity for establishing such an industry in Ireland.  Cement is a product that ought to be easily and economically manufactured in Ireland. Before a Commission which sat on the other side to deal with building supplies I drew attention to that fact, and gave some figures in connection with <Col N="1041" /> it.  That was several years ago.  Since then nothing has been done, but an English company is anxious&mdash;it has so expressed itself&mdash;as soon as conditions are favourable, to start a factory in Skerries, which is considered a suitable place.  What would be the effect of this proposal on those people?  The Government take powers in this clause as soon as that factory is erected&mdash;and it will cost between £200,000 and £250,000&mdash; to step in and fix a selling price for its product.  What will the effect of that be on the industry?  I am sorry to say that people on the other side do not look with favour on this country of ours as a suitable place for investing capital.  These people were prepared to take the risk, and how will they view this clause?  If you or I were advising them, what would our advice be?  I am afraid that in that particular instance it would do a serious injury to the country.</P>
    <P>Let us look at it from another point of view.  The Government is establishing a precedent in this.  In the absence of proof of profiteering, they have thought it wise to bring in such a clause.  Having once done so, there is no reason why they should not extend this to other industries.  We were all proud of the fact that three tobacco factories have been established here, and are expending some hundreds of thousands of pounds at the moment. If such a clause were to operate in connection with that industry, does anybody think for a moment that that money would have been spent?  I know something about capital; I know the minds of those who have capital; I am quite satisfied that if there was any fear of such a clause, in no circumstances would they have invested the money that they have invested.  All this will do will be to frighten capital out of the Free State across the border, where it can supply the requirements of the Free State and be free from such a burden as this.  I ask those who are responsible for the Government of this country: is that a state of affairs that they desire to promote, or that they ought to support?  I think if they consider the matter, in view of what I have said, they will come to the conclusion that the clause is exceedingly <Col N="1042" /> unwise and undesirable.  I have no hesitation whatever in moving, for the good of this country of ours, that this clause be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that he is going to be consistent, and, as a result of consistency, that, I think, will be the natural attitude he will adopt. Deputy Good has raised objection to the inclusion of this clause, mainly because of the adverse effect it would have upon the building providing trade, but he has visualised this evil effect as if the provision the Government is making in this Bill was a provision that was to be applied generally to industrial products in the country, and not, as is actually the case, the conserving of their powers only with respect to such interests as are concerned, and to such an extent as they are concerned, in relation to the new housing proposals. These, as we all know, in relation to the general business of the firms concerned, are a negligible factor.  He suggests that it may be laid down as a precedent, and he cites a particular case in which a cement industry may be established in Skerries under the auspices of English industrialists.  The Deputy knows just as well, or better, than I do what has been the effect of English association with that particular industry in Ireland.  He knows that that association has with respect to the few cement industries that were established in this country had the effect of wiping them out of existence, and I feel that in this particular case, too, realising that sooner or later a cement industry must be established and developed in Ireland, at any rate to the extent of our own requirements, that they are going to take time by the forelock, and secure control of that industry in favour of British interests, and to sell the article not in relation to its value as determined by the cost of <Col N="1043" /> production in Ireland, but in relation to the amount they can impose on the country that ceases to produce for itself, and is dependent on outside firms to provide material factors of this kind for the purpose of national development. I fear the Deputy was not wise when in consultation with our friends across the Channel he gave them a complete analysis of the position in Ireland. It is not always wise to go to the outsider with information that pertains to national development in this country, because I need hardly suggest that the natural utilisation of that information on the part of people whose sympathies are less Irish than British will always be developed in favour of that interest which stands first with them.  Deputy Good, and Deputy Hewat also, have on different occasions complained of the high rate of wage paid to the worker, and the relatively small output for the wage paid to him, and we have claimed that the Government ought to take cognisance of that.  We have claimed that the worker has been a sinner in that respect, and that he should do penance for his sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>And I say that if that is our attitude towards Labour, and if we demand that an inquiry should be made with regard to the high wage and low output, if we are consistent we should also demand that in connection with the materials required for the building trade inquiry should also be made, where the circumstances warrant, as to the prices charged for these materials.  We may rely on it that the Minister will take no action except in cases where he is in possession of a statement that warrants him doing so.  Therefore, there is no hardship, because before the Minister will act a case will have to be presented to him by people competent to do so, showing that there is an abuse in the trade rates that these people are charging.  I have no fear of this establishing a precedent, or that it is going to keep away industrial ventures. This Section is only intended to apply and operate in cases in which it is shown that the trading is not conducted on the basis of legitimate trading, <Col N="1044" /> that the trader is not satisfied with a legitimate profit in connection with the business.  This Section can have effect only in those cases in which it is conclusively proved that that trading is detrimental to the general interests of the country, and when trading is detrimental to the general interests the Government would be failing in its duty if it did not see that the prices are regulated in accordance with the requirements of the country, giving to the trader a legitimate and proper profit on the transactions.</P>

      <P>We all know what the expression &ldquo;building of houses&rdquo; means.  It only refers to houses constructed under the provisions of the Act, and we have no power to go beyond that.  I take it that in the circumscribed circumstances in which this Section will be applied, and bearing in mind also the necessity there is that these houses should be constructed as economically as possible, the Section is one that ought to stand.  No case has been made against the Section, except that it may favour trusts, and the Dáil is not going to support, as against public policy, the sustenance of trusts.</P>

      <P>It is a real treat sometimes to attend this Dáil, because you will be convinced, I think, gradually that we are becoming an Island of Saints.  Some time ago when Deputy Milroy was speaking it was the manufacturers who were the competitors for the halo.  To-day, when Deputy <Col N="1045" /> Good was speaking, it was the building trade.  There is no evidence of profiteering in the building trade, according to Deputy Good.  There is certainly a very strong feeling amongst the ordinary public that there is profiteering. There is a principle to which, I think, Deputy Good gave his assent some weeks ago&mdash;the distinction between legal proof and common knowledge.  I wonder would he accept that to a certain extent in connection with the building trade?  Personally, I have had the good luck not to suffer much at their hands.  Some time ago, however, thinking that the consumption of coal in the house was a little too much, and sorry that I could only give Deputy Good's friends an opportunity for philanthropic work by interfering a little with the equally philanthropic work of Deputy Hewat's friends, I went to see whether the grates could not be looked after.  I went to one of the big contracting firms in the city. They sent out a man.</P>

      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  Personally, I am not able to settle the figures I got, and I will leave them to Deputy Good and Deputy Johnson to dispute between them.  The firm sent out a man, who spent an hour taking some measurements. A couple of days afterwards a mason and his attendant turned up, and spent the best portion of a working day settling the grates.  Then came the bill.  They charged for every item, naturally; mortar, bricks and everything else.  The only item I am interested in at the moment is this: &ldquo;For one day, mason's and labourer's time, repairing grate and furnace range, £2 17s.&rdquo;  It is a pleasure to me to know that masons and labourers in Dublin are paid as much as that.  I waited, I will confess, until the collector came.  There are reasons, unfortunately, at this period of the year.  I cannot go into them, but I did wait until the collector came.  I protested against the charge, and incidentally dropped a hint that in this Dáil I had heard a discussion between Deputy Good and Deputy Johnson about the <Col N="1046" /> charges in the building trade.  I suggested that I doubted if a large portion even of this £2 17s. went to the mason and his assistant.  The collector asked if I required a reduction.  I said not, that I would pay the bill then, but I asked him to send me an itemised receipt. The receipt came, not in the form that I first got the bill, but with an interesting amendment:&mdash;&ldquo;Foreman's time measuring, 12/-; mason's and labourer's time, £2 5s.&rdquo;  Even at that, I was glad to see that there were such high wages given to the masons and labourers in Dublin, because there is a chance of their purchasing these houses if they get a fair portion of what I was charged for one day's work.</P>

      <P>On this occasion, I rise to support my friend, Deputy Good. The Section is objectionable.  One asks, why is it there at all.  The answer that I give is &ldquo;eyewash.&rdquo;  It brings in the principle of Government interference in connection with trade, which is generally recognised as being of no advantage to trade or anybody else, but distinctly disadvantageous to everybody.  It introduces at principle, which if once adopted, one would find it very hard to know where it is going to end.  If it is logical to put it into this Bill, it is equally logical to put it into force in every business transaction. The basis of the Section, I think, is the cry of the man in the street as to the cost of living.  That has been largely fomented by the fact that when the time came for a reduction in wages, the labour leaders raised, I would not like to say a parrot cry, but, at all events, a cry that was not genuine, and put it forward as a reason why uneconomic wages should be paid in connection with all industries.  I would like the Dáil to consider what is the position in business.  On the one side, the business man has to buy, and on the other, he has to sell.  There is very little difference in the importance of both these operations.  In every business, whether that of manufacturing, banking, or stock-broking, the state of the profit and loss account will be largely a matter of good buying or good selling. <Col N="1047" /> Does the Minister who introduced this Bill imagine that he is going to regulate prices?  If he does, he never made a greater mistake in his life.  He has no more power to regulate the price of articles than I have to stop the tide coming in.  Supposing you regulate the price of any article, and say that a certain profit is to attach to it and a certain cost of production, the seller of that article is going to make the maximum price his minimum price, and if he has got a fair margin of profit, he is going to have a good time of it, because the incentive to increase his business, or otherwise, will be gone.  This takes away the personal initiative altogether, and leaves the trade stagnant.  That is the effect of Government interference in the control of any industry.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has given us an amusing instance of his personal experience in connection with a grate.</P>

But are they?  I think not. In business and in dealing with the public I do not think you come across so many &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; as the man in the street would have you believe.  I do not think that a man's business is going to prosper in any way, whether in Dublin or anywhere else, by charging more than the value of the article he is supplying.  I do not think such a man is going to be long doing a very prosperous business.</P>

      <P>In exactly the same way Deputy O'Sullivan gives part of the case.  Might we hear the other side of the case?  Probably the man on the <Col N="1048" /> other side, the seller in this case, could put a very different complexion on the transaction as between himself and Deputy O'Sullivan.  I do not know.  At all events, are you going to put a Section in a Bill like this, so enormously far-reaching, on the assumption that Deputy O'Sullivan and his like, are such a lot of &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; that they are going to submit to be overcharged for every article they buy?  If you are going to legislate for &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; I am afraid you are going to have a busy time of it.  Some Deputy on the opposite side said &ldquo;rings.&rdquo;&ldquo;Rings,&rdquo; as a matter of fact, very often reduce prices.  &ldquo;Rings&rdquo; do not occur, and will not occur&mdash;in the ordinary way. They will occur under certain conditions. These &ldquo;rings&rdquo; are always liable to competition, and competition is the only way in which you will satisfactorily regulate prices in any trade. I object to this Section in the Bill mainly on principle.  I say that the whole basis of business is that both buyer and seller are very well able to take care of themselves, and that this namby-pamby Government interference in trade matters is good neither for the individual nor the community as a whole.  Deputy O'Mahony went into some matters&mdash;Irish affairs&mdash;and it seemed as if his principal aim and object was to keep foreign capital out of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite a helpful clause for that.  It does not do much in the building-up line.  I think the more commonsense view would be to encourage as much capital as possible to come into the country.  It is then under your own control, or under the control of the State.  Make your own regulations, but do not make this sort of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat says: &ldquo;Encourage foreign capital to come into the country, and then it is under your own control.&rdquo;  Apparently he desires that it should be under the control of the State.  I ask him does he desire that foreign capital, having come into the country, should be regulated in its activities by the State? <Col N="1049" /> This Section, as far as I can read and understand it, just purports and intends to do that very thing, and also to control and regulate the not less omnivorous parasites that are homebred. One is amused to hear Deputy Hewat occasionally expounding the economics of the early nineteenth century, and proclaiming the gospel of free competition; the inability to regulate prices, and saying that you might as well try to keep back the tide as to regulate prices.  He then tells us, in almost the next breath, that trusts and &ldquo;rings&rdquo; do not always raise prices.  They sometimes lower prices. The fact remains that they fix prices higher or lower, and if that is not regulating prices, doing what it is alleged one cannot do, my reading is very faulty, and my understanding of the movements of trade and commerce as well as the official declarations of public companies, is at sea.  Deputy Hewat might be aware of the existence of combinations which quite effectively rule out competition, which he says will always regulate prices, if trusts or &ldquo;rings&rdquo; endeavour to overcharge.  He is very innocent.  Perhaps he will remember the experience of the tobacco manufacturers in Ireland and England, and the very great fight they had to try to be independent.  Perhaps he will remember the experiences of some of the shipping companies who gobbled up competitive lines, made &ldquo;rings,&rdquo; raised prices, and then covered over their faults by enlarging the nominal capital, and saying they are only paying a moderate dividend. Perhaps Deputy Good would remind Deputy Hewat of the existence of, say the Light Castings Association, or the Cement Combine.  Perhaps in his reply or further contribution to this discussion the Deputy will tell the Dáil what he knows about the Light Castings Association, the Cement Combine, and any other of the combines in the building materials trade.  Deputy Hewat says you cannot fix prices.  There exists a combination of Portland cement manufacturers, formed in 1900 as a union of thirty undertakings, the purchase consideration being £6,335,000.  It extended its power in 1912 by merging thirty-three other <Col N="1050" /> firms.  One of its declared objects is to control prices in the home market, which is divided into specified areas, each with a committee of manufacturers appointed by the Federation. Perhaps Deputy Good knows something about it.  These committees are empowered to make increases in the prices ruling in their respective areas, and any such increases are binding in all the areas upon all the members of the Federation.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the distributing trades rebates are granted, the maximum allowance being made to those merchants who bind themselves, to buy only from members of the Federation and to sell to the consumer at not less than the scheduled price, and conform to all the other terms as to discount, packages, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course that is not peculiar to the associated cement manufacturers.  You might ask Messrs. Cleeve if they knew anything about combinations in the condensed milk trade, and the way prices were regulated in that business ultimately to the detriment of Messrs. Cleeve.  In very nearly all the big trades there are combinations, more or less effective, but for Deputy Hewat to say that anybody can come into competition is, I say, childish, because we know what the effect of the competition of the small manufacturer is against a big consolidated capital of these trusts and combines.  We know how the small competitor is met when he tries effectively to meet the competition of the combine.  It is a matter of common experience.  For Deputy Hewat to say that you cannot control prices, when it is done every day in the week and every month in the year, is, as I say, childish, and is asking us to believe that which we know is not accurate.  Of course it is true, I will admit at once, that with the development of modern industries, trusts are able to make more than the average profit by saving in expenses by a more efficient organisation, and by improved methods of production.  I quite agree that it requires big organisation to do it.  I am not objecting to the big organisation, <Col N="1051" /> but I am objecting to the way the big organisation is too often used.  Sometimes it is said that the development of the trust is the necessary preliminary to taking over the trust in the common interest.  I do not know whether Deputy Hewat would subscribe to that as the inevitable course of industrial development or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Now it is quite clear to anybody who will follow the proceedings that the organisation in the building trades in Ireland is very defective indeed, so far as efficient output and service are concerned, but there is some kind of a general lackadaisical feeling amongst those engaged in the trade that if by going easy they could make as heavy a profit as by going hard, well, then, they might as well go easy.  Of course it is not quite true to say that the firms in the building trade are having such hard times as has been suggested.  I cannot give all the details of the financial position of all the companies, and I cannot tell you how they manipulate their shares, and how they grant bonuses to reduce the apparent rate of profit, and make bonuses in the form of new shares, but I have some figures which may not be exhaustive, I do not think they are, but they indicate that the building trade providers were not in such a very bad condition during the last two or three years of very bad trade in the building industry.  I find, for instance, from the official returns supplied by the companies themselves that for the four years ending 1916 the amount distributed in the shape of dividends in ordinary shares of Messrs. Brooks, Thomas and Co., averaged £3,000 a year, while the average, distributed in the four years ending 1922, was £5,100. That is to say, there was an average increase of from £3,000 to £5,100 at a time when the building trade was supposed to be out of action.  When it is <Col N="1052" /> retorted, as it probably will be, that the rate of increase is not as great as the rate of increase in the rate of wages, I agree, and, of course, here we come across the fundamental opposition that there is a very different tale to tell when you are dealing with payment for work done, payment for personal service, and payment for allowing money to lie in a particular concern.</P>
      <P>If it is contended that the rate of profit must always increase concurrently with any increase in the rate of wages, I dissent.  The figures I have quoted in regard to Messrs. Brooks, Thomas &amp; Co. certainly show that during those bad years the amount of money distributed as dividends upon the ordinary shares has increased on an average from £3,000 per year to £5,100 per year, while the rate of preference shares of course remains stable.</P>

      <P>I have another illustration of a firm in the same business where for the four years ending 1917, the amount distributed as dividend on ordinary shares averaged £3,500, and for the four years ending 1921 that average increased to £8,900. That again shows that people in that trade, at any rate, did fairly well notwithstanding the slump in the industry. The case that Deputy Hewat makes is particularly interesting, coming from a man who sat on the Profiteering Committee, the inquiry into the cost of living in the city of Dublin and country.</P>

      <P>Surely one would not agree to make inquiries into the profits <Col N="1053" /> of private distributors of food-stuffs, and be afraid to make inquiries into the profits of the manufacturers, and builders' providers in the building trade.  I suggest that having entered into one inquiry, and having learned some lesson as to how that inquiry ought to have been conducted, the lesson should be taken to heart, and applied in the case of the building industry.</P>
      <P>I think that the Section under discussion is probably the most valuable in the Bill.  I hope it will be amended before it passes from the Dáil so that the inquiries will not be merely confined to local inquiries, such as are suggested in the Section itself, but that they may be enlarged to cover not only local prices, but prices over the country as a whole.  Deputy O'Mahony desired to know whether I would likely be consistent and object to the interference by the State authority in the activities of those engaged in the building trade.  I tell Deputy O'Mahony that if he will support me in advocating that the local authorities should have power to enter into the building industry, to provide building material, and if he will say that the building material providers are to be elected publicly, as the local authorities are elected, and that they will be responsible to the public for the conduct of their affairs, then I will object to undue interference by the central authority.  Considering that builders' providers and manufacturers of building materials are not prepared to enter into any understanding regarding the public services, but are only prepared to enter into it with a view to private profit, and while they are doing that, and while there is every evidence that they will persist in taking advantage of the public need for their own aggrandisement, then I say that a public check upon that aggrandisement, such as provided in the Bill, should be retained and carried into immediate effect.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the evidence and the documents laid before the Committee on Wireless Broadcasting be printed and circulated.&rdquo;  In moving this motion, I shall not intrude very long on the patience of the Dáil, and I shall try to make the two arguments I put before them as free from controversy as possible.  I have put down this motion for two reasons, first, as a general principle that when a matter is referred to a Committee of the Dáil every member of the Dáil retains a certain right to know what is being done on that Committee, and that is especially the case when a Committee takes evidence.  We have, every one of us here, our responsibility&mdash;responsibility to our constituencies; responsibility to our own selves&mdash;and by placing a matter on the shoulders of a Committee we cannot completely divest ourselves of that responsibility.  Before we are asked to confirm finally the result of any Committee it is our duty, so far as we can, to weigh the eviddence that that Committee has received and to come to our own conclusions on it.  As for the general question I should prefer to know&mdash;I am very ignorant of this subject of broadcasting&mdash;what the Committee had before it before it framed what I think is an admirable and most satisfactory report, satisfactory in that it exonerates the Postmaster-General from all blame, and satisfactory in its conclusions.  Still I would like to see what they have had before them, and I should like to see <Col N="1055" /> things for myself.  So much for the general principle.</P>
      <P>The second is, as everybody knows, and as we know ourselves, from the Interim Report and the discussion on it in connection with this particular matter of wireless broadcasting, that there have been abundant rumours spread about, affecting the credit of Deputies in this Dáil.  This is the first case of the kind that has come up before the Dáil.  It is a case in which we are charged with a very heavy responsibility, because the action we are taking now sets a precedent for future cases. It may be, I hope it will not be, the case that charges of this kind&mdash;charges of graft, corruption, jobbery&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;will become commonplace in our politics, as fifteen or twenty years ago they were commonplace in Canadian politics.  I have been reading the life of Sir Wilfred Laurier, and was disgusted to see that politics in Canada at the beginning of the century was a question of which party would bring home the largest number of scandals to its opponents.  I hope in this we shall not follow the Canadian precedent, and that is why I wish for the publication of this evidence, to clear the good name of this Dáil.  If it is believed that we are hushing matters up, and are parties to suppression, then our reputation will suffer in the face of the public.</P>
      <P>I am very jealous for the honour of this assembly.  I have been received here with kindness and consideration, for which I can never be sufficiently grateful, and so far as it is in me to try and vindicate the honour of this assembly, I shall do it.  I do not act from any partisan motive.  I have absolutely no political axe to grind in this matter, but I believe it would be bad for the Dáil, and for public life in Ireland, if there remained the slightest suspicion in the mind of the general public at large that we were trying to hush up anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree most heartily with the sentiments which Deputy Bryan Cooper expressed as to the necessity <Col N="1056" /> for preventing, if possible, the occasion, the excuse and the practice that he referred to as having prevailed in Canada, in the early part of the present century.  I agree with the principle that evidence and documents that have been laid before a Committee of the Dáil, making enquiry into any public matter, should be made known to the Dáil and to the public.  There is no harm in saying that when the matter was raised in the Committee regarding the public reporting of the proceedings at a date very late in these proceedings, I was one of the minority that agreed that the Press should be admitted.  I did that because I feared the possibility that, under the present Standing Orders, if we refused to allow the Press in, when they made application, to the proceedings of the Committee, it might be taken as a precedent. But I recognise quite well that the majority had much reason upon their side.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that the Standing Orders on which we have been working did not contemplate an enquiry of the kind which the Committee on Broadcasting has been dealing with.  That Committee's work began quite as a departmental inquiry.  It was not opened with the idea of taking evidence so much as to examine documents and consult experts, and it was only by virtue of circumstances which arose unexpectedly that the demand for publicity arose.  And it arose at a time much too late for the purpose such as Deputy Cooper would like to have been assured on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion, as it stands, asks that the evidence and the documents laid before the Committee on Wireless Broadcasting be printed and circulated. I am just doubtful, notwithstanding my desire for the fullest publicity, whether the acceptance of this motion, in this form, at present, would do justice to people concerned, whether the Committee or the Dáil or the members and non-members referred to in the evidence. The documents quoted here were very extensive.  They were not selected documents.  There were files of papers put in dealing with matters quite apart from Broadcasting, and by no means selected for the purpose of <Col N="1057" /> evidence appertaining to the enquiry. They were put in by the Postmaster-General himself and others, a complete file of all their correspondence, some dealing with matter quite extraneous to broadcasting, and those were put before the Committee.</P>
    <P>I question whether it is just and reasonable that all these documents should be printed, even on the ground of expense, and also on the ground that much of the matter is not germane to the subject under review.  So far for that point.</P>
    <P>Now as to the evidence.  Matters have developed which, I think, require that the evidence relating to broadcasting and relating to extraneous subjects, if such evidence is to be submitted to the public, ought to be submitted in such a manner as would be fair to the persons concerned.  As one of those probably chiefly at fault, I admit that the form of the questions put to the witnesses was, in many cases, probably unfair to the witnesses who may have been led to say things which they would not have been allowed to say if the evidence had been taken in public court before one versed in legal procedure. It is possible that the members of the Committee, including myself, may have formed judgments, and having formed judgments, put questions in a manner which really were innuendoes and charges, and in such a case I doubt whether it is fair of the Dáil to publish all the evidence in the form in which it has been taken.  Witnesses came to the enquiry and said many things that they probably would not have said had they been examined in public, and possibly they would have been less truthful; but, at any rate, witnesses have a right to know the conditions under which they are giving their evidence, and they did give their evidence on the assumption that it was not a public inquiry.  So far I think there is something to be said in favour of not publishing the evidence, but I desire that all the facts germane to the discussion on wireless and on the discussion of other matters quite extraneous to wireless should be made known to the public.</P>
    <P>In the Report which was issued by the Committee, and which will be the <Col N="1058" /> subject of further discussion, there is a reference to a memorandum furnished to the Committee by the Postmaster-General. This memorandum had nothing whatever to do with broadcasting. It was placed in the file supplied by the Postmaster-General, at the request of the Committee that all the documents should be handed in to the Committee.  The memorandum in question had reference to the relations between the chief promoter&mdash;one might say the sole person concerned in an effective way with one of the companies referred to in the Postmaster-General's White Paper.  The memorandum put in by the Postmaster-General purported to be a record of the relations between Mr. Andrew Belton, of Irish Developments, Ltd., and Deputy Darrell Figgis, long before the latter was a Deputy, presumably with the object of showing the relative virtues of the two persons concerned.  The reading of that memorandum disclosed the motive underlying Mr. Belton when he entered into certain associations of a business character with Deputy Figgis, who was then Mr. Darrell Figgis; and it was solely because of the fact that the memorandum disclosed the motive of this gentleman that Mr. Belton was called to give evidence to the Committee, and on that evidence, written by his own hand and supplied by his own words, I had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the company with which he was associated as the leading spokesman ought not to receive a concession from any Department of State.  Arising out of that, Mr. Belton handed in his file of correspondence which affected matters long anterior to the project of an Irish Broadcasting Station or an Irish Broadcasting Company. Deputy Figgis also handed in his file dealing with contemporaneous matters.  The point of these statements of mine is this: That wireless broadcasting and matters connected therewith form the subject of a distinct inquiry from matters relating to the association of Mr. Belton and Deputy Figgis and other persons in projects of an industrial and financial kind.  These documents, for instance, deal with matters long anterior to broadcasting: to projects which it was sought to obtain the support <Col N="1059" /> or assistance in one form or other of the Government of the time; projects, for instance, regarding the flotation of public loans; and projects, for instance, with regard to the establishment of a Casino to replace some of the Continental resorts of the aristocracy of England, and to which the Government were invited to become participants. These are matters that are extraneous entirely to broadcasting, and ought not to be mixed up with an inquiry into broadcasting such as has devolved upon the Committee which the Dáil set up.  These matters, therefore, while throwing light upon the qualifications, shall I say, of the promoter of the Irish Broadcasting Company, which was to receive a concession and which only came indirectly within the purview of our Committee, have opened new doors leading into different quarters, and which, I think, require a different kind of enquiry.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that the evidence relating to broadcasting should be followed up by the Committee on Broadcasting after this, if the interim report is adopted, and should be published in due course.  All the matters connected with these extraneous subjects should be made the occasion of an entirely new inquiry.  There should, in fact, be set up by the Dáil a smaller Committee composed of people who have not prejudged any question, and the evidence that is to come before that Committee should be given in a strictly legal form, and all those persons who have been named by the various witnesses, and in the documents, should have liberty to appear either personally or be represented by solicitors or counsel.  The fullest inquiry should be made, and all the parties concerned should have access to all the documents; then the matters which are of public importance will certainly and necessarily be brought out in a proper form, and every question that could possibly be raised will be raised in a public inquiry, conducted in strict conformity with the rules of evidence.  I believe that would be the fairest course to adopt, fair to those who may be implicated, and it will do more credit to the Dáil and be more satisfactory to the public.</P>
    <P>If, after the whole matter is disposed <Col N="1060" /> of, having been dealt with in such a manner as I have suggested, it is still thought desirable that all the past evidence, in the form in which it has been taken, should be made public, then I, for one, would have no objection whatever. I think, in fairness to all parties, in fairness to the public, and with the utmost desire to have every fact dealing with public affairs placed before the public, all those who may consider themselves interested or involved, or upon whom any reflection of any kind has been placed, should have a right to appear before a quasi-official inquiry, which will conduct the case in a much more formal, and probably much more effective, manner than an amateur Committee dealing informally with matters which were really extraneous to the immediate purposes of the Wireless Broadcasting Committee.  I would, therefore, suggest to Deputy Cooper that a course such as I have suggested would promote his purpose much more effectively than the mere printing of the evidence and the documents laid before the Committee.  Such a Committee as I have suggested would have fuller powers and be able to do the work more efficiently, while the present Committee can, if it is considered necessary by the Dáil, proceed with its work of inquiring into wireless broadcasting.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's statement fills us with admiration for his generosity.  As a member of this Committee to inquire into the White Paper Report on wireless broadcasting, I have found myself continuously, more especially at every important point of the inquiry, in the completest harmony with Deputy Johnson. I regret to find that on this particular motion I am obliged, very much against my will, to part company from him.  I support Deputy Cooper's motion with one slight reservation.  I quite appreciate what Deputy Johnson has urged.  The inquiry was initiated by the members of the Committee as a Departmental inquiry.  It was not thought in the beginning that it would be necessary to call witnesses, and so the question as to the advisability or otherwise of publicity throughout all the stages of the investigation did not strike the mind of every member.  It <Col N="1061" /> was only at the stage of the twelvth day of the inquiry, when certain rumours had gone abroad and had been intensified by reference to them in the daily newspapers, that the claim of the Press to be present at our investigations was made.</P>
      <P>It is, no doubt, true that those who came there and gave evidence, gave it very freely under the obvious impression that what they said was more or less <i>in camera.</i>  They knew, of course, that the Official Reporters of the Dáil were making a record of what they said, and of the documents that they handed in.  But I think we might, without exaggeration, declare that they felt these notes were taken rather for the subsequent information and convenience of the members of the Committee, than for ultimate publication. It may, therefore, not be altogether fair to a witness who gave his testimony freely and without reserve&mdash; without reticence, in fact, as was the case with regard to some of the witnesses&mdash;and it might not be altogether equitable without the witness's permission or consent, to order the publication of the evidence precisely as it now stands in the records of the Official Reporters.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I would urge that this is one of the accidents of life. The Committee was set up, the Committee proceeded on its inquiry, and documents came under its notice which forced it to extend the scope of the inquiry.  Now, what with all respect to Deputy Johnson, I would bring before his notice just at the present moment is, that we were not inquiring into wireless broadcasting absolutely, but into wireless broadcasting relatively as affected by the White Paper of the Postmaster-General.  A portion of the report which it was our mission to bring in should be therefore a report giving our considered judgment with regard to the policy set out or proposed for the Dáil in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now a very essential part of that policy was the handing over, by way of a State concession, of the working of wireless to a company set up ostensibly on the model of the British Broadcasting Company, and when, by virtue <Col N="1062" /> of the revelations made in a document found in the Departmental file, we found that the chief agent in the promotion of this Irish Broadcasting Company was a man of a certain type as revealed in his own documents, we could not form a proper estimate of the policy of handing over a State concession to an Irish Broadcasting Company, in which he was the chief and central figure, unless we pursued this oblique investigation into the document, and the other matters which arose out of that document, which no doubt came accidentally under our notice.  It would not be fair, therefore, I suggest to this Committee that furnished the present Interim Report which you are to debate shortly, to postpone, or perhaps altogether to suppress the evidence upon which the present Interim Report was based.  I am as anxious as Deputy Johnson to do justice to preserving the equities in regard to everybody concerned.  It is a most regrettable fact that charges were made and bandied about with regard to the Postmaster-General and to a Deputy of the Dáil.  The fact that they were made is known to all the world.  We have reported as regards the charges made against the Postmaster-General, and declared that they were wholly unfounded.</P>
    <P>As regards the implications of another Deputy of the Dáil in these rumours and in these aspersions, we are not in a position to give a finding yet.  At the same time, the documents which bring him in by way of implication are really necessary, or might prove to be necessary, to aid in the formation of a judgment as to the rightness or the wrongness of the Interim Report so far as it extends.  There is this, however, to be remembered.  As a Committee of the whole Dáil we considered that the Postmaster-General was an External Minister within the meaning of the Constitution, and that the administration of his office, his proposed policy, and everything of that sort, was subject directly to the criticism and control of the Dáil, and that as a Committee of the Dáil we were entitled to have the files of his Department submitted.  The Postmaster-General met us fully upon that point, <Col N="1063" /> and submitted the entire files of his Department, showing every document from the first moment of the Broadcasting project to the first sitting of our Committee.</P>
    <P>Now, to publish all these, with Departmental notes upon them, would be simply to provide a bulky volume that would serve no useful purpose.  Memos. to the effect that &ldquo;A Memorandum has been received and duly noted,&rdquo; and things trivial, will go to swell the bulk of the volume, and the purpose of Deputy Bryan Cooper would be defeated, if the volume is such that people will not read it, deterred by the fact that there is so much to go through.  I quite appreciate the retort that may be made that if any documents are withheld at all, the suspicious mind of the public will at once raise the cry: &ldquo;Suppression of documents.&rdquo;  But these are things with which we must deal in the ordinary course of life.  We shall not, no matter what we publish or what evidence we reveal, prevent tongues from wagging.  We must, therefore, merely, as experienced men who know what the world is, put up with the possibility of these allegations being repeated.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, for the purpose of the public service, and more particularly to aid the Dáil in the formation of a right judgment, there are certain documents that ought, in my humble opinion, be published, to wit, all upon which the examination of witnesses bore, and to which explicit reference was made in the examination.  I may assure you that, even if all the evidence as taken by us, and all the documents to which I allude, were published it would constitute a pretty large octavo volume, and it would take a considerable time to read and digest.  I take the liberty, therefore, of proposing to Deputy Bryan Cooper, while I support his motion in the main, that he should limit the requirements to the evidence taken by the Committee, and the documents put in and examined upon in the taking of the evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Johnson's suggestion.  I am rather apprehensive that the tone of the speech of Deputy Magennis will rather heighten than allay public apprehension. I have been a member of that <Col N="1064" /> Committee, and I am really astounded to hear there has been such a crop of wild rumours.  So far as the broadcasting business proper is concerned, I think there is nothing to which the finger of reproach can be pointed, unless that to which Deputy Johnson alludes.  If Deputy Magennis's suggestion were adopted it would certainly require a Committee to select and sift the papers which were to receive publication. I cannot see that that is going to cope with the situation created by those wild rumours.</P>
      <P>I take it that the purpose of the publication of the evidence is to dissipate the idea that there has been any crooked work in connection with broadcasting.  If a Committee is appointed to select evidence, those who are hankering after intrigue and sensation-mongering will still say that something has been left out of the publication, whereas the suggestion of Deputy Johnson will give ample opportunity for every scintilla of evidence relative to the matter to be brought in, and to be brought under the public observation.  I do not think that there is anything else to be said.  I think Deputy Johnson's statement was lucid; it was one that stated calmly the facts, and showed a very commonsense way of disposing of this matter.  These things that have given rise to apprehension have nothing whatever to do with broadcasting, and should be dealt with by some other body, and the Committee that is already dealing with this question of broadcasting should be allowed to proceed with their work unimpeded by these irrelevant matters.  I strongly support Deputy Johnson's proposal.</P>

The suggestion made by Deputy Magennis of the appointment of a Committee of the Dáil to sift evidence would not allay the feeling in the minds of the public that there is something that needs the light, and, therefore, in order to be fair to those who are concerned, and whose honour will affect the honour of the Dáil, I say that we should adopt the suggestion made by Deputy Johnson and appoint this Committee, who will investigate in public, hear the evidence <Col N="1065" /> in a legal manner, and give their decision.</P>

      <P>A fortnight ago to-day, in speaking on the reception of the Interim Report of the Committee on Wireless Broadcasting, I stated that it was my intention at some future date to call for the production of documents, and I also added that I would urge the Dáil that these documents might be released from privilege in order that the matter might be taken by me into the courts of this country. I made that statement publicly, and that statement was printed the following day in the papers.  I did not lose many days before I consulted my solicitors as to the action requisite in the matter.  It was my intention that no delay should follow what I said.  But what I feared has happened.  Within a few days of my statement Mr. Belton sold his effects in this country and has left it.  I am, therefore, put in a rather awkward position, because of the document handed in, as Deputy Johnson has said, a long time prior to its production before the Committee, handed in to the Postmaster-General, which, although it had no reference whatever to wireless or anything connected with wireless, was put into the file of correspondence and documents put before the Committee.  I want very carefully, very deliberately, to avoid using any words that might give offence.  I have my own very strong feeling.  I have very strong reasons for that feeling, as to the reasons for the production of that document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be a very unfortunate thing for the future of this country, if a Deputy, pressing an enquiry into a matter, would always have hanging over his head the possibility that some person concerned would file a document that would be put into evidence, making charges against him, charges which must either be true or false.  If true, the document ought to be known, and if false, it is a scandal, and there will always be some person to say that there is never smoke without fire.  I was prepared to support Deputy Bryan Cooper's motion fully and heartily, and I had intended to have said so quite briefly, and to have left the matter at that.  Deputy Johnson's <Col N="1066" /> suggestion, however, has brought a new conception into the field.  It is only necessary now for me to say in regard to it that I welcome, very heartily welcome, any such proposal as he has outlined. The honour of this Dáil is affected. The honour of this Dáil is affected in two ways.  The honour of the Dáil is affected in as far as it refers to one of its members, because its entire honour is reposed in each one of its members, and it is also affected in so far as one of its members has been the subject of an attack so framed as this has been.  Therefore, I think the correct procedure would be, if Deputy Johnson's proposal is to be acted upon, that a Committee should be appointed, and I would urge, and I think those who are familiar with the practice in such matters in other places will follow the reasoning I have in my mind, that a proposal to that effect, that a Committee having power to investigate these matters extraneous to the Wireless Inquiry, and raised in course of it, to investigate judicially, and strictly according to the laws of evidence, should be moved by the leader of this Dáil, the President of the Executive Council.  If the proposal is to be accepted, I would prefer that it should be he, who is the leader of this Dáil, who should move such a motion, and I presume in that case the Committee would be put up in the ordinary way by the Committee of Selection.  However, I have only risen now to say, and I leave it at this sentence: I welcome the appointment of any such Committee.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, would you permit me to say a word.  In view of Deputy Milroy's criticism, I desire to say that I have not asked to suppress anything which has any bearing whatsoever, either as a document or in evidence, upon the Interim Report, and its formation. Deputy Milroy is under the impression that I want to select documents. I want to leave out all bulk-making things that are of no value whatsoever&mdash;merely routine correspondence&mdash;and I am supporting Deputy Bryan Cooper's proposal to have the whole of what came before the Committee, with this slight reservation, <Col N="1067" /> published for the reading of the members of the Dáil.  When they have read these things they can form their own opinion as to the desirability, or otherwise, of pursuing the matter further.</P>

      <P>The point of view that I look at this from ought to be the point of view of the ordinary member of the Dáil who is outside of this Committee and who has not had an opportunity of knowing the evidence put before it, and that to a certain extent must be under the influence of all the rumours that have been circulated through the Press and outside it.  I would imagine that Deputy Bryan Cooper would be in a somewhat similar position, and I take it that he put down his motion because he felt that it was in the best interests of every Deputy, in the best interests of the members of this Dáil whose names were mentioned before this Committee, that all the documents that went before it, the documents on which that Committee based its Report, should be published and should go to the public.  Deputy Johnson has put forward what I am sure is an admirable suggestion, and Deputy Magennis' suggestion is admirable in its way, too, but take all their suggestions from the point of view of those outside this Committee, and what construction must be put on them?  Deputy Johnson suggests that another Committee ought to be set up to consider the evidence again.  I take it that that is really what his suggestion amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion that must inevitably be drawn, if such a Committee as that be set up, will be that there was something in the evidence that went before the previous Committee that ought not go to the public, and because it is not suitable to go before the public another Committee must be set up to inquire into the whole matter.  You may set up that Committee, and may <Col N="1068" /> give to the public a Report that in one sense may be more satisfactory than you can give them on the evidence that has already been given, but will it be entirely satisfactory to the public who are to-day very suspicious?  I say it will not, and I say it will be a dangerous step for the Dáil to decide, and that it will be in the best interests of every Deputy, and more particularly of the Deputies whose names have been mentioned before that Committee, that every document that was put in there and used as evidence, and on which the Report that came before the Dáil was based, should be made public.  Even though it will make a bulky volume it ought to be published.  Let the public know everything that is to be known; let them know the worst that is to be known.  We have good reason to believe that things are not half so bad as the sensation mongers, as Deputy Milroy has said, have tried to make out. If you do not do that they will say things twice as bad as they would if they knew the whole truth.  From my point of view the Motion should be accepted, and let everybody have an opportunity of knowing the evidence that was advanced before that Committee. That evidence ought to be sufficient to clear the names of members of the Dáil from the rumours and suggestions that have been made against their character and integrity.  I think that it is in the best interests of their good name, and in the best interests of the Dáil that selected that Committee, that the information that was before the Committee should be published fully and frankly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I feel as strongly as anybody the importance of the purpose that Deputy Bryan Cooper has in view, and of the necessity for doing everything to prevent the slightest suspicion that the Committee, or anybody else, wants to keep anything secret in this matter.  But while I hope I shall say nothing which will be in the slightest way contrary to that, for that is what I feel very strongly, I do not feel that the suggestion Deputy Johnson made is open to the interpretation Deputy Baxter put on it.  In fact, I think Deputy Johnson was careful to say himself, in the first place. <Col N="1069" /> that if any such Committee were appointed they would have immediate access to the documents and evidence before the previous Committee.  That would get over any suggestion of hushing up anything.  But I rise particularly to express the hope that the Dáil will recognise the real importance of drawing a sharp line between two things.  This Broadcasting Committee has one definite piece of work to do, which it has begun, and I think, as one of the Committee, I may express the hope that the Dáil will be sufficiently satisfied with what it has so far done as to allow it to proceed.  There is no reason for mixing that work up with something else; there is every reason for keeping it apart, and it is not the business of that Committee to go into these extraneous matters.  I support Deputy Johnson strongly in this; I think it is for the Dáil to decide what line they will take with regard to these suggestions, and I think, if I might say so in passing, that the Deputy concerned has a strong right to have his wishes appreciated and met as far as possible.  Let the Dáil decide what they want to do about that.  It is a totally different thing from going on with the work of the Broadcasting Committee. I do not think what Deputy Professor Magennis said really differed from what was in Deputy Johnson's suggestion. I think both were equally anxious to secure publicity.  Deputy Professor Magennis suggested two points, and I think they are important, with reference to the publication of these particular documents that merely are concerned with the broadcasting proposal, and which I have separated now entirely from the documents concerned with these other suggestions. So far as these business documents are concerned, two points of view were mentioned by Deputy Magennis to which I want to draw attention.  A large number of them are absolutely unimportant, and would merely tend to prevent people getting to know the real meaning of the various suggestions about this proposal.  Otherwise departmental papers, which, I think, if published exactly as put before that Committee, would lead to difficulties in departmental work.  There are papers that are semi-confidential, comments <Col N="1070" /> from officials, members of the Postmaster-General's staff, of various kinds, giving their personal opinions as to whether such-and-such projects are likely to be successful, and such things, unimportant in themselves, no doubt, but I think they would lead, if published, to a doubt in the minds of officials in such departments in future as to how far they were likely to have anything they said more or less confidentially to their chief made public at any particular moment when something might happen.  I do hope the Dáil will draw that line I suggest between these two things, and try to keep them completely distinct, and to decide quite separately what they will do on the one hand, and meanwhile allow the Broadcasting Committee to go on with its work as it wants to do.</P>

      <P>I had some difficulty in making up my mind as this discussion went on, but I am quite clear now that at the present stage the Dáil would be wiser to follow the arguments put forward by Deputy Magennis and Deputy Thrift that a certain number of the documents that are pertinent to the matter should be made public.  As for the fear that the public would consider there was a suppression in this matter, if the names of the members of the Committee are appended to the Report, I do not think any member of the public would imagine for one moment, for instance, that Deputy Thrift would put his name to a document where there was material evidence suppressed.  As regards the suggestion that this should be published in the first instance, and if it was thought necessary afterwards by the Dáil, or the public, that a greater amount of publicity should be secured, then I think that Deputy Johnson's proposal for an inquiry in public might be arranged, but at the moment I feel confident that if the material documents of the case were made public, either members of the Dáil or the public in general will ask for further evidence in the nature of Deputy Johnson's proposal.</P>

I think it is the only way to meet the case, that a Special Committee should be appointed to go into this matter of the wireless broadcasting evidence so far as the conduct of any member of the Dáil is affected by allegations.  I think it is only a Special Committee of that sort could select from the evidence that is before the existing committee what should be published.  Deputy Johnson's proposal is the only practical proposal, and I think the only proposal that will be accepted by the public with confidence.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if Deputy Cooper agrees with that suggestion.  It appeared to me when listening to the discussion that the majority of the Deputies who spoke leaned towards the suggestion that was made by Deputy Johnson.  It was subscribed to by some others.  I see a danger in the point that was mentioned by Deputy Magennis as regards certain extracts.  Departmental files, as Deputy Thrift very sensibly pointed out, cannot be made the subject of publication. That is fairly obvious.  We could not be sure of the confidence of heads of Departments, or others, if there was the idea that within three, six or twelve months their comments on proposals were to be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these matters, there ought to be admitted a certain privilege or confidence, which is absolutely essential if you are to discharge business.  That is all I have got to say as regards that.  I do think that Deputy Baxter, if he knew the quality of the material that is contained in these reports, the various hands through which they must go, and how much men's reputations, records, promotion, and all the rest, depend upon the amount of ability that is shown in the various files, would admit that it was not a reasonable thing to ask for them.  A person outside, being utterly irresponsible, might easily attract some popular attention to a matter of that sort and say: &ldquo;Here is an attempt to cloak.&rdquo;  All we can say about that, is that we have to wait until these irresponsible people have some responsibility, when they will themselves <Col N="1072" /> see that there is no attempt to cloak in a matter of that sort.  But there is certainly an attempt to preserve the independence of a service which is of great importance to the State.  If Deputy Cooper is inclined to agree to this proposal, I would undertake to consult him with regard to a motion that I would consider about introducing some day next week to deal with the matter.</P>

To print the evidence would necessarily take some time.  Presumably, the usual course would be followed, and a proof would be sent to the witnesses.  Some of these witnesses, we are told, have left the country, and there might be considerable delay before the proceedings came into the hands of the public.  I do think, however, that sooner or later that material evidence will have to be published.  But I am perfectly prepared for the present to withdraw my motion, because it is obvious that if the President acts on Deputy Johnson's suggestion, the matter will then become <i>sub judice,</i> and it would be entirely wrong to have a mass of fresh material issued whilst this Committee was sitting, or possibly when it was just considering its report. That would not make for justice.  It would simply create a false scent.  I <Col N="1073" /> am prepared to withdraw my motion for the time being, but I reserve to myself the right to re-introduce it, probably in an amended form that may meet some of the objections of Deputy Magennis and the President.  If the President will agree to my doing that, I should be very glad to withdraw, subject to the leave of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I would wish to know whether Deputy Johnson has in mind the exclusion of evidence bearing on broadcasting proper from members of this Dáil.  If that is so, I think the decision will be an unfortunate one. That is the only point with which I am personally concerned.  I am not in the least involved in extraneous matters, but I am, as Minister responsible for the White Paper, deeply concerned to see that the edifice built up by my Department&mdash;an edifice which I still stand by&mdash;will be displayed in its entirety to Deputies before they are called upon to destroy that building and set up something else in its stead. I just want to know at this stage whether this particular motion excludes the production of that broadcasting evidence proper.</P>

The matter, as it stands at present, is that Deputy Cooper has consented to withdraw his motion, and I am undertaking to bring up something which I hope will meet with the approval of the Dáil.  It is open to the Postmaster-General when that motion is introduced&mdash;I have not the faintest notion at the moment of what the terms will be but I know the general lines upon which it will run&mdash;if there is any objection to the motion to enter his objection.  It certainly is not intended at any time to shut out the Postmaster-General from displaying whatever edifice he would like to display.</P>

      <P>What we would like to know is, is the inquiry to be into what I will call, for convenience, the Belton-Figgis affair, or an enquiry into broadcasting?  I think, with all respect to Deputy Johnson, <Col N="1074" /> there is now a possibility of a great deal of confusion.  As I understood Deputy Johnson, he wanted to have an inquiry into the Belton allegations. That course I suggest would follow upon the public being made aware of what these things are, to see whether they are of sufficient importance or otherwise to warrant the enquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with the Postmaster-General in desiring that everything connected with Broadcasting and with the plans and proposals of the Postmaster-General should be published.  I would like that all the matter could be made public, if it were going to be comprehensible to the reader.  The fact remains&mdash;and I challenge anybody who sees the evidence to deny it&mdash;that to publish it as presented and reported it would be incomprehensible. I would assure the Postmaster-General, so far as I am concerned, that all the coherent evidence of himself and his Department might even be detached and published for his satisfaction and justification.  Of course, that will be a matter for the Committee.  The suggestion made by Deputy Magennis&mdash;or at least the query put, apparently to me&mdash;was as to whether there were to be two enquiries. Undoubtedly, if the Broadcasting Committee is to go on with its work, by the will of the Dáil, then, by all means, let it proceed with this work.  I am quite confident, and I am glad the Dáil has agreed, that the other inquiry which the Deputy has referred to as the Belton-v.-Figgis enquiry, should be separate, but it will not be merely a Belton-v.Figgis enquiry.  That is the reason I proposed such a course of action.  If it were the mere printing of the evidence in its present form, or as it has been given, the Broadcasting Committee, would have to follow new lines altogether, and there would be inevitably, even then, a necessity for a further inquiry.  Suggestions have been made, and I have no doubt that the President, on behalf of the Government, will be required to explain its position, or the position of the Government that preceded it, in relation to some of the proposals that have been made.  That is why I want this other <Col N="1075" /> inquiry so that all these matters of refutations of suggestions should be made public, and the course of public life made clean.  That is the whole purpose of my suggestion, and I think this is much the more effective way of securing that end.</P>

      <P>Apparently the suggestion is that Deputy Cooper's motion for the immediate publication of the evidence and the documents should be withdrawn.  The President, then acting on what he deems to be the feeling of the Dáil, is to bring in a motion next week for the setting up of a Special Committee of the Dáil to investigate particular matters that I find it difficult to classify, but which we might, perhaps, call personal matters&mdash;distinct altogether from the question of Broadcasting.

      <P>I have an interest in this matter, as there is one particular point which, perhaps, should be made clear.  The Committee which was appointed to go into the matter of broadcasting was obliged, owing to the nature of some of the documents submitted, to go into other matters. It is only fair to say, as far as it was represented to me, that the Committee could not help that.  Nobody could have avoided it.  In paragraph 9 of the Committee's Report they go into a personal question, in which the name of a Deputy of the Dáil is mentioned.  They came to a conclusion&mdash;as they were perfectly entitled to come to a conclusion &mdash;about a gentleman who was concerned in getting some form of concession from the State.  But they refrained, as they were obliged to refrain, from going into any question relating to charges or counter-charges concerning a Deputy.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee refrained from enquiring into these charges and counter-charges any further than was requisite to form a clear judgment as to the suitability of Mr. Belton to be a State concessionaire.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in this matter from this point of view, that it leaves the Deputy <Col N="1076" /> in the position that a particular thing has been started and has not been carried to a conclusion.  That is a matter that seems to me to concern not only the Deputy, but the whole Dáil. That is why I speak of it.  There appears to be some confusion in the minds of some Deputies; the idea, as far as I can gather it now, appears to be to investigate that matter in order to make a definite report to the Dáil on the question raised about a Deputy, and to investigate any other matter concerning public men which may have arisen.  If that is not the proper interpretation we might as well get it made clear now, because it is a very important matter from the point of view of the whole Dáil.  I take it that is what Deputy Johnson meant.</P>

    <P>I wish to submit this Interim Report from the Broadcasting Committee.  As has been explained, outside matters were introduced that had no practical bearing on Broadcasting.  The members of the Committee felt that it was their <Col N="1077" /> duty to examine into these matters, as they affected the character of one of the leading promoters of the Broadcasting Company.</P>
    <P>We felt it was not within our duty to form or pass any judgment in reference to the accusations made against a Deputy of this Dáil.  Some suggestions in the Press would lead one to believe that the Committee had something to keep from the public.  There was nothing further in the minds of the members of the Committee than to hide anything that was of public interest, and I think, without going into the other matters, the best way to make the work of the Committee a success is to take away from it those outside matters and leave the Committee to continue the work for which it was formed.  I beg to propose the adoption of this report, and I hope that the Committee will be allowed further time to go into the matter again and submit a final report.</P>
    <P>Professor</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="MAGENNIS MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  The members of the Committee share the same desire as the Chairman of the Committee, that the Dáil would approve and adopt the Interim Report.  It might be well for the sake of clearer thought, if I begin by saying that the description of elements in our Report, as extraneous matters, is not altogether accurate. Strictly speaking, we have investigated no extraneous matter.  The terms of reference were that we were to consider the White Paper, and as the Report elaborately sets out, we consider that quite a large number of questions in detail were involved in the consideration of the White Paper.  We have set out these questions in full, and have attempted to answer them, in so far as at the time of furnishing this Interim Report, we were able to do so satisfactorily. In the last discussion about the Figgis-Belton affair, there was a possible suggestion to the members of the Dáil that what was popularly called a red herring had been drawn across the trail of our inquiry.  That is not so. A finding of the Report deals with a very important rejected policy on the part of the Postmaster-General.  He, and the members of the Committee, are very, very desirous of providing a <Col N="1078" /> broadcasting station in Ireland, and when the Postmaster-General looked through what had been done in this regard in other countries, he found an excellent model in the British Broadcasting Co.  Various negotiations were attempted between the Post Office Ministry, and firms in the Saorstát, and eventually the Postmaster-General had formed a model on the British Broadcasting Company, a composite Company to take over the work of broadcasting. Our Report is adverse to the formation of that Broadcasting Company, not merely on the ground that Mr. Belton figured so prominently in its formation and constitution.  This is important to dwell upon.  The real reason is because we considered that in the Broadcasting Co. in England, the constituent units are firms engaged in the manufacture and sale of electrical apparatus, and if the Broadcasting Company, set up in Ireland, is to claim to be after that model the constituent units should be firms of that sort.  There was none of that type, and it appears that at the moment there is none, because of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Committee came to the conclusion that in the absence of similar firms in Ireland to constitute a composite company, the concession should be made to what only appears to be a similar company.  We had before us, as witnesses, various representatives of what are called in the White Paper, the five constituent units.  The judgment at which we arrived, not without very considerable discussion and deliberation, was that we could not regard all of those five firms as eligible to form a composite company to receive the State concessions.  Now, in the course of his evidence, the Postmaster-General laid great stress upon an aspect of Irish Broadcasting to which he, in response to a representation of a body of musicians, adverted, and upon which he dwelt at length in a letter published in the newspapers yesterday, and that is the advantage that would be provided for Irish cultural developments if there were an Irish Broadcasting Station at the service of cultural agencies which would provide lectures, concerts, music and the like to develop and cultivate an Irish taste in the matter <Col N="1079" /> of the arts as practised in Ireland. We share the same view.  Our Committee agrees heartily with the Postmaster-General's aspirations in this regard.  I think it was with reference to that that he claimed on the first occasion that this report came before the Dáil that we had confirmed his judgment.  There are three things in which we confirm his judgment.  One is that there ought to be an Irish Broadcasting Station, that Wireless Telephony should not be merely such for Irish listeners-in as would be provided by foreign stations, that there ought to be distinctly Irish stations; secondly, that it ought to be kept strictly under Irish national control; and thirdly, that the purposes to which that Irish station should be devoted, in addition to the strictly utilitarian purposes of giving meteorological information to farmers and fishermen, and reports about ruling prices to business men, that it should be utilisable for educative purposes of a higher type.  These are very important elements of the White Paper upon which the Committee agree with the Postmaster-General and endorse his policy.</P>
    <P>The only one real respect in which his policy is not adopted or approved is with regard to the formation of the company.  You will see from the report that there are certain items which we reserve, inasmuch as we require to hear the evidence of experts.  A point which was made between the Postmaster-General and certain members of the Committee was this: whether or not the Post Office should retain the ownership and the control or a section of the ownership and installation of a broadcasting station, or whether, as the White Paper seems to propose, that the setting-up and the expense entailed by the setting-up and the subsequent working and its expenditure should be handed over to a company.  We have yet to determine that point.  What we would ask is that the Dáil approve of the report so far as it goes.  There is one other item on which there is an appearance of friction, and it is an appearance which the letter which those musicians published, and to which I have just now referred, would intensify. The Committee was of opinion that facilities for listening-in to what is <Col N="1080" /> already broadcasted from other stations should be at once provided to our Irish citizens under licence on payment of a fee as determined by the Postmaster-General. The Postmaster-General, it would seem, has grave fears that if the Irish public become accustomed to the enjoyment of programmes furnished from other sources that the demand for an Irish broadcasting station would be lessened and, in fact, that the public will forget that there is no such station, and that his hand in demanding the creation of it would be weakened.  I would beg the Dáil to support the view which the members of the Committee of Inquiry put upon their own Report, that is to say upon the very first clause of it, that they recommend the setting up of an Irish broadcasting station, and that they believe it ought to be set up. We take Section 1 and Section 9 together. We do not recommend anything which would postpone, unnecessarily, even for an hour, or militate in any way against the setting up of an Irish station.  We confidently believe that when the Irish public begin to appreciate from experience what broadcasting can afford them in the way of education and cultural entertainment, they will demand the provision of further pabulum of a distinctive Irish character, and, with belief in Irish artistic capacity, they will demand that foreign listeners-in will have an opportunity of being acquainted with the development in Ireland of the civilised arts as exhibited in the matter broadcasted. Therefore, we have great faith in the larger repercussion, as I may call it, of Irish broadcasting than the advocate of it, the Postmaster-General himself.  I have much pleasure in seconding the proposition of the Chairman of the Committee, that the Dáil adopts and approves our Interim Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="POSTMASTER-GENERAL POSTMASTER-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>POSTMASTER-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain items in this Report which are quite acceptable to the Post Office viewpoint.  One of them, that of the issue of licences, is, for instance, acceptable, for the reason that the situation had so developed that some such departure was essential, and also because of the fact that the Committee in its wise judgment recommended that in the <Col N="1081" /> interests of broadcasting control those steps should be taken.  There is another recommendation which has all the appearance of reality, but at best it only conveys a pious expression of opinion, and this is, to my view, the kernel of the whole situation, that of the erection of a broadcasting station. Paragraph 8 demolishes the programme presented to this Dáil in the White Paper, but the Committee, while asking the Dáil to accept that demolition, has taken no steps whatever to ascertain whether a feasible substitute is possible.  It is said, for instance, in paragraph 7, that the Committee is considering whether it would not be advisable to erect this broadcasting station by State funds, and to provide the cultural side of Irish life through some co-ordinating medium between the cultural people, and the State itself should be responsible for the running of the broadcasting station.  It says that in providing that cultural programme not only would it be possible to do it for nothing, but that the State conceivably would make profit from the transaction. I wonder is the Committee serious in this matter.  Has it considered whether such a thing as this is possible? Has it considered, before destroying a feasible proposal constructed over a period of six months, before destroying it in a period of six days, whether there is a practical alternative available?  I would imagine the first duty of the Committee is to ascertain whether this alternative is at their disposal.  I would imagine that before asking the Dáil to turn down the product of our extended labours, some feasible scheme for ensuring the provision of a broadcasting station for this country would have been presented.  It is all very fine to say we believe the best thing is to put up a station at the expense of the State.  Can this Committee guarantee to the Dáil that the State is prepared to expend its money in this venture?  If it cannot guarantee that, why destroy the only material available?  I see no reason whatever for the presentation of this Interim Report, or at least for its adoption here.  There is nothing whatever to prevent the Committee from getting ahead with its further investigations and presenting an alternative for the one which they seek to remove <Col N="1082" /> without in any way binding the Dáil or the Committee to a refusal to sanction that which has been placed before them, and which, to my mind, is the only means through which a broadcasting station can be set up here. There is a lot of confusion in the public mind in this matter, and it would have simplified our position very much had the evidence been made public from the outset.  For instance, people want to know is this a monopoly.  I think the Committee will agree that it is the reverse of a monopoly, and that the one thing the Post Office aimed at from the outset was the avoidance of anything that would give the appearance of a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said, in effect, there are no people engaged in the manufacture of wireless in this country and, seeing that we believe that a broadcasting station would not be a proper investment for State monies, it is our duty to see that anybody within the country, any citizen of the Free State, who is able and willing to participate in a Government concession of this sort, should be permitted to do so.  We followed the direct line, that the one thing to be avoided in the erection of a broadcasting station here was that under no circumstances should we be open to the charge of creating a monopoly.  Now, I venture to say, if the State refuses to speculate its moneys in this broadcasting project, that the Committee will again be thrown back on the necessity of following in our footsteps and inviting Irish citizens to come forward with their money to erect the station.  I have a feeling, in this connection, that paragraph 8 implies a reflection on some of those citizens&mdash;citizens of very great repute, citizens who have contributed materially to the freedom which we enjoy here, citizens of the type of Mr. Dowdall, of Cork&mdash;that it implies in the mind of the public that men of his type are unsuited or unfitted or not entitled to participate in a Government concession. That may or may not be the intention of the Committee, but the paragraph is capable of that interpretation. What I suggest to this Committee is&mdash;and I do not see any objection to it&mdash;that there is no necessity whatever for the adoption of this Interim Report.  There is no reason <Col N="1083" /> whatever why an Interim Report should be presented.  The Committee was set up to consider the White Paper, to consider a proposal already made and, failing acceptance of that proposal, to put up something in its stead. That was their job.  It has not been, in any way, altered by anything that happened in the interval.</P>
    <P>There is just one point on which I would like to dwell, in connection with this whole matter.  Anything in the nature of a Government concession is pretty sure to bring trouble.  The same question has caused serious trouble in other countries.  We do not stand alone in respect to it.  People rush to the conclusion that a concession of this kind is something in the nature of the presentation of a gift on the part of the Government.  As a matter of fact, in our own experience, we found it extremely difficult to get anybody to accept the gift.  We found it necessary to advertise on four successive occasions, and beg of our countrymen to chance their money in what, I think, may be reasonably regarded as a risky speculation.  But that is not a matter that concerns me, so much as the causes which, in my view, led to the original inquiry.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that the only questions raised on broadcasting in this House, prior to the issue of the White Paper, were raised by Deputies Figgis and McGarry.  It will be also remembered that both Deputies were subsequently appointed to the Committee, and it will be further remembered that neither Deputy signed the Report.  All these coincidences must have some meaning to the observer.  If the evidence to which I referred on the previous motion were published before the Dáil was called upon to endorse this Interim Report, I venture to say that it would come to the conclusion that an extern company&mdash;a combine in a neighbouring country&mdash;is directly associated in an effort to prevent the control of broadcasting by the Irish people.  It will be seen in that evidence that both the Deputies concerned&mdash;the Deputies to whom I have just referred &mdash;were in communication with the chairman of that combine.  This is why <Col N="1084" /> I ask that the evidence be placed at the disposal of the Deputies of the Dáil before they are called upon to pass judgment on this Interim Report.  It is common knowledge in local circles at the present time&mdash;I want the members of the Committee to take a special note of this&mdash;that the first move to prevent the adoption of the broadcasting scheme embodied in the White Paper, and the subsequent Press campaign, which, I venture to say, had some bearing on certain decisions, were both the work&mdash;the direct effect&mdash;of this foreign company.</P>
    <P>It is common talk here that this Company initiated the efforts to destroy this White Paper, to destroy the scheme brought forward by the Post Office, that they did it with the sole object of collaring and controlling wireless in Ireland in the future, that by their able tactics, within and without the Committee, they have been enabled to succeed far beyond their expectations, that they have now deprived this country of a Broadcasting Station, that they have thrown the country open to free exploitation in regard to the sale of sets, and that in short Ireland, for their purposes, is simply a continuation of an English Shire.  They say further that once they brought broadcasting to its present stage, it is only a matter of time when they will be appealed to to take up the running to include Ireland in their field of exploit.  That is actually the position. I believe myself that the Committee has the best intentions in the world, when it suggests that a broadcasting station should be set up here. I believe it really wishes that that should be done.  It means well and hopes that it will be done.  But hopes and good intentions are all very fine.  I believe that before it destroys what is at its disposal, its hopes and intentions should be translated into something practical, and that before the Committee asks the Dáil to reject what, in my view, will prove eventually to be the only practicable solution of this matter, it should see to it that there is an alternative, work out the details of that alternative, and prove here conclusively that there is something to be put in its place.  If you do not do that, <Col N="1085" /> you have no right to reject the only course which I personally can see open to the Committee, that of falling back again on private enterprise to produce a Broadcasting Station and control broadcasting here.</P>
    <P>Already the position is very much queered.  The fact of issuing licences&mdash; although I agreed to their issue, I did it without enthusiasm&mdash;to people who had walked on the law, to people who had imported sets, knowing their action was illegal, has queered the pitch of Government control of this very potent instrument in the future.  I can conceive a situation in which the users of wireless will continue to defy the Postmaster-General's control in this matter, will not pay licence fees, will erect their miniature wireless stations as they please, and will bring the utmost chaos and confusion into the wireless world here, in the hope and belief that should the Postmaster-General be foolish enough to attempt again to bring them under control, another Press onslaught will save them.  This is the predicament to which broadcasting has been brought. We have legalised law-breakers.  We have deprived this country of a broadcasting station; we have turned it over to British music-hall dope and British propaganda, and no one of us, on the Committee or off the Committee, sees any way out of the dilemma.  There is only one solid fact, and that is that the product of a Department's efforts, covering a whole six months, are roughly turned down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Postmaster-General regrets the damage to his own wee ewe lamb, and he feels sore that the Committee should have destroyed his hopes, that the company which he worked so hard and ardently to bring into being has not received the recommendation of the Committee.  Because of the loss of that particular creation of his own, he thinks that the whole prospect of Ireland's cultural development through broadcasting is lost.  I am surprised that after a fortnight's contemplation he should be in the same mood. I could understand his feeling sore upon the first day, but I would have thought that a little reflection would <Col N="1086" /> have led him to a happier state of mind. When he urges that there was no occasion for an Interim Report, I would remind him and the Dáil that we were bound to produce a report, and unless he desired us to say ditto, without inquiry, to his own proposal, or to refrain from taking notice of the evidence which he himself placed before us, it was quite impossible to produce the report which he now thinks ought to be produced&mdash;simply an approval <i>en bloc</i> of the White Paper.  The necessity for producing a report was imposed upon the Committee by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Postmaster-General thinks the whole prospect and outlook of wireless broadcasting in this country is damaged almost irretrievably by the loss of this Irish Broadcasting Company.  He desires to assure the Dáil that it is not a monopoly, and he thinks the Committee is unanimous with him in that protestation.  It depends upon his definition of the term &ldquo;monopoly.&rdquo;  I say distinctly it is a monopoly&mdash;it is a monopoly in the transmission of broadcasting and the control, subordinate only to the Postmaster-General&mdash;of trading in wireless apparatus.  The monopoly may be extended to those who are in the trade and who get licences but even the Postmaster-General would not claim that the new adherents to the company, who might be allowed to come in under the terms of the White Paper, are going to have control of the business of that corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The direction of the corporation is to be retained, even under the White Paper proposals, in the hands of the five constituent firms.  And that combination, the Irish Broadcasting Co., is to have the sole licence for conducting wireless in this country.  If that is not a monopoly, then I misunderstand the use of the word.  I am not finding fault with the monopoly.  A monopoly, if well controlled and of good character, in such a case as this may be justified. But as the Postmaster-General challenges the wisdom of the Committee in its reflections upon his good sense, respecting the constituent firms of this Irish Broadcasting Company, it is necessary to defend the views of the Committee.  Deputy Magennis has shown that it departs from the plan of <Col N="1087" /> the British Broadcasting Co., on which it is obviously designed.  One has to bear in mind the conditions surrounding the formation of this Company and the very important fact, that must never be forgotten, that the proposal was to give a concession to that Company, which Company was to be the sole concessionaire for this service, it is immaterial whether it is a good speculation or not.  The very fact that the Postmaster-General proposed that the State should give monopoly rights to a company, required him to make the closest inquiries as to the business, prestige, <i>bona fides</i> and general character of those firms.  Now I subscribe to the Postmaster-General's praise as to the public spirit of many of the people who formed, or were intended to form, some of these companies.  But we must bear in mind, as we are bound to do, that they were brought into existence almost, or shall I say forced into existence, cultivated into existence if you like, for the specific purpose in this form to make it appear that there were five firms, when there might be only two; the same people were associated with the two firms that eventually became five firms.</P>

      <P>When the project was first mooted for this Company, and the names of the persons associated with the Irish Development, Ltd., were submitted, otherwise Andrew Belton, there were twelve to fifteen names of reputable people sent into the Postmaster-General as men who were prepared to enter into this business.  Something happened which led to delay in the promotion of that company.  But it reappeared a little later, and on its reappearance it was three companies. The same people were three companies, neither of them having had any connection whatever, as far as we know, with electrical work or broadcasting or anything appertaining to it in this country. The proposed chairman of the Company, the chairman of one of the constituent companies undoubtedly had had experience a good many years ago as an electrical engineer.  But I submit <Col N="1088" /> that it was the duty of the Postmaster-General, before recommending that a concession should be given to a company of this kind, to have assured himself, especially when the evidence had been put into his hand, of the character of the chief promoter of the company.  He should have hesitated, before offering a concession to such a company with such a spokesman.  Four of the five firms had no great expectations, so it is alleged, of this being a profitable venture.  One of them who, by the way, was pressed, and had to be pressed into the company, who had to be imposed upon the company, believes it would be a very good business speculation. Another is actually in the business, and quite naturally expects to receive profits out of his ordinary electrical business.</P>
      <P>I say the Committee is well justified in urging the Dáil not to approve of that portion of the White Paper which suggests the handing over of this concession to an Irish Broadcasting Company whose constituent firms who will always be the directors and controllers, comprise the names in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be necessary, if the Postmaster-General will not recommend the obvious, to establish another private undertaking to set up a broadcasting station.  But let it be openly a financial undertaking.  Let it be clearly set up as a business concern, and let one company do it, however big that company may be, and not pretend that there are five separate constituent companies who may at some future time enter into the business of buying and selling wireless apparatus.  The suggestion undoubtedly left from all the matter that came before the Committee is that some, at least, of these constituent firms, within a very short time after the company would be set up, would sell out, unload, after boosting the shares, and leave the Postmaster-General, or their successors, to do what they liked with the Company.  It was not a legitimate company of the character that should receive a State concession from the Postmaster-General. The Postmaster-General has referred to a series of coincidences.  I wish he had been a little more frank in <Col N="1089" /> the matter, and stated bluntly what had been in his mind.  He spoke of tactics within and without the Company, presumably suggesting that members of the Company, or that the Company itself, was influenced in its judgement by the propaganda, which he alleges took place on behalf of the Marconi Company. He did not mention Marconi, but, no doubt, it is Marconi he referred to.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the tactics within the Company may have been.  I do not know what the tactics without the Company may have been, except that they did what all kinds of Companies do, and what the chief spokesman of the pet Company of the Postmaster-General admitted in evidence he had done, that is, endeavoured to persuade all kinds of people to support their claims for a concession. When the Postmaster-General refers to people having interviews with the Chairman of the Marconi Company, I do not know whether he is referring to the evidence submitted by Mr. Belton of the fact that he had an interview with the Chairman of the Marconi Company in London.  No, not by Mr. Belton himself, perhaps; I am not sure, but evidence was certainly submitted by a witness to the effect that Mr. Belton had accompanied the proposed Chairman of the Company in a mission to the Chairman of the Marconi Company in London.  So Marconi is not out of it, even under the Postmaster-General's pet scheme.  I think Deputy Hewat, if he were here, would say that the Government could even control Marconi if they established a station in Ireland, just as well, I am sure, as they could have controlled Andrew Belton, Esq.  Then the Postmaster-General refers with sorrow to the recommendation that the existing holders of wireless apparatus should be licensed forthwith.  I thought he would have acceded frankly to that recommendation; he now regrets it because, forsooth, it was legalising law-breakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder did he ever hear of a man who had forgotten to take out his dog licence being granted a licence.  And surely the harm is very much less to the State and to the good name of the <Col N="1090" /> Post Office, as well as of the holders of apparatus, that they should be licensed and recorded than that they should be conducting these operations furtively and in secret.  I think the Postmaster-General is probably right in saying that it will not be possible henceforward to capture records of every wireless receiving set in the country.  No change has taken place in that respect.  If it will not be possible now, it never will be possible, and if what we read about men being able to carry receiving sets in their watch pockets, attach them to their umbrellas, and receive messages, is likely to be true, then the chances of licensing every set are very small indeed. I am not at all enamoured of the principle of licensing these sets.  I am not sure whether it would not be safer and more sensible to make no restrictions upon the holders of wireless receiving sets.  I expect that it will be found in future that no such registration will be possible, and that the whole principle of licensing sets of this kind will have to go by the board.  But in view of the expert recommendations. I was quite prepared to subscribe my name to the suggestion that licences should be required.  There are several positive proposals in the Report, one negative proposal of a very emphatic kind, and other questions which are held in abeyance.  If the Dáil does not agree to the Report, then I think it is obvious that the Committee's usefulness is at an end.  If the Postmaster-General desires to test the views of the Dáil on a specific paragraph of the Report he should move in that direction.  He should move, for instance, for the deletion of paragraph 8, or any other paragraph of which he disapproves, but I can assure him that the Committee, so far, at any rate, as I can read its mind, is quite enthusiastic about the necessity for an Irish broadcasting station, and the members will individually do all they can to impress upon the Dáil the necessity for establishing such at the earliest possible date.  Speaking for myself, I would say to the Postmaster-General that he should frame a proposal for the establishment of a broadcasting station immediately, spending £20,000, or thereabouts, in the operation, and doing it as Postmaster-General. Leave the question of the operation <Col N="1091" /> of that station to be decided at a later date, prior to the erection, and I, at any rate, would support him enthusiastically if he will set about the erection of this station as a Post Office operation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe he would be thwarted by the Minister for Finance, and if he is he can come to the Dáil and ask for permission.  I do not believe for a moment that the Minister for Finance will prevent it, and I ask him to pursue his enthusiasm for the establishment of an Irish station, to the point of doing it as a Post Office operation.</P>
