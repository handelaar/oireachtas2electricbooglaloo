      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that in some cases men demobilised from the National Army have been unable to draw Unemployment benefit owing to the non-receipt of their Army Certificates at the Labour Exchange, and whether he will expedite the procedure in dealing with these certificates.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the water supply of the town of Arva, Co. Cavan, is unsatisfactory and insufficient for the needs of the town; whether he is in a position to cause an inquiry to be held into the matter.</P>

      <P>If the residents complain that the sanitary authority have been in default in the matter, that danger to the health of the inhabitants arises from the insufficiency or quality of the existing supply, and that a proper supply can be obtained at a reasonable cost, arrangements will be made for holding an inquiry.</P>

      <P>It is apparent to others, but so far not to me, what exactly is the purpose of this Committee.  It is merely a matter of information.  It is not set out here, and I have not been able to follow it.  Is it to act as the final Committee of the two Houses, or to consider revisions of the Standing Orders?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps as a member of the Standing Orders Committee, I may be allowed to reply.  This is more for procedure than for any other purpose.  The Committee will not consider the Bills.  It will be in permanent session as a sort of supervising Committee of the Private Bill procedure, and it will be also the channel of communication between the Seanad and the Dáil as regards private business. It will not be a Committee that will have an enormous amount of duty to perform.  The whole functions of the Committee are laid down in the Private Bills Standing Orders.</P>

Perhaps I may further ask him, in regard to any question of interpretation of these Private Bills Standing Orders, if any Deputy or any other person desires to have an interpretation with regard to <Col N="208" /> some point that remains in doubt on the reading, will this Committee be the Committee to which to apply, or if not, to whom should the application be made?</P>

      <P>This is not a considered judgment, but I think he should apply to the Examiner of Private Bills in the first instance, who will be an official of the Dáil.  Another function of the Committee will be the nominating of members to sit on Committees on various Bills.  They will nominate the panel of those who will consider the various Private Bills that will go before the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 7, page 4, line 39, after the word &ldquo;Commandant&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;who may be specifically empowered in any particular case by the Ministry of Defence to delegate his powers under this Act to any member of the military forces of Saorstát Eireann not below the rank of sergeant save and except in such cases where a military force has been detailed by the order of a person so empowered to arrest any person or persons in which case every member of such force shall be deemed to possess the powers granted by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The necessity for this amendment was fully gone into yesterday, but Deputy Johnson may have some further remarks to make to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the phraseology of this amendment has been carefully considered since yesterday? It is intended, it will be noted, to add these words to Section 7 after the word &ldquo;Commandant.&rdquo; Section 7 is a definition clause to explain certain phrases, and what certain terms mean, <Col N="209" /> and we are asked to insert in a definition clause a sentence which includes these words: &ldquo;Save and except in such cases where a military force has been detailed by the order of a person so empowered to arrest any person or persons in which case every member of such force shall be deemed to possess the powers granted by this Act.&rdquo;  I submit, as a matter of order, that this amendment, if it is to be considered and discussed, ought to be considered in the body of the Bill and not in a definition clause.  It is, as a matter of fact, extending the powers of certain soldiers and cannot be considered as part of the definition of who is a responsible officer.  Before going further I would ask whether it is in order to add to Section 7 a clause which extends the powers referred to in the earlier stages of the Bill to particular people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the clause is really only a definition clause.  It is one the purpose of which is to define a responsible officer.  A responsible officer is defined as a Commandant so far as the military are concerned, and then you define the type of officer lower than a Commandant who may, in any circumstances, have to be regarded as a responsible officer. From the point of view of any other clause in the Bill in which you simply mention a responsible officer and what powers you give him, there does not seem to be any necessity for giving any special authority in any statutory way to a particular officer of any kind to delegate powers.  There is automatic delegation of powers in many matters for this specific purpose.  A clause is necessary to indicate who is a responsible officer.  The clause definitely states it, and it puts limitations as to the manner in which these powers can be delegated, but it does nothing to point out what or who may be regarded as a responsible officer for the purpose of taking action within the terms of the Bill.  I submit that although the phraseology may not be what we usually meet with in a clause such as this, the actual amendment does nothing but indicate for the purpose of the Bill types of people whom it is <Col N="210" /> desirable to regard as responsible officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I would direct attention to the last three lines in relation to the clause as a whole: &ldquo;In this Act the expression responsible officer means an officer of a police force ... or an officer of the military forces, not being below the rank of Commandant, who may be specifically empowered ... save and except in such cases where a military force has been detailed by the order of a person so empowered to arrest any person or persons.&rdquo;  Now, it may be argued up to that point that this is a definition clause, but then we come to the words: &ldquo;In which case every member of such force shall be deemed to possess the powers granted by this Act.&rdquo;  I submit that is going beyond the limits set down in our Standing Orders, because it changes the intention of Section 2, which speaks of a responsible officer.  It says that in certain cases every member of the force shall be deemed to possess the powers granted by this Act which, in Section 2, were confined to certain people of certain rank.  I ask you to rule whether the amendment as it stands is in order, particular consideration being given to this last phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was made clear yesterday that we were anxious to restrain or restrict the use of military in as great a portion of the country as we possibly could, and that there are only limited portions of the country over which it was proposed to give these powers of delegation to an officer of the rank of Commandant or higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest, without discussing the merits, that we should decide the question of whether this is in order or not at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is whether if a Lieutenant is sent out in charge of a party of men for the arrest of certain specific persons in circumstances that induce the scattering of his party and the acting of one or two soldiers separately, a private soldier in such a position must be regarded as a responsible officer for <Col N="211" /> the actual arrest and detention, even for a space of time, of the party he is sent out to look for.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can show that this refers only to a definition of powers and does not give any special powers to ordinary members of the military forces to partake in arrests, then the lines of the amendment would be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, A Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, that it is for you to decide definitely whether this is in order, and not if so-and-so is in order, &mdash;whether it is in fact within the Rules of Order that this amendment, or proposed amendment, which purports to do certain things, is in order at this stage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicOMaille" hpid="AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE Padraic Ó Máille">
      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The ruling I have to give on this matter is that this amendment, in my opinion, does not go outside the scope of the Bill, because it only gives power to a military force that is out to arrest a wanted person on the order of an officer.  If it comes the way of any member of that force, whether a private or not, to take this person into custody, this amendment would empower him to do so. Therefore it does not give, in my opinion, any additional powers to ordinary members of the military forces except when acting under the direct order of their officer.  The officer is responsible for the arrest of the person.  For this reason I rule that the amendment is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting your ruling regarding the amendment being within the scope of the Bill, I do not suggest that it is not within the scope of the Bill.  The point of order is whether, having passed certain sections dealing with the powers granted to certain people, namely responsible officers, we could then on the definition clause, No. 7, purport to define responsible officers.  If at that stage of the consideration of the Bill we may extend these powers to an entirely new set of persons, I ask whether it is in order at this stage to extend such powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this point?  We have already by a previous amendment to this clause extended the power given in the Bill to every member of a police force. Surely, therefore, if it were intended to extend these powers to every member of the Army, it would be within the <Col N="215" /> scope of the amendment to do so.  It does not give powers that are not granted elsewhere in the Bill, but merely gives powers granted in the Bill to a large number of people.  The definition clause could give them to every member of the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>It occurs to me that the conflict is between the words and the intention, and Deputy Johnson, I think, regards the words as going beyond the intention.  I suggest that it be altered to read in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;Detailed by the order of a person so empowered to arrest a particular person or particular persons, in which case every member of such force shall be deemed to be a responsible officer for the purposes of such arrest.&rdquo;  That, I think, confines the intention without extending, as Deputy Johnson fears, the powers and authority of members of the force.</P>

In its wisdom the Dáil inserted the words &ldquo;responsible officers who are to be empowered to arrest and detain.&rdquo; Surely it had some meaning when it inserted the adjective &ldquo;responsible.&rdquo;  It did not mean to extend the power to arrest and detain to any person who could be deemed to be responsible on any particular occasion.  The word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; was surely put in with an object. It was intended to confine these temporary powers that were being granted in these extraordinary circumstances, to certain people who were to be responsible officers.  Now we are asked to say that we did not mean responsible officers except in a few cases. Responsible officers are to be members of forces who may be privates or corporals or sergeants, or any other rank. Any person shall be deemed to be a responsible officer so long as he has an authorisation from somebody above his rank.  I am afraid in that amendment people will be covered after the fact. People may arrest individuals, and if they are proceeded against for such arrests illegally they will be covered and shielded, or may be covered and shielded, by some person who is in reality a responsible officer.  They would at least come within the intention of the Dáil in Section 2 by saying: &ldquo;Oh, yes, these men had authority from us.&rdquo;  There is no suggestion that the responsibility will be a written authority. That is the objection to No. 1. I ask the Dáil to read this amendment and to convince themselves that they understand what it means, if they can. The expression &ldquo;responsible officer&rdquo; means an officer not being below the <Col N="217" /> rank of Commandant.  That was the intention of the Minister for Home Affairs when he introduced the Bill, and when he got a Second Reading for it, and also when it went through Committee. But it is only on Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Report the Minister for Defence proceeds to define the definition and to say that the responsible officer may be a person in future below the rank of Commandant &ldquo;who may be specifically empowered in any particular case by the Ministry of Defence, to delegate his powers under this Act to any member of the military forces of Saorstát Eireann not below the rank of Sergeant.&rdquo;&ldquo;Who may be specifically empowered in any particular case to delegate his powers under this Act.&rdquo;  This does not convey the intention of the Minister for Defence when he spoke yesterday.  &ldquo;In any particular case&rdquo; surely means in the case of any particular offender. The Minister told us that he intended &ldquo;in any particular case&rdquo; would be the case of any particular officer.  That is not the intention, at least it is not the meaning set out here.  &ldquo;Who may be specifically empowered in any particular case by the Ministry of Defence to delegate his powers under this Act to any member of the military forces of Saorstát Eireann not below the rank of Sergeant, save and except in such cases (presumably those particular cases) where a military force has been detailed by the order of a person so empowered to arrest any person or persons in which case every member of such force shall be deemed to possess the powers granted by this Act.&rdquo;  What powers? The powers of arrest?  The powers of detention?  The powers of remission? The powers of setting up Appeals Councils?  The powers of issuing orders for release.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Dáil that if they read and examine it they will agree that it is liable to misconstruction, and that the powers granted by this Act may in certain circumstances be extended to every member of a force which has been detailed by a responsible officer to arrest.</P>
      <P>We all understand, I hope, the intentions, but I have been trying to persuade the Dáil that the amendment, as framed, does not secure the intention either of the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Home Affairs, or both. I argue that all the powers, that are sought for would be secured if this amendment stopped at the words &ldquo;persons.&rdquo; and that there would be less ambiguity.  But, as you have ruled that in a definition clause it is in order to extend certain powers to new people, we have to discuss it from the standpoint of its being in order.  I maintain that it is not good policy to extend powers of arrest to military forces beyond the powers they at present have under the ordinary law. A police officer could, under the ordinary law, call upon military forces to effect an arrest, and there is no necessity for any increased powers such are as outlined in this amendment.  The amendment empowers military forces to do things which it is not intended should be given to them and, even though we all agree with the intention, this amendment is so framed that it is liable to misinterpretation and misconstruction, and may include the granting of much wider powers to classes of men who should not receive those powers.  I therefore ask the Dáil to oppose the amendment.</P>

Article 22 of the Constitution reads:&mdash;&ldquo;All matters in each House shall, save as otherwise provided by this Constitution, be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present, other than the Chairman or Presiding Member, who shall have and exercise, a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes.&rdquo;  I ask your ruling, A Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, on that very important matter.</P>

The members on the Committee which drew them up, and members of the Dáil generally, will recollect that, if the ruling you are asked to give is accepted as the procedure of this House, on any day, when there is a small minority of members present, a motion may be brought forward to rescind Rules, Regulations and Standing Orders and pass Bills, or do anything which is within the competence <Col N="226" /> of the Dáil to do without notice, on the motion of a Minister or of a Member who may have a temporary majority to support him.

The second limb of Article 22 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;The number of members necessary to constitute a meeting of either House for the exercise of its powers shall be determined by its Standing Orders.&rdquo;  Therefore, if by the Standing Orders there is determined a sufficiently large and responsible quorum, then a simple majority would not involve such a danger.</P>

      <P>I submit that the proper interpretation of Standing Order 123 is the interpretation that must be made of any Standing Order or of any Clause or Act of Parliament, so long as the Constitution stands as the fundamental rule and the fundamental law.  The words of the Standing Order are: &ldquo;Provided that such motion has the support of the majority of the Teachtaí of the Dáil who are qualified to vote.&rdquo;  I direct attention to the words, &ldquo;who are qualified to vote.&rdquo;  I think, Sir, you have said that there are 105 Teachtaí qualified to vote.  Yes, there are 105 qualified to vote in so far as qualification consists in having subscribed the oath and taken a seat, but I submit there is a further qualification, <Col N="227" /> a qualification demanded by an Article of the Constitution to qualify for a vote, and that is that Teachtaí must be present here in their places and record their votes.  Consequently, there is a majority under Standing Order 123, and there is no necessity so to interpret it as to make it to be in conflict with the Constitution.</P>

      <P>As regards the arguments put forward by Deputy Johnson as to how a motion can be sprung on the Dáil by a Minister having a majority of members present for the time being, I think in a case of that kind, if there is anything in the motion that would infringe on the rights of a minority of members in the <Col N="228" /> House it would be obviously the duty of the Chairman or Speaker of the Dáil for the time being to rule that motion out of order; but I do not see that that arises in the present case, and as regards the point raised by Deputy Magennis, there could be two constructions put on the matter of who is qualified to vote, and that view put forward by Deputy Magennis was in my mind previous to giving any decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was postponed on Friday last at the request of Deputy Bryan Cooper to see what might be done in cases like this, where there is a possible conflict between the two Houses, and, at least, to let the conflict be properly defined.  I think in this case the dispute is not so much between the two Houses as really over the matters actually in dispute.  A Bill was introduced here of a non-contentious character, which was necessary to enable us to put more effective machinery into operation in dealing with one of the most important services in the State, namely, the franchise, and for the purpose of fixing the date for the compilation of the register.  When that Bill went to the Seanad an alteration <Col N="231" /> was made in the Local Government franchise, which, of course, changed the character of the Bill altogether.  I think I sent along to the Clerk a copy of a resolution which, I would suggest to the Dáil, it would be desirable to have considered and, if agreed upon, passed and have a copy sent to the Seanad.  In effect it comes to this, that a Committee of the Dáil should be appointed to confer with a Committee of the Seanad on this matter.  I have very little doubt, if such a Committee meets a Committee of the Seanad, this matter will be satisfactorily settled and the possibility of such conflict in the future will not easily arise, but if it does, machinery will be put in motion which will solve the problem.  I accordingly move the resolution.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed to Section 9 there is one matter&mdash;I do not know whether it is strictly a point of order, but it is a point affecting the procedure of this Dáil&mdash;which I want to raise in regard to this Bill.  On a certain day&mdash;I have not the dates handy here&mdash;we began to hear amendments on Section 8. A number of amendments had been tabled, and the first two had been considered.  It was then proposed from the Government Benches that the Bill should not be further proceeded with until after the Christmas vacation, and that other business should be taken on the following day, which was the last day before the adjournment. Some of us, not being very much interested in the automatic business for the following day, were not present on that day.  I was one of those, and had desired to speak to certain of the amendments that were to have been taken.  In spite of the fact that a Government pledge had been given on the preceding night that no further Sections of this Bill would be taken, the Government did the following day proceed to conclude the remaining amendments to that Section.  I think it is very regrettable that the Government should give a pledge on one night and then depart from it the following day.  I leave that at that.  The only point I now wish to put to you is, where do members stand who acted upon the security of that pledge in regard to certain questions that they wished to raise on the amendments that had been tabled which were not to have been considered on the day on which they were taken?</P>

      <P>The effect of this Section is that power is given to the Executive Council to distribute its services among certain Minister.  All <Col N="240" /> the Ministers that are created by this Dáil may have the Departments distributed to them which the Executive Council decides should be allocated to them.  I am putting it to you, sir, that no such provision can be allowed by you, because it is contrary to the Constitution. Under the provisions of the Constitution Ministers who are described as non-Executive Ministers and have sometimes been described as Extern Ministers, are directly responsible to the Dáil, not at all to the Executive Council.  Yet, this Section provides that the Executive Council, intervening between them and the Dáil, may distribute Departments to them. I suggest that that is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, and that Section 11 is <i>ultra vires</i> under the Constitution. I think it is a matter of some importance.</P>

      <P>I gather the Deputy is raising this as a point of order.  He did not quote any specific provision in the Constitution under which this is out of order.  In any event, I take it, it is inherent that the powers granted to the Dáil by the Constitution can be delegated by the Dáil; that the Dáil can transfer those powers to any person or persons whom they think fit&mdash;the Executive Council or anybody else, if they think fit to do so&mdash;by the act of passing this Bill.  I do not think there is any provision in the Constitution which precludes the Dáil from doing that.  I, therefore, rule that the Section is in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well. In that case it is only necessary to draw attention to what the real effect of this Section is.  The purport of this Section will be that every Minister who, under the Constitution, commended to this Dáil by the Ministry, holds a position that it was claimed would be independent of the Executive Council, would be under the direct responsibility of the Dáil, would not be governed by the party and political considerations that the Executive Council have got to accept, will really have interposed between himself and the Dáil the Executive Council, because the Executive Council will have the apportionment to such Minister of the various Departments. <Col N="241" /> The Executive Council may remove Departments from him, may add Departments to him.  It will be recollected by the Attorney-General that I was not exactly what might be described as an enthusiastic supporter of these peculiar provisions.  I believed that the result of these provisions under the Constitution would be that the Ministers who were then described as Extern Ministers and who now in legislation are described as non-Executive Ministers, would become subordinate Ministers, subordinate not to the Legislature directly, but subordinate to the Executive Council; that they would be digits on the Executive Council's hand.  That is exactly what is now happening, and the Ministry who recommended those very provisions are the very Ministry who are now bringing in this Bill with the intention of undoing the very arguments that they advanced then with such massive cogency and with such powerful learning.  That is a very remarkable result to have achieved.  In other words, either through munificence or through some other cause I cannot follow, they have gone out of their way to prove that every one of the arguments I then raised were correct arguments. They have fulfilled every one of my melancholy prognostications.</P>

      <P>May I point out, in the first place, that this Section, which deals purely with organisation, proposes that the Executive Council may effect certain re-organisations by Order, and that so far from withdrawing such re-organisation from the control of the Dáil, a later Section provides that such Order shall be laid on the table of the Dáil, and may be rendered null and void by a resolution of the Dáil.  Moreover, it will be observed that at the end of Sub-section (1) of section 11, there is a proviso which should relieve the anxiety of the Deputy.  &ldquo;Provided, however, that in the case of any Department of State, the Minister in charge of which is not, for the time being, a member of the Executive Council, no such Order shall be made without the concurrence of such Minister first obtained.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Deputy says that this is phrased with the intention of undoing <Col N="242" /> the Constitution, I hope he does not use his words recklessly in attributing intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did say was that this result will be achieved.  Let me read Article 56 of the Constitution, and it is really a matter of some moment, because it does affect the real independence of non-Executive Ministers, whether they are to be directly responsible to the Dáil or not; whether they are to be, as originally intended, really independent or not.  Article 56 reads, &ldquo;Every Minister who is not a member of the Executive Council shall be the responsible head of the Department or Departments under his charge, and shall be individually responsible to Dáil Eireann alone for the administration of the Department or Departments of which he is the head.&rdquo;  Now this Bill comes along.  If the Executive Council thinks that one of the Departments is not being properly administered, or is not being administered to its liking, by the Minister in charge, and supposing that Department is not being administered to the liking of the Dáil, it may, by Order, remove that Department from his control, and pass it to the control of an Executive Minister.  All that is required, under the provision to which the Attorney-General draws my attention, and which does not at all effect what he says it does effect, with all deference to him, is not the consent of the Dáil, which has to go through a very formal procedure in order to effect it in agreement with the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Very well, I accept the correction.  But in any case what I was coming to, is that all that is required is that they require the consent of the Minister in question; but the fact, nevertheless, is that somewhere outside of the Dáil the Executive Council have interposed, by this Section, between the responsibility of the Minister to the Dáil and the Dáil, to which he is supposed to be directly responsible, just as though, according to the Constitution, no such thing as an <Col N="243" /> Executive Council existed.  These are the arguments that were brought forward in the first instance.  I wish to draw attention to the fact that the very parts that aroused such contention at the time, and which were advocated by the Minister at the time, are now being turned aside from, because they have proved unworkable.  I am not alone in these views.  There are certain members of the Minister's own Party who are equally agitated about it, who also believe that this matter is contrary to the real meaning of the Constitution, and who were advocates of these provisions at the time.  I do not notice them in the Dáil at present, but that, of course, cannot be helped. The fact, nevertheless, is that this Section does vitally affect the real independence of non-Executive Ministers, and it does vitally affect the intention of the Constitution, that they should be individually and severally responsible to the Dáil, quite apart from the existence and functioning of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>To insert immediately before Section 16 a new Section as follows:</P>
      <P>Wherever any statutory board of commissioners or other statutory or public board or body or public authority is by any existing law required to present any annual or other report to the Lord Lieutenant or to Parliament or to any Parliamentary head of any Department of State, every such report shall after the passing of this Act be presented in the first instance to the Minister who is head of the Department of State for the time being concerned with the services or functions of such board, body, or authority, and if such Minister be for the time being an Executive Minister he shall present the report to the Executive Council, which shall cause the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, but if such Minister be not for the time being an Executive Minister he shall himself cause the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It may be remembered that some short time ago Deputy Johnson called attention to the matter of the presentation of a report by one of the non-Executive Ministers, and the question was raised then as to the position where reports are required by Statute to be presented, whether they should be presented to the Executive Council or direct to the Dáil.  Difficulties had arisen, as there are a great number of Statutes under which various Departments and officials are required to present reports.  In some cases under old Statutes they are required to present them to the Lord Lieutenant and in others to Parliament.  This proposed new Section is to fix the procedure for the future.</P>

      <P>As the Dáil will see, the object of the amendment is that the College of Science should be retained under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture, and not placed, as indicated in the Bill, under the Minister for Education. It is my opinion, as this country is predominantly agricultural, scientific education should be retained under the control of the Department of Agriculture.  We know it has been so in the past, and it is very important that an agricultural bias should be given to all the teaching in the College of Science.  I cannot see any good reason why the accepted order of affairs should be changed, and the College of Science transferred to the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy's amendment to transfer the College of Science from the Minister for Education to the Minister for Agriculture, is in pursuance of that policy of the Farmers' Party, which we have recently learned, namely, to exclude anything in the nature of intellectualism from the pursuit of agriculture.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture, who is unfortunately unwell, is not here, nor is the other of the same clan who has voiced that particular policy recently.  The College of Science has seemed to the Ministry to fall naturally within the scope both as a college and from the point of view of science, of the Ministry of Education. It is not limited in any sense to agriculture, but in pursuance of what we hope will be the policy in future of the coordination of education with, presumably, that agricultural bias it will derive from the character of the country, I believe that the College would be appropriately placed under the Minister for Education.  The amendment cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am still not convinced and not satisfied that any good case has been proved why this great change should be made. As I understand, three-quarters, or perhaps a larger proportion of the scientific work of the college, is connected with agriculture.  We are constantly hearing it reiterated from day to day by Ministers and others, that agriculture is our predominant industry, and I am not satisfied that under the Ministry of Education, which, we have reason to think, would be largely composed of intellectuals, scientific agriculture would be safe.  I am of opinion that under the Ministry for Agriculture, which is not composed of intellectuals, and whose Minister&mdash; at least I have read&mdash;has openly declared himself to be a materialist, the College of Science would be better placed.  I do not know whether it is possible to be a materialist and an intellectualist at the same time.  I maintain, however, that the College of Science should be under the materialist Department of Agriculture rather than under the intellectual Ministry of Education.</P>

I am advised in this matter by those who have brought it to my attention and who are concerned, that there would be complications if there was no repeal Schedule.

      <P>The Deputy did mention the matter before, and I have carefully considered it, and I have come to the conclusion that in a Bill of this character a Repeal Section would hardly be feasible.  If it were to be complete it would involve a certain amount of research and with considerable modifications here and there. The normal course, in a matter of this kind, is that at some date we will commence the passing of Statute Law Remission Acts.  These are Acts in which one collects Statutes that have become obsolete or that have become repealed by implication, and they are considered from that point of view, and I should think that in the course of the present session we shall have to trouble the House with a Revision Bill dealing with these consequential repeals.  It seems to me that that would be the better way to deal with it.</P>

    <P>I think very few Deputies will question the advisability of initiating at the very earliest moment a discussion upon the issues raised in this motion.  The Report of the Fiscal Inquiry Committee was tabled the last day that this assembly met prior to the Christmas adjournment.  It has, in the interval, I understand been circulated to Deputies.  I trust that most, if not all of them, have carefully read and scrutinised this Report, and that this <Col N="251" /> discussion will elicit what impressions they have formed upon it.  But whether these impressions are favourable to the Report or otherwise I think there will be general agreement with the contention that the data provided by this Report are completely inadequate for a basis of fiscal policy in this country. A wider and a fuller grasp of the factors that enter into this matter will have to be secured before anything approximating to a permanent conclusion can be arrived at as to what is to be the fiscal policy or the fiscal system under which this State can progressively exist.  Therefore, I think that the publication of this Report is a good thing, inasmuch as it helps to clear the air and indicates somewhat definitely the direction in which certain economic influences in this State are tending.  I wish to suggest that that direction is not satisfactory, not one that makes either for national health or economic stability, but one fraught with serious danger to the future of the State.</P>
    <P>I have read this report several times carefully, paragraph by paragraph, and it appears to me to be inadequate, or incomplete in its survey, inaccurate in its premises and misleading, sometimes malignantly misleading, in its conclusions. The limitations of the Terms of Reference of the Committee cannot be pleaded as being responsible for its main defects, for the Committee appear to have imposed upon themselves voluntarily certain limitations unwarranted by their instructions.  These limitations exclude essential matters to such an inquiry, and have practically rendered abortive the labours of the Committee.  Here are the Terms of Reference:&mdash;&ldquo;To investigate and report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) as to the effect of the existing fiscal system, and of any measures regulating or restricting imports or exports on industry and agriculture in the Saorstát, and</P>
    <P>(b) as to the effect of any changes therein intended to foster the development of industry and agriculture with due regard to the interests <Col N="252" /> of the general community and to the economic relations of the Saorstát with other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such are its Terms of Reference, but a perusal of the report would almost convince one, unaware of its Terms of Reference, that the Committee was instructed to investigate and report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) as to how best to inspire contempt for existing industrial enterprise in the Saorstát, and</P>
    <P>(b) as to how to discourage any further effort to prevent Ireland from fulfilling the prophecy of a certain English nobleman when he spoke of this country as being destined to be the fruitful mother of flocks and herds to feed the industrial workers of Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as I have been able to glean a coherent impression from this report, the manufacturers, business men and industrialists of the Saorstát have been placed in the dock, and indicted as a set of incompetents whose incapacity is the primary cause of our lack of industrial progress.  Scattered through about a dozen paragraphs of this report, are reflections upon these men engaged in these enterprises, which while being utterly irrelevant to the inquiry, may possibly at the same time have the effect of lowering public opinion in Ireland and elsewhere as to the merits of our native products.  I do not wish to suggest that was the object of the Committee, but the kind of comment in this direction in which our professors on this Committee have indulged, seems to me to be like saying to a drowning man: &ldquo;We are very sorry for you, but really your predicament is entirely your own fault.  If you had only learned to become an expert swimmer you would have a much better chance of surviving, but as you did not do so we think it would be most unfair to charge the public purse with the cost of throwing a lifebuoy to save you.&rdquo;  Perhaps the insinuation which will be most resented by Irish manufacturers is the one which is a reflection on their probity, as contained in paragraph 101, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" />&ldquo;There is the further possibility that the secure possession of the home market may lead to the lowering of the standard of the article produced, which even if the normal price remained unaltered, would be equally injurious to the consumer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have the imputation, not merely of incapacity, but of gross dishonesty. One would think that this Committee had been appointed to inquire into the morals of our manufacturers instead of into matters appertaining to the economic welfare of the country.  It is true that in certain paragraphs of the report the difficulties that face Irish manufacturers have been duly noted in passing, but only to be brushed aside in later passages as so many irrelevancies&mdash;where the men who have steadfastly borne the brunt of financial and other embarrassments in the interests of Irish industry, where the men who were entitled to look for some consideration and some sympathy, have been offered cynical homilies on their own shortcomings.  The Committee in its superior wisdom, or rather, self-complacent ignorance of realities, seem to suggest that the value to the State of industry is to be measured, not by its services or potential services to the nation, but by its capacity to face alone and unaided the strongly entrenched interests of other nations. They seem to have overlooked one great truth which indeed has been overlooked by many others similarly engaged like them in trying to galvanise the dry bones of Adam Smith's philosophy into life again, the truth enunciated by Frederick List when he said, &ldquo;Between each individual and entire humanity there stands the nation.&rdquo;  But the entity of the nation has found no place in the pages of this report, or in the consideration of its authors.  There appears to be no conception of the fact that all captains of industry are of value to the State, or that healthy and solvent industries are not only assets to the State, but essential if the State is to make economic progress.  Rather one gets the impression, reading through the sorrowful mysteries of the five professors, that our manufacturers are regarded as so many parasites who <Col N="254" /> wish to prey upon the public purse, and these gentlemen of the Committee regard themselves ordained by Providence to stand between them and their fell design.  Now, in this connection the Committee would have been very well advised to have pondered a little further certain declarations of one great man who walks no more amongst us, the late Arthur Griffith.</P>
    <P>This is what he said: &ldquo;We must clear the minds of the Irish people of the pernicious idea that they are not entitled or called upon to give preferential aid to the manufacturing industries of their own country.&rdquo;  If that idea were not met and combatted there would be an end to all hope of the development of the Irish manufacturing arm.  We must offer our producers protection where protection is necessary, and let it be clearly understood what protection is.  Protection does not mean the exclusion of foreign competition. It means rendering the native manufacturer equal to meeting foreign competition.  It does not mean that we shall pay a higher profit to the Irish manufacturer, but that we must not stand by and see him crushed by the mere weight of foreign capital.  If an Irish manufacturer cannot produce an article as cheaply as an English or other foreigner, only because his competitor has larger resources at his disposal, then it is the first duty of the Irish nation to accord protection to the Irish manufacturer.  If, on the other hand, an Irish manufacturer can produce as cheaply but charges an enhanced price, such a man deserves no support&mdash;he is, in plain words, a swindler.  It is contrary to the principles of protection and the interests of the community that a manufacturer in Ireland who can produce as cheaply as his foreign competitors should receive an enhanced price.  The movement is one to give Ireland back her manufacturing arm, not to make fortunes for dishonest manufacturers. I now come to what I have described as the limitations which the members of the Committee imposed upon their inquiries, but on second thoughts that seems to me to be rather an inaccurate way of alluding to these limitations. Further consideration leads me to the <Col N="255" /> belief that in this regard it was not so much a matter of limiting the scope of their investigations, as a lack of understanding of what really entered into such an inquiry which accounts for the strange inadequacy of this report.</P>
    <P>There are certain fundamental factors which must be fully explored and considered in any satisfactory investigation into tariffs.  Among such factors the following may be cited as obvious:&mdash;(1) The country's tariff policy in the past, and the effects of this policy upon its economic welfare; (2) the character of the foreign trade (i.e., whether the imports and exports are predominantly food stuffs and raw materials, or predominantly manufactured goods); (3) the increase or decrease of population in the recent past; (4) the state of employment; (5) the tariff policies of other countries, the motives underlying them, and the results achieved; (6) in the case of a country inexperienced in the framing of tariffs, the analogy, or lack of analogy, between its economic circumstances and those of other countries, and how far such a comparison would be held to justify the limitation of, or a departure from, the tariff policies of such other countries.  In regard to each and every one of those fundamental considerations the report is silent.  These things are vital and essential to any understanding of a tariff system, and in each and every one of them this report of five professors is silent.  I propose, in the first instance, to touch briefly upon these sins of omission and then to examine and criticise the report.</P>
    <P>Taken as an isolated fact, I would not feel disposed to attach undue importance to the omission from the report of any reference to the historical aspect of our tariff problem, how Irish industries were destroyed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by means of penal legislation passed by the British Parliament, how they rapidly revived towards the end of the eighteenth century as a result of the protective policy of Grattan's Parliament, only to fall again into ruin and decay after the passing of the Act of Union, especially after the establishment of <Col N="256" /> complete free trade between Great Britain and Ireland, and also how they have languished and died throughout the whole period of the Union.  The Committee might have been excused for ignoring these phases of Irish economic history on the ground that a substantial proportion of the Irish public might be presumed to be well informed in regard to them and could appreciate their bearing upon the question of tariff policy; but when I find that other more important but little known factors falling within the scope of the inquiry are similarly passed over, I say that the omission in the present instance possesses a certain sinister significance. Moreover, on the face of it, this report contains no evidence whatever that the reactions of the political history of the country upon its economic development, or rather upon its economic retrogression, received any consideration at the hands of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Now, as to the character of the import and export trade of this country, there is no country on earth for the given area and population, which exports so large a quantity of food-stuffs and animal raw materials, and imports so large a quantity of manufactured goods as does An Saorstát. The food stuffs and raw material in question are not the products of tillage cultivation to any large extent; they consist mainly of cattle, sheep, and butter, the products almost entirely of grass.  These food stuffs, therefore, are produced with the minimum expenditure of human labour and at a maximum wastage consistently with the existence of agriculture in any form in the country.  On the other hand, upon examining the items imported from abroad, it will be found that, apart from wheat, flour and coal, they consist of articles such as apparel of all kinds, boots, furniture, motor cars, and so forth&mdash;highly manufactured and luxury products&mdash;the value of which is almost wholly attributable to the labour employed in their manufacture.  The official figures showing the quantities and values of the different articles imported and exported will be found in the report on &ldquo;Trade, Exports and Imports at Irish Ports for 1921,&rdquo; and in the companion <Col N="257" /> publications of previous years compiled by the Department of Agriculture. Were we to buy from Great Britain, the whole supply of the articles which she manufactures from the raw material and by-products obtained from the cattle and sheep which we export to that country, such as boots, shoes, leather goods, soap, textiles, combs, buttons, glue, brushes, clothing, etc., it would be found that the value of those articles would equal, or perhaps exceed, that of our total exports of cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the mountains of meat derived from those animals, ignoring for a moment the wasteful manner in which the country's resources are squandered in the raising of meat, constitute a free gift to Britain, in return for which she is pleased to keep a large portion of her population engaged in working up manufactures, and her mercantile marine engaged in carrying exports and imports.  Never in the whole history of mankind has there been a more ruthless squandering of a country's natural resources as is here exemplified.  One searches this Report for some glimmer of light upon this tremendous fundamental consideration, the very pith and marrow of a nation's claim for a tariff policy.  One searches for some glimmer of light upon that, but one searches in vain.  That was an aspect the Committee did not think worth while considering.  Next, one wonders whether employment and emigration are phenomena which are peculiar to any food exporting country except Ireland.  As examples of countries exporting food, one thinks of Australia, New Zealand, the Argentine, the United States and Canada.  These are all protectionist countries, and, as is well known, there has not yet been an unemployment problem of sufficient dimensions in them to necessitate emigration.  On the contrary, there has been continuous immigration into all the countries mentioned. On the Continent of Europe there are a few food exporting countries&mdash;Russia (before 1914), Denmark, Bulgaria, Roumania and Hungary.  All those countries are protectionist to a greater or lesser degree, and in each the population has increased enormously during the past 70 or 80 years. These countries, moreover, export the <Col N="258" /> products of their tillage in contra-distinction to Ireland, which exports the far more wasteful products of grass.</P>
    <P>Every food-exporting country in the world, with the single exception of Ireland, is protectionist.  Why?  Every food-exporting country in the world, except Ireland, has increased her population during the last 70 or 80 years. Why?  I return to this Report under discussion for some little light upon this pregnant question, but again in vain.  Does there exist in this country at the present moment an unemployment problem, and has such problem existed in the past?  If so, what are its dimensions, and what is its annual cost to the National Exchequer; and, secondly, to the family income of every bread-winner in the country who has to provide food, clothing and house for himself and family, and for one or more dependent relatives unable to find employment?  What is the extent of the economic wastage involved in feeding and clothing, up to the age of manhood, all the young men and women who have emigrated from our shores during the last 70 or 80 years?  What is the effect on the cost of living of this drain upon the nation's human resources? Has anyone the hardihood to suggest that these questions are not strictly relevant and pertinent to an inquiry into our tariffs?  What is one to think of a Committee, specially constituted to inquire into the existing fiscal system of Saorstát Eireann, and as to the effect of any changes therein, intended to foster the development of industry and agriculture, which, after a lengthened investigation, has failed to provide an answer to any one of those questions, and seemingly has not deemed it necessary even to consider them?  The State, like ourselves, in seeking to frame a tariff policy, would naturally look for guidance to the example of other countries, notably those countries presenting economic features analagous to those already touched upon as existing here&mdash;if, indeed, any other country in the world has been so unfortunate as to find itself thus circumstanced.</P>
    <P>Why has no country in the world followed the example of Britain in opening, and keeping open its doors to free trade?  Why has free trade at <Col N="259" /> least in the past been admittedly a boon to Great Britain, and if it has been a boon to her, why has it not been a boon to every other nation?  Is the inference justified that economic wisdom has centred alone in the statesmen of Great Britain, and that the statesmen of the rest of the world, in pursuing the policy of protection, have made a blunder?  As I hope to demonstrate later on, the Commission has arrived at many amazing conclusions by short cuts, but I venture to say that even they would draw the line at broadly stating that the statesmen of the world, with the exception of those of Britain, were fools.  In what respect is there a divergency between the economic circumstances of the Saorstát and those of protectionist countries, and at the same time an analogy between the Saorstát and Great Britain which justifies our adhering to the tariff policy of the latter country?  It ought to be unnecessary for me to point out that this newly risen State of ours in the matter of tariffs cannot remain indifferent to the example of other countries whose economic circumstances more closely resemble those prevailing here than do those of Britain. The world is rich in experience in regard to tariffs.  The world is rich in experiences, of those things.  Why has no information concerning that experience been conveyed by this report to the Irish Government, and the Irish people?  If protection is a mistaken policy for statesmen to pursue, there must be some one or two countries of the many protectionist countries in the world where protection has brought injury or, perhaps, disaster.  If so, where are those countries and what is the extent of the injury done?  One searches the report in vain for an answer to any of those questions.  I will not further occupy the time of the Dáil by a recital of all the sins of omission that can be charged against the Report.  To exhaust such a category would be a labour, not of hours, but of weeks.  I think I have sufficiently indicated the extent and the overwhelming importance of those omissions to place the report in a clearer and truer perspective for the <Col N="260" /> purpose of the critical examination to which I now propose to submit it.</P>
    <P>A document upon the question of tariffs which omits any reference to the consideration of the factors to which I have drawn attention, must necessarily be defective fundamentally, and, therefore, I claim that in examining and discussing the different positive features of the Report I am dealing with what are, in the main, either subordinate or irrelevant points of controversy in the issue. In its final and only important Report the Committee was careful not to make recommendations or to adduce findings. It interpreted its duty to be the narrow one of examining from the economical standpoint the results to be anticipated from a system of protective tariffs, and it proceeded by special pleading, by suggestion and innuendo, by palpably false inferences, and by lopsided inferences, from inadequate premises, to construct the most blatant piece of Cobdenite propaganda that our generation has witnessed.</P>
    <P>The following are some of the objections urged by the Committee against the application of protective tariffs here:&mdash;(1) They lead to no permanent expansion of industry or permanent increase of employment.  (2) They increase the cost of living.  (3) They increase wages.  (4) They increase prices. (5) They provide no remedy against dumping.  (6) They hamper agriculture. (7) They are difficult to construct and difficult to administer, and they raise uncertainty as to their duration.</P>
    <P>I will take all those foregoing objections in the order set forth above.  It seems almost superfluous to have to disprove the Committee's contention that protective tariffs lead to no permanent expansion of industry because the mass of evidence to the contrary is overwhelming. However, as this Dáil and the Irish public have had very little opportunity of observing first hand or of studying the effects of protective tariffs in this respect, I propose to discuss the point in some detail.</P>
    <P>The well-known English economist, Mr. John A. Hobson, than whom there is no more robust free-trader, is responsible for the following statement in one of his most recent publications, &ldquo;The <Col N="261" /> Evolution of Modern Capitalism,&rdquo; page 100:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be generally admitted that English industries would not have advanced so rapidly without protection, but as we built up our manufacturing industries by protection, so we undoubtedly conserved and strengthened them by free trade; first by the remission of tariffs upon the raw material of manufacture and machine-making, and later on by the free admission of food-stuffs which were a prime essential to a nation descending to specialised manufacture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I next quote certain particulars showing the comparative rate of economic developments of the two Australian States of Victoria and New South Wales from the year 1870, when protection was adopted in the former colony, to 1903, the year after the Commonwealth tariff had extended protection to New South Wales and given an immediate and immense impetus to the manufacturing industries of that State. These particulars are taken from a work published in Melbourne and London in 1908, entitled &ldquo;David Syme, The Father of Protection in Australia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From its inception up to 1870 the colony of Victoria had run an uninterrupted course of free trade.  Free imports had prohibited the possibility of industrial expansion.  Several manufactures had been started by enterprising spirits but the importers had strangled them at their birth.  The importers were bringing in foreign made goods and foodstuffs to the value of £15,000,000 a year in exchange for Victorian gold, wool, timber, and tallow.  In the years 1855-59 more than 45,000 persons had emigrated from Victoria, owing to the lack of means of industrial employment.  Cobdenism was the established fiscal policy.  No voice had ever been raised against it.  No one dreamed of questioning it.  A free trade historian of these times, Mr. Henry Giles Turner, in his &ldquo;History of Victoria,&rdquo; states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the early sixties no educated man would have cared to pose as an advocate of protection</P>
    <P>(they were all like our professors).</P>
    <P>If they thought about it at all it was as a gloomy memory of <Col N="262" /> desperate times in the old land where its monopolistic tendencies drove the labouring classes to the verge of revolution, where it was a synonym of the most hateful form of oppression of the capitalist and was broken down and routed by the Parliamentary champions of the workingman.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such was the outlook of the situation when protection was first mooted in Victoria.  The proposal met with cries similar to those which are voiced in Ireland to-day.  Protection, the importers asserted, was a drag, a burden, a fraud; slavery and robbery.  The people were warned that the doctrine was intended to tax the entire community for the benefit of the few manufacturers whom protection might encourage into a febrile industrial existence.  I think we have heard something very like that recently from the mouths of our professors.  The end of the struggle was, however, that a protectionist tariff was adopted with the result of an increase of social comfort, education, population, agricultural and industrial development and wealth, while the cost of living remained lower in that State of Victoria than in the neighbouring free trade State of New South Wales.  Official figures and statistics substantiating every one of these assertions can be found in the volume I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Now I come back home again.  We have an example of the efficiency of protection in the matter of stimulating industries nearer home in the fact well known to everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the beginning that the statement I have prepared was made up after very serious consideration, as I am discharging a very serious duty.  It is perfectly clear, and I think it will be gathered from the nature of the remarks I have made so far, that it is physically impossible for anyone to <Col N="263" /> memorise a statement like this, and that it is essential that a certain amount of latitude, or indulgence if you like, should be allowed in reference to notes.  Even our Professors are aware that there have been certain tobacco industries started in Ireland recently. No less than three new tobacco factories have started in the Saorstát as a result of the protection to the tobacco industry by the regulations which came into operation on the 1st April last.  What has happened in the case of the tobacco firms is only typical of what is happening throughout the world in all protectionist countries. The Dunlop firm has found itself compelled to get inside tariff barriers by establishing tyre factories in various foreign countries.  The establishment of the Ford factory at Cork was due to the protection afforded to the motor manufacturing industry in the United Kingdom by the Finance Act of 1915. It is quite easy, but I think quite unnecessary, to extend almost indefinitely the list of concrete examples which one and all dispose of the contention of the Committee, that tariffs do not provide any permanent stimulus to manufacturing industries.  The Committee seems to take advantage of the comparative ignorance of the Irish public&mdash;a pardonable ignorance in view of the circumstances of our history &mdash;upon this question, to palm off upon them this brazen propaganda. It follows naturally if, as I have shown, protection leads to expansion of industry, it must lead to increased employment. The Committee's contention, however, is otherwise.  The statement of its views on these points contained in paragraph 120 is quoted in full, first because it is the nearest approach to a definite conclusion to be found in the Report, and secondly, because it serves to illustrate the capacity of the men selected to advise the Government and the people upon the question of tariffs. It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The argument frequently urged in favour of protective tariffs is that an increase in the number of persons employed will result.  Assuming that this will be so as regards the protected industries, the immediate effect <Col N="264" /> of the tariff upon employment will be different if it be imposed in normal times from that which it will be if imposed during periods of depression. In the first place, the increased employment in the industries concerned can only be obtained by withdrawing labour either from agriculture or from other existing industries. The ultimate, as distinct from the immediate, effect of this will be not to increase the total amount of employment but to re-distribute the labour power of the country.  In other words, a temporary increase of employment may result from the absorption of unemployed workers caused by the increased demand for labour in the protected industries, but once the temporary employment is thus brought to an end, any further change will again be nothing more than a redistribution of labour power.  Again, when prices of articles rise in consequence of the imposition of a tariff, the amount of purchasing power available for other purposes is decreased to the same extent.  This decrease, resulting in a falling off in demand for these and other articles, will lead eventually to a decrease in the total amount of labour required, and, therefore, to renewed unemployment.</P>
    <P>That is the statement of the Professors. I wonder do they themselves understand what it really means? Clearly if any coherent meaning at all is to be attached to the foregoing statement, this can only be done by assuming that the Committee had in its mind the circumstances of a country totally unlike ours, where population was stationary, and where emigration did not exist.  In so far as the conclusions of the Committee purport to have relevancy to the conditions prevailing here, they are obviously the very embodiment of inconsequence and futility.  How can the Committee reconcile its peculiar views as to the inability of protective tariffs to promote employment with the known facts, that at the present time unemployment is practically non-existent in protectionist countries, while in the free trade countries of Great Britain and Ireland it is rampant?  In protectionist France unemployment is nil.  In <Col N="265" /> protectionist Belgium unemployment amounts to three-fifths of one per cent. of the working people.  The corresponding percentage in free trade Britain is 12, and in our own free trade country it is probably still higher.</P>
    <P>I come to the question of whether tariffs increase the cost of living, prices and wages.  It is greatly to be regretted that the Committee in its observations regarding the effects of protective tariffs upon the cost of living should consider as adequate for the information of the general public the mere statement of a conclusion without any attempt to prove it.  I have had before me the Report of the cost of living in the Saorstát, published in August, 1922. In it I find a table showing the actual proportions of expenditure by the average wage-earning household on the various commodities that make up the family budget of such a household.  Out of every 100/- spent altogether, food accounts for 57/-; clothing, 17/6; rent, 5/6; fuel and light, 7/-; sundries, including tobacco and cigarettes, 13/-. Of the food items tea, sugar and jam, which are dutiable articles, account for an expenditure of over 0/-, and the amount of duty included in this expenditure would be approximately 2/6. All the tea, sugar, and a great proportion of the jam consumed in this country are imported, as is also the great bulk of the clothing figuring in the budget&mdash;how much exactly it is impossible to say.</P>
    <P>Would the cost of living, or in other words, the expenditure upon the family budget, be increased if the duty of 2/6 on tea and sugar and jam were abolished, and a corresponding amount placed upon imported clothing? Obviously not, and the Committee, apparently realising that such was the case, seem to have attempted to conceal the fact by introducing into paragraph 100 of its Report a number of irrelevant considerations about what would happen to the revenue if the duties now levied upon tea and sugar were transferred to manufactured and luxury articles imported.  Our imports of clothing, boots and shoes, are so considerable that even a small ad valorem tariff upon these items alone would realise as much revenue as is at <Col N="266" /> present obtained from tea and sugar. Moreover, such a transference of import duties would obviously stimulate the establishment and the growth of a large number of manufacturing industries here and increase employment. Thus would be brought about, gradually, perhaps, but steadily, an increase in population, in houses, in factories and so forth.  New sources of revenue would be created by the development indicated, whilst at the same time the Exchequer would be relieved of many of the burdens cast upon it as a result of the unemployment now prevalent. The Committee is quite quick to point out the imaginary danger to the revenue from a transference of duties such as has been indicated, but it is careful to ignore the advantages to the Exchequer and to the country's welfare which would have been reaped in numerous other directions by the time our imports of clothing had been reduced to the point where it could no longer provide any considerable revenue, no matter how high the rate of import duty imposed, and accordingly our own clothing manufacture had developed to the extent necessary to supply our own requirements.  When the Committee wants to prove, as in paragraph 108, that a protective tariff would provide a diminishing revenue it has no hesitation in admitting that the tariff would fulfil the intention for which it was imposed, which would, of course, be primarily to increase employment, but the Committee, in paragraph 120, is equally happy at proving that a protective tariff would not increase employment.  It is merely the old story of the showman over again: &ldquo;You pays your money, and you takes your choice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have advanced the foregoing very exact demonstration, based upon official figures, that a protective tariff would not increase, but on the contrary would tend to decrease the cost of living.  This conclusion is also supported by ample testimony from the actual experiences of protectionist countries.  The great German economist, Frederick List, in his well-known work on national economics, published 80 years ago, in alluding to the then recently acquired experience of Germany <Col N="267" /> in regard to the effects of its particular tariffs, wrote as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The doctrine was taught from a hundred professional chairs that nations could only attain to wealth and power by means of universal free trade.  Thus it was then, but how is it now?  Germany has advanced in prosperity and industry, in national self-respect and in national power in the course of ten years as much as in a century, and how has this result been achieved? It was especially the protection which the tariff of Zollverein secured to manufactured articles of common use which has wrought this miracle. What has been the operation of these protective duties?  Are the consumers paying for their German manufactured goods twenty to sixty per cent. more than they formerly paid for foreign ones (as must be the case if the popular theory is correct), or are these goods at all worse than the foreign ones?  Nothing of the sort.  Doctor Bowring himself adduces testimony that the manufactured goods produced under the high customs tariff are both better and cheaper than the foreign ones (and the, I may say in passing, Doctor Bowring referred to was an agent of British Board of Trade sent on a mission to Germany for the purpose of securing tariff concessions in the interest of British manufacture). The internal combination and the security from destructive competition by the foreigner has wrought this miracle of which the popular school knows nothing and is determined to know nothing.  Thus that is not true, which the popular school maintains, that a protective duty increases the price of the goods of home production by the amount of protective duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The popular school to which List alludes was nothing more or less than the body of professors of Free Trade economics, who, seemingly, were as energetic in their propaganda in List's day as they are now.  In the meantime they seem to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.  The similarity between <Col N="268" /> the arguments quoted by List as to the effect of Protection in increasing prices, and these to be found in the Report presently under discussion is, to say the least, striking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole history of Protectionist Germany since List's time constitutes a complete refutation of the claim that Protection increases the cost of living.  It cannot be shown that the cost of living has been higher there at any time during all that period than it has been in Free Trade England. On the contrary, the fact is notorious, and doubtless within the knowledge and cognisance of everyone in the Dáil, that the cost of living is lower to-day in all the Protectionist countries in Continental Europe than it is in our own Free Trade country.</P>
      <P>Lest anything should still be wanting in the refutation of the Cobdenite claim that Protection increases the cost of living, I quote the following figures, compiled by Mr. T.A. Coughlan, onetime Government statistician to the Government of New South Wales, and himself a Free Trader.  He shows that in the year 1903 as much of all the items entering into the cost of living could be obtained for an expenditure of £36 19s. 5d. in the Protectionist States of Australia as could be obtained for the sum of £39 14s. 11d. in the then Free Trade State of New South Wales, and the author of the book that I referred to some time ago proceeds: &ldquo;Than this there could not be a more triumphant vindication of the policy of Protection.&rdquo;  Mr. Coughlan, the Cobdenist statistician of the Free Trade State, first admits that the standard of living is the same in all the States of Australia, and then he confesses (to the confusion of the economic doctrine he holds) that under Free Trade the people of New South Wales consumed less food, less drink and lodge in worse houses than the citizens of the Protectionist States; that it cost them 19s. 3d. per head more for their food, 4s. 6d. per head more for their drink, and 1s. 1d. more for their charity and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures prove beyond dispute <Col N="269" /> that while the standard of living is equal throughout Australia, the cost of that standard was less by £2 15s. 6d. under Protection than under Free Trade, and that the New South Wales housefather was taxed to that amount for the privilege of living under an importing regime rather than buy the products of his own fellow-citizens.  Small wonder, then, that New South Wales saw the error of its policy and later on fell in with the Protection regime of the Commonwealth of the period I am referring to.  In 1895 a board of public experts examined the whole protection system of Victoria and made a report to the Government, from which I quote the following extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the vexed question as to whether goods have been made dearer or cheaper by the imposition of protective duties, we have a deal of evidence.  It is an established fact that such goods are, as a rule, cheaper to the public than they were before the imposition of such duties. Many instances have been brought under our notice where the establishment of a local factory has at once brought down the prices of the articles produced in a remarkable degree. All calculations based upon the price at which goods could be sold if the import duties were not restricted, if the import trade were not restricted or prohibited by duties, are valueless in face of the direct evidence before us that when such duties are not imposed the goods are not sold at the anticipated low prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>More recent testimony is available on this matter.  Representative W.R. Green, of Iowa, Acting Chairman of the United States Government Ways and Means Committee, is reported to have said the other day that the Fordney Tariff Law which became operative in the United States in September, 1922, is</P>
    <P>&ldquo;bringing in revenue at the rate of 500,000,000 dollars a year, as compared with 300,000,000 dollars under the former Act; besides which the present large volume of employment in American industries and the activity of American industries may be attributed to the measure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> Mr. Green expresses the opinion that the Fordney Tariff is so satisfactory that the Government will not propose to alter it, save in one or two minor details. He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Free Traders told us that the Fordney Tariff would damage America's Foreign Trade, and they assert that even a milder tariff would ruin our external trade and shipping. But the report of the United States Shipping Department for October states that there was a favourable trade balance of 99,000,000 dollars for that month, compared with 95,000,000 dollars for October, 1922, and it goes on to record that for the 10 months ended with October, 1923, the country's exports were valued at 300,340,000,000 dollars, an increase of 235,000,000 dollars for the corresponding 10 months of last year.  On the import side there was a value of 303,000,000 dollars for the month of October, an increase of 50,000,000 dollars for the month.  But, perhaps, the most notable statement in the report is that on the export side.  The greatest increases over last year are in manufactures for consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus experience is in flat opposition to the Free Trade theory that import tariffs will kill export trade in manufactures. It is further recorded that the general level of prices has varied but little in the last two years, which upsets the theory that import duties mean high prices.  With 100 per cent. increase in the tariff there has been practically no increase in the general price level.  In face of the abundant data I have adduced showing that protection never does increase and never has increased the cost of living, I will merely quote, for purpose of contrast, the following statement advanced by the Fiscal Committee in paragraph 108 of its Report, without any attempt whatever at proof, thus implying for the benefit of a public, perhaps a little credulous, and not too well informed on such questions, that the statement is universally accepted.  The statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" />&ldquo;That a protective tariff will increase the cost of living in proportion to its extent, and especially if it be applied to articles of general consumption, and in particular to food, is self-evident.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lest the statement standing thus alone and unsupported should not prove sufficiently grotesque, the Committee at once proceeds, in the same paragraph, to argue against any transference of the duties at present levied upon tea and sugar, although these goods are amongst the chief items of food in the budget of the average Irish household.  If, as the Committee states, the duty in particular applied to food increased the cost of living, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case at once established for transferring that duty to other articles not so vitally important as food, where its effects on the cost of living would, seemingly, and in accordance with the views expressed by the Committee, be less apparent.  In the case of protectionist countries, it will be found, as indeed one might expect, that tea is admitted either duty free or at a merely nominal tariff; also the tariffs on sugar are in no case as large, or nearly as large, as ours, and, as a rule, they operate as a protection to a home-grown sugar industry, which we unfortunately have not got in the Saorstát.  Tea is admitted free of duty into Australia, the United States, and other countries.  In no country on earth save Great Britain do we find that the import duties on tea and sugar are as high as they are here.  Why should we retain these preposterous rates of duty upon what are to us essential food stuffs, when by shifting them on to less important imports competing with the products of our native manufactures, we can, with one stroke, lower the cost of living, create employment at home, and thus in a two-fold way consolidate and develop the economic sources of the nation?  The claim that protective tariffs increase wages and prices is, of course, based on the claim that such tariffs increase the cost of living, since prices are the immediate, and wages one of the proximate factors in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> Needless to observe, wages, prices and cost of living act and react upon each other; and it is impossible even for the Fiscal Committee to measure the separate segments in this charmed circle.  This difficulty, however, does not restrain the Committee from dogmatising upon each part, separately, with great show of words, but with complete absence of the data necessary to sustain its views.</P>
    <P>I come to the attitude of the Committee on the question of dumping. Prominent amongst the difficulties with which our manufacturers have had to contend, especially during recent years, is that of dumping.  Nearly all the manufacturers who appeared before the Committee seemed to have complained of this evil, but with an affection of helplessness worthy of the best traditions of laissez faire, the Committee has no remedy to offer against this scourge, and, in effect, tells the manufacturers to bow their heads meekly and in all humility before it.  In support of its advice, the Committee for once deigns to quote evidence from an independent source.  The quotation, which is from a pamphlet published in Washington, will be found in paragraph 85, and, as may be observed by anyone reading it carefully, it does not bear the strained interpretation sought to be put upon it by the Committee. Is it not strange that the Committee should be guided in this matter by their interpretation of a statement in this pamphlet, and at the same time ignore the example set by the United States Government in passing into law recently the Fordney-McCumber Tariff &mdash;designed expressly for the purpose of protecting the manufacturing industry of that country against the unfair competition of cheap, foreign manufactures? Is there any one, be he Protectionist or Free Trader, really so gullible as to believe that the foreigner can dump his goods as effectively into this country when he has a tariff wall to contend with as when he has not? Theoretically, it might be true that certain kinds of dumping at certain times will circumvent any tariff wall opposed to it, just as it is true that a burglar will, at certain times, circumvent the protection that bolts and locks give to the householder.  But is this a reason <Col N="273" /> why the householder should leave his door unbolted and unlocked day and night?  The method here exemplified of arriving at conclusions far too wide and sweeping for the premises upon which they are based, is typical of the Report.  This method of reasoning was ancient even in the days of Aristotle, and has rightly met with contempt down through the ages.</P>
    <P>The Committee in its lofty disregard for the niceties of logical inference states in paragraph 66 that because of the non-appearance before it of witnesses representative of certain interests, these interests were regarded by the Committee as content with the existing fiscal arrangements&mdash;in other words, content with the present crushing imports upon a few essential articles of daily use in every household in the country.  As one proceeds with the perusal of the Report, one gets accustomed to the laxity of the less important inferences set forth, but in regard to the major inferences in the present instance, as well as to that relating to dumping, we might be pardoned for expecting that the Committee would display a little more discretion. To suggest, as is done in paragraphs 66 and 87, that because a protective tariff is not desired for such products as bacon, eggs, etc., the agricultural population would be opposed to any change in the present fiscal system, inherited hap-hazard as it has been from the old regime, is to cast an unworthy aspersion upon the intelligence and public spirit of the largest and most important section of the community. The annual increment of young people, which year after year have been emigrating from our shores, for generations past, owing to lack of employment at home, is derived almost entirely from the agricultural population.</P>
    <P>If one cares to witness the real tragedy of unemployment and national decay in this country, he must search, not among the urban population, but in the ruined homes and broken families of the countryside.  The suggestion that the agricultural population of this country is not vitally interested and concerned in any policy aiming at the economic development of the country, <Col N="274" /> and at the provision of increased employment in both agricultural and industrial occupations for the sons and daughters of our still numerous small farmers, betrays an amazing ignorance of what are the hopes and needs of the rural population.  The agriculture of this country is rightly regarded as our greatest industry.  But the inference does not follow that agriculture has been prosperous, and manufactures the reverse.  Under Free Trade both have gone down the hill together into what might be described as one common ruin. During the past three-quarters of a century, whilst the rural population of every country in the world, save that of our own, and of Great Britain, has increased, the rural population of Ireland, in contradistinction to the urban population, has declined from 7,040,000 souls to 2,920,000.  The number of agricultural holdings above one acre has declined from 730,000 to 460,000, whilst the number of those in every country in Continental Europe has increased.  The area under tillage has declined from 4,600,000 to 2,400,000 acres, whilst the tillage area of every country in the world, outside what used to be known as the British Islands, has increased. Nor is it possible to attribute this decline in our agriculture to any cause other than that of Free Trade.  The era of complete Free Trade in this country coincides exactly with that of the decline of agriculture; whilst, on the other hand, those countries which remained or became Protectionist during the same period have been able not alone to maintain their agriculture unimpaired, but to maintain and develop it exceedingly.  In the case of Great Britain Free Trade conferred ample compensation for the decline of agriculture by the stimulus it gave to the manufacturing industry, which had already made gigantic strides there as a result of the various advantages conferred by the numerous mechanical inventions, long a monopoly of Great Britain, and associated with the so-called industrial revolution.  The successful emergence of Britain from the Napoleonic Wars, which had retarded industrial development on the Continent, was another favourable factor for her.  These advantages gave to Britain for a long time the lead in <Col N="275" /> manufacturing industries over all other countries.  Had the other countries been unable to erect protective barriers against competition from Great Britain they would have found themselves long ago in the position occupied by Ireland to-day, that is, industrial derelicts.</P>
    <P>Protection saved them, both agriculturally and industrially.  Free Trade meant the ruin of British agriculture, but it also meant the making of British industrial greatness.  Free Trade meant ruin to Irish agriculture and Irish industry.  The Committee suggests that certain industries would be likely to transfer their business out of the country if a protective tariff were imposed, but such a threat on the part of any of our manufacturers could only rest upon the false propaganda spread abroad by our Cobdenite economists.  I have heard nothing to the effect that British manufacturers recently threatened to transfer their business abroad when the British Government proposed to impose a protective tariff. As I have already shown, it is the general experience that Protection lowers the cost of living, and, therefore, apart from the direct advantage it confers on manufacturers, it assists them indirectly at keeping money wages, as distinct from real wages, low.</P>
    <P>The Committee endeavours to base arguments against Protection upon the fact that there are in An Saorstát a few firms who export a proportion of their products, and who, therefore, consider themselves not in need of a tariff. Generally speaking, the basis upon which an export trade can be developed is the assured position of the home market.  For example, did the firm of Messrs. Guinness and Son begin business by exporting its products, or, rather, did it not first capture the home market and then look abroad for an extension of its trade?  Let us give our manufacturers a chance of capturing the home market, and immediately they will be able to effect considerable economies in production rates, reduce overhead charges, and be able to specialise to a greater extent than is possible under existing circumstances. In due course these manufacturers will be able to look abroad for other markets, <Col N="276" /> just as Messrs. Guinness and Messrs. Jacob have done.</P>
    <P>Thus is opened up for the country a fair vista of industrial expansion and progress, assuming only that we have the vision and capacity to shape our economic policy on right lines.  I have already indicated how vitally the agricultural population is interested in this question of industrial development from the standpoint of providing employment for the surplus rural population which agriculture cannot absorb; but agriculturists are also interested in this matter from a somewhat different angle.  An expanding industrial population leads to agricultural development along healthy lines, and a more assured market for agricultural products is created on the spot.  Perishable and bulky garden products that will not bear long transit to external markets will be required in increasing quantities.  Tillage will be stimulated as a result.  Small tillage farms will again become economic units to cultivate, just as they are at present in France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and elsewhere.  The present tendency in our agricultural industry towards cattle and grass, coupled with the decline and decay of manufacturing industries, if not checked in some way, must eventually prove fatal alike to the Irish nation and the race.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no hope for our agriculture along its present lines of economic development, or, rather, economic retrogression.  Our countryside increasingly justifies the designation applied to it by George Moore&mdash;&ldquo;a land of wilderness and weed.&rdquo;  It is, of course, quite impossible for me, even in the somewhat lengthy statement I feel compelled to make, to deal in detail with all the fallacies in a Report in which everything is fallacious.  I would, however, like to draw attention to the statements in paragraphs 116-117, to the effect that if we restrict our imports by means of a protective tariff we will be unable to obtain payment for our exports.  I will not pause to dwell on the fact that, of course, the other foolish protectionist countries in the world must find themselves in this plight at the present time, and must have found themselves for generations past.  Just picture the folly of the <Col N="277" /> Yankees in passing into law the Fordney McCumber Tariff Act.  They ought to have known its effect would be to preclude them from obtaining payment for their wheat, maize, flour, motor-cars, etc., which we get from them.  We do feel deeply grateful to them for their generosity.</P>
    <P>I frankly admit that one probable effect of a protective tariff would be a falling off in our exports of food and raw materials, and indeed this is one of my principal arguments in favour of Protection.  Were we a country exporting to a great extent manufactured goods, and could it be shown to me that the effect of Protection would be to bring about a falling off in these exports in the same way that I can show that the actual effect of Protection in our agricultural country would be to cause a falling off in our exports of food and raw materials, then I, for one, would have a very different outlook to the one I have at present.  This is the fundamental difference, as I see it, between the basis of a case for Protection and that of a case for Free Trade.  I will now proceed to illustrate by a homely example how it is that protective tariffs upon manufactured goods cause a falling off in exports of food-stuffs and raw materials.  Supposing that, following upon the imposition of a tariff on boots, it is decided to establish a boot factory in the town of Cavan, the immediate effect would be an increase of employment, and therefore of increased consumption in the town of food products such as butter, eggs, milk, meat, etc., produced by the local agricultural population. The present surplus products mentioned are exported almost wholly to Great Britain, but in the conditions assumed this surplus would be greatly reduced owing to the increased local consumption. At the same time, the boot factory would supply the needs of the local people at present met by imported boots.  Thus, owing to the healthy expansion of the town of Cavan in the manner described, there would be brought about a decline in both the import and export trade of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> Supposing the same type of development occurred not in one, not even in one hundred, but in a thousand different places in the Saorstát, the decline, both in imports and in exports, might prove to be very appreciable indeed, but the country as a whole would have been developed, and population would have been increased far beyond the present figures.  Now one gets a glimpse of the reason why companies, mostly foreign, that do our shipping and carrying, and some portal authorities as well, are such outspoken free traders.  May I ask at this stage at what time the Dáil adjourns?</P>
