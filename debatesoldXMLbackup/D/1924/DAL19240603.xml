      <P>asked the President if he has any information to give to the Dáil in respect to the intention of the Executive Council regarding the operations of the Courts of Justice Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive Council has under consideration at the moment the question of bringing into immediate operation the Courts of Justice Act in so far as it relates to the Supreme Court and the High Court.</P>
      <P>The considerations of public convenience and the disposal of public business, and the necessity for considering procedure, make it desirable to allow a somewhat longer interval before bringing the Act into operation as regards the Circuit Court.  It is considered that the Act cannot conveniently be brought into operation as regards the District Court otherwise than at the same time as the Circuit Courts are set up.  The latter part of the Act will accordingly not be brought into operation until after the conclusion of the Trinity Session in the County Courts.</P>

      <P>The collation of the figures representing revenue derived from Customs duty on goods entering the Saorstát through the land frontier would require a considerable amount of time and labour, and the information available would not be sufficiently reliable to warrant the expenditure of public money that would be involved.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that the staff on the border is mainly a preventive staff and that the staff is necessary, even if no actual duty were collected.</P>

      <P>The person named by the Deputy was awarded a decree for £226 5s. and £18 18s. 3d. costs, by the County Court Judge of the County of Clare, in April, 1922.  An appeal was lodged against this decree by the Clare County Council.  The British Government accepted liability for payment of compensation in this case as a breach of the Truce on the British side, and as the appeal against the decree was still pending, the case was submitted for assessment of compensation to Messrs.  Dowdall and Howell Thomas, of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, who heard the case and awarded £250 compensation, and £23 12s. 9d. costs.  This award has been paid by the British Government.  I am satisfied that Messrs.  Dowdall and Howell Thomas took all the facts of the case into consideration, and I see no reason why representations should be made to the British Government with a view to the case being reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of a number of cases in which the Department has been put to considerable trouble owing to the failure of teachers on retirement from the service to surrender possession of the teacher's residence, of which they had the use in their capacity as teachers.  The residence in this case was provided by a State loan for the use of the teacher serving in the school for the time being, and the failure of Mrs. Tubridy to relinquish possession of the residence as from the date from which she ceased to give service in the school has, it is understood, put her successor in office to considerable inconvenience.  Although Mrs. Tubridy has now surrendered possession of the residence, she has not given up possession of the whole of the land on which the residence was built, on the ground that she claims that she is the owner of portion of this land.  The matter has been the subject of correspondence with the Congested Districts Board and has been under the consideration of the legal adviser of this Department, and, in view of the doubts that have arisen in regard to the title to the portion of the land in question, it has been decided to refer Mrs. Tubridy's claim for pension to the Teachers' Pension Office, without prejudice to any further action which it may be found necessary to take.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if before entering upon the second stage of the Finance Bill he will circulate the estimate of the yield of Customs and Excise taxes under separate heads, as was done for the year 1923-24, and also the revenue derived from each of these taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I made inquiries into this matter since it was raised by the Deputy, and I find that the estimate of revenue contained in the White Paper that was issued at the end of the financial year contains all the information that was circulated last year.  That is, it gives the amounts anticipated to be yielded by Customs duties, Excise duties and estate duties, and so forth. In regard to the yield of taxes which are being imposed for the first time I have given what information was available, I think, on the resolution, and I will repeat it or supplement it so far as possible in dealing with the relevant clauses of the Finance Bill.  But it is <Col N="1730" /> to be understood that at the present stage those estimates are largely conjectural. In regard to the estimate of Customs and Excise duties generally, the estimate of the yield of a particular tax is a difficult matter, especially in the earlier parts of the financial year, and whilst in an estimate which bulks a number of taxes, errors may be cancelled off against each other, the more an estimate goes into detail the less informing, and the more misleading, it may possibly be.  The final figures of the yield of separate taxes for 1920 and 1924 are not available, but the accounts are in course of audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, whose examination will be completed by August or September, when the audited details will be published in the White Paper.  In regard to any particular taxes I am perfectly willing to give the Deputy any information I have, but I do not like to give a return which would be, perhaps, an incorrect return and an incomplete return at the present stage, and which may be, perhaps, used for statistical purposes here or elsewhere without having regard to its provisional character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to relieve the Exchequer of the major portion of the charge for medical certification under the National Health Insurance Act.  Heretofore the whole charge has been met out of the Exchequer.  That was not the case during the past couple of years in Northern Ireland, nor was it the case in Great Britain, although arrangements for National Health Insurance differs somewhat in Great Britain.  The cost of the medical certification in 1923-4 was £51,200.  The money for medical certification is distributed each year amongst medical practitioners who enter into agreements with the Commissioners to furnish medical certificates in accordance with the scheme agreed to by the medical profession, and approved by the Minister for Finance.  There is also a small provision for second medical opinions in doubtful cases.  The average sum per member paid to the medical practitioners for certification was approximately <Col N="1732" /> two shillings and three pence.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to meet that service and to defray the charge this year out of the various sources indicated in the Bill.  However, it will not be necessary to find two shillings and three pence per member.  The Insurance Commission have been in negotiation with the medical profession, and they have agreed to accept a reduction in remuneration until the 31st August next, which would give an average of two shillings per member as against two shillings and three pence.  It is hoped that it will be possible to have that arrangement extended to the end of the year.  Meantime steps are being taken to see if it will be possible for the Government to put forward any proposals in regard to reform and improvement, in whatever way it is found best, of the system of National Health Insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Bill provides that 10d. per member shall be found out of the Benefit Fund of every approved Society in respect of each member.  That is really the effect of Section 2 of the Bill.  The financial basis of the Health Insurance Acts makes provision for six shillings and seven pence per insured member for charges other than sickness, disablement and maternity benefit.  The charges hitherto against the Societies' fund were four shillings and ten pence for their own administration, one shilling and threepence for sanitorium benefit, four pence for administration of Insurance Committees&mdash;a total of six shillings, and five pence, leaving a margin of two pence.  That margin arose out of the fact that only four pence per member is allowed for the administration of Insurance Committees, whereas there was actual provision for six pence.  It is proposed to take that margin of two pence for purposes of medical certification. The societies have been allowed four shillings and ten pence per member for administration.  The Insurance Commissioners have, by regulation, reduced the charge for the Societies' administration to four shillings and five pence from the 1st January last.  That four shillings and five pence is the amount allowed for administration in Great Britain and <Col N="1733" /> Northern Ireland, and it is felt that the amount is sufficient for the cost of administration in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The present weekly rates of contribution are 8d. and 7d.  That is sufficient to meet the obligations of the societies under the Act, and leaves a margin of 3d. per member per annum. It would not be possible to reduce the contribution by even one farthing, shall we say, without reducing it below what is necessary.  On the other hand, the existing contribution does leave this small margin of 3d. per member per annum.  So that the 10d. is made up of the 2d. which already exists as a margin and is available for the benefit fund of the society; of 5d. by which it is proposed to reduce the amount allowed&mdash;by which, in fact, the Commissioners have already reduced the amount allowed to the societies for administration&mdash;and the extra 3d., which is the actuarial margin.  That gives 10d.  The remainder of the sum required&mdash;1s. 2d.&mdash;it is proposed to find by diverting money that arises from unclaimed contributions from the National Health Insurance Central Fund. The unclaimed balance in the Stamps Sales Account at the end of 1921, was £196,000 for all Ireland.  The Free State share has not been apportioned yet, but it may be taken at £113,000. This is not, of course, entirely surplus, because it includes the value of stamps in the hands of the public and not affixed to contribution cards, and stamps on cards in the hands of societies or insured persons for which credit will ultimately be claimed.  But something like, shall we say, £80,000 or £100,000 is definitely surplus.  Certain people who have to be insured and who do not wish to apply for benefit, occasionally throw their cards into the fire.  In such ways as that the surplus arises.  At present it goes to the National Health Insurance Central Fund, which is a second line of defence for the societies.  It can be called upon if a deficiency arises in the Contingencies Fund of a society, if the society can show that the deficiency was due to some special cause beyond their control, such as an epidemic of disease.</P>
    <P>Under Section 27 of the National Health Insurance Act of last year a <Col N="1734" /> small proportion of this money was diverted from the Central Fund to recoup societies for keeping members in benefit who would otherwise have been suspended on account of arrears, but the amount so diverted will be comparatively small.  This proposal to take the major part of the amount required for medical certification away from the Central Fund, can only be continued for a short period.  It is as tually only for this year, or perhaps for another year, but it could not be continued indefinitely.  It is really a temporary provision to meet the need for providing for medical certification until we have been able to look further into the whole question of the administration of National Health Insurance. It would be unwise and unsafe to continue to divert this particular revenue, as it were, from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposal, taking a membership of 440,000, at 10d. per member, is that from the societies we get £18,340, and from the Stamp Sales Account, or from the portion of it attributable to unclaimed stamps, we get £25,670.  In addition, there is the cost of second medical opinions, about £1,600, making a total of £45,610.  As the money will in future be taken out of contributions and applied in defraying the expenses of administration, and not, as heretofore, provided by the Exchequer, it will attract the two-ninths State contribution provided for in Section 3 of the 1911 Act.  Consequently the total of £45,610 required for medical certification will be distributed in the proportion of seven-ninths from Insurance Funds and two-ninths from the Exchequer.  That is, the Insurance Funds will bear £35,480 and the Exchequer £10,130.  The net saving to the Exchequer will be £35,480.  The two-ninths of these various sums which will be taken from the societies and from the Central Fund will be recouped to the societies and to that Fund.  That is, the societies will not really lose the 10d.; they will lose seven-ninths of the 10d.  They will be responsible for paying the 10d., but the two-ninths of that amount will be recouped to them under the provisions of Section 3 of the 1911 Act. That is the principal provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> Section 5 of the Bill provides that the limitation in regard to soldiers, which prescribed that they should have been enlisted for a period not exceeding twelve months in order to get the benefit of the Act, is removed. We are now enlisting soldiers for longer periods.  The provision which enables people to be kept on the books and not to be suspended because of arrears, which terminated on the 31st December last, is revived, and will continue till the end of 1925.  As I have already said, there is a somewhat similar provision in Northern Ireland. The money is found in a rather different way from Insurance Funds, but it comes to the same thing in the long run.  That is, that seven-ninths of the cost of medical certification is found from Insurance Funds, and during the past two years the societies had to find the greater part of the cost of medical certification, while in the Saorstát the entire expenses were borne by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, I think, given a good reason why the Dáil should not agree to the Second Reading of this Bill.  The reason is that this is not a Bill which can possibly continue longer than this year, or possibly next year.  The Minister has stated that the plan proposed in the Bill cannot be permanent.  I presume the reason is because it is unsound actuarily. Nothing has been made known, no publication has reached the hands of the public, which would show that there has been any valuation, or any actuarial test, as to whether the societies can stand such a charge and remain sound.  Everything that has been made available, information from one society or another, shows that the imposition of this new charge of 10d.&mdash; 5d. from the Administration Fund and 5d. in effect from Health Insurance Fund&mdash;cannot be borne, and leave the societies in a position to pay their obligations. The effect is likely to be that, at succeeding valuations 400,000 people, who are working people, will have to be levied to make up any deficit. It is another instance where the poor are going to be made bear the burden of the failure of the Exchequer. The Minister has spoken of the margins, <Col N="1736" /> 2d. on administration and sundry funds, and another 3d., but I think if he inquires further he will find that it will require these margins, in most cases, to enable the societies to pay their obligations.  These are not margins that could be played with.  The societies really require these margins to pay benefits that are statutory.  It is only by assuming that the health conditions of the people here, that the charges upon the societies' funds are similar, or could be called indentical with the position in Great Britain, that this kind of calculation could be made. I venture to say it is not on account of any calculation made at this side of the Channel that the Minister has arrived at his conclusion.  He has done so on account of a calculation made in Great Britain, and he assumes that the same reasoning can apply to Irish societies. I say there is no 5d. of a margin that could be spared out of the Health Insurance Fund, and, as a consequence, if you are going to take from the societies this 5d. to pay medical certification fees it simply means at a later period, having to call upon the individual members of the societies to meet the loss which this Bill is destined to impose.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the Unclaimed Stamps Fund.  That is, in fact, a fund which is part of the contributions of insured persons, and should not be distributed in this way.  It should be available for health contingencies and not doctor's certificates. That fund should not be treated as one of the hen-roosts that has to be robbed. It is something to be maintained as a reserve upon which the societies could call in case of the emergency mentioned, such as a possible epidemic or an unexpected charge.  The Minister is going to take that reserve and apply it for medical certification, leaving the societies in a worse position than they have ever been in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can understand it, the position of the Minister is that he proposes to set up a Commission to inquire into the general incidence of this Health Insurance system, and then legislate upon the report that the Commission or Committee may make.  I suggest that it should be after that Committee has reported that a measure <Col N="1737" /> of this kind ought to be brought forward. To deprive the Societies first of the five pence for administration, and secondly of the five pence for margins, which has always been required, taking the bulk of the Societies into account, to pay insurance obligations before you get the report on administration, and on the general incidence of the Insurance Acts, seems to me to be proceeding in the wrong way.  If it is necessary for this year to act in accordance with this plan at all, or anything like it, I suggest that the procedure should be to borrow from this Unclaimed Stamps Fund and utilise the proceeds for this current year until the report has been received.  The amount can be paid back, and it ought to be paid back.  That Fund has been subscribed by insured persons for health purposes, and it ought not to be taken away in this manner.  I think the case made on behalf of the Ministry for this change is not convincing, and that the Dáil should not agree to the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Our attitude with regard to this Bill, and to all Bills under this particular heading, is distinctly hostile.  Whatever service this class of Bill is to a city, or whatever support it has in the city, it certainly has no support from either employer or workman in the country.  Neither wants it, and it is only wanted by the few people who draw salaries, and who are having a good time out of it.  If you had a plebiscite in the morning with regard to National Health, I think you would have at least ninety per cent. or ninety-five per cent. of the people voting against the continuance of this Act.  Outside of the officials connected with the societies nobody is in support of it, and I think the sooner the Government makes up its mind to scrap it the better it will be in the interests of the country.</P>

      <P>I think from what Deputy Gorey has said that he does not know anything at all about the National Health Insurance Act, its working, or the benefit it is to people in the country.  Certainly farmers, as well as other employers, try by every means in their power&mdash;at least certain <Col N="1738" /> sections of them do&mdash;to prevent the Act being worked and to prevent proper compliance with it, and they also try to make the workers believe that the Act is of no benefit to them.  I claim to speak for my own part of the country, and I certainly say that the workers want the National Health Insurance Act; they want it improved, and they look to the Ministry to see that there is proper compliance with it.  I am sure that if, as Deputy Gorey has said, there was a plebiscite to-morrow morning, you would have 95 per cent. in favour of it, instead of against it.</P>

      <P>I agree altogether with what Deputy Morrissey has said.  I have been a member of the County Insurance Committee of the big County of Cork for a number of years, and I know the benefit that unfortunate workmen derive from the Act.  The domiciliary treatment, for instance, is the greatest boon to the unfortunate people who suffer from consumption, and who cannot or do not like to be sent away to a sanatorium.  These people get 10s. or 15s. worth of food a week, milk, eggs and other things, through the Insurance Act, that they could not get otherwise without the stain of pauperism.  They do not like to go to the Board of Guardians or anywhere else; they simply take back what they paid to the insurance societies. and they have a claim to it.  Everybody looked upon the Act as a fraud when it started; but it improves with age, and these poor people, when sick, have not to be looking to anybody for relief.  They claim this as a right, and they get it, and I hold that the Insurance Act has been a great benefit&mdash;it has been a benefit to the farmers, too, if they only saw it.</P>

      <P>With regard to one part of the proposal, I admitted in my statement that it could only be a temporary expedient: that is, the taking of 1s. 2d. per member from the Unclaimed Stamps Account.  That is only a temporary expedient, because that account would very soon be exhausted and a certain reserve on it, which is desirable and perhaps necessary for the safety of the societies, would be taken away.  With regard to the 10d. which would be taken from the societies, I do not admit at all that that is a temporary expedient, or one which could not be continued.  I see no reason at all why the societies here could not be administered as cheaply as the societies in Northern Ireland, where they are only allowed 1s. 5d. There may be societies which require the margin to which I referred, but that is generally the result of inefficient management or of a peculiar type of membership, or something like that.  The societies in general can quite well afford to meet this particular charge of 10d. per member.  I would remind Deputy Johnson of what I said in the beginning: that the societies in the Saorstát during the last two years have got over £70,000 from the Exchequer which they would not have got if the same provision only had been made here as was made in Northern <Col N="1740" /> Ireland.  We are now putting them practically on a parity from the point of view of State aid with the societies in the North, and I think, in view of the state of affairs here, that we cannot afford to make contributions that are not made to societies that are situated in very similar circumstances.</P>

      <P>It comes to the same thing in the long run.  They are taking in the North a sum from the interest account which we are not touching.  What you lose on the swings is made up on the roundabouts.  Anything taken from the Health Insurance Fund ultimately comes from the Benefit Funds of the Society.  It makes no substantial difference.  The reason we take anything from the interest funds is that the Health Insurance Fund has not been apportioned, and we do not know what surplus there is, and we do not know what the size of the fund from which we would be withdrawing a sum for medical certification is.  In the North they have drawn from that fund, but we think that is not the wisest course.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Second Reading of this Bill, after following the usual course of such debates, rather branched off into what one might call an academic discussion, which, perhaps, may be of value to the Committee of Inquiry which is to be set up to consider the form of the Bill which will take the place of the present Bill.  In the circumstances, I think it is possible that the experience of members of the Dáil who have been connected with local government in the country may be of some small value to the framers of the next Bill that may come before us.  As regards myself, I have had the honour of being connected for nearly 30 years with the local government of the county that did me the honour to return me as one of the members to represent them in the Dáil.  I have, or at least ought to have, some idea of the comparative value of the different systems that have been in force in connection with local government.  In 1898 the English Government, being compelled to do so by a popular clamour, determined to do away with the old Grand Jury system, which, of course, was entirely in the hands of one class of society, and was most undemocratic in every way.  The Boards of Guardians were not so bad.  The popular element could and did prevail in most of them, but they had very limited powers, and were not able to do a very vast amount of improvement, but what they had in their power they carried out to the best of their ability.  The present system of local government, which was introduced by the English Government, as I have said, in 1898, is framed absolutely on the system that had been in force for 10 years in England prior to its introduction here.  It had the advantage of being most democratic in every way. I am bound to say that as regards the District Councils I have a sneaking affection for them.  I think with the powers they had they did extremely good work in many ways, but from the beginning they were handicapped by certain things.  The system was <Col N="1742" /> more expensive.  We were prepared to pay for democracy and for the freedom that was given us, but I think we paid too much, and I think a system that was more economical, and at the same time equally democratic, might have been introduced at that time.  I will give you a few figures.  The year that was adopted as the standard year by the English Government when they introduced the Local Government Bill, was 1897, and they adopted that year because they gave a grant to placate the landed interests which were then all powerful, by relieving them of certain rates they had to pay, and this amount was called the agricultural grant.  It was divided amongst the counties in certain definite proportions. To show that the system introduced was more expensive, or at least cost more money, I want to give you some figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount raised in County Kildare in 1897, I think, for every purpose in the county was £42,567, and the amount spent in the county in the first working year under the Local Government Act was £38,633&mdash;actually raised in the county&mdash;plus £15,740, the Agricultural Grant, so that although the amount actually raised was about £4,000 less the amount actually spent was about £11,000 more.  That shows clearly that if it had not been for the Agricultural Grant there would have been a very heavy drain on the county, and I suppose it was the same with all the other counties.  The average amount raised in the 20 years from the 1st April, 1899, to the 31st March, 1919, apart from the Agricultural Grant, was £40,606.  That is, plus the Agricultural Grant it would be £55,000, but the average annual amount raised for the five subsequent years 1920 to 1924 was £117,064.  Of course, there were drawbacks to local government administration.  The local bodies were overloaded with too many members, to begin with.  The District Council I had the honour to belong to had about 80 members, and the Board of Guardians connected with it, a great many of the members of which were the same people as were on the District Councils, numbered about 90.  At the beginning the quorum was fixed at one-fourth, but it was utterly impossible to get them to attend.  After about two <Col N="1743" /> meetings the numbers fell off, and the quorum had to be reduced to very small numbers.  In the case of the Board of Guardians, with 90 members on the roll, the quorum had to be fixed at 13, and they had sometimes great difficulty in getting the quorum.  With regard to the Co. Councils, the membership was less.  In the Co. Council to which I belong the number at first was 31, and it was later reduced to 28, and during the 21 years I have been on the Council such a thing as a meeting falling through never occurred.  I think the average attendance out of a possible of 30 who could have attended, I should say for 21 years, was about 19 or 20, so I think one may come to the conclusion that over the county it would be possible to get only about 40 or 50 people who would give their time to the work. It is not everybody who has the time, and who is willing to work.  Some seem to think that to put D.C. or C.C. after their names is quite enough, and that no work is expected from them.  I think in these days that is not the sort of thing people expect, and I am glad to say that in the measure the Minister for Local Government has placed before us that matter is dealt with.  I think he is seeing the necessity of reducing the number.  I take it in the county I belong to the number that would be elected would be about 50, and I think that would be about the number you would be able to get to attend.  So far as that goes, I think the change will be extremely good, but as I say I have a sneaking affection for the District Councils, as I think during their term of office they did many excellent things.  Nevertheless, if a better or cheaper system could be evolved, I do not see why it should not be done, and if the Committee of Inquiry can show that such a system can be evolved, I think we would be wrong not to adopt it.</P>
    <P>As regards the Health part of the Bill Sir James Craig has dealt most carefully with that, and I think that his suggestions are worthy of being noted.  I have one suggestion to make in addition to those which he made.  He recommends that the school children should be inspected.  I would add to that that they ought to have a dentist to attend to them.</P>

      <P>I think it is deplorable to see children in these days, before they are out of their teens, without such a thing as a tooth at all.  I think this is a most important matter.  I think that the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health for the entire county&mdash;a wholetime officer&mdash;will have a most excellent effect.  It is one of the best features of the Bill.  There is one thing in the Bill that has not been noticed.  It is in Section 17 which says &ldquo;A tent, van, shed, or similar structure used for human habitation, which is in such a state as to be a nuisance or injurious to health, or which is so overcrowded as to be injurious to the health of the inmates (whether they are or are not members of the same family) shall be deemed to be a nuisance within the meaning of Section 107 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and the provisions of that Act shall apply accordingly.&rdquo; Now, in my county that is a matter that concerns us very considerably. We are simply overrun with tinkers going through the country.  It is really not such a laughing matter at all.  You see these people going about the country, and if there was an epidemic they would spread disease.  They leave behind them piles of filthy rags; you see these piles of rags in every place they have been.  You see these vans that would hold three or four people, and they take, perhaps, twentyfive or thirty.  I expect that it is to deal with this matter that the Minister has introduced this clause.  These people ought, certainly, to come under it; and I hope that if the matter has not already been brought to his notice, and if this is not his idea in introducing the clause that he will take note of this matter.</P>

All these matters are, according to the newest arrangement, <Col N="1745" /> to be submitted to a Committee for their consideration; and I am sure and I hope, that out of that consideration will be evolved a scheme that will be useful to the county, and to the country generally, will be economical, and will serve the best interests of the people.</P>

      <P>The announcement of the President when we were discussing this Bill on the last day has brought new matter into this discussion.  When we were dealing with the Bill at first we thought that we were confronted with the possibility or with the necessity of dealing with it right off; but his suggestion of a Commission, to my mind, is very wholesome and very healthy, and we welcome the suggestion. I hope that the suggestion made by the President will change the viewpoint and the attitude of the Minister in charge of the Bill with regard to taking a division on this Bill.  There are two main bones of contention in this Bill.  One is&mdash;and perhaps it is the principal one&mdash;the abolition of the District Councils.  Now, my sole idea in supporting the continuance of the District Councils is that they be given more work to do than they have been given as District Councils; my whole idea in supporting their retention is that they be fitted into the scheme of local administration in such a way that they will get something to do, and that their duties will not be, as they have been, a sinecure.  When the District Councils were elected&mdash;I think 1920 was the last election, but I am not sure&mdash;they were elected not as District Councils alone, but they were elected also as Boards of Guardians; and their work as Boards of Guardians was the principal work they had to do.  The introduction of the new scheme of National Health did away with their duties as Boards of Guardians, and nothing remained but their duties as District Councils.  Now, the duties of District Councils are very small, indeed; they have very little to do; they have only four main meetings in the year, and when they have those four meetings disposed of they have nothing else to do.  What I suggest to the Minister is that these elected bodies be retained for the purpose of taking part in local supervision: local <Col N="1746" /> supervision in two senses&mdash;local supervision with regard to the work done on the roads, and local supervision with regard to the administration of Home Help and other duties.  If you fit them into that, they will serve a useful purpose.  They will be more effective than Inspectors of Home Help and other officials whom you are appointing at salaries.  I suggest to the Minister that he carefully consider the suggestion whether the District Councillors cannot be retained and fitted in to the new scheme of Home Help.  If they are not, there is no case at all for their retention. But I do suggest to the Minister that he should carefully consider this vital question of local supervision before he decides on abolishing these locally-elected bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that more duties should be given to them, and that an attempt should be made to fit them in to this scheme of Home Help; and I suggest that they can be fitted in and fitted in with advantage.  I quite admit that their existence without poor law duty is a sham.  I quite admit that it is a sham, but their position ought not to be a sham, and I think they could be fitted in.  Now, with regard to what has been said about Home Help and the success of the scheme in one place, and its failure in another, I attribute the success of certain Boards of Health to the fact that they have introduced the element of commonsense into the way in which they have carried out the scheme and put it into effect instead of adopting the central idea brought from the Local Government Board, and which, to my mind, and to the minds of a good many people, lacks that very essential quality of commonsense. The result is the difference between success and failure.  There is no getting away from the fact at all that in Deputy Wolfe's county the Home Help scheme has been a failure from the point of view of the ratepayers and from everybody's point of view.  There are other counties in which men have used that quality of commonsense, and the experience they have got in the administration of this scheme and in the old Board of Guardians scheme, and the result is that the scheme has been a success, a success from every point of view financially and in every aspect <Col N="1747" /> of the matter.  As regards the suggestion made by the Minister in introducing this measure and made by him also at a later stage, of giving this Bill a Second Reading, I do not think that suggestion is consistent with the idea of the setting up of a special Commission to inquire into this matter.  If this Commission is going to have a free hand I suggest that this Bill get a full discussion and leave it there.</P>
    <P>In view of the setting up of this Commission, I do not think any of us are prepared to give this Bill a Second Reading.  We do not want to commit ourselves to the principle of a Bill that we do not like.  We may like certain sections in the Bill, but as the Bill stands we do not like it.  Deputy Egan called attention to one of the main principles in the Bill, the one dealing with the upkeep of the main roads.  I do not think I could overstate the position with regard to that question.  In my opinion the trunk and the main roads of the country ought to be a State charge.  The development of the main roads for tourist traffic will be of very little use to the people of the country or the district through which these roads run.  It is the people in the cities and from other districts who will benefit from any development that may take place on these main or trunk roads.  For that reason we insist that the main and trunk roads of the country should be a State charge and should be maintained by the State.  If we are going to have the tourist traffic of the country developed in the way suggested by Deputy Egan, we shall have, I think, to go a good deal further than by developing merely the main road.  We must, I think, make up our minds, in addition, to provide attractive hotels and casinos, perhaps, with dancing facilities and probably some jazz bands.  In that connection we would need to be careful not to get up against the licensing laws recently introduced by the Minister for Justice as well as the other laws that it is not necessary to refer to at the moment. While not being unmindful of the President's suggestion to set up a Commission to deal with this whole question of local government, I am quite <Col N="1748" /> prepared to believe the statement of the Minister for Local Government that this Bill is not to be taken as the last word in local government, or as a cast-iron measure to deal with that very pressing problem.  I would like to refer just for a moment again to this question of the roads.  In the making of our main roads we must bear in mind that we will be obliged to deal with modern methods of locomotion, and that the main roads in the future will have to be made on a different system altogether to that which was in use up to a short time ago.  If we are to face this question honestly, we must admit that the work cannot be done by counties or districts in the country.  It is a work that will have to be undertaken by the State, and must be made a national charge.  The roads, as they were made in the past, could not support the present traffic with so many three and four-ton lorries carrying heavy loads from one end of the country to another.  We are only in the beginning of this class of traffic, and we will have to make our roads in such a way that they will be able to meet heavy traffic of that kind.  That is an aspect of the question that I hope the Minister will take into consideration. I want to tell him quite frankly that there is no use whatever in tackling this big question in bits and patches, because we do not want to have a Local Government Bill introduced every year.  The Minister, in introducing the Bill, said that the medical officer to be appointed under the Home Health Scheme would be a whole-time officer. He also said that Veterinary Surgeons were to be employed under the County Schemes, but he did not say if these officers were to be whole-time officers.</P>

      <P>That is satisfactory. Deputy Sir James Craig, in the course of his speech, referred to the case of Medical Officers.  He said, if these officers in the discharge of their duty were to report people for having insanitary premises, they would lose their private practice.  I think that is a very far-fetched assertion to make, and if we are to attach the same importance <Col N="1749" /> to that statement of the Deputy's as we are to attach to the other things he said, then I do not think we will believe anything he said.  What we object to is too much centralising of authority with regard to local affairs.  If we are to have all the centralisation that is indicated in various sections of this Bill then I think we had better change the title of it and delete the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;central.&rdquo;  Deputy McGoldrick, when discussing the Bill, made a case for the retention of the District Council.  I am very glad to be in the position to be able to make an even better case for the retention of the District Councils and for their retention on their merits alone.  I do not think that Deputy McGoldrick made a very good case for their retension if we are to take the county of Tirconaill.  In that county, I understand, the rates last year were 15/6 in the pound.  In one part of that county, in Glenties, I believe the rates this year are 14/- in the pound.  I am quite positive that it would be a very good thing, in view of the state of affairs which the rate in that district reveals, if the Glenties District Council were scrapped, and perhaps it would be a good thing if the whole administration in Tirconaill were scrapped. Deputy McGoldrick made some suggestions with regard to the qualifications which candidates for election on the County Council or District Councils should possess.  I did not quite follow his suggestions.  I do not know whether he meant a money qualification or a mental qualification, or as I would prefer to put it, a common honesty qualification.  This is a question that I am not prepared to deal with, as I do not know what the Deputy means by qualification.  The two main questions to be considered in connection with this Bill are the maintenance of the main roads and the abolition of the District Councils.  In regard to the main roads, I would ask the Minister to take into consideration all the facts that have been put before him in connection with this problem, so that we may be able to make suitable arrangements to meet the very heavy traffic that is bound to develop in the future.</P>

      <P>I may say I am in general agreement with the details of this Bill.  On the matter of public health, we could safely agree with Deputy Sir James Craig in welcoming the proposed changes in public health administration in the various counties. On the question of the abolition of the District Councils, I do not agree with the House generally, in thinking it would be a great loss to the country or to local administration to lose them. The question now is not when the District Councils were killed, but the question is who killed them.  Who killed Cock Robin, so to speak.  We all know that the District Councils, to all intents and purposes, came to an end when Sinn Fein decided to centralise the public health in the county homes, and that it is only mere pretence to suggest that the District Councils are in being, any longer, or that there is any necessity for them.  I suggested there is need of an intermediate body required for keeping a liaison between the central authority and the County Councils and District Councils.  Sometime ago, at the General Council of the County Councils, we suggested some kind of body partly nominated and partly drawn from the councils for the particular districts involved. I do not know whether that would be a success or not.  In any case, I do not think the District Councils were a success by any means, at least for the last six or seven years, and it is questionable whether they were before that.  During the past six or seven years District Councils and County Councils did as well as <Col N="1751" /> they could, in the circumstances.  A sea-worthy ship is a ship that weathers the storm.  During the last couple of years the County Councils and District Councils have been through the storm, but they have not weathered that storm, and for that reason I say they are by no means sea-worthy.  I only speak of the system, not the personnel, because I believe we have as good men and administrators, and as good a type of administrators in Ireland as any country in the world.  I believe it was not character or education or administrative training of the men that was the cause of the failure, but rather it was the system under which they were working.</P>
      <P>I am in general agreement with the proposed changes in the matter of detail, such as public health and the abolition of the District Councils, although to my mind, it seems that some body may ultimately be necessary to take their place, but I would not suggest a big elected body.</P>
      <P>On the general principle of the Bill I am not in agreement, because it changes nothing, and while I am more or less satisfied with the Minister's assurance that it is not the last word in local government reform, I feel now that when we are going to make a change, even details, we have big leeway to make up.  If this question of local government is tackled at all it should be tackled from the very foundation. There will be no real work done in the country from the local administration point of view until the whole principle of local government is fundamentally changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very drastic and fundamental changes were carried out in local government by the old Dáil between the Truce and the signing of the Treaty. Most of us who have gone through the Anglo-Irish war here and who saw the working of local government, and who had to do certain things to keep local government from collapsing, so to speak, felt that a drastic change was necessary, and anticipating at the time another storm in Ireland, the then President de Valera agreed to a certain change which had been mooted for <Col N="1752" /> some time, and that was the appointment in each County Council by the Council of the county of a small Executive Council.</P>
    <P>Just when the next war broke out I think these small Executives had been appointed, and the arrangement was beginning to work fairly smoothly, and to show signs of bringing about a great change for the better in the conditions of things in the country, but these beneficial arrangements did not get a chance, and since then nothing has been done to revive the idea, except to some extent in my own county of Sligo, where we appointed a super committee of three to look after the whole administration of the county.  I may say they have done their work very well, and, as far as we were able to go, the arrangement was a very pronounced success.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill before us the number of members of County Councils is to be increased.  We are all agreed that big assemblies, as a rule, do not get through their business, and cannot carry on administration with any great efficiency or feeling of responsibility. The responsibility for carrying out any work devolving on the council is spread over so many heads, and so many pairs of shoulders, that no one feels the responsibility put upon him to any great extent, which is not the same as if you put the responsibility on a particular man.  For instance, as illustrating the idea that I am suggesting, take the case of the Dáil here. If it were to try and carry out the administration in the country without an Executive Council, we can picture for ourselves what chaos and mismanagement that would bring about&mdash;if everyone in this assembly of 100 or 150 Deputies was to take upon himself the responsibility of an executive officer. That just brings home, I think, what you will have in the County Council under the new arrangement with your membership increased by 4, 5 or 10 members, as the case might be.  You will have a much worse state of affairs. The one defect of the old arrangement was they had too many people responsible. Responsibility was spread over too many shoulders to make for efficiency or rapidity of working in the administration of the affairs of the County Council or any other local <Col N="1753" /> body.  What most of us are trying to aspire to is this.  The problem that most reformers wish to secure is more efficiency in the working of the local administration, while giving full consideration to the principle of democracy and representation.  A small Executive Council will take away the defects inherent in a system which provides a big body for administration like the County Councils, and at the same time will allow the views of the people being fully heard and finding full representation on the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexMcCabe" hpid="Mr. McCABE Mr. McCABE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCABE</NameTxt>
      <P>To the County Council itself.  That was the arrangement of the decree of the old Dáil, that they were to be elected by the County Council and be responsible to the County Council.  Now, as regards the one argument that is used against this increase in the number of County Councillors&mdash; that it is inevitable as a consequence of the abolition of the District Councils&mdash; it is an argument that I think can be used against the abolition of the District Councils, that it deprives the residents of a district of any direct voice in the administration of the county.  Under the arrangements made here for an increased representation in the County Council you will have men from all these districts, probably represented in the County Council, and it cannot be said that while these people are represented in the County Councils, as they will be when the membership is increased, that they are deprived of any voice or say in the administration of their own districts.  Now, the question of the payment of members of the County Council has been raised here.  I think a small Executive Committee or Council will be a great advantage.  If you intend to pay a big number of County Councillors every time they come to administer the affairs of a county, it means paying a very substantial sum annually, because the County Councillors will have to come together monthly in order to do the work they will have to do, on account of the abolition of the District Councils and the decentralising of public health.  They will have to be there probably a few times a month.  That would be a fairly big drain on the resources <Col N="1754" /> of the Council.  On the other hand, if you have a small Executive Committee of the Council to carry on the work of administration, see the advantage it is.</P>
      <P>By all means pay the County Councillors when it is necessary for them to come together, and pay the County Councillors what you may call their expenses, if you like, but if there is an Executive Council there to carry out the work of supervising the work of the county, it would not be necessary to bring the Council together more than once every three months to pass estimates, sanction rates, and do other such work.  This would be a great saying to the rates, that is, to bring them together only four or five times a year instead of having to bring them together 12 or even 24 times a year, as the case may be.  I hold that an Executive Committee of the Council would be ideal from the economical point of view.  Then, from another point of view, Deputy McGoldrick mentioned that you wanted a better class of man as administrator. Now, in the County Council you might get 20 to 40 members who would put their heads together and pick out three or four members who would be ideal administrators and as good as the men that are sent down from Dublin to administer local bodies.  The Council would, perhaps, be as successful in selecting men like that, as you would be probably in the Dáil in finding a small body of men to carry out the work of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, before going away from this matter of District Councils, I would like to make a suggestion.  I am not in favour of centralisation to any great extent. I think there should be a little more decentralisation, as Deputy Johnson said here in a previous debate.  From this point of view it gives a good opportunity in getting rid of this question of District Councils.  Why not leave it to the District Councils themselves to find out and give a decision on the subject of the District Councils?  The needs of every county in Ireland are different; they are different in areas and in standards of living, and in poverty and wealth.  Why not give them the choice or give them an opportunity of saying themselves whether they require a change, whether it is necessary to have District Councils in any particular area <Col N="1755" /> to make local government a success?  I think that would be an ideal arrangement for getting rid of this question of District Councils.  That is the line that the Ministry for Local Government should take in dealing with that subject.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads, I agree with Deputy Gorey and other Deputies.  The General Council of County Councils and my own Council in Sligo have given a lot of consideration to the question of roads, and especially to the question of arterial roads, roads connecting cities with other cities.  These should be made a State charge, that is to say, all these big arteries linking up Dublin and Belfast, Dublin and Galway, Galway and Limerick, Limerick and Cork. These roads should be taken up at once and worked as a State charge, as an experiment. I believe it would be an experiment with a promise of success. Most of the Deputies here spoke at length of the desirability of improving the roads and the necessity for it.  I will not dwell on it further than saying that the condition of the roads may be taken as an index of the progress a country is making.  Arrangements should be made under the new Bill for making these State charges, that is, that the State should take over charge of the arterial roads and make them a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Although a countryman, I would like to say a word as to the Dublin Corporation and the arrangements for the government of our capital city.  I do so just as one interested in the capital of the country.  There is no one in any part of Ireland, I believe, who is not more or less interested in the capital. It is a reflex of the whole life and character of the country, its national activity, and its development, economic and artistic, and everything that touches the nation is reflected in the capital of this country, more so in fact, than in any other capital in Europe, because I believe there is not another capital in Europe in which the political and economic and manufacturing and artistic life of the country is so much concentrated as in this capital of ours. Now, on that account the administration of the capital and the areas of Greater Dublin are matters of deep interest to every Irishman.  Everyone <Col N="1756" /> takes an interest in the progress of the capital city, and I think there is a special reason in pleading for exceptional treatment for Dublin in the new Local Government Bill.  I believe that not only should very special consideration be given it by the Commission which the President has promised to set up, but it should get a Commission of its own. Dublin is a city that is rapidly extending its border.  It is gradually encroaching on the County Dublin, and it is bound to increase.  It is increasing by a few thousand every year.  In the course of 10 or 20 years you will see the population of Dublin exceeding 500,000.</P>
    <P>Now to give the city full room for expansion and to give those people who have plans for a Greater Dublin Scheme and for beautifying the city and for bettering the condition of the people, more scope for their activities, the County of Dublin should come in for special consideration and, if possible, there should be one body for the administration of the whole county; at least there should be a liaison body so as to make it easy for the borough authorities to secure grounds, if necessary, for the extension of the city boundary.  I am glad to see that the President has not lost sight of the question of a remission of rates in favour of industries in the country.  I have already suggested this to the Minister for Local Government, and I have requested that a clause be inserted in the Bill to this effect.  There is a number of industries badly in need of a stimulus of some kind.  It is particularly within the power of the County Councils to stimulate those industries and to bring them into life again.  I think it would be an ideal form of protection to give the County Councils authority to give a remission of rates in these cases.  It will mean no loss.  I can anticipate the argument that it means putting an extra burden on the ratepayers' shoulders.  In a few cases that I have in mind, factories are paying no rates at all.  If industries are revived in the country they will be paying some rates, so that it will be a gain in most cases.  I am glad this question of local government is not going to be rushed, and that it will be made the subject of long thought and deliberation, and there will be ample opportunity given for discussion.  It is a vital question <Col N="1757" /> for the future of the country, and I am glad to note that the President has suggested that a Commission should consider the Bill and make any changes that it thinks are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a rather difficult position.  There are some parts of this Bill which I very much approve of, and which I believe are badly needed in the country.  I speak particularly with reference to an independent doctor or, if you like to call him so, a medical supervisor for the county. He is very much needed.  I entirely agree with Deputy Craig when he says that the local doctor could not do much independently.  It is quite possible that he may have living next door to him another local doctor who is not the dispensary doctor.  The local doctor might not like condemning numbers of houses belonging to what we may describe as paying patients.  With all respect to the local doctors, I believe they may find it difficult to do that.  I approve of the Local Government Department appointing an independent doctor, because I know from experience that such an appointment is necessary. Take the case of poor people who are forced to live in a particular type of house in the villages and towns.  Those houses are condemned, and I believe the law, as it at present stands, is that once a house is condemned as not being in a habitable condition, the District Councils or the Urban Councils are empowered to improve the house and make the owner pay for the improvement, so that the person living in the house would be saved from disease and from the danger of disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain an independent doctor would look after that matter in a special manner.  From year to year numbers of houses are condemned.  The custom is that when a tenant comes out and has to get a labourer's cottage because his other house is condemned, in pops another tenant, and in due course he would go out, and still another would come and take possession.  It might happen that a consumptive family would be taken away from a house to a sanatorium, and another family would come to occupy the house. We know the results that would follow. Deputy Wolfe referred to County Kildare, where, he said, tinkers might <Col N="1758" /> destroy the health of the district.  In my opinion it would be a new cure for consumption if people got inoculated with tinkers' blood, because tinkers are really very healthy.</P>

      <P>It is something for science.  I agree with my friend, Deputy Gorey, when he says that instead of abolishing the Rural Councils we should widen their powers and give them more to do.  There is nobody knows more about a district than the District Councillor; that is the reason he is so called.  In my county, which I believe is about 100 miles square, what would a man from Bantry Bay know about affairs in Araglen?  He would not do on the Health Committee.  It is not necessary or mandatory that a person on the Public Health Committee, appointed from the County or District Councils, should be elected from the district. That is not portion of the Bill, I believe.  I have had experience for years of County and District Councils, and I believe that instead of abolishing the Rural Councils you should take away from the County Councils a lot of the powers that they have and allocate those powers to the District Councils. You thus save yourselves the trouble of adding another lot of pensioners to the long list that we have already to support.</P>
      <P>District Councils would have a better local knowledge, and the councillors would know more about the local water supply, naturally, than a man living miles away.  If a question was raised about a well, there would be no use in a man saying it was never-failing when the local District Councillor would know to the contrary.  A man living 40 miles away would see the well giving a good supply at this time of the year, but he would not know how it would work at other periods of the year.  It would be undemocratic that people living in a particular district should be told &ldquo;there may be fellows living amongst you, but you will not have the privilege of electing them, because either you do not know who they are, or you are afraid to elect the right man.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a slight cast on the <Col N="1759" /> people of the district.  I was certain when the President said the other day that he proposed to appoint a Commission that it was all over for some time at least.  But it is not.  Deputy McCabe pointed out that for the last four or five years Rural Councils had not done their work.  I would like to point out that these Councils were war councils, if you like to call them so.  All the other administrators stood aside and let the young men in as a kind of war necessity.  If these young men, who did their honest best, failed in a small way, they have no right to be condemned, because in those dark and evil days they risked their lives and liberties in administering these Councils.  I would agree to have the power of the County Councils reduced and the power of the District Councils increased.  That would not mean any increase in the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>The business of the counties would go on as well, and even better, than heretofore.  The last four years should not be taken as a criterion of the working of the Rural Councils. The times were abnormal.  Good work was done by the Rural Councils in the preceding years.  Roads were improved; local boreens were made into roads; village pathways were paved; water supplies and other improvements, which tended to the betterment of the health of the people, were provided by the Councils.  Deputy Wolfe said he had a kind of sneaking affection for the Rural Councils. I confess I was in love with them because they did much good, especially in building cottages for the poor people.  While I disagree with the abolition of the Rural Councils I entirely agree with the proposal to have a full-time Medical Officer of Health in each county.  I hope there will be two or three in the County Cork, because they are absolutely necessary.  If, under the law at present, owners of houses can be compelled to put them into a sanitary condition, and if for failure to do that the houses can be taken over by the Rural or Urban Council, that law must have been stillborn, <Col N="1760" /> because I never heard of its being put into operation.  I ask the Local Government Department to put that law into operation and to see that it is made mandatory, which it will be, if this Bill passes.  We will hail with delight the appointment of full-time Medical Officers of Health in the different districts.  I hope in the further consideration of this Bill that it will not be forgotten that Cork was the first county in Ireland to build a sanatorium. We feel that there is £13,500 due to us for the building of that sanatorium, and I hope that the Ministry will in justice see that a section is inserted recouping us for that expenditure.</P>

      <P>In view of the statement made by the President, that it was his intention to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the matters dealt with in this Bill, it is very hard to see why the time of the Dáil is being taken up with the consideration of the different proposals. If we have to get through twenty-nine Bills between this and the 4th July, I think that every moment that can be saved ought to be saved on measures such as this.  I cannot see the reason for taking up time discussing a measure of this kind which is to be the subject of an inquiry and report by a Commission.  I do not intend to follow the previous speakers into all the details of local government. I am sure if the closure is not applied, we will be still talking about the different details on the 4th July next.  However, there is one matter in this Bill which is very vital to the trade of the country.  It is a question that has been referred to by several speakers, and there seems to be a unanimous opinion among those I have heard, that the proposals in the Bill with regard to roadways are not satisfactory.  We have been considering for some weeks past, in another measure, the question of traffic, and it has been urged by a Minister, whom we are all glad to see present, that in the interests of traffic we should do away with a large number of Boards of Directors, railway managers, engineers, etc., in order to reduce the overhead expenses that that traffic will have to carry.  The volume of traffic that is carried by the roadways is of very great importance.  It is an increasing <Col N="1761" /> traffic.  It will be a very much larger traffic in the future.  What does this Bill propose?  It proposes that these roadways, over which this traffic will pass, should be administered by twenty-six county authorities, and I do not know how many urban authorities. If we had not been discussing the other measure so recently, and had not got the different arguments so freshly in our minds in connection with that measure, we could possibly understand the reason for putting forward this one. But here we are, one week trying to do away with this large number of directors, engineers, etc., and the next week proposing to deal with traffic in another form through the medium of this large number of boards of directors, because, when you come to roadways, they are nothing more or less than directors.  I think it is exceedingly unwise that we should have these roadways, which are of vast importance to commerce, administered by so many different bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a good many of the roadways of Ireland, particularly the main roadways. Some of the bodies in control are fit to administer roadways, but a great many, on the other hand, know very little about such matters.  When one comes to the question of the charges for the maintenance of the roads, it is there one really sees the injustice of the proposals put forward in this Bill.  Let us consider one aspect of it.  That is where the Bill mentions that urban authorities out of the rates are to maintain the roadways in their areas.  Many of the Deputies are conversant with the duties of urban authorities.  They know that many of the roadways in connection with the city of Dublin run through the areas of two urban authorities, and that seventy-five to eighty per cent. of the traffic&mdash;and, mark you, the heavy traffic which does most of the damage &mdash;passes through these areas.  These urban authorities have to maintain roads for traffic, out of which they get no income whatsoever.  Now, I think it is inequitable to put up such a proposal. It appears to me that the only way such a problem could be dealt with is by concentrating the administration of the roadways under one authority, instead of having it under <Col N="1762" /> different local authorities.  The question will then arise as to how the money that is to be administered by that one authority will be levied.  A certain amount of it might be levied from various local authorities, but I think a greater portion of it might be levied off the users of the roadways than is the case at present.  Take, for example, cyclists, who are, I suppose, the greatest critics of our roads, and, some of them, of our pathways.  I do not know that cyclists, as road users, contribute anything to the upkeep of the roadways.  One could mention other forms of traffic with which we are familiar, that should be made contribute to road maintenance.  The problem is one, I think, that might very properly be the subject of inquiry by a Commission.  As the result of such inquiry by an impartial Commission, we will, I think, have different proposals to the ones put forward in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill because I believe that, with some amendment, it will lead to economy and efficiency.  I am in favour of the abolition of the Rural District Councils because the Bill will lead to centralisation, and a relief from the heavy burden of taxation.  Some Deputies spoke in favour of devolution, but, looking at the Act of 1918, under which there was devolution go leor, you had three independent bodies striking rates.  If you have three bodies in each county striking rates the result will be that they will lose sight of the main fact, that is, the capacity of the ratepayers to pay.  It has been urged in the Dáil repeatedly that the Budget must balance.  If that is the national slogan, it is much more important that the local Budgets should balance, and that they should be within the capacity of the ratepayers.  In County Limerick the farmers are practically unanimous in favour of the proposal to abolish District Councils.  The Farmers' Association took a plebiscite, and they found that ninety per cent. of the members were in agreement with the abolition of the District Councils, believing that the existence of three independent rate-striking bodies in a county leads to extravagance.  Centralisation is the only way to come to <Col N="1763" /> grips with the present heavy burden of taxation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the President's suggestion to refer the Bill to a Commission, I certainly would not approve, because it would lead to the postponing of the elections, and that is a thing which the ratepayers would not favour.  They are all anxiously looking forward to an opportunity to have a fresh election, to have a chance to change their representatives, because certainly the rates they are called upon to pay now are altogether out of proportion to what they can meet.  The President said that the elections would be held in July or October.  You would have a County Council two-thirds of which would be new, and one-third would be composed of the Chairmen of the different District Councils in the county, and I do not think that would be feasible.  Another thing is that in that case, if the Commission recommended the Bill I do not see how you could have it, because in the Bill if the District Councils are abolished you would be increasing the membership of the County Councils.  Taking the whole Bill with amendments, I certainly say that it will give great relief to the ratepayers if an amendment to Section 21 is accepted by the Government to make the main roads a national charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the rare occasions in which I find myself in agreement with Deputy Good.  I agree with him on the question of roads, and also with his views regarding the saving of time if it were decided that the whole question would be referred to a Commission.  As far as I am concerned, I would not waste another moment of the time of the Dáil if the Minister agreed to accept the President's suggestion, together with the suggestion of Deputy Magennis, and if he agreed to an amendment not to take any steps to abolish the Rural District Councils. But seeing that he has not given us that assurance, we can only assume that he intends to do his best to have the Bill carried.  I think most people who have studied the question will agree that the main and trunk roads should be under a national authority. <Col N="1764" /> As a matter of fact, many people during the last dozen years or so have come to the conclusion that a great deal of transit will be done by motors, and it is considered by experts who have given a good deal of time to the matter and have carried out experiments extending over a number of years, that transit of goods up to a distance of 200 miles is more economical by motor than by railways, where the roads are good.  It is only when it comes to a case of 400 miles that railways are more economical than roads. This is a small country, and most of the journeys would be under the 200 miles limit.  It is very necessary for the future development of the country that motor traffic should be encouraged, and in order to do that the very first thing to be done would be to make the roads fit for motor traffic.</P>
      <P>Deputy Professor Magennis said that he was quite in agreement with the President's suggestion regarding a Commission, but pointed out that a Special Commission should be set up to deal with the question of Greater Dublin. Three or four Deputies have stated that Dublin differs considerably from the capitals of all other countries; that it is more important to Ireland than any other capital is to its own country; that it is the biggest industrial centre; it is the seat of government; the seat of education; that on account of the existence of so many bodies which are overlapping in the work of conducting the business of the city a Special Commission should be set up to consider the whole question; and that there would be such an amount of work to be done by this Commission, that it would take at least three or four months to arrive at any proper conclusion as to what should be done regarding Dublin alone. Therefore, I say I am in agreement with the suggestion of the President to send the whole question of local government to a Commission, on condition that a Special Commission should be set up to deal with the question of Dublin city and suburbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to see included in the Bill on which I disagree with the Minister for Local Government, and that is the question we discussed last year, of the payment of rates.  I would like to see a <Col N="1765" /> provision inserted in the Bill for the payment of rates on houses of a valuation of £4 or under, to be made by the landlord.  In very many cases at present the landlords are not paying the rates on these small houses; the tenants cannot pay, and the result is that the rates are not paid at all.  The rate collectors cannot distrain on any property to get the amount due, for the very good reason that the people, through unemployment and other causes, have not any property that is worth seizing, and public bodies lose a certain amount as a result of that.  There should be a provision that the owners of houses with a valuation of less than £4, should be compelled to pay the rates instead of the tenants.</P>
    <P>Another thing that I am in disagreement with is the abolition of the rural district councils.  A good deal has been said here about the rural district councils, and I daresay any of us, if we wished, could put forward very good reasons for their abolition, if we considered them principally from the point of view of the membership of these councils.  But I would like to point out that the members of the present councils were elected in 1920, principally because of their express willingness to refuse to recognise the British Local Government Board, and that that appeared at that time to be the only qualification that was necessary for membership.  Deputy Gorey mentioned what the qualifications of members of county councils should be in the future.  He wanted to know would they be a mental or a property qualification, and another Deputy asked would the qualifications be physical or muscular.  He was trying to be jocose when he said that.  The only qualification that was necessary, and that was asked and given by the majority of members of rural district councils when they were elected four years ago, was that they would refuse to recognise the British Local Government Board, and that they would do their best to prevent the functioning of British authority.  We have the remnants of that at present in some of the Rural district councils and county councils; one in which I am particularly interested refused to function for a long <Col N="1766" /> time past until very recently, because the majority of the members were Republicans and were against the present Government, and they refused to carry out the ordinary work of the council because they did not recognise the right of the Government and the Dáil to function.  That is not an argument against district councils; it is only an argument in favour of an early election; it is only an argument in favour of giving people an opportunity of electing men and women who will do their best, irrespective of their political beliefs, to carry out the work for which they are elected.  I do not think that the fact that they have been acting as they have been for some time past is a justification for the abolition of the rural district councils, and, therefore, I am against that particular proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Egan has stated that there were something like 4,000 officials employed by the rural district councils in Ireland, and that the abolition of the councils would make for economy.  I saw a letter in one of this morning's papers; I do not pay much attention to letter usually, but I think this may have some bearing on the matter.  The writer said that the rural district council, of which he was a member, has a valuation of £85,000; a staff composed of five medical officers, five sanitary subofficers, an engineer, a solicitor, a clerk, and an assistant, a total of 14, and that the Local Government Department put down the number of officials as 43.  The writer pointed out that the five sanitary sub-officers also acted as dairy inspectors and rent collectors, and that the Local Government Department counted them as 15 officers, because each of them did three particular classes of work. There were also included in the district 26 graveyards, each of which had a caretaker employed at a very huge salary of £1 per annum.  These caretakers had to open the gates when people were going to be buried, perhaps once or twice in a week, and being paid £1 per annum to perform that duty, they were considered as officers.  If those offices are to be abolished I do not think we will effect very great economy by that.  Even apart from that these caretakerships will not be abolished, because somebody must open the graveyard gates for funerals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> I want to say one thing in favour of the Bill.  Section 28, the Definition Section, states that &ldquo;pensionable officer&rdquo; means any permanent officer who devotes the whole of his time to the services of one or more local authorities. I think, whether or not a Commission is set up to deal with this question, that it is advisable that that definition should be continued.  I have in mind one or two cases in which I was interested, one in particular, and that was a rate collector who was employed by a county council, about fourteen-fifteenths of his time, and by an urban council, inside the county council area, for about one-fifteenth of his time.  After giving 36 years' service as a whole-time employee of these bodies, when both decided that he should get as large a pension as it was legal for them to give him, the Local Government Department turned down the proposal on the ground that as he was an employee of two public boards, he was not a full-time employee of either, and was not entitled to a pension. I think that the law, even as it stands, states that a certain amount of allowance should be made in a case like that.  I think that as well as keeping this Definition Section in, even after the Commission has decided on the matter, the Minister should take some steps to see that the four or five cases similar to that which I have mentioned, should be included in the Bill, and that, simply because the law in the past stated one thing without having regard to the facts and the situation, injustice should not be done.</P>

      <P>I feel like apologising to the House for taking up its time in general in discussing this matter further.  But, as we have not got any definite statement as to whether the Commission will inquire into this matter, it seems to me that this should be thrashed out, and that the opinions of the people throughout the country should be given effect to in this House. We may here say a great many things which are not of the slightest importance from the Minister's point of view, but we may give him one or two little ideas which may be of use to him in local government matters in the country in the <Col N="1769" /> future.  I agree with Deputy Daly with regard to this Bill, in that it is like the curate's egg; it is good in parts, but that it is difficult to tell the parts that are good from the parts that are bad.  The parts I think are good are thought by other Deputies to be bad. Still, I think there are good points in it, and that if it is thoroughly threshed out we will have a Bill which will be of advantage to local government administration in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the abolition of district councils, although I am in close touch with the people, I find it difficult to get information as to their feelings on this matter.  Some people want abolition and others do not, but taking everything into account, I am inclined to think, in the circumstances, and with the changes that have taken place, that it is necessary either to abolish district councils or to change their duties considerably. If they are not abolished, some form of devolution should take place.  Some power at present held by the county councils should be devolved on the district councils, so that they may get something worth while to do, or in the absence of the devolution of power a step in the other direction should take place.  District councils should be made much smaller, and if necessary, amalgamated; but at any rate attempts should be made to maintain local representation which we have at the present time by means of district councils. Whether that can be maintained or not is the whole question, because there are many matters of local importance which cannot be dealt with by men who are at a considerable distance from the area about which they are to speak.  From the point of view of the farmers, I would say that they look upon the local government business at the present time largely from the point of view of rates. We do not look on it altogether from the point of view of rates, because we maintain there are necessary local services which should be maintained, but we believe that those services have been maintained at an unnecessarily high expenditure.  Something must be done immediately to rectify the present misgovernment in local affairs.  Our people are being forced to pay rates altogether beyond their ability to produce at the present time, and unless those responsible <Col N="1770" /> for local government wake up to that fact they will find themselves this year or very soon, in such a position that they will not be able to collect the rates assessed on the people.  I live in a county which is not at all highly rated, and we have had in some of those districts in the course of this normal year, to pay a rate over 200 per cent. higher than the rate of 1914.  I do not wish to bore the House by going into details as to what profits farmers are making, but we are not making 100 per cent. or 50 per cent. higher than 1914, and yet we are forced to pay in some cases rates over 200 per cent. higher. That position cannot be continued, but I must confess that on reading this Bill I do not see that the position is going to be changed.  There is not anything in this Bill to cause a great reduction in rates.  Certain recommendations have been made by the Agricultural Commission, and I am sure the Minister had those recommendations in his hands at the time this Bill was drafted.</P>
    <P>It was recommended by that Commission that the trunk roads and the asylums should be made a national charge, and not maintained as a county charge any longer.  I do not notice any provision in the Bill to carry these recommendations into effect, and if there is any use in setting up Commissions and any advantage in men devoting weeks and months of their time to these Commissions, at least an effort should be made to carry out their recommendations. With regard to the amalgamation of unions, we have been told a great deal about the wonderful economies which are to result and which are resulting from this amalgamation. There is considerable doubt as to the economies which are resulting. Some maintain that no economies have been effected, and others that economies have been effected, but I believe the economies which are being effected are, to a certain extent, being mixed up with economies which would naturally take place owing to the fall in prices, and also to collective buying. I am not going to condemn amalgamation of unions, for I think it was absolutely necessary, but I think it might have been carried out in a much more effective and efficient manner.  We have in the counties young and capable <Col N="1771" /> officials being sent out on pension. There is no reason in the world why these people should not have been provided with proper employment under the new changes which are being made, and there is no reason why new men should be taken in and given pensionable jobs, and men who are still young, active and physically fit to carry on that work should be allowed to go out on pension.  Of course, the claim might be made that the duties are not the same as they have been accustomed to, and that these men are not capable of performing those duties.  I think that line of reasoning can be carried too far.  It is wonderful what duties a man can perform when absolute necessity forces it upon him.  That is a fact well known in other countries.  It is well known in America.  You will find successful men in America who have had nine or ten different jobs in their lives, and these jobs were almost diametrically different, and yet they have carried them out quite successfully. Now, we find one man who is one kind of a clerk in one part of the county, who, it is suggested, is not capable of being another kind of a clerk in another part of the county. That system has become a scandal, and we are packing the country with people who are still capable of doing efficient work, but who are going out on pension.  More than that, these men who go out are going into the ordinary labour market competing with others who have to make their living altogether by their individual jobs.  These pensionable men are prepared to work at a smaller salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With the leave of the Chair. There is this point which, I think, would be very much in order, and that is the appointment of officials to the local boards in the future.  That is a system of appointment which I think might reasonably be brought into a Bill dealing with local government officials.  I wish to say in that regard that when the present district councils and the old county councils were first elected, and when there was something extraordinary in regard to the method by which they worked, and the wonderful purity in their administration, it was then stated that local appointments were to be filled by competitive examination, and I believe a very genuine attempt <Col N="1773" /> was made to fill those appointments by competitive examination for a time.  That system, in my opinion, has been dropped altogether, and I think it very advisable that the Minister should consider the question of getting into this Bill something which may have the effect of causing these appointments to be filled in future by some form of competitive examination. The ordinary forms of competitive examination will not be effective.  I am aware that you will get a young boy out of school who will beat a man who has years of experience in business work, but who has lost the brightness of his school education.  I suggest to the Minister that there is the possibility of working along lines like those, that is, that he should establish a local civil service, and that for that civil service all appointments should be filled by competitive examinations from outside sources, and in that local civil service promotions should be made by means of the ordinary methods of promotion and seniority.  That would eliminate one of the greatest difficulties of the local man doing local work&mdash;and that is caused by the system of canvassing.  My experience of men who go into local boards is that they go into them in most cases with every intention to do their best to run the boards as they ought to be run, but as time goes on they find pressure brought to bear from one side or another, family influence here and family influence there, so that in the end it is almost impossible for these men not to respond to the influences brought to bear upon them.  I think if the possibilities for such influences were removed the administration of the local boards would be much more efficient in the future.  One other point before I finish.  I would suggest to the Minister this&mdash;that an effort should be made to combine the administrative authorities with the spending authorities, so that those who administer will be also those who will spend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find in this Bill that the Board of Health is the administrative authority, to a large extent, but it is not the authority which strikes the rate.  It will, apparently, make a demand on the county council, and the county council will be forced, to a large extent, to <Col N="1774" /> meet that demand.  The result will be that we shall have a shuffling of responsibility. At present, we have the district council saying that they did not strike the rates and that they are not responsible for the rates, and the county council say that they got an estimate from the district council; and nobody can tell who is finally responsible for the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the members of the Dáil have reason to complain of the position in which they have been placed by the Government.  In the first place, we have the Minister for Local Government introducing the Bill and recommending it to the Dáil for adoption: and then we have the President practically acknowledging that the Bill is not one which the Dáil should be asked to adopt, inasmuch as he suggested that it should be transferred to a Commission to examine its provisions, and, I daresay, to make up for its shortcomings.  One would think that the logical course to adopt, when the President made that suggestion, was to withdraw the Bill.</P>
      <P>Now, as to the Bill itself and its merits, none of us, I think, will deny that there are many good features in the Bill.  But, on the other hand, there are grave omissions.  What I regard as a great blot upon it, is the omission of any provision for the upkeep of the main roads of the country as a national charge.  That point has been very well put before the Dáil by Deputy Good and Deputy Gorey, and it is not necessary for me to dwell upon it.  But the county which I represent has a particular grievance in that regard.  The whole heavy lorry traffic of the South and West passes over the main roads of the county Kildare, involving very large expenditure indeed.  As Deputy Gorey has said, the present system of road maintenance is a failure.  I know a trunk road in County Kildare which, not more than twelve months ago, was steam-rolled and tarred at very great expense.  That road is just as much in need to-day of reconstruction as it was twelve months ago.  That shows that the present system of road repair cannot be pursued with economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the abolition of district councils, I must say that the feeling <Col N="1775" /> in my part of the country is altogether against the proposal.  We think that the district councils, which have done very good work in the past, would be able to do very good work still, if their powers were enlarged.  Complaints have been made, of course, as to extravagance and maladministration on the part of some of those councils.  I must say that as far as my observation went&mdash; and I was a member of a district council for a good many years&mdash;I can bear testimony to the fact that every single item of expenditure was criticised most closely, and the strictest economy observed.  Deputy Professor Magennis argued that the people are not sufficiently educated to fill the office of district councillors.  Well, on the point of education, although charges may be made, with justice, against some district councils, we must recollect that they are not the only bodies which have been accused of misdemeanours of that sort.  We find, in the United States, for instance, that members of high Government departments have had such charges launched against them.  So that it is not so much the composition of the district councils that is at fault, as the want of sufficient powers on account of recent changes.  Whether things would be improved so much if the people were kept in a state of tutelage for an indefinite term of years, as Deputy Professor Magennis suggests is a matter upon which I am not competent to offer an opinion.  I do not know whether the learned Deputy would attach very much importance to the opinion of Dr. Johnson with regard to scholars.</P>

      <P>That writer has given his opinion in this way: &ldquo;Scholars whom I have found a harmless and inoffensive order of beings, not much wiser than ourselves.&rdquo;  However, that may be, we all would welcome an improved standard of national education being set up; but, at the same time, we ought not to wait for that in order to give the people control over their own domestic affairs.  The argument that the Irish people were unfitted for such control is a stock one.  We have had it <Col N="1776" /> trotted out for generations.  It was urged in the Home Rule controversy by the English Die-hards.  It was used against Mr. Balfour when he was establishing those very district councils which are now proposed to be scrapped.  I will conclude by saying that it is only due to the Dáil that the Government should extricate us from the very unpleasant position in which we have been placed by an announcement that the Bill will be consigned to a Commission which, I hope, will not prove a Limbo from which it shall not emerge.</P>

      <P>I would have saved the Dáil the trouble of listening to the few brief observations that I have to make if I could have ascertained from the Minister, when he was asked the question, whether or not he wished to press this measure to a division.  I listened very carefully to the President a couple of nights ago&mdash;I do not claim to have that intelligence which other members of the Dáil are gifted with&mdash; and it appeared to me that his speech from beginning to end, so far as I could follow it, was an entire repudiation of the whole Bill.  If that is the case, I should have expected that the Minister for Local Government, who is an extern Minister responsible to this Dáil, who knows the influence that is behind the President when he talks in a definite manner of that kind, who knows the amount of support that he can control when he wishes to force his views upon the House&mdash;I should have expected that the Minister would, for that reason, have got up immediately afterwards and said that he was prepared to withdraw the Bill.  We have been in this and in the Third Dáil working very hard, dealing with legislation of an emergency nature, Bills having been turned out in a machine-made way, for the purpose of making it appear to the people that the Government was anxious to create a civic spirit, a spirit of civic responsibility. They have, in many ways, other than by methods of persuasion, endeavoured to make people believe that that was their object.  This Bill serves quite an opposite purpose, in my opinion.  Instead of creating a spirit of civic responsibility, the object of the Bill is to remove all idea that there is any <Col N="1777" /> such impression, or any such thing in the minds of the Government.  The question of district councils is a very contentious part of this whole Bill.  I have, personally an open mind as to what should be done, under normal conditions, based upon the experience of the working of such councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Nagle rightly said that the councils elected in 1920 were not elected because they had, or were required to have, any business qualifications. They were elected because they were prepared to answer the call of the Government which was acting on behalf of the Irish people at the time, and because they were prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to interrupt and impede the administration of the British Government which was in force at that time in the country.  It is not long since we had the statement from President Cosgrave that the business men in the country were of the antique furniture type which would not even serve the purpose of decorating an ordinary assembly.  If there is not any business qualifications amongst the people going to administer the law in this country, then this question of electing business men on county councils and on boards of public health in future is all bunkum.  We hear one day that there is no real business type of man in the country, but when the Government comes along with a Bill of this kind we are told that it is our duty to put business men only on the councils, although the Government themselves have said that no such thing as a proper type of business man exists.  It appears to me to be very contradictory to say one day that there is no proper type of business man in this country, and then to argue on the following day that the proper people to elect on those bodies are business men.  I think the Government should not press any clause in a Bill of this kind which means the abolition of district councils, without first having proper experience of the working of such councils under normal conditions.  We all know that during the last four or five years the conditions were not normal in this country.  I wonder did the Minister, when he sought the votes of the electors of Tipperary at the last election, when he headed the poll in that particular <Col N="1778" /> area, tell the people of Tipperary that he and those behind him, if elected as a Government, would support a revolutionary measure of this kind?  I am certain sure he did not. They sought the votes of the electors in the different constituencies simply on the plea that they stood for the Treaty and were prepared to make use of the machinery which they secured through the Treaty in the best interests of the people of the country. It would be the duty of a Government seeking the votes of the people under normal conditions to tell them that it was their intention to bring in a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>I contend that if the Minister and the Government had done that at the last election, or had done it under normal conditions, that the people of Tipperary would not have given the Minister the majority he had secured at the last election.  That is a very good reason, in my opinion, why the Minister for Local Government should not press this measure further in the way that he apparently intends to do.  Deputy Hogan, to whom we listened with very great pleasure for the first time, appears to be labouring under a certain amount of ignorance with regard to the powers exercised by district councils, especially on this question of the striking of the rates.  I have never been honoured with a seat on a county council or a district council, and I may say here and now that I have no ambition in that direction, but from the knowledge at my disposal, I believe that district councils have always exercised the right to frame estimates and submit them for the consideration of the county council.  Only in a very few cases, as far as my information goes, has the county council attempted to turn down the estimates prepared and submitted to it by the district council. To that extent, at any rate, the district councillors who are the local representatives of the ratepayers should certainly have the power to strike the local rate.  Any government in the world that pretends to govern on democratic lines should have it as an object to extend the administration of the law as far as they possibly can to the whole of the people.  In that way, and in that way only, will a government <Col N="1779" /> succeed in creating a civic spirit and a sense of responsibility among the people themselves.  The adoption of such a course will give the people confidence in the Government that makes the laws for the country.</P>
    <P>I hold that the administration of the law is equally as important, if not more so, than the making of the laws, and for that reason, and particularly at this time, a measure of this kind will not receive the general approval of the ratepayers or the community as a whole.  A suggestion was made by the President that the matter should be referred to a Commission.  In making that suggestion, he rather indicated that the Commission should not be composed of members of the Dáil.  I feel quite certain that there are many Deputies who have such experience of local government administration as would fit them for membership of a Commission that is to go into the whole question of local government administration in the future.  I have a very strong objection to matters of this kind being referred to a Commission composed principally of officials.  We had too much of that type of officialism during the British regime, and even under the present system in this country.  I object to matters of this kind being referred to the type of mind which was in charge of the British administration in this country, of men who cannot see even up to the present time that it is the will of the people that must prevail and that must be respected, and not the will of the official type of men who in their offices are cut away altogether from contact with the ordinary citizen outside.  I would suggest to the Minister that the whole question of the future of local government administration in the country, and the future even of the district councils as to whether or not they serve any useful purpose or whether they do any useful work in the interests of the people who elect them to public positions, should be a matter for the Commission to go into, and not the mere question relating to the City of Dublin or the composition of the county councils.  I did not intend to trouble the Dáil with any remarks of mine if the Minister had indicated that he was prepared to withdraw <Col N="1780" /> the Bill and leave the matter of the local government administration to a Committee appointed by the Dáil.  I hope he will see the wisdom of adopting such a course, because I can see, if this question of the Second Reading of the Bill is forced to a division, President Cosgrave going into one lobby and bringing behind him the influence that the Executive Council commands, and the Minister for Local Government going into the minority lobby to support the Bill which, as far as I can learn, has not the approval of the general body of the people of this country at the present time.</P>

      <P>In rising to support the motion that this Bill should get a second reading I may say at the outside that I think Deputy Davin will be rudely disappointed when he sees which lobby the President will go into in case of a division and which lobby the Minister for Local Government will go into. I think that on this occasion he will find both Ministers in the same lobby.  I may say that while I am supporting this Bill I am doing so on the grounds that it contains many good things, which in my opinion outweigh some of the things that objection has been taken to by some Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because while I am not entirely in favour of the abolition of rural councils I think some scheme could be worked out, or some amendment could be put into the Bill, that would give such bodies such rights as they have, and I am convinced such a body as the rural district council, if not the district council, should be in existence, because I believe the county councils have quite as much work to do at the present time, if they are to do it properly and well, as will keep them going.  Therefore, I think some body must exist between the county council <Col N="1781" /> and the ratepayers for carrying out the necessary work.  I also agree with several Deputies who have spoken, that the main roads through the country should be nationalised, because in small bodies like the county councils you will never get them of the same mind as to what should or should not be done as regards these main trunk roads.  While it may not be possible, at the moment, from the point of view of the Exchequer, to spend large sums of money without some contribution from the local rates, I think the time has come when these roads must be nationalised, and when the country as a whole must pay for them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Bill there is a simplification of procedure with regard to land that has to be acquired for local purposes.  The procedure hitherto that had to be adopted particularly in urban districts was very cumbersome and very costly and very tedious, and the simplification of that procedure in this Bill, to my mind, will be a great thing for the urban district councils and for cities such as Dublin, Cork and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There was a point touched upon by Deputy Nagle with which I am in entire agreement, and that is the question of rates on small dwellings.  I do not know whether it will be possible to bring a matter of that kind into the Bill or not, or whether it requires some other legislation, but I know from experience that the sooner some amendment is made in the law in that respect the better it will be for urban districts.  I know the loss every year to the ratepayers of the urban districts because of the inability of people living in these hovels to pay the amount of the town rate and the poor rate assessed upon them.  These rates are a loss that have to be wiped out and then they have to be re-assessed on people who can pay them.  Hitherto, and since the passing of the Act of 1898, a considerable portion of the landlords did pay these rates and collected them in rent from the small dwellers, but recently, when the rates went up considerably, the landlords refused to pay them, and the consequence was that no rate collectors could enforce the payment of rates on these smaller dwellings. I know several instances where <Col N="1782" /> there were landlords with several small takes on yearly systems of two or three pounds a year.  The people had to keep the houses in repair, and the landlord paid the rates up to a few years ago. Now he refuses, and I know that fully 10 per cent. of these rates cannot be collected, and that they are a dead loss to the town of which I speak.  The same thing applies to other towns.  I would be glad if any proposal could be put into this Bill, or any other Bill, that might be brought forward, to seriously deal with these questions of local rates.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Good who said urban areas get nothing at all from the central authority.  As a matter of fact urban areas have got their share of the grant this year and they got their share before, but Deputy Good would like, I think, to tax everybody that comes into an urban area.  He would like to tax the bicycle and the farmer's cart and everything, in fact.  He does not seem to think for a moment that these people are, perhaps, a necessity to the dwellers in the town.  If they did not come in what would the people do?  People are taxed heavily enough already, and if we refrain from putting additional taxation upon them I think we would be doing the proper thing.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in a system of centralisation of local government.  I think we should proceed very carefully in a matter of that kind.  I do not think it would be well to start with the thin end of the wedge now, and try to get the wedge in further, until we bring the whole seat of local government back to the city of Dublin.  That is a position I do not like, but whilst I say that, I say that the utmost care should be taken by the central authority&mdash;the Local Government Department&mdash;to see that the councils carry out their work in a proper and efficient manner.  I know, perhaps, there may be councils throughout the country who do not wish to carry out the law.  These councils should be made to carry out the law, no matter what the consequences may be.  Therefore, while that power exists with the Minister and his Department to see that the councils carry out their duty, we should not take away from them their power unless they abuse it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> I am also glad to notice in the Bill that the areas of charge for local purposes are to be enlarged.  The 1898 Act did away with the townland or division charge, and made it a Union charge.  I am glad to see that under this Bill the charge is to be further enlarged and that the county is to be the area in the future.  But taking the Bill as a whole, I do believe that we are doing the right thing in giving it a Second Reading, and it is my intention to vote for it.</P>

      <P>I may say that on the whole I am rather disappointed at the criticisms of this Bill.  There has been very little of a constructive kind, and what criticism has taken place has to a great extent been founded on misunderstanding.  There has been a great lot of talk about the abolition of the rural district councils. At the outset I tried to make it clear, and I wish to do so again, that the merits, or the demerits, of the rural district councils have practically nothing to do with our decision to get rid of them.  It was necessary to arrive at that decision irrespective of whether these bodies carried out their duty efficiently or inefficiently during the last few years.  If I wished to do so, I could make a very strong case of inefficiency against the rural district councils.  Just a few days ago word came to us from the clerk, that the rural district council of Caherciveen could not get a meeting together to deal with a serious case of an outbreak of fever, and we have cases of that kind continually cropping up.  We have decided to get rid of the rural district councils, first because we consider they are obsolete.  They are obsolete because for most of the duties they have to perform their control is altogether too small, and also because for some of the other duties they have to perform the district is too large.  I do not know if Deputies have ever looked up, on the map, the geographical formation of the different areas of the rural districts. If they have, they will find an extraordinary disparity between these areas. In fact, they were selected and jumbled together in the most arbitrary way. For instance, take the rural district of <Col N="1784" /> Idrone, in Carlow.  The area there is 25,000 acres and the population 3,233, while we have the rural district of Tuam, with an area of 191,263 acres, and a population of 29,127 people. In other words, in area and population it approaches very nearly to the position of the County Carlow which has an area of 221,539 acres and a population of 30,252.  It will be seen that the representatives for the rural district of Idrone, number six; the representatives for the rural district of Tuam number 37.  It will be seen that it was absolutely ridiculous to try to apply the same measures to areas of that kind.  We have also another factor influencing us in favour of getting rid of rural councils and that is that they are uneconomic.  If we keep on the rural council we should go back again to the boards of guardians because the two hang together.  The same staff did the work of the board of guardians and the work of the rural council and they had, as a general rule, much heavier duties to perform as the staff of the guardians than as the staff of the rural council.  As I mentioned before, under this Bill, 95 per cent. of their duties, those connected with roads and with sanitation will be transferred to the county council, and for that reason they are absolutely uneconomic. Deputy Corish referred to another function of the district council which I did not refer to in my opening statement, namely, their functions with regard to housing.  Deputy Corish knows as well as I do that the duties of the rural councils in connection with housing, particularly labourers' cottages are anything but efficiently carried out.  The rents for those labourers' cottages are very much in arrears at the present time, and our solution of that problem is to insist on having all those cottages bought out.  It will save the local authorities considerable time and considerable expense.  All this cry about the abolition of the rural district councils being undemocratic is beside the point.  The rural councils are elected under exactly the same conditions as the county councils are elected and there is no reason for saying that the rural council is a democratic body and that the county council is an undemocratic <Col N="1785" /> body.  As a matter of fact, I consider that this question of democracy, or the absence of it, should not be taken into consideration, or influence our view to any great extent in considering the question of local government at all.  The relationship between the administration of local government and the public is a business rather than a political relationship and those who administer local government should be judged rather by the principles by which commercial concerns are judged than by the principles which should guide statesmen or politicians.</P>

      <P>This confusion of thought and the jumbling together of politics and local government, like so many more of our problems here in Ireland, have their origin in the former history of the country.  At the time when these local councils were first established there was no national parliament in Ireland.  There was no forum from which the people could express their political views.  They naturally seized upon the opportunity presented to them in the establishment of those councils of using them as so many forums from which they could voice their political opinions.  I myself am inclined to believe that it was partly with this object in view that Mr. Balfour introduced his Local Government Bill of 1898&mdash;that is with a view to diverting the energy of the more aggressive and influential local leaders whom he surmised, and rightly surmised, would be elected to these local councils, from the Home Rule agitation. To a great extent the title of councillor was thrown out as a bribe to defeat the Home Rule policy of the Liberal Party, and it succeeded.  Under Campbell-Bannerman's measure Mr. Balfour's councils were to disappear. When these people got wind of this, they kicked up a terrible row.  Mr. Redmond crossed over from England, and tried to pacify them, and failed. They called a convention consisting primarily of their own members, just as this present agitation against their abolition has its origin mainly in the same source, and they turned down <Col N="1786" /> this Bill of Campbell-Bannerman's, which was an excellent measure for that time.  From that day to this politics and local government have gone hand in hand very much to the detriment of local government.  Now, there is nothing to inspire, nothing to stimulate, or nothing to enthuse over in the rural district councils.  The rural council has its roots neither in Irish history nor in Irish tradition, nor in Irish character.  It is an anomaly, and a foreign imposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>You might just as well have a parish council.  It would be much better than a rural council.  Or we might have councils for every townland in the country.  It is merely a question of where we ought to draw the line.  At the present time, to give an instance of how confused local administration is, let us take this:&mdash;The rain water which flows in the channel along the street is supposed to be looked after by the employees of the county council.  The sewerage there in that same street is supposed to be looked after by the employees of the rural council.  It is time we were done with such anomalies.  A great of argument has been directed against the abolition of rural councils because there is nobody to take their place.  Under this Bill power is given to appoint committees. These can be appointed by the county council, and it is hoped and expected that these committees will legislate for areas of a much more suitable kind than the present extraordinary areas known as rural districts.  It is expected that these committees will develop parish units like small towns and places in which the people have some interest and in that way local pride and local ambition and local idealism will have an opportunity of developing.  Nobody has ever heard of such a thing as a hurling club or a football club or a pipers' band, or a political club belonging to a rural district <Col N="1787" /> council for the simple reason that there is no local sentiment attached to it. It is hoped that under this Bill little groups will gather together and will be bound together by a natural local sentiment.</P>
      <P>Now, Deputy O'Connell referred to the medical inspection of school children and I told him that under the Act of 1919 we have power to insist upon such inspection of schools; but the difficulty is that we have no machinery to put such legislation into operation. If we were to do so it would mean appointing this medical inspector of schools at a very high salary, whereas under the present Bill we hope that the county medical inspector will be able to discharge this duty, or see that it is discharged, along with a great many other duties.  If this Bill cannot go through, and if we cannot get the county medical officer of health appointed, it will mean that this provision will have to go through anyway, and it will mean that later on there will be a great duplication of duty and there will be a pensioning of officers who should never have been appointed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the county medical officer of health, Deputy Sir James Craig was rather dubious as to whether we could get the right type of person for the position.  This is really the pivotal position of the Bill; the whole administration of the county will devolve on his shoulders.  He will have to be a thoroughly capable officer, and for that reason we are going to insist on the highest qualifications that we can get.  He will have to have a diploma of public health, together with the customary degrees for a person holding that position, and in addition to that I intend to endeavour in every possible way to see he is a man of very large experience in matters relating to public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson rather upset me in his first onslaught on the Bill.  It turned out to be a grand offensive against centralisation, but as he argued, there was a difference.  As long as he was dealing with theory, he confined himself to the attack on centralisation. When he came down to practical common sense, I find that he was prepared to go even further than I was able to go myself.  The principal point on <Col N="1788" /> which Deputy Johnson was in favour of centralisation was with regard to roads, and I think that his opinion was held unanimously by every Deputy, irrespective of party.  My position is exactly on a par with theirs.  I am altogether in favour of the centralisation of the administration of trunk or main roads, but I would like to impress on Deputies that that is not going to mean any saving.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have advocated the centralisation of the administration of trunk roads on the ground that they believe it will be much less expensive than the present system.  On the Continent, for strategic and other reasons, they have maintained roads on a national basis for a considerable time and they find it much more costly.  I have no doubt if we started immediately in Ireland on the national system of maintaining roads we would find it very expensive. You would find that to have our staff working along the trunk roads with a centralised administration in Dublin, would mean very heavy expense in the provision of steam rollers and machinery for crushing stones, while perhaps within fifty or a hundred yards away, on one of the roads feeding the trunk road there may be plant and machinery of the same kind at work.  For the present it is much better to allow the staff in the various counties to do the work on the main roads as well as on the roads of secondary importance.</P>
    <P>The one point that Deputies seem to have missed in the section dealing with roads is that I have taken the power to determine what roads shall be main roads.  That is a big step towards the nationalisation of those roads.  Heretofore, as some Deputy has suggested, it was quite a common thing to have a splendid road running through two or three counties and then in another county it would cease to become a main road and would be classified as a byroad. That entailed great hardship on travellers and it ruined the road work that had been done in the other counties. There are at least two counties in Ireland which have no main or trunk roads.  The Bill gets over that difficulty and prepares the way for nationalisation, if it is found workable.</P>
    <P>The main objection to nationalising the roads is because of the financial <Col N="1789" /> difficulties.  It would mean very considerable expense setting up a central authority, securing a staff for the roads, and duplicating machinery all over the country.  We would have to start off with a very large fund. Deputy Egan has referred to the different kinds of roads, and it seems to be generally agreed in the Dáil that the water-bound macadam road is obsolete, at least for heavy traffic.  I agree. I had the experience of travelling some thousands of miles in the United States on concrete roads, and I certainly found them excellent.  I have discussed the proposition with several engineers here, and they say that the roads would stand the heat and frost in America very well, but they would not stand the moisture of Ireland.  I am not certain of that, but it is something that can be investigated.  We will require a high standard of road in Ireland, just as they do in other countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to those Deputies who stress the fact that the charge for trunk roads should be met from a central fund, that this year we have advanced a large sum for the maintenance of trunk roads, and I believe that every year we will find ourselves in a position to make grants of a similar kind.  As the roads get better we have every reason to expect that the numbers of motors will increase. That will mean an increase in the amount of the road fund, which is the national fund for the upkeep of roads. As the roads get better our income will get larger, and there will be less necessity for heavy expenditure.  I think the provisions in the Bill in that respect set us on the right road.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in the number of county council members, except where there are one or two rural district councils there will be no increase in the membership of the county councils, and any increase that will occur will be necessary owing to the fact that boards of health and other committees will have to be set up which will consist of the same personnel as the county councils.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the rural councils will not, I believe, add very greatly to the duties that will have to be performed <Col N="1790" /> by the county council itself. The main duties of the county council under this Bill will be in connection with roads and with finance.  Public health duties will be carried out by the county board of health.  There are a great many duties, or so-called duties, at present carried out by rural councils which are quite unnecessary.  As to the talk of parish pumps, mending broken glass in labourers' cottages, and all that, under a properly regulated system all these matters should be very carefully handled by officials without having local bodies wasting their time in discussing them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson made great play with a circular sent out from my Department giving very specific instructions to officials down the country. Those instructions were sent out on the request of these officials themselves. When you send out instructions it is necessary to make them particular and specific.  The reason they were issued was that these officials were complaining that they were continually wrangling amongst themselves about their duties and unless we laid down hard and fast rules it would be impossible to get those duties performed at all&mdash; one would say it was the other's job, and so on.  Deputy Johnson referred to many matters in connection with the Poor Law.  This Bill does not attempt to deal with the Poor Law at all.  It was considered to be a different problem, and that we had no statistics or anything on which to base a decision at present.  Later one we hope to introduce a Bill that will deal with this very important question.  The Deputy also mentioned the question of National Insurance.  The Minister for Finance has announced his intention of appointing a committee to enquire into National Health Insurance generally and until this problem is examined it would be most unwise to make any changes.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of the Commission, many Deputies have complained about the way they are being treated in having this Bill flung at them and then, when we were half way through, having the suggestion made that the question of local administration should be left to a Commission.  I <Col N="1791" /> want to disabuse the minds of Deputies of the idea that this Bill was hastily drafted or thrown at them without getting the fullest consideration.  We have been dealing with this Bill, thinking over it and doing everything we can to improve it for a considerable time. Some of the provisions of it have been on the tapis for the last 12 months&mdash;I might say before I became Minister at all.  So far as my department could get helpful information from outside, everything has been done to make this Bill as perfect as possible.  When I introduced this Bill I intended to see it get a second reading.  When I was introducing it I threw out the suggestion that I expected that we would get considerable help in its passage through the Dáil, because, as the President remarked, the Bill is largely founded on the opinion of experts and we had not got the opinion of many people who are in touch with local conditions&mdash; at least I believe that Deputies who represent those people here in the Dáil, particularly those who are members of local councils, will be able to give us a point of view which we had not to the same extent in drafting the Bill.  It is on those lines I expect that we shall be able to amend this Bill considerably in committee.  The question of the Commission originally arose in connection with the Greater Dublin scheme. Several people who are particularly interested in the city of Dublin, and who realised that it is a problem <i>per se</i>, came to me and to the President and asked us to leave that question altogether outside the Bill, as it was a problem that could be better dealt with by itself.  I agreed to give the fullest consideration to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Several other important problems have to be considered, and I am anxious to have these dealt with by a Commission or some such body.  Consideration of the relations between agriculture and local government is very important and does not brook delay. The question of asylums will have to receive very careful consideration, as well as a scheme of State medical service. It is necessary that a Commission should be set up to deal with various problems of that kind.  With regard to the main provisions of the <Col N="1792" /> Bill, we have very carefully drafted them, and with the view of seeing, if they were accepted, that it would be quite easy to attach to them measures dealing with poor law or agriculture, without hampering them in any way. The Bill is a kind of necessary skeleton, set up before we can make any further additions to or reforms of the local government code.  Some of these measures are extremely urgent.  The setting up of county medical officers is most important, and I would be very sorry to see that delayed longer than is necessary.  At the present time we have practically no such things as health services functioning in this country.  The inspection of schools, care of mothers, welfare of the blind and other things are being neglected. Every day we delay, people are probably dying in this country owing to the absence of proper sanitary conditions, who might be saved if the Bill was passed.  Hundreds of children are growing up in the country weaklings, mentally and physically, who might be healthy and strong under proper supervision. For these reasons this part of the Bill is most important.</P>
    <P>I might say the same with regard to the part of the Bill that deals with roads.  The Bill is a step towards nationalisation, as big as we can take owing to our present financial position. Every month, or every year, that we delay centralising road maintenance in the county councils means that thousands of pounds are being expended unnecessarily on roads, without getting proper value for the money.  For that reason I am very anxious to get this Bill through as soon as possible.  I realise that such an important Bill could not be put through the Dáil and Seanad this session, and I am not pressing it.  In the Committee Stage I hope Deputies will be able to do full justice to the Bill.  The holding up of the Bill, that I now find is necessary, until after the recess, will necessitate postponing the elections, at all events for the rural district councils, and it will be necessary for me to bring in a Bill to that effect later on.  I am not sure but that it may necessitate the holding up of the elections for county councils, but, if possible, I will try to avoid that. As I say, committees will be set up <Col N="1793" /> to deal with the other vital problems of local government, so that I believe Deputies should be thoroughly well able to deal <Col N="1794" /> with the matters that I have opened for discussion in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are quite a number of very important matters that will require to be raised on this vote, but I want to raise a somewhat minor matter at the outset which will not excite perhaps acute controversy, and one might hope would have good results. I propose to do it by virtue of an amendment to the motion, that the Vote be reduced by £1,000.  I am taking that sum so as to allow reductions of small amounts, for one thing, and because it more or less fits in with the amount of £880 indicated as being payable to the medical inspector and inspector of lunacy.  The subject I want to draw the attention of the Dáil to, and more particularly that of the Minister, is the dispute at Letterkenny Asylum that has been going on for some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I misled you.  I only referred to that item under a sub-head as an indication of why I had chosen £1,000.  The question I have raised is a matter of general policy, and it has to do with the relation of the Ministry to, and the policy of the Ministry in regard to matters which have led to a very unpleasant and unsatisfactory dispute in Letterkenny Asylum.  This question of the control of asylums is one which is more national than local, but in any case the Ministry has taken upon itself the responsibility of supervising very strictly the conduct of asylums.  A matter arose in February between the staffs of the asylum and the asylum committee arising out of a circular letter sent by the Ministry advising economies. In the course of that circular letter there was a reference to the necessity for revision in the present rate of wages; they should revise in all cases &ldquo;with special reference to the rates current in the district.&rdquo;  Now, the asylum committee responded to that by proposing new terms and conditions of employment to the staff.  They did not do what one might have expected a committee of this kind should have done, a committee which had in fact and in effect made an agreement with the union to which the asylum attendants belong.  They did not approach the union and have the matter discussed amicably.  They simply laid it down that certain rates should follow at a certain time.  It is a fact that in 1920, after several controversies between the asylum workers and the various asylums, there was a national conference called under the auspices of the county councils.  After several discussions a general agreement was arrived at with regard to scales of pay, allowances and terms of employment. This agreement was entered into, signed by representatives of the committees, and generally accepted <Col N="1797" /> throughout the country.  It is objected that no agreement was entered into by this asylum committee of Letterkenny, because their particular signature was attached to no agreement. As a matter of fact, they were represented on the committee which consulted, conferred and finally arrived at an agreement.  The signatories to the agreement were persons representative of the committee, and this national agreement was arrived at, and up to this year the management committees of asylums have accepted the findings and acted up to them.  Following the circular of the Minister, one or two boards considered this question, and most of them agreed that it was a matter for national arrangement, and could not be dealt with until there had been a further conference and a new settlement.  The Letterkenny committee took another view, and insisted there should be a change and a considerable reduction in the rates of pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>MR. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The next step which leads to controversy was the retirement of the Head Attendant of this asylum on pension, and the appointment of a successor.  The successor who was appointed as head attendant, it so happened, was a stone mason who had been in the employment of the Asylum Board for a considerable number of years.  Contrary to the usual practice, the Ministry of Local Government sanctioned this appointment very speedily, indeed, much more speedily than such appointments are usually sanctioned.  I think it was in ten days in this case, but apparently the fact had been overlooked by the Ministry that the person who had been appointed as head attendant responsible for the work and the control of attendants, and generally supervising the action of men who are asked now <Col N="1798" /> to qualify in a special manner for their duties, was a man who had no experience of attendants of that kind, and was, as I say, a stone mason.</P>
      <P>That may have been a fact overlooked by the Ministry.  They may not have recognised that this new head attendant was not competent by qualification to do the work of supervisor over the rest of the attendants, and it seems to me to be, or should have been at least, a very considerable factor in the question whether the Ministry ought to sanction such an appointment. There were people who had long service, and had all the qualifications required as attendants, who were passed over, but for a reason which I have not been able to divine, the local authority insisted upon the appointment of this stone mason, and insisted at the same time that he should withdraw his membership of the trade union.  These considerations, the reduction in pay following the advice of the Ministry, the sanctioning by the Ministry of a stone mason to be head attendant, and the insistence that that stone mason should withdraw from the trade union led to a strike.  Those are the bald facts, and I do not intend to go into very much detail, or to enlarge upon the matter up to that time. A good many incidents have followed, apparently a good deal of heat has been engendered on both sides, and apparently the people of Letterkenny are divided with a certain amount of intensity of feeling, and many bitter things have been said and many wrong things probably have been done on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been introduced into the hospital in attendance on the patients a considerable number of people who, I think, it will be admitted, in the ordinary course would not be recognised as fit persons to take care of lunatics in an asylum.  All this has been done, it is suggested&mdash;I am not backing the suggestion because I cannot confirm it in any way&mdash;not merely with the sanction and approval of, but at the instigation of the Ministry, or the Ministry's officials.  The position apparently is that the two bodies are locked in conflict, both of them are obstinate; one feels strong and the other <Col N="1799" /> feels equally strong, but the effect of it all is that the patients are suffering. The asylum is not being administered properly.  The risk to the patients is probably greater than their certain suffering, but in addition to that a good deal of risk is being entailed by reason of the fact that people who ought to be in the asylum have been sent to their homes, and one never knows what may be the effect of having lunatics, many of them probably not capable of taking care of themselves, sent to their homes.  My reason in raising the matter now is: I want if possible by drawing attention to it to prevent the development of this kind of trouble.  As I say, there is a good deal of obstinacy on both sides, and the intention, to use a common phrase, to fight to a finish and all the rest of it.  In this case the people who are going to be the sufferers and losers are the patients.  I feel in regard to it that I could say things that are, perhaps, strong and somewhat bitter, but I do not want to say them.  I want, if possible, to suggest to the Ministry that there ought to be a going back to the period before the strike began, that there ought to be a recognition that there was an agreement between the various asylums throughout the country with the union to which these workers belong, that that should not have been altered or attempted to be altered by one asylum authority without a general conference, and that to do so simply suggests to the men in this occupation, as it has been suggested in so many other occupations, that the Ministry is simply moving in the direction of breaking down the standard of living.  To avoid even the appearance of that, steps should have been taken to get the various asylum authorities which had come to an agreement with the union in 1920 to come again to the union and endeavour to arrive at a new agreement.  The union has been endeavouring for some long time now to tune up the quality and qualifications of attendants in hospitals, and to insist as far as possible that the tests that the Ministry have sought to be applied to all mental hospital attendants should be passed by such attendants. The policy which the Ministry <Col N="1800" /> in the past has attempted to enforce, and which has been played up to by the union concerned, is now overthrown at once in the case of this head attendant, with the added contention that he must no longer remain a member of the trades union as before.  These are things, I think, which should have had the attention of the Ministry before sanctioning the appointment and before issuing instructions for these reductions in pay.</P>
    <P>Taking into account, as I say, local considerations, which, by the way, has never been done by the present Government and its departments in dealing with policemen, soldiers and officials generally, I think the Ministry ought to recognise that in dealing with the position that has to be considered in respect of this Letterkenny dispute it should be treated as it was before the strike began.  It should be recognised that there have been faults and obstinacies on the part of the committee, and acts on the part of the attendants and their supporters outside which have roused ill-feeling and bad blood&mdash;creating, as I say, the spirit of conflict to the death&mdash;that that should all be overlooked until you get to the root of the trouble.  And the root of the trouble, I submit, lies in the fact that the Ministry has committed what I suggest were two grievous errors in their action, and it is the commission of these errors which has led to this unfortunate trouble in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter, and I raise it in this way, because I want the Ministry to endeavour to recover from the position which they have allowed themselves to get into, and, in effect, allowed the asylum in Letterkenny to get into.  The position, I think, is one that is very unsatisfactory, and not at all likely to bring any credit to the administration of the Ministry in respect to the asylums.  And, without going into any further detail, and for the purpose of allowing this matter to be dealt with by the Ministry, I beg to move the motion.</P>

      <P>I fail to see in Deputy Johnson's statement where I come into this matter at all.  In his speech on the Local Government Bill, Deputy Johnson <Col N="1801" /> took me to task for interfering unduly with the work of local authorities. In this particular instance he is asking me to interfere in a matter in which I have got no jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I interfered to sanction the appointment of an officer whom Deputy Johnson seems to object to on the ground of his being a stone mason, which is really no disqualification at all.  The lunacy officer in the district gave the highest recommendation to this person.  And he has fulfilled his duties admirably, and I have no discretion in the matter but to sanction his appointment.  I may say, with regard to this strike up in Letterkenny, that it has been a disgraceful performance. Even amongst uncivilised tribes&mdash;even amongst Red Indians&mdash; special care is taken of the mentally deficient. And if members of one tribe get lost amongst another tribe&mdash;even if the two tribes be hostile&mdash;if it is found that the lost ones are mentally deficient, those among whom they go never resort to any acts of cruelty or anything of that kind in regard to them.  In this particular case the strike has been carried on by those responsible for it, at the expense of those unfortunate patients in Letterkenny; and I think nothing worse or more disgraceful has occurred in the whole history of disagreement between employers and employees.  As I have said, I had no discretion in this matter, except to sanction the appointment of this man, to whom Deputy Johnson refers as a stone mason, because he has been recommended by the officer who is in a position to recommend him.  And he has given every satisfaction to the local committee, who have absolute discretion in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the main question, I should like to say a word in support of the motion.  But there are one or two points which I should wish to refer to.  In South Mayo there was considerable distress during the last few months, and the Local Government Department undoubtedly did good work in supplying seed potatoes to the Unions there.  They were also recommended to take further action than that.  It was reported that there was serious distress in certain portions of the county, and inspectors were sent down.  I am sure that the Department acted on the reports of those inspectors. But there were two districts, or one district consisting of two townlands, where the distress was exceedingly severe; and those inspectors returned home without visiting those districts.  I visited them myself, and I was told by the priest&mdash;the local curate&mdash;that no inspector visited those places.  I reported at Government Buildings about the serious distress in those places, but my report, perhaps, did not go to the Minister for Local Government.  I sent it to the Land Commission, because I wanted work for those people.  They did not want outdoor relief.  They wanted some <Col N="1803" /> work, and there is any amount of reproductive work which could be done in the locality.  Now I bring the matter formally before the Minister, and I would urge him to send inspectors to the districts Croaghrim and Glenmask, in the parish of Partry, where there is acute distress, according to the local evidence&mdash;the evidence of priests and others&mdash;and also to the adjoining portion of the County of Galway, particularly Maamtrasna, where there is also acute distress.  There is another point I should also wish to speak on, on this Vote, and that is the question of old age pensions.  I approve of the action of the Department in examining strictly all applications for old age pensions.  I am entirely with them in rejecting cases where there is not sufficient evidence of age, or evidence on the question of means.  But they must consider the position of these old people in looking for evidence of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First and foremost we have the fact that the records were not very well kept in the parishes in Ireland in the past, and, in cases where they were kept, during the last few years some of them were destroyed, and that gives rise to very serious difficulties for the applicants for old age pensions.  Imagine those poor people when they face the task of discovering their ages. They have no notion where to look for the records.  The old age pension expert, living in Dublin, entrenched behind his desk and documents asks the old age pensioner, &ldquo;Where is your evidence?&rdquo;  They might as well expect some of these people to get the moon as the record of their age.  If there is an onus upon the State to supply pensions, there should be, also, an onus, to a certain extent, to place facilities for finding evidence within the reach of those people.  They should place within their reach the school records and the vaccination records, and give them every possible chance of supporting their case.  A number of refusals of the Local Government Department to give pensions are based on the age of the applicant supplied on the occasion of his or her marriage.  That is taking a very cruel advantage of the vanity of the ordinary man or woman <Col N="1804" /> at what was supposed to be the happiest moment of his or her life.  There is, perhaps, no man or woman who has not knocked off ten or twenty years from the age at that period.  It is not fair to bring that evidence against them, and it certainly is not reliable. I know people with 70 years of age printed upon their faces who have been turned down.  I heard a priest say on one occasion, when the authorities were looking for documents to prove age &ldquo;What better document could you have than that,&rdquo; pointing to the face of a poor old woman.  I quite approve of the Department exercising the greatest care to see that they are not imposed upon.  I am afraid they were imposed upon in the past.  I am afraid I imposed upon them myself in the interests of some old people before the Treaty.  While they are right in seeing they are not imposed upon now, it is, at the same time, a great wrong to keep people who are really 70 years of age out of the pension.  The line should not be drawn too tightly, and I would urge that great care should be taken not to refuse the pensions to men and women over 70 years of age.  While it is the intention of the Act to ensure that people of 70 years of age should not be refused the pension, I am afraid that a great many of them are refused it at the present time.</P>

      <P>The whole question of old age pensions is a very difficult one. As Deputy Sears himself has hinted, many looked upon old age pensions as fair game for anybody when the British were administering them.  It was looked upon as legitimate for everybody to get this money when it was not the Irish taxpayer exclusively that was paying it.  Now, however, we have to bear our own burden and it is necessary that this grant should only be given to those whose cases are absolutely bona fide.  Owing to the position I am placed in the Dáil, having to answer in the negative applications from all over the country, raised by Deputies in regard to old age pensions, it may appear that I am straining the rules, but the trouble is that the Deputies never raise questions where old age pensions are looked for by persons <Col N="1805" /> who have no right to get them.  My present attitude, in the administration of the old age pensions grant, is to administer it strictly in those cases where the families to which the old age pensioners belong are tolerably well able to look after them.  But in cases where there is absolute certainty that the family is in a bad way, I am inclined not to be too particular in looking for absolute evidence as to whether the applicant is over 70 years of age or not, as I realise it is very difficult sometimes to substantiate that fact.  I may remind Deputies that faces are a very bad criterion to go upon.  You sometimes see people who are under 60 years of age but who look over 80.  On the other hand, people who have not had such a hard battle in life look hale and hearty up to 80 years of age.</P>
      <P>With regard to the distress in the west, that question was raised before and I am glad that, in this instance, Deputy Sears has put specific cases, as it is only in such cases that we can go into the matter fully.  I might suggest, first of all, to Deputy Sears that it is primarily a question to be dealt with by the county.  The County Mayo has an exceptionally low rate this year&mdash;lower than it was in 1914&mdash;and they have ample powers to relieve distress themselves. In the administration of the road grant I made the best of every opportunity to have that grant expended in those districts where the incidence of unemployment is high.  I do not know whether that brings any relief to the district mentioned by Deputy Sears.</P>

      <P>If not I will be prepared to give them special consideration, but as I say, it is a case primarily for the local authorities to deal with, as they have full power to apply relief.  The rate is exceptionally low, and they should be able to do that without any great hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call attention to the policy of the Ministry in regard to refusal to sanction superannuation of old workers by Local Government authorities.  I have a case which has already been notified to the Minister where a man was employed by the Pembroke Council since 1883, and worked as a skilled worker for 40 <Col N="1806" /> years.  He was certified last year by the medical officer as unfit for further service owing to heart trouble.  The council granted him a pension of £2 8s. 4d. per week, but the Department refused sanction of this pension and consequently the payment was stopped.</P>
      <P>If this man had withdrawn ten years ago and had sent in his claim, he would have had it sanctioned by the British Local Government Board and he would have been drawing his pension, as others in such a position are to-day drawing their pensions which were granted and sanctioned by the British Local Government Board.  The explanation given now by the Ministry for refusing saction in this case, and I believe in numerous other cases of a similar kind&mdash;the explanation given for their change of policy from the policy adopted by the Local Government Board under the British regime&mdash; is that it has been found, according to one legal authority, that is to say the Attorney-General, that the right of the local authority to grant pensions does not extend to workmen or to people working for a weekly wage, but is confined to those who are in the nature of permanent officials receiving a salary. It is suggested that whatever was done under the old regime, with the sanction of the Lord Lieutenant, was done without authority.  We are now in the position that the new Local Government regime is declaring that all the previous pensions granted under the same Act were beyond the authority of the Board and are in fact illegal, and that the new Local Government authority is administering this law, or at least is interpreting the law in this much more rigid sense than the old Local Government authority did.  We find the result is that men who stayed on in troubled times and filled in further years of service when they might have retired five, seven, or ten years ago, are now being deprived of pensions because of that attention to their work over these years. I recognise the difficulty that the Minister himself may be in after having received a notification from the Attorney-General as to his reading of the law, but I wonder what preceded the approach to the Attorney-General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> I wonder why it was found necessary in such a case to seek the judgment of the Attorney-General on such a matter? Presumably because of a desire to be very rigid, or shall I say, very just, or very legal rather than just, in the administration of the existing law wherever it attempts to assist the poor. Here we have a case, and I quote it as one of many where, because of a new interpretation of the law which has not yet been decided in the courts, local authorities are deprived of their rights and of their desire to pension old employees under the law which has been operating for many years, and they are thwarted by the judgment of the Ministry of Local Government.  As I say, that is not in response to any decision of the courts, but in response, shall I say, to Counsel's opinion which, presumably, was sought in the hope that they would get an adverse opinion.  That, perhaps, is unkind, but one cannot but feel unkind when one gets piles and piles of complaints about the way in which the Ministry is interpreting its duties.  This is a very important matter for many people. Possibly it will place the position of many enjoying pensions in jeopardy if this interpretation of the law can be sustained, and if any members of some of the ratepayers' unions, if I may call them that for the moment, without fear of exciting their antipathy, should try to save the rates by going to the courts and objecting to the payment of further pensions on the grounds that they are illegal.  I can imagine that happening without any great stretch of the imagination, and I am raising the matter in the hope that the Minister will see his way to explain it more satisfactorily to the Dáil than he has done by letter, and to urge the necessity for bringing in legislation to legalise all that has been done and to make legal the powers that have been exercised in the past by local authorities to pay pensions to their old and faithful employees.</P>

      <P>I desire briefly to draw the attention of the Minister to the refusal of his Department to sanction pensions to relieving officers who have become redundant as a result of the scheme of Union amalgamation that <Col N="1808" /> has been carried out in many parts of the country.  I had occasion to make representations to his Department regarding the delay in the case of two men who were voted pensions in one particular area.  One case was settled up, to the satisfaction of the individual concerned, and in the other the Department has refused sanction on the grounds that the individual concerned, although he had forty-three years' service in that particular position, was not regarded as a full-time officer.  I would like the Minister to make it clear what is his definition, or the definition of his Department, of a full-time officer.  Here is a case of two individuals serving in a particular area and doing the same class of work for a number of years.  I want to know why one is regarded as a full-time officer and gets his pension, and the other is not, though both have been doing the same class of work.  I want to know why one man got his pension and why the other was refused it, and what I am really anxious to get is a definition of what constitutes a full-time officer.</P>

I do not know exactly under what headings these questions are coming up.  Last year I think it was Deputy Johnson who suggested that we should have the general discussion first, and then take the estimates one by one afterwards.  Then Deputy Fitzgibbon suggested that it would be better take the estimates one by one and have a general discussion afterwards in order to avoid overlapping.

      <P>I was evolving a definition of that during the discussion.  The general question is a question I think which does not seem to arise properly under the sub-heads and which therefore, I take it, arises under sub-head (a). Deputy Johnson's point does arise under the second sub-head&mdash;&ldquo;Salaries of Officers of Lunatic Asylums.&rdquo;  That is a specific case.  Deputy Sears raised a question about sending inspectors to the west for the relief of distress; that appears to come in under sub-head (a). Old age pensions do not appear to have any sub-head, and therefore that subject comes in under the general question sub-head (a). Superannuation does not appear to have any sub-head and therefore it also comes in under sub-head (a). The discussion so far has been by a process of exclusion of what might be called general questions.  It would be reasonable for the Minister to ask that all points should first be made before he replies.</P>

      <P>I would like to get some information in connection with the distribution of the money given for reconstruction.  I would like to know what were the reasons that prompted the Ministry in defining the wages which should be paid in rural areas and in urban areas.  I asked a similar question of the Minister sometime <Col N="1810" /> ago and I did not get a very definite answer.  Would I be right in assuming that the reason a higher rate was given in a town as against a rural district was because of the higher cost of living in the town?  If I am right in that assumption, am I to take it that every worker living in a town, whether he was employed in the urban district or outside it in connection with this grant, would be entitled to the 35/- because of the fact that he was living in the town and had to bear the high cost of living there?</P>
      <P>A few days before the election in Limerick I noticed in a paper that the Ministry had decided to grant an increase of 2/- a week in the wages of the workers in Limerick.  The result of that was that I heard workers in Tipperary wishing that some Deputy would resign there so that they could get an extra 2/- a week.  This wage has been spoken of as a 29/- a week wage but it has been put up to the Ministry that it is really only a nett wage of 27/11.  The Ministry has been asked by several county councils to sanction an increase of this 29/- a week.  Several county councils have passed resolutions in connection with the increasing of this wage, but the Ministry have refused to sanction any increase.  I would like to know why the Minister agreed to give an increase of 2/- a week in Limerick County and refused it in other places, such as Cork or other counties.  They are able to get a good deal perhaps, there.  I have been requested to bring up this matter in reference to the wage of 29/- a week &mdash;especially in regard to the increase given in Limerick.  Was that increase given, as has been suggested, because of the Election?</P>

Therefore I am not quite sure whether the point that I want to <Col N="1811" /> raise is due to come under this sub-head. Are these trade inspectors in any way connected with the Contracts Department or have they anything to do with it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference to a legal adviser at a salary of £700, and a legal assistant at £400, and there was nothing last year.  I notice by the notes that in 1923-24 the duties of the position were discharged by a member of the audit staff, a B.L., and his salary was provided for under sub-head &ldquo;C.&rdquo; In respect of the second position, the duties of this were discharged by a Lower Executive Officer, a B.L., and his salary was paid from the amount provided for the Lower Executive Class.  Perhaps on this sub-head the Minister will explain why the economic arrangement of last year has been departed from.  Coming back to trade inspectors, I want to draw attention to a matter which obviously comes within the purview of these officers, and that is the giving away of contracts, as has recently been done for brushes.  There was a tender invited for so many thousand shaving brushes.  A sample shaving brush was submitted to local Irish makers and the contract was not accepted. Presumably the price was too high.  It appears there has been a purchase of 15,000 shaving brushes at a price considerably lower than the price quoted by the Irish manufacturers.  And as it turns out, the quality was very much lower than that which was quoted for and of which a sample was presented to the Irish manufacturers.  That requires some explanation.  It has been said, as a matter of fact, that the price paid was only about half of what the Irish manufacturers quoted.  They claim that the quality was much less than half as good as the quality they were able to make, for which they quoted and for which the specification provided.  It is further suggested that <Col N="1812" /> the actual article which was purchased at possibly half the price of the Irish quotation could have been bought and was offered to Irish manufacturers in trading circles at less than half of what was actually paid.  Now, the position with regard to Irish manufactured brushes is very serious.  The trade here has been established for a very long time.  It is a trade which is conducted by skilled people, in the main, and by virtue of the kind of competition that is coming in from Belgium and from other countries, the trade is practically three quarters idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nearly extinct and it will be extinct if the Government follows the present policy of giving out its contracts to cheap makes of imported goods from other countries, probably long-distance countires.  It is possible that the 15,000 shaving brushes contracted for by the Irish Government were made either in Germany or in Japan.  Now, there is a serious aspect to this.  It is&mdash;what tests have been applied by the Trade Department to make sure that these shaving brushes are free from contamination?  It has been a not infrequent complaint that anthrax has been carried through shaving brushes to people and very much suffering and very much pain caused thereby.  Quite recently in Aldershot a case of anthrax was found. A soldier through using cheap, imported shaving brushes was infected and there was a general seizure in the town of Aldershot by the British Authorities on account of that.  I want to know whether any assurances can be given to the Dáil that these 15,000 shaving brushes which have been bought cheaply have been guaranteed free from infection?  What tests have been applied?  Where have they come from?  Has any close inspection been made of the source of these brushes, whether they came from Japan, the Far East, Australia or Germany or where they have come from and what guarantees have the Trade Department that these brushes are free from infection?  This is a matter, of <Col N="1813" /> course, that is of very great importance to the people in the trade but it is of much greater importance to the public.  Unless the Department responsible is going to impose stringent tests upon the quality and freedom from infection of articles of this kind, then cheapness will be found a very mistaken policy.  It will be found to be very dear, because it will impose very great cost upon the sufferers if such a thing as anthrax is introduced. This is not an alarmist note.  As a matter of fact, it has been found necessary to deal very stringently with this question of anthrax carried to people through using brushes.  I think we are entitled to ask what inspections were made in regard to the quality of these <Col N="1814" /> brushes and their freedom from infection, and what guarantees have been secured by the Trade Department before they gave a contract away for brushes to be imported that they were made under fair conditions and are not liable to create disease amongst the users?  I will leave it at that.</P>
