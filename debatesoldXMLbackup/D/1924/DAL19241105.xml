      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state (a) the number of applications received from resigned and dismissed members of the R.I.C. for pensions under the Superannuation Act, 1923; (b) the number of claims in which favourable recommendations were forwarded to the Minister by the Committee of Inquiry; (c) the number of cases in which payment of pension has been sanctioned; (d) the latest date of joining the R.I.C. after which payment of pension is being declined; whether pension was suspended or reduced in the case of any resigned or dismissed R.I.C. men during their period of service in the National Army, Gárda Síochána, Customs and Excise, etc.; whether pension is restored in the case of any men who have been or may be dismissed from such services or who resigned previous to or subsequent to the passing of the Act, and whether the same conditions will apply to disbanded R.I.C. men or ex-British Army pensioners serving in the same Government Departments; also, whether, in view of the many assurances given by the Minister since the passing of the Act in August, 1923; he will expedite payment in all outstanding cases, and state when he will be in a position to publish a final list of the names of men whose claims have been sanctioned for payment of a pension under the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of applications <Col N="748" /> received from former members of the Royal Irish Constabulary for pension under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, is 1,215.  The number of applications recommended by the Committee of Inquiry is 628, and the number of cases in which payment of pension has so far been sanctioned is 408.</P>
      <P>Pensions are not withheld by reference to any particular date of enlistment, but are granted on the merits of each case as known to the Government. I have not, however, awarded pension to any men who, on resignation or dismissal within the main period 1919-1921, had less than four years' service, whilst a small number with less service have been granted pensions because their resignations or dismissals were clearly attributable to national sympathies in the conscription crisis of the period March-May, 1918. No man with less than three and a half years' service has been granted a pension.</P>
      <P>For the principles governing the suspension of pension on re-employment under the State or in a Public Office and the forfeiture of pension in consequence of resignation or dismissal from such office, I must refer the Deputy to the terms of Articles 4 and 5 of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924, and Article 2 of the Schedule thereto.  The conditions governing the suspension of pensions of disbanded Royal Irish Constabulary and British Army pensioners are matters outside the control of the Free State Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the principle enunciated in Article 5 (a) of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924, pension has been suspended in whole or in part in the case of all pensioners who have been employed for any period since the date of the passing of the Act (8th August, 1923) in any office remunerated out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas (e.g., Army, Civic Guard, Dublin Metropolitan Police, Revenue Commissioners) or which is a public office within the meaning of the <Col N="749" /> Superannuation Act, 1892 (e.g., Registry of District Court Clerks).</P>
    <P>In applying the above principle the approved practice has been as follows:</P>
    <P>In cases of re-employment in the circumstances mentioned only so much of the pension shall be issued as with the effective pay of the pensioner's new office shall not exceed the pay a member of the Gárda Síochána would have with corresponding service calculated to the 31st March, 1922, at the rates prescribed in the Gárda Síochána Pay Order, dated 22nd February, 1924, or any subsequent Order modifying those rates.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the principles enunciated in Article 4 of the Order and Article 2 (e) of the Schedule thereto, it is intended to declare forfeited the pension of any pensioner who has been re-employed for any period whether before or since the passing of the Act in any office which the Minister for Justice agrees is reasonably suitable for him and is dismissed from or resigns from that office without adequate reason either before or since the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>As regards the concluding portion of the question, there remain for decision three classes of cases concerning men who are now either in whole-time employment by the State, or have emigrated to remote parts of the world, or have already received on discharge as being medically unfit for further service pensions or substantial gratuities. The last two classes of cases obviously require the most careful consideration, and investigation is proceeding as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister refer to page 3601 of the Official Report of the 3rd July, 1924, in which he will find the following statement:</P>
      <P>There will be no discrimination against them.</P>
      <P>(That is the R.I.C. men.)</P>
      <P>simply because they are in the Gárda Síochána.  The only point is that the pension as in the case of the other men</P>
      <P>(That is the suspended men.)</P>
      <P>will be suspended while they are serving in the Gárda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> Will the Minister, in view of that statement made by a member of the Executive Council, revise or reconsider his decision regarding the treatment of men who may be dismissed or who may hereafter resign from the Gárda Síochána?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If a man has been provided for by employment the State will take no further liability in regard to him.  If he resigns or gets dismissed through his own fault, no pension can be given.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the President in promising the inquiry stated, I think, that it would be unwise to wait two or three months to have this matter investigated, and advanced that as an argument against having a Dáil Committee of Inquiry?  In view of the fact that two or three months have now elapsed and that an inquiry has not been held, will the Minister consider the desirability now of appointing a Dáil Committee of Inquiry to investigate the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that the blame, if there be such, is not entirely on the Executive Council or upon me as the Minister promising that particular inquiry.  It was promised by me in good faith, and it was intended, at that time, to have the inquiry without delay, but certain proceedings took place in connection with the setting up of the Committee and the settling of the Terms of Reference. These were completed, and, as far as I know, without any complaint on the part of the Deputy in the Dáil who is responsible for making the main case for this inquiry.  I was then asked if it could be agreed that the work of this Committee would not start for some time, as the Deputy in question would not find it convenient for a certain time to be in Dublin in order to give evidence or to attend the inquiry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state whether his attention has been drawn to the article in the <i>Dundalk Democrat</i> of November 1st, 1924, descriptive of the incidents at St. Patrick's Cemetery, Dowdallhill, on October 30th, 1924, wherein it is stated the military, after the greater majority of the people had left, rounded up a number of young men and women and searched them, and whether this statement is true as regards the females arrested, and, if so, if he will state if female searchers were employed on the task; further, whether, <Col N="752" /> having regard to recent fatalities, he will state the policy of the Government on the matter of arrests and searches at public meetings.</P>

      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to.</P>
      <P>The facts as to the incidents referred to are being inquired into.  The investigation has been delayed on account of the holding of an inquest in connection with a death resulting from the incidents. Pending the receipt of the military report I am not in a position to make any statement, but I will communicate with the Deputy on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question the policy of the Government in matters of this character, is to enforce the Public Safety (Powers of Arrest and Detention) Temporary Act, 1924.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I desire to ask whether in anticipation of movements of military in respect, for instance, of the carrying of arms, any special prohibition was issued for the occasion referred to, or whether any warning was issued to the public as to the danger and risks they ran in attending these demonstrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, I believe, a measure called the Firearms Act passed in this Dáil.  That particular measure was all that was needed in the nature of information to persons carrying arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. C. HOGAN Mr. C. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, in view of the fact that the presence of armed men at these demonstrations last week was more or less a contingency foreseen by the Government and provided against, may I ask why the innocent public were not informed of the dangers they ran in attending these demonstrations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for a reply to that question.  It is obvious that a demonstration of armed men, not under the control of the State, but in opposition to the State, cannot be permitted, and every effort will be taken in the present and in the future to prevent any such armed displays.  Persons <Col N="753" /> taking part in them do so at their own risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. C. HOGAN Mr. C. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the public should get warning of the risks and dangers they run.  Will the President see that on the occasion of future Sinn Fein demonstrations an announcement to that effect will be issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If they give us warning that they are going to use these arms at these demonstrations, we will give the necessary warning afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President say why, if he was not aware of the possibility or likelihood of arms being used, there were forces in such numbers present on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I myself gave orders that the military were to attend and prevent any armed displays at those interments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that suggest that a similar warning should have been given to the public not to be present for fear of a possible fight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see why it is necessary to give warning.  The thing is well known.  Anybody who sees the military there knows what they are there for&mdash;to prevent any armed displays.  People who see the military present know that they attend to prevent armed displays, and they have sufficient warning in the presence of the troops.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Mrs. Mary Collatin, 5 Rowan Terrace, Droichead Nua, Co. Kildare, has been requested to refund a sum of £7 16s. 0d., alleged to have been overdrawn in dependents allowance in respect of the Army service of her husband, Sergeant Michael Collatin, No. 14434, Army Corps of Engineers; further, whether the statement of account issued to Mrs. Collatin from the Dependents Allowance Branch, Army Pay Corps, Portobello Barracks, <Col N="754" /> on the 14th October, 1924, gives the date of payment of dependents allowance as beginning on the 20th August, 1922, instead of the 3rd July, 1922, the date on which her husband attested in Naas Barracks, and whether he will order payment of the difference, £9 12s. 0d., plus £4 10s. 0d., already deducted and due to Mrs. Collatin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Mrs. Collatin was incorrectly informed that an overpayment of £7 16s. 0d. had been made to her in respect of dependents allowance.  A cheque for £4 10s. was sent to her yesterday to clear the amount which she had already refunded.</P>
      <P>The statement of account referred to by the Deputy included only payments made to her direct from the Dependents Allowance Branch of the Department of Defence in Portobello Barracks.  Generally speaking, allowances were paid in this way only from about the end of August, 1922.  Previously they were ordinarily issued, not directly to dependents, but to soldiers themselves.  The question arises, therefore, as to whether the allowance in respect of Mrs. Collatin was not paid to her husband during the period from the 3rd July, 1922, to the 20th August, 1922.  It is being enquired into, and I will communicate the result to the Deputy in due course.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware that a number of tenants on the Wilson property, situate at Drummond, Milltownpass, Mullingar, and at Edmonton, Killucan, Co. Westmeath, who purchased out their holdings under Sections 24 and 35 of the Land Act, 1881, had only two-thirds of the purchase money advanced by the Land Commission, the landlord taking out mortgages for the remaining one-third at 3? per cent.; that the tenants will shortly have the advances made by the Land Commission repaid, whilst the original principal of one-third the landlord's estimated interest in the land over forty years ago still remains due, and whether the Land Commission will take steps to enable the tenants to redeem those charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act of 1881, the Land Commission had power to make advances to tenant purchasers, not exceeding three-fourths of the purchase money, repayable by annuity at the rate of 5 per cent for a period of 35 years.  Advances were made under that Act to the tenants of the estate referred to on the 6th June and 28th November, 1883.  Under Section 4 of the Act of 1885 the annuity rate was reduced to 4 per cent. and the period extended to 49 years, and under Section 25 of the Act of 1896 the annuities were further reduced, and consequently will not redeem the advances until the years 1962 and 1963.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to inform the Dáil that this amendment was actually drafted before Deputy Good raised the matter on Second Reading.  It occurred to both of us that the interval laid down in the Bill during which a public holiday could be declared was too short. Assuming a public holiday was to be on Saturday, and that notice of it was only given in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and the Dublin daily papers on Friday, it is quite obvious that those papers would not reach country towns, like Sligo and Castlebar, until after mid-day on Friday. The shopkeepers and bankers would know there was a holiday, but the farmers and the country people would have no means of knowing.  The day might be a market day, and they might come in to the town to sell their butter and eggs and find that the banks and shops were shut and that no business was being done.  I think, therefore, that a longer period should be given.  If the amendment were adopted we would be given a fortnight's notice of any bank holiday.  These extrastatutory Bank Holidays will occur principally on the occasion of a General Election.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="758" /> always give us at least a fortnight's notice of a General Election.  If that be the case, there will not be much inconvenience caused to anybody by accepting this amendment.  The Minister intimated on Second Reading that he was prepared to accept this amendment, and I beg to move it.</P>

      <P>I formally move the amendments.  I should say that my reason for expressing the opinion that the amendments should be withdrawn was because of the attitude of the Minister last night on the propositions and arguments put forward.  I recognise that we advanced a very reasonable case that was entitled to consideration, and was, I think, entitled to be met with some forward step on the part of the Minister.  As far as I can see he could hardly deny the fact that our arguments as to the retention of the district councils was sound in so far as we showed that there was work that the district councils might do, that there was room, perhaps, for a change, an alteration, and a re-allocation of the duties that district councils might perform, and I did consider that the Minister might have been prepared today on consideration to say that at a further stage he would put in something else, some alternative that might in some way meet all the points of view that were expressed and outlined. If he is not prepared to do that I must admit that it is largely a waste of time to move the amendments, because if they meet with the same <i>non possumus</i> attitude as they did yesterday evening it is simply a question of waiting for the poll.  For that reason I was inclined to withdraw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I shall advance the point of view that came to me when I put down these amendments.  As I said yesterday evening, I do not take up the attitude that the district councils should be retained to function as at present, and it was not my intention that the administration of public health services or the service of sanitation would be retained under their jurisdiction. But I did say that they could perform services in the administration of district roads.  I also feel that in the administration of home help a local committee could do the work in a way that a county committee, meeting in a central <Col N="762" /> place, representing a huge area and a great number of people, charged with a very considerable expenditure, could not do it.  I believe, as I argued yesterday evening, that the time of a body like a district council would be well spent in doing this work.  I admit that there are districts, and perhaps counties, where apathy prevails as regards the retention or the abolition of district councils, and rightly so.  In some districts they have been a failure, an absolute failure, largely due to the events of the past three or four years, perhaps due in some cases to the personnel of these councils.  There are other districts where they have not been such a failure, and there are districts that feel strongly that these councils ought to be retained, and districts where the electorate feel that all their rights as regards local administration are to be taken very far away from their districts to some centre.  Beyond question, many counties might as well have their county councils functioning and administered from the city of Dubline as from where they are.  To many counties Dublin city is as accessible as portions of their own counties are, and the distance could be covered just as easily.</P>
    <P>I hold that the electorate in a district ought to be given a chance to say whether they are keen on having their district councils to continue.  The Minister, of course, may argue that this proposal would mean that elections would have to be put back a very considerable time.  If there was a desire to speed up and discover what the people think, there is no doubt whatever that a plebiscite could be taken on this within three months of the passing of the Bill.  We would then know what the people think.  After all, this is a question of local administration, local government, and the people locally should be consulted directly as to what is their point of view and in what fashion they seek to have their affairs administered.  I have put in one amendment that in any district, after the passing of this Bill, where 100 electors in the district present a petition to the Minister for the retention of their district council, he shall cause <Col N="763" /> a plebiscite or referendum to be taken of the total local government electorate in that district, and if two-thirds of those voting declare that the district council shall not be abolished, it shall not be abolished.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive any proposal that would be fairer than that.  If the situation is as the Minister for Finance yesterday evening argued it was, that the people do not care, we will probably not be able in a district to get 100 electors to sign the petition, or, the number who will go to the polls will be so very small that the majority would be against the retention of district councils, and the Minister will then have the sanction of the electorate for what he has taken on.  On the other hand, the Minister may advance the point of view that we would have one system prevailing in one part of a county and another in another district in the same county.  I cannot say I have a very wide experience of other counties, but in a county the rural district councils have either been a failure or they have been tolerably satisfactory.  In a county where the people are in favour of district councils they will be in favour of all the district councils in their county or none at all, and I cannot conceive that you would in any county be likely to have one district council retained and the others abolished. But even if they were like that, my amendment is so arranged, and I have amendments further on in the Bill arranged in such a way, that the functions of the district councils would not clash with the functions allocated to the county councils.  I feel that there are services that might be better performed by a central authority within a county.  But if there are services that might be administered locally, that the people locally want to administer.  I believe the Minister is erring in passing legislation that will deprive these people of the rights they have enjoyed up to the present, deprive them of a system of administration that as far as they are concerned as rate-payers has been satisfactory and as far as they can see will not be improved by the system the Minister proposes to introduce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Baxter in his proposition, and I am sure we shall have the support of the Minister for Justice.  He has been very eloquent and convincing in certain statements that have been made publicly regarding the ascertainment of the wishes of the inhabitants.  The proposition of Deputy Baxter is to administer local areas in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants duly ascertained. Surely we shall have the support of the Minister for Justice in this proposition, otherwise we will have to conclude that his argument will only apply in the odd case and that he is prepared to turn his back on the wishes of the inhabitants if they do not suit the Minister for Local Government. The case Deputy Baxter makes, that where the inhabitants of the district, having an opportunity of declaring their wishes, vote by a two-thirds majority in favour of the retention of the rural district council, seems to me to safeguard the declared intention of the Minister and his supporters, because they have insisted that the rural district councils have been extravagant, wasteful and incompetent.  Then they will have the choice as to whether in their view the rural district councils have been extravagant, incompetent, and unworthy of support.  If, despite the Minister's views on this question, the people are prepared to pay for their extravagance and bear the responsibility of their incompetence, then I suggest they should be allowed to.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is not inappropriate to remind Ministers of another phrase that has come frequently from their lips&mdash;that it is better to have self-government, even though it means bad government, than government from an outside authority.  In respect of certain purely local services it is well that the inhabitants of a locality should have the responsibility, and that is what Deputy Baxter's amendment proposes to ensure, and I hope the Minister for Justice will support it.</P>

      <P>I regret that through a misapprehension I was not here in time last night to oppose vigorously the abolition of district councils and <Col N="765" /> vote against the section in the Bill which was unfortunately carried.  I think it would be a good business proposition if the Minister would inform the Dáil what machinery he proposes to set up in lieu of the district councils before he puts down a section to abolish them.  I went very carefully through the Bill and I did not see there was anything in the Bill to satisfy us on that point.  We are groping in the dark.  We do not know what machinery is to be set up.  Of course, I speak from the point of view of the County Tirconaill.  I cannot for the life of me see what machinery he is going to set up to carry on the business that is allocated to district councils at the present time.  I suppose he intends to make the office or position of county councillor in Tirconaill a whole-time job and keep him in Lifford for three weeks of each month in the year.  If I had been here last night I would have advocated giving the district councils more extended powers, because in my opinion the district councils should have the administration of the Medical Charities Act and also home help, formerly known as outdoor relief.  There you have the representatives of the people and they are the people who would be in a proper position to administer these things in an honest and upright way.</P>
      <P>I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment which is down in the name of Deputy Baxter, although it does not go far enough so far as I am concerned, because I am convinced that the rural councils should not be abolished for the very reason that there is no machinery set up in the Bill to take their place.  You will hear me later on on this subject, as I have notes and statistics upstairs which I will bring down, and between this and Friday you will hear something vigorous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am so keen on supporting this amendment is that I think it should meet with the wishes of the Minister for Local Government. We are supposed to be a democratic assembly, acting on behalf of the people and voicing their opinions.  If that be so, we should give the people an opportunity of expressing their views regarding the abolition of the <Col N="766" /> district councils.  This amendment will not cause any expenditure.  A plebiscite can be taken at the church doors or in clubs or halls, and I am sure that the opinion of the people will be voiced in that manner.  Of course I am well aware of the fact that the Minister for Justice, the President, and the Minister for Local Government are of opinion that a plebiscite cannot be taken at the church doors or in the schools, because in their opinion there might be corruption, or there might be tactics used to make people sign against their will. That is not so, for wherever there is a district council the people of the district are the people who pay the rates, and if they wish their council to remain why not give them that opportunity of saying so?  It was pointed out yesterday that this proposal to abolish them was based on grounds of economy.  I would like to remind the Minister that this will not mean economy, but will result in effects similar to those under the amalgamation schemes.  At the inquiry into the administration of Offaly Co. Council the Secretary swore that he did not see that any saving was effected by the amalgamation scheme.  Surely that should be sufficient proof.  Surely these officials are not going to swear what are not facts.  If the people of the district in which there is a Rural Council have not an opportunity of having some representatives to carry out local administration it will not be a saving but will mean increased expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment gives the Minister an opportunity of saying whether he really believes in the voice of the majority of the people and whether he is really sincere when he talks about majority rule.  If such a vote results in two-thirds of the people being in favour of the retention of Rural Councils, I do not see why they should not remain.  It is an understood fact that you have several Rural District Councils which were capable bodies.  We have been told by Deputy Good that the District Councils never did any real service, but I can tell him that they have done a great deal of useful work.  In the first place, it was through the district councils, and through their bombarding the different local government officers, that they succeeded <Col N="767" /> in getting decent houses in the form of labourers' cottages.  Yet we are told that they have served no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>There are other councils which look after the old and infirm, and at present if an aged person wants to get shelter he has perhaps to be taken thirty or forty miles away.  Yet we are told that that is no expense.  I suppose it costs nothing for a motor car or van.  By having control of local administration the rural district council will be the proper authority to look after such people.  I think all local administration should be in the hands of district councils, and where the people are against dissolving them these councils should remain.  I hope that every Deputy will support the amendment in order to give the people an opportunity of voicing their opinions as to whether the rural councils should be abolished. Personally, I do not see why any Deputy should not support the amendment unless, of course, he is part of the voting machine, and comes in here at the press of a button, and says <i>tá</i> when he really prefers to say <i>níl</i>, or says <i>níl</i> when in his heart he means <i>tá.</i> I ask the Minister to let this amendment go to a free vote of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter in moving his amendment seemed very reluctant to do so.  His principal reason appeared to be that he considered that it covered very much the same ground as that covered by the amendment yesterday.  For that reason I think that he showed a great deal of common-sense in not inflicting another debate on the Dáil.  Deputy Lyons, however, has come to his assistance and insists on plunging the Dáil into a new discussion on this matter. Many Deputies have objected to this Bill on the ground that there is no substitute for the rural district council. If they were carefully to read the Bill, however, and read it in connection with the Electoral Act for local councils they would understand that there are such things as electoral areas in each county. These areas are apportioned out on a much more equitable and more sensible system than the rural district <Col N="768" /> councils.  In these areas you have got, approximately, equal populations and the areas are approximately equal also. Each of these areas will send a certain number of representatives to the county council elected in accordance with the system of Proportional Representation. You have, accordingly, in each area the nucleus of a committee which can perform all the work of a rural district council without having to go to additional expense in electing such members, and in paying salaries to officials, and also in paying establishment charges.</P>

Does the Minister mean to convey that the committee he suggests in each county council area should be a voluntary committee, that is, that whatever services are rendered by them shall be voluntary, or will it be mandatory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that these committees will be voluntary.  In fact, it is a logical thing for these people to do when elected, to come together to decide a common policy in regard to matters that affect their own particular area, and there is no necessity for them in doing that to have an expensive establishment to carry out their duty. There is authority for the county council to set up committees in the ordinary way under a previous Act, but with regard to local committees, I do not think that the county councils have that power at the moment.  However, it is a matter that we can discuss at a later stage.  I am in favour of making it as easy as possible to establish these committees, but it is a thing we want to allow considerable latitude in.  If we tie these committees to any hard and fast line it would mean that that would defeat the purpose of these committees.  We want power to appoint committees that will serve the special interests of local areas, as well as the general interests that concern the whole of the county areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been objected by Deputy Baxter that there is nothing to take the place of these rural councils, but I submit that those committees will be a very good substitute, and will perform these duties very much better, first of all because they will be elected for a sensible area instead of being elected for a ridiculously disproportionate area like the district councils; and, secondly, because the election or appointment of such committees will not involve the very high expense incurred by rural councils at present&mdash;£65,000 <Col N="771" /> for their election every three years, and £85,000 for establishment charges.</P>

      <P>There was a discussion yesterday about amalgamation, and Deputy Baxter complained that if this Bill is to follow the lines of the amalgamation system it will prove a failure.  I would like Deputies to understand that the amalgamation has not proved a failure.  It would not have been at all surprising, under the circumstances of the great agricultural depression in this country, that amalgamation would show an increase in the cost of the administration of poor law relief, particularly when you take into consideration the high pensions that are being paid, and that a great number of public buildings have to be reconstructed in order to fit in with the amalgamation scheme.  I have a list of the expenditure in the different counties incurred under the head of poor law relief before and after the amalgamation. In every county there has been a saving under the amalgamation scheme, with the exception of one county, and that is Kildare.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested both to-day and yesterday that the amalgamation scheme has not caused a saving, and I think it is only fair that I should get up and answer.  The one county where we had an increase under that scheme was Kildare, and there the poor relief was administered by the rural district councils, the honest and upright administration, as Deputy White declared, rural councils to be. We sent an inspector down to do away with these honest and upright bodies, and the result is that we saved £20,000.</P>

      <P>In another district, with an area of 52,849 acres, there is a population of 32,800.  Under the Bill the county council will comprise 36 elected members for five county electoral areas, and they will be apportioned as follows:&mdash;Donegal 9, Letterkenny 8, Milford 5, Ballyshannon 7, and Glenties 7.  The election will be by Proportional Representation, and each local interest can be as well represented in each of those five areas as they are in the present eight rural districts, served by so many councils.  That can be done without incurring double charges for the election of representatives.  So much for the County of Donegal.  On the whole, there has been no case made out for this proposal of Deputy Baxter's.  It will only lead to two systems of local government.  In one part of the county you would have the rural district council with all its high <Col N="773" /> charges retained, and in another part of the county you would have this centralised system.  Unless I hear some arguments of a convincing nature I must say that I could not entertain the idea of any change in my attitude towards the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the whole Bill falls through on the admission of the Minister.  He admits that there must be a committee set up to administer the affairs of each district.  The only difference is that the rural district councils are the committees set up by the vote of the people and at their expressed wish, whereas the committee suggested by the Minister will be elected by the county council.  County councillors who might be living fifty miles away will be casting a vote in a rural district that they never saw the <Col N="774" /> sun shining upon.  That would be undemocratic and unfair; and on that basis alone the whole Bill falls through, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst the Minister's figures were, I am sure, very interesting to most Deputies, he has not yet made a case for the abolition of district councils.  However, that is not the question before us now.  The Minister, in his statement, did not deal with the amendment proposed by Deputy Baxter.  He did not give any definite argument against the proposal that people should be allowed to determine for themselves the usefulness or otherwise of district councils.  It is not too much to ask the Minister to reply to an amendment that is put before the Dáil.  I say that the Minister is misleading the Dáil by two statements that he has made.  He said that rural district councils cost this country something like £65,000.  I say that is not true; I state definitely that it is not true, because district and county council elections have always been held in this country on the one day.  It would cost the same amount of money to provide machinery for a county council election as it would to have the two elections at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister knows that, and it is not fair on his part to tell the Dáil what he has told it in order to get a certain amount of support for his Bill.  He should try to make a good case.  There were no Deputies on his benches yesterday when he was making his case&mdash;not a single Deputy.  He says that at the present moment county councils are entitled to appoint committees to do certain work.  Anybody who knows anything about county council work is aware that that is incorrect. The county council is entitled to appoint asylum committees, agricultural and technical instruction committees, roads and finance committees, and other committees of a similar nature which control the whole area; but it is not fair to suggest, or try to get anybody to draw the inference from that statement, that the county councils are at present entitled to appoint committees to function over different areas in the county.  That is not so, and the Minister has no right <Col N="775" /> to mislead the Dáil in order to bring some pressure to bear on Deputies to support the Bill.  The Minister did not endeavour to deal with Deputy Baxter's amendment.  Everybody, I think, will agree that the amendment is reasonable. The people should be allowed to determine for themselves whether district councils are wanted or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether the committees shall be appointed by the county councils.  Section 12 says that the board of health may from time to time appoint as many committees as it may think fit.  The county board of health is only a body nominated by the county council.  You are, therefore, giving power to that body to nominate a committee, although that body is not elected the same as the county council. I think that the county council should have power to nominate those committees.  There is one more question I would like to ask.  Will the clerks, who are at present acting for the district councils, be continued as clerks for those committees?  Will those clerks be acting in the same capacity on those committees as they are at present acting for the district councils? While this amendment is before the Dáil we ought to be told the position. The Minister has made no explanation in regard to the clerks.  Yesterday, in reply to me, the Minister told us that all these officers would be transferred from the district to the county councils. Now, as he has come half-way and suggested that committees would be appointed for carrying out local administration, will he say whether the clerks will be continued in employment on those committees?  Will they be saved from dismissal, and will we, therefore, avoid giving unnecessary superannuation to people quite well able to work?</P>

      <P>I will take the Minister back to the realities of the case by asking him some questions. Is it mandatory that these committees should be appointed to operate in the districts over which the district councils carried out their administration? Who will take the initiative for the <Col N="776" /> appointment of those committees?  If those committees are not appointed, who will carry out the administration of the districts previously administered by the district councils?  Will the committee be elected by the county council or by the people in the district?  If he answers these few questions he would give us an understanding of where we are with regard to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to label Deputy Baxter as an enthusiast for the Boundary Commission. The object of the amendment is to place the different rural areas in the position of opting out of the Local Government Bill altogether, and setting up their own Rural Councils in direct opposition to the whole trend of the Bill, which is to abolish Rural Councils.  It seems to be rather illogical, and, if carried, would be fatal to the whole purpose of the Bill.  It seems to me that this whole question of the committee automatically operates in connection with the County Council, because you have got men from the different areas in the county representing the different districts, or I presume you will when the Bill is passed.  They themselves, for any practical purpose, would be in touch with the neighbourhood from which they come, and they would, I think, afford to the County Council all the local information that would be required in connection with the affairs of the county&mdash;</P>

If you are going to have a separate government for every little area, I think the sooner the Government recognises that either a united Ireland or a united Saorstát is out of the question the better.  If every area is to claim that it has a right to administer its own affairs, then I think we would have to adopt the procedure that is adopted in connection with the United States.  Except that we all know the members who have spoken in favour of this amendment are against the abolition of the Rural Councils, I do not think they have brought forward any real reason in favour of this amendment that has not been advanced on the broad question in connection with the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I am quite clear about it, but I think the Minister wanted to give us the impression that we wanted, by this amendment, to have power to establish these committees.  Did he want us to understand that we have power to establish these committees in the different districts? I wonder is he at the moment in the frame of mind that he is considering whether we ought to have the power to establish these committees or not?  If we can get him to go so far as to admit that, we would be thankful for small mercies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat makes the point about areas opting out and setting up their own Councils.  Now, I want him to understand that it is not the power of setting up our own Councils that we want at all, but the power to let the councils exist as they are at present, if the people want them.  All we want is to give the people a chance of saying whether the Councils are to continue in existence or not.  Nobody has a better right to say whether they are to continue to exist than the people who are responsible for bringing them into existence and who keep them in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying as far as we can to help the Minister to devise what, as we see things, is the best system for dealing with local administration. Now is it an easy thing to say that a district can be well represented by a councillor coming into a county council meeting from a distance of thirty or forty miles, or coming into a meeting of the board of health, and putting to that meeting the point of view of his district?  Anyone who knows how the affairs of a county council are conducted knows very well that a county councillor coming in from any particular district, if he is capable of making enough noise at the meeting of the council, would be able to get a greater part of the road money spent in his part of the county.  Similarly on a board of health, he would be successful in getting a greater amount of money spent on outdoor relief in his part of the district.  That is happening to-day.  That will continue to happen, and the system that is now set up provides for that happening.  What we <Col N="778" /> want to provide is that the money that is raised in the district, would be spent in the district.  If there is too much spent in a particular district the electorate will have to bear that, and they will alter that system.  We want to give the people who understand the present system an opportunity of saying whether or not that system is to live.  The Minister says we have not made our case.  I hold that the Minister has not made a case for the change.</P>

Then the only thing you will have changed will be the name.  What will be known as the &ldquo;district committee&rdquo; will replace what is called the &ldquo;district council.&rdquo;  I know also that in the meantime, in dissolving these district councils, you will get rid of the present officials and put in a new lot of officials to do the work of the district committees.</P>

Where there are five electoral divisions, if two of these voted that they would continue to have rural district councils functioning as they are, what is to happen in the case of the other three? What position would the county council in such a county be in?  How can the county council then function?  These are matters I would like to have explained. Everybody who has any knowledge of county council work knows that the county council does delegate certain work to committees in certain parts of the county.  These committees have to submit their findings to the county council for ratification.  That is the position in the county councils at present.  The same as any ordinary committee, it has to go back to the parent body.  That is the position of the county councils at the moment.</P>

    <P>(4)  Every such council may from time to time appoint, out of their own body, such and so many committees, either of a general or special nature, and consisting of such number of persons, as they think fit, for any purposes which, in the opinion of the council, would be better regulated <Col N="780" /> and managed by means of such committees; but the acts of every such committee shall be submitted to the council for their approval.</P>

They appoint Roads Committees, Finance Committees, and other committees of various kinds.  They have the power to appoint these committees to-day, but the committees have to report back to the county council, and it is for them to sanction or reject the recommendations of the committees.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have seen committees that had the expenditure of considerable sums of money.  The council in its wisdom thought they were not the proper people to deal with certain matters and they appointed six or seven members to give them proper consideration, with very good results. If this amendment is not carried, county councils in the future can appoint committees to look after roads in certain areas.  Take counties where you have Ridings for north, south, east and west.  The county councillors for each area can be formed into a committee to look after the roads in the area.  In that way, I say they will do as well as any district councils could do, because these people live in the area, and there will be no necessity to have an official or a District Clerk to do <Col N="781" /> the work.  The officials of the county councils are the people who will call these committees together.  An official will go there to keep a record of the proceedings, and it will be done in quite a proper manner.  I do not think there is any necessity at all for the amendment as it stands.  As regards getting a hundred people out of a rural district to sign a requisition where the population of that rural district is 30,000, I think it would be quite preposterous for any sane body of men to do anything of the kind.</P>

What Deputy Hughes referred to is county committees, not district committees.  The two are quite distinct.  The impression is given by the Minister's statement that these district committees would largely replace district councils.  That is not right and it will not be right in practice.

      <P>We want to know where we are.  I think we have got a right to know.  I suggest that even the Minister does not know where he is on this question.  Before we argue the merits or demerits of this case, we want to know where we are, if the Minister can tell us.  If we are to have these district committees functioning, what in the name of goodness is the argument for getting rid of the district councils?  We have the machinery there already, but it will be scrapped by giving effect to the first section of this Bill.  The next thing that will happen after scrapping is <Col N="782" /> superannuation.  These district committees are going to be set up.  If they are to have anything to do they will have to be staffed.  Another staff will have to be appointed.  I suggest the Minister does not know what he is contemplating at all.  He has introduced this Bill and I suggest he knows nothing about it.  What constitutional position will those district committees have?  I can understand committees appointed to look after home help, asylums and other specific duties. They are not district committees; they are county committees which are district altogether.  I want to know further, will those district committees be administrative or advisory and on what?  Will it be on home help, road maintenance, sewerage and all the rest?  We want to be quite clear as to what their duties will be.  We do not know what their duties will be.  Voluntary committees?  What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in this connection?  Are they to be constituted voluntarily, and to work voluntarily? Perhaps the people appointed to convene them will be also voluntary or honorary, or whatever you like to call them.</P>
      <P>I admit that if the functions of a county are going to be administered by one body there must be committees. No county council can do the work of the county council, and do it well, except it sits two or three days a month. Neither could the board of health do the work, and do it well, in one day&mdash; and I have some knowledge of them&mdash; only for the number of sub-committees that are set up by the board of health out of its own body, to deal with certain specific questions.  As a matter of fact, there are sub-committees meeting every week, and the same will have to be done with the county councils.  To talk about voluntary bodies or district committees replacing district councils is just the same as if the work were left to the district councils.  The name committee or council is just the same.  I suggest that you leave the present staff there, and get on as you are.  I think the Minister does not know very well what he contemplates.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I understand the matter, but to my <Col N="783" /> mind the position of affairs is that the county councils still retain the power under the Act of 1898, and may appoint committees.  There is no mention whatever in the Bill of provision being made for the appointment of these committees by the county council. I think that is perfectly clear.  A provision is made in Section 12 whereby county councils appoint boards of health from their own members, and these boards of health are then authorised to appoint committees.  These committees may either be of a character that will cover the entire health area or may be appointed to deal with specific points in limited areas of the health area.  A point has been raised, and I think it is a fairly good point, as to who is to call these committees together, and who is to be responsible for them.  Is it the secretary of the board of health who has to meet these specific committees throughout the county?  I think that is a point that should be defined, because, as Deputy Gorey has mentioned, it might quite reasonably necessitate the appointment of quite a number of individuals to posts that are not filled at the present moment.  I think I have made the position of affairs clear to my own mind, that there is no use talking about the appointment of committees by the county councils to replace the district councils.  I do not think that is contemplated by the Minister.  If it is, there is no provision whatsoever made for it in this Bill.  The provision of committees by boards of health is specifically stated.</P>

Deputy Gorey seems to be in difficulty as to whether these committees will be district committees or county committees. What I pointed out was, that for the purposes of election each county will be divided into electoral areas.  There are, say, seven electoral areas in a county, and each one elects seven representatives to the county council. These men can, and would, naturally come together to decide various matters relating to their own particular area.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Gorey would not be quite so bucolic in his interruptions.  Where necessary, those staffs are transferred from the rural district council to the county council, and where necessary the clerk of the county board of health or the county council can call those committees together.  In most cases the duties of these committees will be of a very informal nature, dealing with labourers' cottages and questions of that kind. It would not be necessary to have a huge staff if you have a regular county council officer to conduct the business. While we are putting the Act into operation we do not wish to tie up these various committees with hard and fast regulations.  It might be necessary in different areas to appoint committees for different purposes.  In an area that is likely to be frequented by tourists, it might be necessary to have a committee with regard to that particular matter.  In another area there might be a defective water supply, and it might be necessary to set up a committee there.  I do not want to put any statutory limitations as to the kind of committees that can be set up by the county council.</P>

I am separating county committees, such as the County Committee of Agriculture, the County Technical Committee, and the Finance and Road Committee, all of which are nominated by the county council. Leaving all these committees apart, I want to know if the Minister will consider the advisability of inserting in this Bill something that will give the county council or the electorate power to constitute committees, with special functions, and will he also make provision for an official to take charge of the work of these district committees?

In addition, there are quarterly meetings of the county council which occupy the members a whole day, and at the end of the day it frequently happens that all the business is not done.  There are also meetings of the roads and finance committees and of several other committees, such as the public health committee and the asylum committee.  My point is that if a county council as a county council were to be asked to do all that work, without the assistance of such committees, it could not be done in less than a week every month.</P>

My recollection of the work done by rural district councils in the past was that about once a fortnight, after the meetings of the boards of guardians, a certain number of the personnel of the boards of guardians remained on and transacted, in half an hour or forty minutes, the work of the rural district councils.  The board of guardians are gone.  The rural district councils remain for the present.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite sure whether we are thinking in terms of efficient and economical administration or thinking in terms of petty parish vested interests, in terms of little local Bumbles of one kind or another, whose attitude simply is: &ldquo;We are here because we are here, and we should not be called upon to justify our existence. If you attempt to say that the county council, properly run, is capable of supervising the local administration of a county, then you are saying something blasphemous, because that means our extinction.&rdquo;  I do not know that we should have much patience with that kind of mentality.  We are told that because the county council consists of men drawn from a rather large area it will not know the conditions in the outlying localities, that administration there will be neglected, and that people will have nobody to look after their requirements. I have a fair idea of the size of an electoral area.  If six or seven county councillors, elected from an area of that size, are not capable of representing their area within the county council, it is a strange thing.  It is because we are thinking in terms of little vested interests, of the little patronage&mdash; people strutting awhile on the little stage of the rural district council&mdash;and not in terms of value for the money of the ratepayers of the county, that we have such a storm in this rather miserable teacup.  If the people learn to look seriously to their representatives on the county council to give them value for the rates they pay, if they take the obvious course when and if they come to the conclusion that they are not getting that value, then the standard of efficiency in the county councils, and within the staffs of the county council, will tend to rise steadily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county council is a committee of the ratepayers.  The members are themselves ratepayers, but that conception tends to sink into the background, and you have a situation arising in which men who are themselves members of the county council advise people&mdash; as I have known them to do&mdash;not to pay their rates, because they are not getting fair value for their money.  Surely, <Col N="790" /> if a member of a county council thinks that people are not getting value for their rates, he has his remedy; he has his platform.  Surely, the very reason of his membership of the county council is to see that such a state of affairs as that does not prevail.  If we have six representatives of the ratepayers coming from that comparatively small area, which is an electoral area, we should not be told that they are not capable of seeing that the local administration of the area which they come from is properly conducted, and of voicing any complaints and any grievances that may arise in that area within the county council&mdash;provided that they visualise themselves as representatives of the ratepayers of that area, and see that the ratepayers of that area get value for their money; provided that they visualise themselves in that light rather than in the light of people who, by the grace of God, have been given certain powers of patronage until the next local elections come round.  I have heard a term used to describe the rural district councils as at present existing.  It is a military term&mdash;buckshee&mdash;superfluous, lagging, unwanted on the stage, because the work they have to do at present and the work they do at present does not justify their existence and could be, I will not say as well done, but better done, more efficiently done, more economically done by the central body of the county.</P>
    <P>We are asked by Deputy Baxter to favour a kind of local option&mdash;a plebiscite on the important question of whether a district council, which probably has not met for six or eight months, but may be relied upon to meet within the next month to pass a resolution against this Bill, is to continue to drag out its existence.  One has a picture of the local rural district councillors, their friends and their relatives and the staff of the rural council, very busy and working hard for a successful plebiscite, so that the necessary 100 citizens may be got to say that &ldquo;What is is best.&rdquo;  What is is not best as regards the rural district councils.  What would be best is an efficient county council, with the people <Col N="791" /> insisting that they get from that body value for their money and taking the obvious steps, if they consider they are not getting value for their money.  Everyone knows that local administration in the country is capable of being toned up.  Everybody knows it should be toned up.  Everybody knows that within the staffs of many county councils people are not giving fair value for the ratepayers' money they receive as salary and wages.  These are the things that matter to the people.  These are the things that the people should be putting up to their representatives on the county council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The little outlying bodies that used to do their work in a hurried twenty minutes after the meeting of the board of guardians have no case for continued existence.  I would like to see a table made out showing how many of these councils have met, say, over the last four months.  I have no doubt they will begin to meet now.  I have no <Col N="792" /> doubt they will nearly all meet to make their little protest against the passing of this particular provision in the Bill. But let a fair examination be made over, say, any six or eight months taken at random.  Let us see how often these rural district councils met.  Let us see the business they transacted.  Let us take up that and ask ourselves whether it constitutes a fair case for the continuance of these bodies as statutory bodies; whether it is not a national waste, even supposing they were meeting regularly, to ask men to give up their time and travel to a meeting-place for that very small bit of work that now falls to be transacted by rural district councils.  I do not believe that a county council could not do its work well without meeting three months in the year.  I am not prepared to accept that.  I believe the county council could do all its present work, and the trifling additional work that would fall to it by the abolition of the rural district councils, very well, meeting no oftener than at present, provided that the members were awakened by the people they represent to a proper conception of what their role and functions are upon that body.  The county council, Deputy Gorey says, meets every month, and in addition quarterly.  I wonder how many county councils meet every month?</P>

Surely, they could meet oftener than that without <Col N="793" /> breaking down under the strain.  Supposing they met twice as often as that, would it be an intolerable burden?</P>
      <P>Facing up to it squarely, there is nothing in the local administration of a county that ought to be beyond the capacity of fifty or sixty intelligent men elected to that county council to administer efficiently and economically, provided that they have a fair sense of their duties, provided the people behind them, whom they represent, have a fair appreciation of what they are entitled to expect from their representatives on the county council.  Do not ask the Dáil to believe that these representatives from an electoral area are not capable of understanding such grievances, such complaints, such looseness as might arise in the local administration within an electoral area and of representing that adequately to the county council and insisting on its rectification.</P>
      <P>I am entirely against the idea that there should not be uniformity.  I am entirely against Deputy Baxter's idea that a local option, a kind of local plebiscite, should be invited on this question as to whether or not the rural district council as a factor in local administration is to disappear.  The sooner we get to the conception that the county council is, as it were, a local parliament administering and supervising local administration of the county, I believe the sooner we will get to a proper outlook and a proper perspective on this whole matter of the value for the rates which the people pay. When you have this dissipation of responsibility, so to speak, when you have a body shouldering the blame on somebody else, you cannot get down to the root of the trouble. You will be able to get down to the root of the trouble when you have simply one single responsibility in the county council, dealing with the rates of the county, answering, as it should answer, to the people for the administration of the rates of the county.  You will be told at present by a county councillor that the rural district councils are wasteful, that they are extravagant in their road administration, that their employees are not working&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At any rate people will not be able to put up that particular case in the future, and such things as are wrong in the county councils, they will not be able to pass over, as one hears them passed over at present, to some other body, or the rural councils.  The work that could be done in the past, as every Deputy here is aware, was done in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the board meeting, and it surely can be done at your own county parliament consisting of fifty or sixty members and with seven members from each electoral area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has been talking with his tongue in his cheek.  He really intended by a kind of sidelong glance at the Minister for Local Government to attack the Bill, in so far as it deals with the boards of health, but he thought he would attack it, in that way, by referring to the dissipation of energy and the responsibility lying on the central authority in respect of other matters than board of health matters, because all he said in denunciation of the proposal of Deputy Baxter applied with much more force to the propositions respecting the board of health.  The board of health is appointed by the county council&mdash;a sub-committee of the council to administer public health affairs.  It may appoint local committees consisting partly of its own members and of outsiders who are not elected, and that board of health is not to be responsible to the county council.  Where is the unification, the responsibility, the waste, the dissipation of energy, there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the responsibility of such a committee is the responsibility of the county council. The board of health is a sub-committee of the county council, as I understand it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of health is a sub-committee of the county council. It submits once a year an estimate <Col N="795" /> and is entirely irresponsible to them.  The Minister talked about a dissipation of energy and the sense of responsibility to the body which is elected directly by the ratepayers. Anything that is said in favour of local administration in public health and sanitation matters can be said to apply with equal force to the administration of such matters as roads, lighting, paving, water, libraries, wash-houses, and many of the other small matters that affect a locality, and you are taking from the locality that responsibility and centring it in an authority which is only dealing with the wider affairs of the county.  The Minister explains in one phrase how he has arrived at this misconception.  He speaks of the county council as a parliament. It is not a parliament.  It is an administrative authority.  Once you assume the county council is a parliament you are practically saying that the county council will hand over all the administration of the details to officials who will respond once a year with estimates and submit certain general proposals.  That is the explanation of this Bill.  The county council is to be a parliament and the officials are to be given all power of administration, with an occasional report to the parliament.  That, I think, explains a great deal in this Bill.  He talked about centralisation of responsibility in defence of a Bill which, in respect of its main provisions, decentralises that responsibility in a way that he has not recognised and is certainly in contradiction to the proposals that applied to the administration of local services outside health services.  I think the Minister would have been well advised to consult with the Minister for Local Government about this Bill before he entered into a defence of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he was not told that.  In arguing against the amendment, a statement was made by the Minister for Justice that the county councils will have ample time to transact all the business transferred to them from the district councils, as they only meet, at the very utmost, 16 days in the year.  I am a member of a county council, and I can say that it takes anything from 40 to 50 days in the year&mdash;one day each week&mdash;one day for the county council, a day for the committee of management, a day for the agricultural and technical instruction committee, and a day for the county board of health.  That would be 52 days in the year, and with the extra work of the district councils it will at least mean another day per week.  The Minister for Justice has not really any idea of the amount of labour that would be placed on the unfortunate county councillors.  If he had, I am sure that he would not advocate the rejection of this amendment.  He further said that the officials of the county council will perform this extra duty.  I would like to remind the Minister that the officials of the county councils can at any time resign under Article X of the Treaty, and if you impose extra duties on them they will resign and the county councils would have no option but to superannuate them and appoint other officials.  We will have in a very short time in this country of ours nine people out of every ten pensioners and drawing superannuation from public bodies.  I think that the Minister for Justice was not right when he said that the county councils would only have to meet 16 days in the year.</P>

Whether it is under Article X of the Treaty or not, I know it is right.  That will certainly happen.  Ministers stand up here and say that it is more or less a pleasure for members of county councils to attend meetings on 16 days in the year, but in some cases you will find that 52 days are taken up, if a member of the county council is a member of different committees, as he generally is.  I think that the Minister for Local Government has made out no case against the amendment and I am quite sure that the Minister for Justice has really made a case for the amendment.</P>

I think that the Minister has made no case against this amendment, in fact no one who has spoken from the Government benches has.  I think the supporters of the Government ought to be congratulated, as some of them have spoken to-day.  Yesterday Deputy Baxter had to force one to speak on behalf of Sec. tion 3.

      <P>The procedure as to how these councils are going to function as one board.  You are aware that contracts have been largely dealt with by some district councils.  For instance in Tirconaill, Cavan and Kerry, where roads are dealt with under the contract system, the contractors have to meet at the local district council office to enter into these contracts.  In Tirconaill that will mean that they will have to go, in some cases, nearly a hundred miles if they have to go to the county council office.

      <P>In regard to the substantive motion now before the Dáil, I desire to say that I think that a strong case could have been made out, should have been made out, but I do not think it has been made <Col N="803" /> out, for the abolition of rural councils, simply because they do not correspond to any real unit in the life of the country. Although this point has not been put forward in justification of Section 3, I take it that the real argument is that the rural councils, for example, have been described as continuing a lingering life and not functioning at all in the life of the country.  That is perfectly true, and everybody who knows the country knows that that is what is happening.  Very strong arguments have been put up by those against the section, who say that there should be something more near to the local life of the people, more nearly corresponding to that life than the county councils which are to take over all the functions that ceased to exist in the review and administration of local councils as up to this moment.  I was not able to be here yesterday, but I remember reading that Deputy Cooper stated that if somebody came down from ancient days and were to see the rural councils, he would not recognise anything in them that corresponds to the real life of the people or anything that is typically Irish.  When one goes back to the historical conditions under which rural councils were established one can see why they did not correspond to anything geographically or economically real in the life of the country.  They expressed nothing in which the life of the people ever did, or does now move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, although I agree that the facts of the case show that the rural councils have failed to correspond with, and have failed to be moved in any measure by the life of the people, I disagree equally fundamentally, from my point of view, with the taking over of those functions by the county councils.  Remember the time when the rural district councils were first drawn up and brought into the life of Ireland&mdash;if one may use that expression of something not drawn into the life of Ireland at all&mdash;but when they were first imposed on the life of Ireland in an Act which was taken over from another country. When geographical units were drawn over the map of Ireland for rural district councils, how they came to be <Col N="804" /> drawn in the manner they were then, it would puzzle the mind of man to discover, for they are arbitrary outlines throughout.  I urge that the county councils are equally arbitrary. If it be true to say, and I think it would, and I would admit at once that the rural district councils are arbitrary units that do not correspond to anything real in the geographical or economical life of the country, then it is equally true that the county councils are arbitrary, and in fact the county areas were drawn even more arbitrarily, when they were first given existence at the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of the seventeenth century, than those units known as rural district councils.</P>
    <P>Take any county that comes to the mind of any Deputy&mdash;take Mayo, for instance.  Will anyone say that County Mayo suggests any kind of geographical or economic unity, or any kind of conceivable unity at all?  Take County Wicklow.  I remember in the old days when the political organisation was being conducted, and it was found necessary to convene a committee for County Wicklow, it was necessary to bring the people constituting that committee to Dublin, for they could meet much more easily in Dublin than in any part of the County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>While I support fully the abolition of rural district councils, because I think the case made out against them is clear&mdash;that they do not correspond to any part of the real life of the country&mdash;I do suggest that every argument that is true against the existence of rural councils is equally true, and in many cases much more forcibly true, in regard to county councils.  That is what occurs to me as a fundamental fault of this Bill: that it has started to abolish certain things that were unreal, and that it has imposed the duties done by these councils, that are unreal, upon other councils which are equally unreal, whereas what is urgently wanted to be done is to devise some new unit altogether, something not so small as rural district councils, and something not so large as county councils.  It would be something that is more clearly and closely corresponding to <Col N="805" /> the life of the people amongst whom it is functioning.</P>
    <P>Those new units would not be so very difficult to discover.  Every person who has participated in fairs knows that there is a certain community of interest existing in what are known as fair and market centres.  There are many units that are geographically in touch with one another, that are woven together as far as their economic life is concerned, and if the local life and local government of the country is based upon those units, we would be able to get away from the unreality of the rural district area and also from the more glaring unreality of the county council area.  I support the section that is now before the Dáil, to abolish the rural councils; but I would urge that the task that will be imposed by its abolition has not been included in the Bill.  I think experience will prove that the county councils will not merely not have the time, but will not be able to equip themselves for the additional duties which will be put upon them, because they will not have the close correspondence with the life of the areas, the administration of which is their primary concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the question is put, I would like to remind the Minister for Local Government that at the inception of the Local Government Act of 1898, given to us by England, it was optional with the County Council of Cork to divide that county into two county councils, and have an East <Col N="806" /> Riding County Council and a West Riding County Council.  The people of the Cork County Council made a mistake. They did not avail of the option that the Act gave them.  There was plenty of room in the County of Cork for two county councils.  This is rendered all the more necessary as the interests of the two areas were altogether different.  In the West Riding you had a lot of piers along the seaboard and it cost a lot of money to repair them and also for their ordinary upkeep.  If it is proverbial that the wise men came from the East, it was not the case that time.  The western people had the best of it that time by allowing for the whole county one county council.  That being the case, I think the time is now opportune, when this Bill is going through, to ask the Minister for Local Government to make the County Cork into two county council areas.  This would be much more equitable all round and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 merely provides for the automatic substitution of the county councils or county boards of health for the R.D. Councils in cases of law actions pending at the time of the transfer and bonds and agreements not then fully executed.  It is consequential upon Section 3.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>(1)  Any joint board, committee, or authority, all of whose members were, prior to the passing of this Act, elected or appointed by the councils of rural districts situate in the same county health district shall, from and after the appointed day, cease to exist, and the powers, duties, property, and liabilities of such joint board, committee, or authority shall be transferred to the council of the county in which such county health district is situate, and such powers and duties shall be exercised and performed by such county council through and by the board of health for such county health district.</P>
      <P>(2)  The members of any public body in office on the appointed day who were appointed or elected by the council of a rural district shall cease to hold office on the appointed day, and where, prior to the passing of this Act, it was the duty of the council of a rural district in a county to elect members of any public body, it shall, from and after the appointed day, be the duty of the council of such county to elect such members of such public body.</P>
      <P>This sub-section shall not apply to any public body to which the first sub-section of this section applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 provides that <Col N="809" /> in cases where members of boards and committees, and so on, are elected by rural district councils entirely inside one county health area, their functions will be transferred to the county council. The rural district councils will be abolished, and when their functions are transferred to the county council, it will, in turn, transfer them to the county board of health.  In other cases those committees are to stand, but their members are to be appointed by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section gives us the opportunity of asking the Minister questions in regard to the committees.  The section does away with all the committees that have been formed by the district councils and all the powers of the district councils are transferred to the county council. Does the Minister intend to allow county councils to re-appoint such committees as will be abolished under this section?  Does the Minister intend, under this Bill, to give power to the county councils, as elected bodies, to appoint such committees as they think necessary for different districts?  Further, I would like to ask the Minister if he thinks it right or fair to have appointed for each district, committees to do the work which an elected body should really do.  The ratepayers want to be represented in a proper manner. I think that the ratepayers want the people who are to transact their business for them to be people whom they themselves have elected.  These are the people that would be responsible to them and not the people who may be nominated by the councillors whom the ratepayers elected.  In other words the Minister is giving full power in another section to committees such as are appointed by the districts.  Under this section he is doing away with that power.  He is giving power under Section 12 to the nominated body to appoint committees.  I think he should explain his attitude as to whether it is his intention to give power to the county councils to nominate these committees that he is now abolishing by Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be reasonable to ask the Minister to explain <Col N="810" /> for our enlightenment the effect of this section, and the kind of board, committee, or authority that was in the mind of the Minister when he inserted it; also the kind of board referred to in Sub-section (2).  No doubt we could find out if we went through all the Acts and Orders, and made close inquiries, but in presenting a section of this kind it seems to me reasonable to ask the Minister to explain what will be its effect in application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Lyons' point would be better raised on Section 12.  These are only committees of a minor importance, burial boards and trivial bodies of that kind.  Where these boards are appointed by rural district councils, all of which come within the same county health area, their duties are transferred to the county board of health, which will appoint the committees.  In other cases that cannot be done, and accordingly the appointment of the committees is to be vested in the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That merely repeats what the section says, except for the statement that included in these boards would be burial boards, so that we have not got very much further.  I do not think it is asking too much for the Dáil to request the Minister to enlighten us as to what is intended by the section and what would be the effect of the enactment of that section upon the administration.  It seems to me to be part of the duty of one who is piloting the Bill to explain the effect of the technical phraseology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

      <P>(1)  Any joint board, committee, or authority, all of whose members were, prior to the passing of this Act, elected or appointed by the councils of rural districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>According to this section, all such committees are scrapped. The Minister wants to do away with <Col N="811" /> all such committees, whether elected or appointed by the district councils, and to replace them by some that may be set up by a body that is not elected, such as the county board of health.  Personally, I think the Dáil is entitled to a better explanation as to the meaning or as to what the effect of the section will be.  Will it result in a saving to the different districts? To my mind there will be no saving.  I think we are entitled to know the body we will have to look to in future to appoint such committees as will be required to carry on local administration. I want to see appointments made by the elected representatives of the people and not by persons who do not represent the people, such as those who would be co-opted or appointed by the county council.  I think we are entitled to some explanation as to who will have authority to make such appointments in the future should this section be carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C.M. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand this section, it means that at present rural district councils appoint representatives on harbour boards and burial boards.  Burial boards are constituted by district and urban councils.  In future I understand when the district councils will cease to exist the county councils will appoint such representatives.

Rural district councils will disappear under this Bill.  Rural district councillors were ex-officio members of boards of guardians.  If they are not elected, as they will not be after this Bill passes&mdash;if there is any necessity again for electing boards of guardians, power will have to be given for that, as they cannot become members of boards of guardians ex-officio.

    <P>(1)  From and after the appointed day, and subject to the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section, the area of every county, with the exception of those portions (if any) of that area which are included in urban districts, shall for all purposes form one rural sanitary district or rural district within the meaning of the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1919, and the council of such <Col N="814" /> county shall be the sanitary authority for such rural sanitary district or rural district, and such rural sanitary district or rural district shall be called by the name of the county health district with the addition of the name of the county.</P>

It could be done better on the recommendation of the council of the county. Local councils ought to be the best judges of what divisions should be made in any county and beyond doubt their opinion ought to be invited.  It is on their recommendations I think the divisions ought to be made in any county.  I think it would be rather arbitrary if the Minister himself could make a division in a county, regardless of the point of view of the council or board of health in that county.  My amendment will ensure that the council must be consulted and it is on their recommendation the boundary shall be marked in the rural sanitary <Col N="816" /> area if there are to be more than one sanitary district in a county.</P>

      <P>The only objection I would see to the amendment would be in the event of the council not doing it the Minister would not have any power then to determine the area.  I think it is very proper, as Deputy Baxter says, that the council should be consulted in any division of the area.  I am sure they would be consulted, but supposing they failed to do it you would leave the Minister in a difficulty.  Would you not?</P>

      <P>I can quite easily recognise that the council of a county may agree, or the board of health may agree, that a county be divided into two or more rural sanitary areas, but when it comes to marking out the line that is to define these rural sanitary areas that is another matter.  The Minister may easily agree at first, but generally what would happen would <Col N="817" /> be that the county board of health would decide that a county would be divided into two or three sanitary areas.  That may be as far as they would get.  The Minister may come along and, without consulting the Board of Health at all, or the people who decided on the division of the county, mark out the lines where he chooses.  I think this is a safeguard. It is better that the people should be consulted.  I believe it is necessary.</P>

    <P>(a)  in a county to which for the <Col N="818" /> time being no county scheme relates, or</P>
    <P>(b)  adjoining a county borough and situate in a county to which a joint county scheme for such county borough and county relates,</P>
    <P>the powers and duties of the council of such county as sanitary authority for such district shall, save as is otherwise provided by this Act, be exercised and performed through and by a board to be established in such county health district and to be called the board of public health.</P>
    <P>(2)  In every county health district in a county to which a county scheme for the time being relates other than those referred to in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of this section, the powers and duties of the council of such county as sanitary authority for such district shall, save as is otherwise provided by this Act, be exercised and performed through and by the body to whom under such county scheme is entrusted the administration of the relief of the poor in such county health district, and such body shall be known as the board of health and public assistance for such county health district.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any property transferred to the council of a county by this Act may be transferred by such council by order under their seal to the board of public health or the board of health and public assistance of any county health district in such county, and every such order shall operate as an effective conveyance of such property according to the terms of such order, but such order shall not require to be stamped as a conveyance or transfer of property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is necessary for the reason that the term, &ldquo;Board of Health,&rdquo; includes two kinds of boards, in cases where there is a joint body between a county borough and a county.  In those particular cases, there is already a board of health in existence.  It is still called a board of public health.  At present that body deals with the distribution of outdoor relief.  Under this Bill we are adding new duties, and in the ordinary case, where you have amalgamation <Col N="819" /> schemes in operation in the county, and where a board of health already exists, it will be a board acting in a dual capacity.  It will deal not only with outdoor relief but with the ordinary duty of a board of guardians.  In addition, it will have to carry out the duties formerly carried out by the rural district councils.  It will have a dual function, and will accordingly be called a Board of Health and Public Assistance. This section is inserted in order to make that clear.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the Minister whether in the case of a county where an amalgamation scheme has been put into operation, and the county health board established, special committees will be set up to look after the affairs of district hospitals which have been set up.  In the town of Athlone there is a district hospital, but under the amalgamation schemes in operation in that county the county home is situate in the town of Mullingar. Some time ago the Minister refused the right of the people of South Westmeath to have a committee to look after the administration of the district hospital in Athlone.  At the time the request was made, the cost of the upkeep of that district hospital was borne entirely by the ratepayers of South Westmeath.  What I want to know is, whether the people in the areas where such district hospitals have been established will be given power to appoint committees of their own to look after these hospitals.  I do not ask that these committees should have full control over the hospitals, but that they should be appointed and be subject to the county board of health or to the Minister for Local Government.</P>

I am voicing their opinions when I ask that <Col N="820" /> they be given control over their district hospitals.  In order to expedite matters, I do not wish to press the point this evening.

      <P>I do not think there is very much difference between the committee and the county council.  It is a committee appointed by the county council, consisting of members of the county council, and it is absolutely under financial control by the county council.  It has got no financial responsibility of its own, and the county council has power to dismiss, by a two-thirds majority, any members of the board of health.

As a matter of fact, I think the Committee in this matter are getting into a complete fog.  I think some of the members are losing sight of the fact that the Bill places the administration of the county in the hands of the county council.  The county council delegates to the board of health.  The board of health and the county council abolish the duties of the rural district council, so that the whole county, as I understand it, is administered by the county council.  The county council is responsible for everything, including sanitary work.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite right, as far as he goes.  But it is not mandatory on the county councils to accede to the full amount of the demands which they receive.  If there are any works proposed to be done, which the county council thinks should not be done this year, they can cut out that item.  That has been the case with the boards of guardians.  Very often, in recent years, the estimates of the boards of guardians were cut down. The board of health will not have as <Col N="824" /> much power as the board of guardians had.  They will be a committee of the county council.  That committee sends in a recommendation to the county council for a certain sum of money for home help, to carry out certain sanitary works, and perhaps some new works.  The county council can go into the memorandum they receive from their committee and say which of these works are to be done.  Of home help assistance, the county council, of course, cannot be a judge.  But, in regard to sanitary works and any new works, the county council can exercise their veto, if they consider that the execution of these works would impose too great a strain on the public finances.  Those are the relations between the board of health and the county council, as I understand the Bill.</P>

Article 22, Sub-section (2) of the Schedule to the Application of Enactments Order, 1898, at present limits the borrowing powers of a county council to one-tenth of the rateable valuation of the county. Rural district councils also have borrowing powers which are limited by Section 238, Sub-section (2) of the Public Health Act, 1878.  This sub-section retains both these limiting powers.  The Application of Enactments limitation applies to the county council in the same way as it always did, and the limitation under the Public Health Act of 1878 applies to those cases where the county council acquires new powers under the present Bill.</P>

      <P>On Section 11 I might say that it was thought necessary to make the board of health a corporate body, otherwise it would lead to certain difficulties.  For instance, if it were not, it could not initiate prosecutions for public nuisances and other offences of that kind.  Such proceedings would have to be initiated by the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not require some justification as to why the board of health should be required to have this separate corporate power?  The fact that you are giving the board of health this power raises it, it seems to me, to equality of status&mdash;shall I say&mdash;with the county council.  It is no longer a committee of the county council when you have set it up as &ldquo;a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal, with power to acquire and hold land for the purpose of their powers and duties.&rdquo;  It seems to me that by giving this position to the board of health you are removing it at once from the category of being a committee of the county council.  You are depriving the county council of much of its authority, and, in fact, in so far as public health services are concerned, you are making the county council a small electoral college for the purpose of selecting a board of health. We have not generally consented to that principle being introduced into our legislation.  We did appoint the Dáil as an electoral college for the first election of half the members of the Seanad, but other than that we have not adopted that method, and I think it requires some justification.  The raising of the board of health into this position of semi-independence of the county council should be justified by argument, and not allow us to assume that it is right because the Minister says it is right.  A very good case may be made for it, but it has not yet been made, and I am not convinced as to the wisdom of removing that power to initiate prosecutions, to hold lands, etc., from the county council to the board <Col N="827" /> of health.  It seems to me that if the county council is to be the authority which is to appoint the board of health, and that the county council is the body that is elected and has to raise moneys, it should be the authority to hold the land, to initiate prosecutions, etc.  I would like to have some justification for this proposal before it is passed over, and I hope that the Minister will give it to us.</P>

      <P>There is nothing novel in this section at all.  At present the boards of health, under the amalgamation schemes, are corporate bodies in the same way.  I think when Deputies realise the importance of the board of health, what very wide functions it has to exercise, considering that it is over the whole public health administration of the county, controlling hispitals and sanatoria, dealing with home help and the administration of all the health services of the county, it would be a very futile proceeding to tie its hands in the matter of prosecution in cases of any infringement of health laws, or matters of that kind, or prevent it from acquiring, where necessary, land for the purpose of constructing hospitals and other institutions of that kind.  It would lead to considerable delay, and probably to inefficiency. I think that it is a very commendable thing to make it a corporate body.  So long as the county council has financial control over the proceedings of the board of health I do not think that there is any danger of allowing it to function as a county board.</P>

      <P>I would like a little more light on this.  Is it not the case that if the board of health is not a body corporate it cannot legally conclude binding contracts?  It is obviously ridiculous, if you are setting up a board of health, to say that it cannot make contracts, that every contract for the supply of milk, or anything for a hospital, must be entered into by the county council because the board of health has no legal existence. If that is the case I think it is probably the strongest argument in favour of the section.</P>

      <P>Under this section will the county board of health be entitled, if it decides to run a farm, to pay £3,000 or £4,000 for a farm, without first going to the county council?  The powers and duties referred to in the section would, of course, include the setting up of a dairy if they thought fit, and they could take some of the ranches for that purpose.  That might deprive some uneconomic holder in the district of that land, and they get this land under this section without any authority from the county council.  The county council has to see that the rates are collected, but that is all the powers that they have.  I would like to know if a county board of health decides that in order to grow sufficient vegetables for the patients and inmates they require 20 or 30 acres of land that may be adjoining the county home, will they have power to buy that without authority from the county council?</P>

    <P>Motion by Deputy McKenna:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a Special Committee, consisting of nine Deputies, to be nominated by the Sessional Committee of Selection, be appointed to enquire into the system under which the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924, is being administered in the Saorstát; that the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and that the quorum of the Committee be five.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to call attention to a matter of vital importance to thousands of people in the Saorstát.  I desire to bring before the Dáil some of the gross irregularities in the system under which old age pensions are administered. There is a growing conviction amongst the people that a large number of people over 70 years of age are being unfairly treated, and deprived of the maximum amount of the pensions to which they are justly entitled. The administration of the Act by the Local Government Department, as a final court of appeal, is very unsatisfactory and it seems to me a great misfortune that so much power, practically the power of a court of law, is given to the Local Government Department or whatever that body is, in reference to the final decisions under the Act.  I am sure the Dáil would like to know who is the Local Government Department?  Is it the Minister?  Who is associated with the Minister, or is the work of the Department in this particular question left to a junior clerk or office boy in the office of the Department?  Surely it is not <Col N="830" /> the intention of the Act that simply because a person's name cannot be found on the register, through no fault of his own, or that of his parents&mdash;the census 70 years ago having been taken by the police officials&mdash; that he should be deprived of his pension. Yet we are daily receiving complaints from applicants that claims have been disallowed on the question of age.</P>
      <P>You have in the Local Pensions Committee something in the nature of a judicial tribunal.  You have a body of men selected locally much in the same fashion as you have a jury selected and having no interests in the Finance Department or Local Government Department on the one hand or in the applicants on the other.  It was thought, and I believe rightly thought, that the decisions of the sub-committees would be given full effect to, by the Local Government Department.  I am in a position to point out to the Dáil that such is not the case and that pensions have been cut in the recent revision in such a fashion that few Deputies outside the Ministry ever anticipated, would be so drastic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give credit where credit is due, but speaking for myself, and, I believe, for the majority of the members of the Party that I have the honour to sit amongst, I did not believe that when the Minister for Finance asked for powers from the Dáil to cut those pensions, he would ever have obtained the necessary permission if Deputies understood the arbitrary and absolute powers vested in the hands of the Local Government Department.  Everybody believed, as I said before, that great discretion would be given to the Local Pensions Committee. What do we find now?  Letters are daily pouring in upon us telling us that pensioners who were in receipt of an allowance of 10/- per week have been cut to 6/-, and pensioners in receipt of 8/- have been cut to 4/-, and in some cases the pensions have been disallowed altogether.  The result is, that the people have no confidence in the action or discrimination of the Local Government Department or in the judicial <Col N="831" /> character of its decisions.  Many people believe&mdash;and I would like to have this matter cleared up&mdash;that there is some underground communications between the Local Government Department and that of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the revision which has been made is a very unfair one, and one that is not in keeping with the Old Age Pensions Act.  I want a clear answer from the Minister for Local Government or from the Minister for Finance as to what instructions were given to the pension officers in the various districts on this matter.  I would like to know whether any instructions of a special or confidential character have been issued to pension officers of setting themselves to the task of, so to speak, hunting down old age pensioners with the object of having their pensions disallowed.  I am also especially anxious to get from the Minister for Local Government the instructions which were issued to the pension officers as to estimating the cost of maintenance of these poor people who are living with their married sons and daughters.  I have an idea that they adopt a rough-and-ready method of assessment of the profits derived from small agricultural holdings.  If that is so, it is an extraordinary thing&mdash;that this Act, passed for the benefit of the aged poor, should be administered by the pension officer with a rough-and-ready method of assessment.  I would like to know where are the instructions or who is in power?  The committee have no power.  The pension officer recommends and in nine cases out of ten his decision is upheld.  This question of maintenance is one that requires to be dealt with.  In many cases the father or mother hands over the little farm to the son or daughter, but the pension officer suggests that the transfer is bogus and that it is made over for the purpose of qualifying for the pension and the applicant is disqualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Dáil that, after the Old Age Pensions Act passed in an alien assembly, the then Chief Secretary, Mr. Birrell, admitted <Col N="832" /> in the British Parliament, on this very question, that this was a well-established custom in Ireland, and that it was not a question of fraud&mdash;he was referring to the transfers to obtain pensions. Here, however, under a home Government, we are confronted with cases like those, where pensions have been disallowed owing to the transfer of lands. I should like to say a word in reference to one class of case which is very prevalent, and which causes a great deal of dissatisfaction, and that is where an applicant has his case considered by a pension committee, who come to the conclusion that his means are such that he is entitled to the maximum pension, but the pension officer arrives at a different conclusion.  The officer holds that the applicant is entitled to a modified pension.  You have, over and over again, cases of that kind, where the local committee recommends a pension of nine or ten shillings, but the pension officer recommends one of four or five shillings.  There is then an appeal which comes before the local government department, and in nine out of ten cases the decision of the pension officer is upheld.  I am not so sure but that the cuts are illegal, and I believe that if a good many cases were taken into a court of law, it would be found that the Minister has no legal power to uphold the decision of these officials.</P>
    <P>In 1910 there was a famous case tried in the King's Bench before four very eminent judges&mdash;the late Lord Chief Baron, Lord Justice Cherry, Lord Justice Holmes, and the then Lord Chancellor.  That case has a great bearing on present administration, although we are living in a new regime. I would like to point out that that, in my opinion, has a bearing on some cases in which cuts have taken place.  I will read the decision of Lord Justice Cherry:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this case I think that the findings of the Committee upon the facts before it cannot at any time be set aside by any court or ignored by any Government official.  The pension must be paid at the rate awarded until the determination of a question, properly raised under Section 7, which either alters the rate <Col N="833" /> of the pension or may put an end altogether to the right to receive it. In the present case the question was raised, not by the pension officer, but by the pensioner.  It related only to an increase in the amount of the pension, and the claim for an increase was based, not upon any alteration in the pensioner's means, or even upon any fresh evidence as to the amount of his means at the time the pension was granted, but upon an allegation that the Pension Committee had erred in calculating the yearly value of those means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His colleague, Lord Justice Holmes, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I notice that the Lord Chief Baron, in coming to the same conclusion, seems to have been of opinion that there can be no reconsideration of an order granting or refusing a pension unless it can be shown that there has been a change of circumstances after the order has been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he has consulted the law officers, before making these drastic cuts.  In my opinion there is a lot of common sense in the judgement I have read to the effect that if the decision of the local committee is given the case cannot be reconsidered unless there has been a change of circumstances after the order has been made.  How are we to know whether there has been a change of circumstances in a lot of these cases?  By what regulation, or by what method, does the pension officer decide the value of the pension, and where there is a small holding of land, how does he arrive at the applicant's income?  As regards the question of age, a great deal of trouble arises owing to the fact that we have not a proper census.  In those days, when the census was taken, it was taken by police officials going round the country.  In England they are a lot fairer than we are here.  I was over there recently, and I made inquiries regarding the administration of the Act.  I find that the English Local Government Department have accepted as evidence of age a family Bible, for instance, in which different dates of birth were registered.  They have also <Col N="834" /> accepted photographs, including photographs of tombstones, and they accept a number of things which we would not accept here.  I am told by people that the Department now will hardly accept an affidavit, and they look upon decent men almost as perjurers if they sign to the effect that they believe so-and-so to be such an age.  In a bad year like this, when people never wanted the pension as badly as they do now, I think that is very unfair.</P>
    <P>The majority of the Deputies associated with me on these benches voted for the cut in the belief that there were going to be a number of cuts in the various departments of State which could be better afforded than the cut in old age pensions.  Now we feel sore that there is no attempt to effect cuts in any department of State which could afford them better than these poor people.  I maintain that there is a case for a full inquiry and that the maladministration of the Act and the way in which it has been worked justify an inquiry.  Until such inquiry is held and reports its conclusion to the Dáil, I am satisfied that the people will have no confidence in the honesty and straightforwardness of the Local Government Department.  I move the motion standing in my name, and I hope that the Government will agree to have a committee of inquiry set up.</P>

      <P>I am glad to welcome Deputy McKenna into the ranks of the converted.  It took a good deal of teaching and preaching from these benches to get people to see the right with regard to administering old age pensions in a proper way, and keeping them up to a proper standard.  The Deputy has analysed the position closely and he has put it very fairly to the Minister.  I will endeavour to give some concrete cases as proof that what has been said by Deputy McKenna was quite correct.  The first case I have to submit is one where an application was made for an old-age pension.  The applicant when applying for the pension was able to produce all the necessary evidence, and yet for fifteen months her case was not considered by, or submitted for consideration to, the <Col N="835" /> proper authorities.  She made repeated applications, and she got people of some prominence in the district to make the necessary representations, and yet no notice was taken.  She then wrote to me as a last resource, and I raised the matter on the Old Age Pension Estimate.  The President was good enough to say he would have the matter investigated, and within a fortnight of the sending of a personal letter to the President the pension was paid in accordance with the justice of the case. I should like to know if the Old Age Pension Act is administered in a proper fashion why it is necessary that that old lady in a backward part of the country, and having little means of communication with the people who could bring her case to light in a proper manner, found it necessary to write to me, and that I should write to the President, and that she should wait fifteen months for the pension.</P>
      <P>Take another case: the wife of a working man made application for a pension.  It was granted by the committee. The case was appealed on the grounds that this man was getting more than would legally entitle his wife to the pension.  The following is an extract from a letter written to me by the Local Government Department:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Pension officer appealed on the ground of blindness, and also on the ground that Mrs ...........'s means exceeded £49 17s. 6d. a year. In his report the Pension officer stated the woman's husband, when working, earns £2 10s. 0d. to £3 a week, and when out of work received £1 a week unemployment benefit, and he estimated the man's total annual means at £100.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts?  The man stated to the pensions officer that he got £2 10s. a week when he worked, that he worked thirteen weeks in that year, and that his unemployment benefit was in direct ratio to the number of weeks he worked.  Yet this woman's application was turned down, and she did not get the pension until it had been taken up by a Deputy, representation made to the proper quarter, and a question put in the Dáil about it.  Why is it <Col N="836" /> necessary that this should be done, and that Deputies should be asked to make these representations when the case was clear?</P>
    <P>Here is another blind pension case: An application was made for the pension on the 26th April, 1923; it was granted by the Pensions Committee on the 19th June, 1923; it was appealed against by the pension officer, and an intimation was sent that a medical inspector would be sent to examine her. The medical examination takes place on the 10th July, 1924, and the pension is granted as from the 1st April, 1924. I want to know on what grounds the Department decided that the applicant was not blind from the 26th April, 1923, to the 1st April, 1924, seeing that the medical officer did not see the claimant until the 10th July, 1924?  If that is the administration of the Old Age Pension Act, well then, it is not what we expected the administration of it would be.</P>
    <P>Here is another case: Deputy McKenna spoke of affidavits not being accepted.  In this case the eldest sister of an applicant for the pension is 72 years of age.  He is the next, and his age cannot be got, but certificates of his sister's age are produced showing that she is 72.  Affidavits are sent up by six old residents in the district stating that he is next to his sister, aged 72, whose certificate could be found, and yet for the last four months this applicant has not got any account of whether the pension can be got or not. These are concrete cases, and better than any amount of talk against the administration of the Pensions Act, but they are only examples taken by chance.  There are scores of others, and if they show in any way maladministration, or want of fairness and justice in administration of the Pensions Act to the claimants, I think they will do good and necessary work.  Deputy McKenna has, I think, raised a very important point, and I believe that the whole administration of the Pensions Act requires looking into.</P>

      <P>In supporting the amendment put forward by Deputy McKenna, I wish to draw attention to a return recently issued by <Col N="837" /> the Department, which shows with what vigour the pension officers and the Department are applying the cut. In introducing the Bill, the Minister for Finance announced that he was aiming at a reduction in the cost of £300,000 a year.  During the passage of the Act he made some small concessions to the very aged and others that he anticipated would reduce the saving temporarily by £80,000 a year.  The return shows that the saving effected works out at probably £428,000 a year.  That is an extraordinary miscalculation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BYRNE Mr. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask how the extraordinary difference in the figures arises&mdash;the difference in the figures in the Minister's speech when the Bill was passing through the Dáil, as compared with the actual facts.  The pension was reduced by only 1/- a week, and I would like to know would the Minister produce a return to the Dáil showing how many pensions have been issued at 9/- a week.  I want the Dáil to know that old age pension officers, in considering the maintenance, have assessed a bed and taken it as income, putting a value of 3/- on it, though the bed was provided by some distant relative or some friend.  That assessment on the bed is put on for the purpose of reducing the amount awarded by way of maintenance.  That was not the intention of the Old Age Pensions Act. It certainly was not the intention that a bed provided by a friend or relative, and put in a small closet room, should count as income.  I have carefully read the maintenance clauses, and I fail to find that a bed should be valued as <Col N="838" /> equivalent to 3/- income.  If the Minister produced a list of pensions issued since the Act passed, it would show that not ten per cent. had been awarded 9/-.  His officers have done what was never done in the days of the British Government by putting an assessment on beds.</P>
      <P>Another point arises in connection with voluntary gifts.  I know that claimants, when they stated that they had no income, were asked: &ldquo;You are sure you have no income?&rdquo;  They replied: &ldquo;None, whatever.&rdquo;  Then they were asked: &ldquo;Who pays your rent?&rdquo;  and the reply was: &ldquo;My niece does.&rdquo;  The rent of three shillings for the room, which is given voluntarily by the niece or some distant relative, is calculated as income under the Act. I do not think it was ever intended, even by those who supported the Minister in the cut, that the 2/6 or the 3/- rent paid by the distant relative should be taken into consideration when assessing the value of the claimant's income.</P>
      <P>Deputy McKenna and other Deputies have gone very carefully into the difficulties that poor persons find in getting the pension.  As far as I can see the economy axe that has been used by the Finance Ministry, in so far as it applies to pensioners, has been used well.  Those using it do not care where it falls so long as they get blood, because it is really blood when you take from those poor people the 1/- or the 3/- that you have been deducting for the past few months.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of not permitting voluntary gifts, or rents paid by distant relatives, friends or charitable institutions, to be taken into consideration by way of income.  The British Government in their worst day never did that and this Government ought not to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion.  In doing so let me say that I am glad a number of Deputies have found out they were hoodwinked by the Minister when he brought in this Act.  Perhaps in the future they will be more careful to read some of the Bills that are brought forward and not allow themselves <Col N="839" /> to follow the Minister so blindly as a number of them has already done. One reason why I would like to see this committee set up is because it seems absolutely impossible for a person who makes a claim for a pension to get that pension unless he or she is able to produce a birth certificate. Despite what the Minister says when he indicates that affidavits will be accepted, we know that affidavits are not accepted, and time out of number they have been refused.  As a matter of fact the position in the country as regards most of the old people who make claims for pensions, is, that when they find the pension officer has appealed against the decision of the Pensions Committee, granting them a pension, they do not go any further; they know it is useless and it would be only a loss of time.  That is exactly the position.</P>
      <P>With regard to applicants for blind pensions, as far as I know from the cases which have been brought to my notice, it is impossible for applicants to succeed in securing a pension unless they are stone blind.  It would not be considered sufficient if they could be proved blind to such an extent that they are not able to carry on their ordinary work.  When a case is appealed in that connection, and the matter is taken up with the Pensions Section of the Local Government Department, we are told that the medical inspector will call.  I have a case in mind about which I wrote over twelve months ago to the Pensions Department. I was informed that as soon as an inspector would be in the district he would call to examine the person. The matter went on for three or four months.  I wrote again and was told that the medical inspector had not been able to get there, but as soon as he did he would call and make an examination. The case has been going on for almost seventeen or eighteen months, and as far as I know the inspector has not yet called.  I raised that particular case here and the Minister promised to have it seen to, but he has not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was actually misleading members of the Dáil and the people of the country <Col N="840" /> when the Bill was introduced, because he said he was going to reduce pensions by one shilling.  We know that what has actually happened is, that a number of people who were in receipt of a pension have had it taken away altogether.  In a number of cases the pension has been reduced from 10/- to 7/- and 6/-, and in other cases actually to 4/-.  Not alone have pensions been reduced, but it has been made almost impossible for people claiming pensions now to get any pensions at all because of the way administrative machinery has been tightened up.  Of course there is a great amount of suspicion in the minds of Ministers and officials regarding the granting of pensions by local committees.  I am sure some of the Ministers and some of the officials, if they bring their minds back to the state of affairs that obtained three or five years ago, might be under the impression that what then applied on those committees applies to-day. It was then the custom&mdash;and I am sure Ministers and officials winked their eyes at it&mdash;to give pensions to everybody, because the British Government was paying.  That, however, does not obtain to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not say that there should not be some supervision by the pension officers.  I do not say that there is not some abuse.  I daresay that there is some abuse, because it would not be possible to administer the Act without some abuse; but holding up pensions for 17 or 18 months is not the right way to administer the Act.  The fact is that the poor people in the country are beginning to tick off on their fingers the number of Acts passed by a majority in the Dáil, hitting directly at the poor. I am going to say very plainly and straightly, because I feel it, that the poor people have gained nothing by the advent of the Free State; they have lost.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy McKenna, in moving this motion, dealt with it rather mildly.  I would be inclined to go further than he has gone in regard to the so-called administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  I think that Act is an absolute disgrace to the Government, and the <Col N="841" /> manner in which it is administered is also a disgrace to the Government. Deputy Byrne referred to cases where pensions were reduced on the strength of certain perquisites that people had and he referred particularly to hard cases where people were deprived of pensions because of the little gifts they had from relative.  I can remember a case where the old age pension was reduced because the crippled daughter who lived with the pensioner was in receipt of a couple of shillings per week.  That is one of the many cases.  Furthermore, there is another aspect of the case&mdash;a point that has not been touched on&mdash;in connection with the administration of the Act and the question of impartiality.  I have knowledge of a case in which the administration has not been impartial.  I have a case, vouched for by a Deputy, where a man and his wife, who have a large farm, are enjoying the old age pension because their son is a pensions officer.</P>
      <P>I say, furthermore, that it has been remarked by a good many people that a great deal of the troubles that have lately fallen on the Government have fallen on them because of this Old Age Pensions Act.  I think the sooner they consider the question of the setting up of this Committee, and even consider the scrapping of the Act altogether, the better for themselves and for the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Minister pointed out that he did not quote the sum of £300,000 as the amount to be saved.  He says he quoted £500,000 as the sum that he expected.  I think if he enquires he will find that £300,000 was the sum he intimated as the amount to be saved in the first instance, and ultimately he mentioned £500,000.

      <P>If the Deputy would pardon me, at the moment I think I could make that clear.  It is obvious, if you look at the figures, that the 1/- cut itself would give £300,000.  Roughly, the amount spent on pensions was £3,000,000.  Ten per cent. of that amount would give £300,000.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That just leads up to the point I was about to make.  The Minister will admit, because he was present here at the time while the other Deputies were not, that we insisted from these benches that the evil of the proposal was not solely in the 1/- cut, but that it was wrapped up in the proposals for revaluation of perquisites and such like, and we insisted upon that as definitely and as persistently as it was possible to do.  Yet the Deputies allowed that to pass.  The Farmers' benches, unfortunately, saved the Bill.  They could have defeated the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a £300,000 saving in respect of the 1/- cut, and you have at least £128,000, and possibly £200,000 of a saving in respect of the revaluation of perquisites.  That means to say in many cases&mdash;and I want to give one instance where people have been depending upon a few shillings pension&mdash;that the pension has been reduced by 100 per cent.&mdash;wiped out altogether.  In some cases it has been reduced by 50 per cent., in others by 40 per cent., and in others by 30 per cent.  The case I want to quote is where it has applied in respect to blind persons in an institution.  In this particular case I hoped to have the exact figures, but the main facts are: Seventy or eighty persons living in an institution for the blind have been in receipt <Col N="843" /> of a pension.  Owing presumably to the increased cost of foodstuffs, the valuation of their perquisites, and the amount they received for their food, clothing and lodging, what is received by the institution and by themselves has been revalued and, as a consequence, their pension is cut down to 1/-.  Either the persons themselves or the institution suffers.  The institution suffers, because it got the benefit of the pension, and the institution has now to apply either to the charitable public or else drive these people out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the way the Act has been administered during the past twelve months or eighteen months or two years has been so rigorous as to create a belief in the minds of many thousands of people that the purpose of the Ministry responsible is to drive the people on to poor law, or to drive them to beg in the streets&mdash;to do anything but to fulfil the intentions of the Act.  I think that the evils accompanying this administrative action are not so much in the cut of 1s., bad as that may be, but in the way it is administered.  I asked the Minister on previous occasions to tabulate, and put on the Table, the orders that have been issued from the Department to the officials, so that we could understand what was the tone of the Ministry in respect to these pensions, what was the spirit in which they were administering the Act, and what kind of instructions they were giving to their officers.  I hope the Dáil will agree to the motion of the Deputy, and I hope it will be interpreted, if it is passed, as authorising a complete enquiry into the method of administration of the Act.  I think the Minister will have to plead very hard, and very eloquently, before he can convince us that the administration of the Act is being carried out in the spirit that was implied in the original Act&mdash;the original Act, not the last Act.  The spirit of that Act was to ensure that people who had reached the age of seventy years would be reckoned to have done fair service to the community, and that they should not in their old age be bound to a life of utter dependence upon <Col N="844" /> charitable neighbours, or to seek the aid of the poor law.  I think we have got to remember that this is a Pensions Act, and it should be considered as such. I do not believe that its administration at the present time is being carried out in the spirit of the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>

I do not object to Deputy Johnson flinging around a little mud so that some of it may stick.  That is tactics.  For that reason I do not blame him for using tactics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson practically represents us as being the creators of this cut, that it could not operate without our assistance, and that we could prevent it if we wished. Deputy Johnson knows as well as I do, and as well as every other Deputy here does, that whatever action we took, and if we voted 100 per cent. against that Act, we could not have prevented its enforcement.</P>

      <P>We voted for it.  If we voted against it, 100 per cent. of our Party, we could not have altered the position, and Deputy Johnson knows it.  He says that if we went to the country or did something very active that we could have raised the country. I make him a present of the whole joke. Now, in regard to the principle of the Bill and our action on it, I ask the Dáil to remember that the Deputies on these Benches, and I, are absolutely unrepentant with regard to what we did.  When it comes to be administered and that is what this motion is dealing with&mdash;administration&mdash;our attitude is altogether different.  We quarrel with the method of finding out ages and the trouble that is taken to prove men's ages and the lack of will on the part of pension officers to accept plain evidence. <Col N="845" /> Particularly do I object to the method of putting down the gift of some friends to help any particular individual. I am speaking for myself in this matter.  I think it is absolutely abhorrent if I choose to be kind to an individual that the Government should take advantage of it.  If I choose to give a room in my house to some person that is put down as an asset belonging to the nation.  The Government claims it.  If the Minister is charitable &mdash;maybe he has some little money to give away&mdash;and if he chooses to exercise his charitable instincts, it goes for nought.  His kindness is subtracted from the income of the unfortunate individual.  That was never contemplated by any Deputy in this House, and I am sure it was not contemplated by the Minister himself.  I am sure he does not stand over this policy. If he does, it is something that we do not expect, and I think it will reduce the Minister in the eyes of all of us to a level that we did not expect he would descend to.  The case that was instanced by Deputy Byrne certainly indicates a line that was never contemplated by any of us on these Benches, and I venture to suggest that it was never contemplated by any Deputy in the House.</P>

People with an income of their own, independent of the pension, ought to have that taken into consideration.  People who get a present from some friend, altogether outside of income, altogether outside anything but the kindness of a relative or friend, ought not to have that taken into consideration.  We are unrepentant with regard to anything we have done.  What we intended to do we did, and anything that has taken place without our knowledge and that we did not intend is what we quarrel with.  We are absolutely unrepentant and we offer no apology for our action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is admitted now that when the Bill was going through the Dáil we understood that there would be at least a 10 per cent. cut in all the old age pensions.  That cut was agreed to.  I am very pleased now to see that those Deputies who agreed to it have seen the true light&mdash;that it meant a great deal more than a cut of 10 per cent.&mdash;and that they find out now really what was at the back of the mind of the Minister.  There have been several cases of real hardship concerning the old and infirm and especially the blind. I know some cases where blind people up to 60 or 65 years of age were in receipt of pensions of ten shillings per week.  They were first cut by a shilling a week and without any notification or without making any enquiries as to their financial position, there was another cut, making it four shillings. In other cases, on the question of age, I have myself, time after time, written to the Department concerning applicants for the old age pension.  It was proved by documentary evidence that the applicants were over 70 years of age but they could not supply birth certificates and they were refused the pension.  Two persons older than themselves had sworn affidavits, but these were not accepted.  It seems that the memory of the persons concerned must go back to some historical event before their evidence can be taken.  I think the Minister should accept this motion.  I am quite aware it is not the fault of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully understood at the time that the Minister had simply to put forward the Bill as he was directed by the Government.  We were out for economy.  The only people we could economise on were the old people who could not put up a fight.  We did not cut the incomes of people at the head <Col N="847" /> of the State, because they probably could put up a fight.  I do not want to see any salaries reduced.  I certainly do not want to see old people turned into paupers as they are being at the present moment.  It is a great hardship on old people of seventy or seventy-one years of age when they make applications for their pension to be refused on the ground that they could not prove their ages by the production of birth certificates.  I have known cases where they have produced the marriage certificates of their parents and these would not be taken in evidence.  The mover of the motion says that they take photographs of tombstones in England as a guarantee of age, but in Ireland we will not accept the marriage certificate of the parents of the applicant.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious thing to be considered in connection with this matter.  It affects the worker.  A worker may be sixty-five or sixty-six years of age, while his wife may be over seventy.  He had been working when the wages were high or what were called high.  His wage may have been £2 or £2 5s. a week, or 35s. a week, eighteen months or two years ago.  His wife was in receipt of a pension of 6/- or 8/- and on going to the firm where the man was employed, the pension officer of the district reduces the pension without making any enquiries as to whether the husband was in receipt of the same wages now as eighteen months ago.  They will not take a letter from that employer.  I have personally submitted a letter from an employer, on behalf of an applicant whose wages were calculated on a period of six months, and it would not be accepted because they were not based on a twelve-months' period.  That applicant cannot appeal for six months.  By agreeing to this motion you will leave the old age pensioners in a position to make an appeal, and all papers and records that have been submitted to the local committee can be submitted to this Committee. I think the Minister fully realises, and the Local Government Department fully realises, that even at the time this reduction in the old age <Col N="848" /> pensions took place the cost of living was not so high as it is now.  The cost of living has gone up especially in the case of these old people who cannot afford to buy the expensive stuff that has fallen in price.  They can only buy plain food which has gone up in price.</P>
    <P>Taking these things into account, I think the least the Minister can do is to agree to the motion, especially as he is after saving a great many thousands more than he anticipated.  He anticipated saving £300,000, but I think, if the truth were known, it must be over £800,000.  A number of people are in receipt of one shilling weekly.  Fancy walking three miles for one shilling! I wonder if Government Departments have any hearts at all.  I do not suppose they have.  If they have, I think they must be as hard as flint.  I think the Dáil has an opportunity now of expressing an opinion, and I hope that Deputies will vote for the motion.  If the Minister does not agree with the terms of the motion to set up a committee, he will make old people who have given seventy years of their lives to the State suffer.  They will realise that they have a Government of their own established and that the first action of that Government was to penalise, persecute, and I might say, torture them.  It comes to that.  I hope Deputies will support the motion, and not be saying in three months' time that if they had known the contrary would be the effect, they would not have voted for a reduction in pensions. There is an opportunity now of undoing some of the things that were done.  Every Deputy who voted for a reduction of the old age pensions has now an opportunity of repenting for the sin he committed against these old people in voting for the Bill.</P>
    <P>As to certificates of age, surely it is sufficient if old people, eighty years of age, express their opinion.  People of that age are not going to swear a false oath, and one would expect that an affidavit from them would be accepted stating that they remembered when an applicant was five years of age and that it was over 65 years ago.  We find that such evidence is not accepted.  It is necessary to recall the killing of some <Col N="849" /> one, the building of a school, or the making of a railway, or some event that is mentioned in history.  I am very pleased that Deputy McKenna has brought forward this motion.  I hope the Minister for Finance will accept it, and that he will advise the Minister for Local Government to agree with him.  In doing so, they will only be undoing some of the things that were done against the old age pensioners. The bit that was going into their mouths was taken from them, but if this motion is agreed to it will be an encouragement to them to live longer, and enable them to get some more nourishment.  The nine shillings weekly would be given in cases where there is no other income.</P>
    <P>I know hundreds of cases where the people are party depending upon home help.  Complaint is made that the expenditure on home help has increased.  Why would it not increase? The people who receive it have nothing else to live on.  Unless some member of the county board of health or of a public body recommends them for grants of three or four shillings weekly, they have nothing to keep them.  There is also the case of a man who is married, with a family of his own, whose mother resides with him.  His earnings for his wife and family are taken into account, and his mother is debarred from getting the pension on that account.  Surely that is not justice.  I ask every Deputy to vote so as to try and get the Minister for Local Government, and the Minister for Finance to accede to this motion, with a view to helping the old age pensioners, upon whom the cut was such a hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been dealt with, I think in three aspects.  There has been a discussion of the Act of 1924.  I am not going to deal with the question of that Act.  That was a necessity. It was a thing that was forced on us by circumstances altogether outside our control.  The financial circumstances have not so changed that the Act could be repealed.  We are still in the condition where our income from taxation does not equal ordinary outgoings, <Col N="850" /> leaving out of account altogether compensation charges, and leaving out of account also any army charges in excess of £2,000,000.  I would not like, when we come to the next Budget, to be in the position of having to propose an increase in taxation. I regretted that the Bill had to be brought in, and I also regret that it could not, at this stage, at any rate, be repealed or altered.</P>
      <P>There has been talk about the system of administration.  The system of administration is exactly the same as has prevailed since the Old Age Pensions Act came into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the operations of the officers of Customs and Excise who act as pension officers, we have the pensions committee and the sub-committees which consider cases; we have the Ministry of Local Government, which acts as the appeal tribunal; we have the Post Office, which acts as the paying agent, and we have the Ministry of Finance, which deals with the general policy of legislation.  That is the system which has been in operation since the old age pensions were introduced.  If there were any desire to reconsider the system, I would not be averse to the appointment of a commission consisting of members of the Dáil and of qualified outsiders to consider whether another system of administration might not profitably be substituted for the system we have at present.  It has been suggested by some people that the old age pensioners should be given the opportunity of going before a District Justice, and that their cases should be determined judicially by him.  There are very strong arguments against that, even from the point of view of the old age pensioners.  If it was considered wise, a commission could be set up to consider a scheme of administration. It has also been suggested that counties, out of the rates, should pay some proportion of the total charge of the pensions for the county, and that the Old Age Pension Committees should, with that check upon them, be given a much freer hand than they are given at the present time.  There are objections to that.  But if it is really desired to review the system of administration of old age pensions, it could be considered <Col N="851" /> by a body set up to do that. I think, if we are going to have a general review of the system, it would better be done by a body consisting of members of the Dáil and of qualified outsiders, rather than by a Committee of the Dáil alone.  If there was a feeling for that, I would not, as I have said, be averse to the setting up of such a Commission.</P>
    <P>So much for the system.  The real talk here has not been about the system at all.  Except to a small extent, it has been about the administration.  It is really premature to deal at present with the administration, but I will reply to one or two points that Deputy McKenna put.  He asked whether there has been any special and confidential instructions sent to pension officers to hunt down, as he said, old age pensioners. Of course there were not. You could not send such instructions out.  If any such instructions were sent out, you may be sure that they would not remain &ldquo;special and confidential.&rdquo; Under the operative section in the Act, the instruction sent out to old age pension officers was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every pension officer is to recalculate immediately the means of all pensioners in his station.  Subject to review, the fixing of the new rate of pension is to be based on the particulars given on Form O.A.P. No. 58, except where the officer has reason to believe that the record thereon does not correctly represent the pensioner's true means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Form O.A.P. No. 58 is a special form, which was filled when the pensioner was originally given the pension. I should say that in, perhaps, 80 per cent. of the cases&mdash;certainly in the vast majority of the cases&mdash;the pension officers simply took the means they had already set down in the forms on record in their offices, and calculated the new rate of pension in accordance with the Acts.  They had nothing to do except a quite mechanical operation.  They had not even the time to go into a reconsideration of the means, on the spot, of the 120,000 pensioners, and it was not necessary in the big majority of cases to do so.  The information which was already in the office was taken and, <Col N="852" /> by arithmetical calculation, the new rate of pension was determined.  In every case, of course, where the officer had some reason to believe that the form was inaccurate he did make an investigation on the spot.</P>

If there was only a question of a bed, it would not come into the account, because unless the person had at least 7/- of other means it would not be counted at all.

      <P>I have already referred to the question of the &ldquo;absolute and arbitrary authority,&rdquo; as someone called it, exercised by the Local Government Department.  If a better tribunal can be suggested, on consideration by a suitable authority, I have no objection at all to the whole matter being gone into.  Deputy Hogan referred <Col N="853" /> to concrete cases.  It is easy to bring up concrete cases when nobody else has any of the facts about them, and I could not argue with the Deputy in regard to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the facts and it is easy for the Deputy, who has them, to talk about these cases.  I would remind the Deputy that some 20,000 pensions are granted per annum.  No matter what system you have, you are bound to have refusals and you are bound to have people annoyed at refusals&mdash;even at refusals which could be argued with a good deal of plausibility and reason.  There are now 119,031 old age pensioners.  Of these 92,158 have the maximum pension; that is 9/-; 26,873 have less than the maximum: that is less than 9/-.  Previously something like 10,000 had less than the old maximum of 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an increase in the number of pensioners below the maximum, of 16,000.  There is no use in talking about the behaviour of the Local Government Department in regard to these review cases.  So far, the Local Government Department has actually received only about 2,400 appeals. It expects to receive perhaps about 4,000, but, so far, of these 16,000 only 2,400 have actually had appeals forwarded to the Local Government Department.  Several hundred of these came in this week.  So far, the Local Government Department has only dealt with 800 of these appeals, so that, nobody can say what way the Act has been administered so far as the question of deciding appeals by the Local Government Department is concerned.  Deputy McKenna's statement <Col N="854" /> in that respect is altogether premature. With regard to tightness of administration, I said when the Bill was passing that I favoured rather a definite reduction in the scale than trying to save a few pounds on the Vote by means of strictness in administration. In pursuance of the sort of undertaking I then gave the Dáil, about three weeks ago I had a conference with the Minister for Local Government and the responsible officials in his Department.</P>
    <P>We then decided that while, of course, the law is binding on Ministers and officials just as on pensioners, so far as the law allowed and so far as discretion could be exercised within the law, it should be exercised to the benefit of the pensioners.  We agreed that as such a large sum was being taken out of the Vote, that even if less rigid administration meant the loss of £20,000 or £50,000 per year, that loss could be afforded.  We agreed that, in dealing with the question of review of means, wherever there was a doubt the pensioner should get the benefit of that doubt.  Further, in dealing with the question of proof of age, we decided that we could afford now to give the pensioner the benefit of the doubt even if it meant that an occasional person under 70 years of age would get the pension.  We agreed in the case of persons who had no means, or who had very little means and who would be entitled to the maximum pension&mdash;persons who were certainly very nearly 70 and might, so far as one could judge, be over 70&mdash; that they should get the benefit of the doubt even if there was no documentary evidence.</P>
    <P>When Deputies say that, following this Act, there has been a tightening of administration they are taking a view that is altogether contrary to the fact.  We have concluded that, because so much has been taken out of this Vote, we can afford to relax the rigidity of administration so far as it can be done without setting the Minister or officials above the law.  After all, if a thing is not within the four corners of an Act, no discretion can be allowed a Minister or an official to override the law.  So far <Col N="855" /> as it can be done, we are endeavouring to alleviate the hardship this Act may cause to the poorer class of pensioners and the hardship that may be caused by the general difficulty of getting proof of age.  I think I have said on that point all that is necessary at the moment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future system of administration, if there is a desire to review that system, I am prepared to have a Commission set up to go into the whole question of an improved system for the administration of the Pensions Act.  In regard to the actual administration, I say that no case can yet be made, even if it should be possible later on to do so.  We are still only at the end of the first stage.  The &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; have been carried out by pensions' officers in accordance with the Act.  The appeals have not yet, to any appreciable extent, been heard, and I think that nobody could form any opinion on the matter until the bulk of the appeals, at any rate, have been heard.  If any person has not appealed within the usual time, that can be dealt with by means of a question in the ordinary way and the hearing will be expedited.</P>

The words of the 1911 Act are&mdash;&ldquo;the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed.&rdquo;  That has always, since the Act came into operation, been taken into account.  We have not altered that.  The Deputy may contend that it should be altered, but it cannot be altered without amendment of the law.  I certainly think that though there might be a case in respect of gifts from an outsider, that it ought to be counted the duty of a son or daughter, who are in a position to do so, to contribute to the support of their parents. In any case, we have not altered the law or the facts in regard to that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to raise the matter that at a meeting apparently a few days ago at which the President, some of the Army Chiefs, and some of the Chiefs of the Gárda Síochána were present, the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, referring to the army matters of March last or subsequent to March last, made the statement that we were now in the happy and proud position of being able to say that no officer and no soldier of the Army who had stood loyally to the State, was let down.  It has been represented to me that the terms of my <Col N="858" /> motion this evening are too confined to enable some Deputies to say some things they would like to say on some of the statements made in Athlone.  I regret that any Deputy who wanted to put down a wider motion did not do so, because I would be very glad to be relieved of the responsibility of drawing attention to it.  I hoped to draw attention to what is the particular point I had in mind.  That statement was made publicly and it was thought of sufficient importance to bring it out in leaded type in at least one daily paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy in this House will remember that as recently as Thursday last, nine Deputies left this Dáil and resigned their positions as Deputies, because, in their opinion, certain Army officers had been let down.  I personally have a very keen recollection that in March last three general officers who were responsible for making the Army, responsible for making it in pre-Truce days, were dismissed from their posts. I have left many things unsaid on that particular matter, but I am sure I have made it clear that in my opinion these three officers were let down, as the phrase goes.  It is a fact also that as a result of the happenings of March, many other officers have left the Army, left it in circumstances in which they were put into such positions, or were to be put into such positions, that they considered they were let down.  I do not think it could be said that any of these three classes were without men who had contributed to the setting up of this State, and yet we find ourselves in the position that the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána could state by implication that the whole three classes were people who were disloyal to the State.  I think we are entitled to know what is meant by the statement, and I think also that every Deputy will be anxious to know from what particular official quarter we are in danger of having from time to time officials butting in, into what are political matters, delicate or otherwise.  Every Deputy is entitled to know if in the Army or the Police Force or in any other department of the State, the chiefs may come together from time to time in synod, issue pastorals, serve out <i>obstats</i><Col N="859" /> and <i>nihil obstats</i> with regard to the political thoughts or deeds of other people.  Very many sacrifices, sacrifices over the whole gamut along which sacrifices, big or small, may be made, have been made in the cause of differentiating out here the different parts of our Government machinery, the different parts of the machinery of State, and differentiating for each of them their position, their powers, their responsibilities&mdash;the Executive Council, the Dáil, the Army, the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Many sacrifices are being made to-day in that cause and many sacrifices will be made to-morrow and I think it is of the utmost importance that that differentiation should not be obscured in any way either by the deeds of any persons or by any laxity on our part to draw attention to things to which attention should be drawn. It is to a large extent because of that but also because I think the persons who in any small way have served the State in circumstances of which the whole truth can never be known, should not be belied in the way in which this statement does belie very many persons, that I ask what is the meaning of this statement, and why is it made, and to how much more of this stuff are persons, from whom sacrifices are being expected to-day, expected to listen with their mouths shut?</P>

      <P>Before the President replies I want to say a word. I do not want to re-discuss the events of the last six months, but motions of this sort compel me to re-discuss them, at least to some extent.  Deputy Mulcahy mentioned that there were three classes who were apparently referred to&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it in another way.  Deputy Mulcahy pointed out that the three or four officers who were dismissed last March represented one class; that the Deputies who left the House some time ago represented another class; and the officers for whom they spoke represented a third class, and that there was another class of officers who had left the army for reasons <Col N="860" /> connected with the events over which these classes left the army.  I think he wanted to know whether this reference to disloyalty to the State referred to any of these classes of officers. I think that that is a fair statement of the position.  Now I am going to repeat&mdash;because I think that point of view should be kept in front, as well as any other points of view which any other Deputy may think it necessary to put forward&mdash;that the people who reorganised the I.R.B. in the army were striking a blow at the foundations of the State; that the people who reorganised the I.R.A. in the army were striking a blow at the foundations of the State, and that so far as the other class of officers, who are now resigned and at home at their work, are concerned, if they identify themselves with either of these two classes, they must take the same blame, and they must come into the same category.</P>
      <P>There is just one further point, and it is this.  We hear too much about the services that certain well-known officers and certain well-known people have given in the past.  We hear far too much about that, and it is not fair to the very large number of officers who are doing their work quietly in their shops, in business, at work, at home, who gave real service to the State without expecting anything in return, and who are quite content now to go home to do their business, having done their work for the State at the time of crisis. We hear far too much about records, and we hear far too much about records from people whose records are about the same as mine, from the point of view of soldiering.  There are about 100 people in this country with any records as soldiers, and about 70 per cent. of those people have left the Army, left the pre-Truce Army and the post-Truce National Army, when they had their work done.  They are at home now doing their business, supporting the State in another capacity, and these are the people to whom the real thanks of the State and of the people should go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make an appeal to the Dáil not to revive old <Col N="861" /> quarrels.  I was, somewhat against my will, put into a position of investigating these troubles that arose in the past. Is there anything in the world to be gained by reviving them now, as some of the remarks of the Minister for Agriculture are tending to revive them?  I agree with many of his remarks, but I would point out to him that if there is a man in the Dáil who has a right to plead for restraint in speech it is Deputy Mulcahy.  Under a very difficult and trying situation he has preserved a restraint which has won the respect, I think, of the whole country.  That being so, I think he is entitled to ask that officers of high rank in the Army and Police Forces should, where it is possible, not make public remarks which are likely to hurt the feelings of individuals who have, or have not, records, but, I think, are calculated to hurt the feelings of the very people to whom the Minister for Agriculture referred.  A great many officers, obscure officers, who in their time did good service, have gone back to civil life, and have gone back with a feeling of regret that the country could not use their services any longer.</P>
      <P>The moral I draw is that, if possible, officers in the Army and officers in the Police Forces should not make speeches in public.  I have known Generals in several armies; I have known very few who could be trusted to open their mouths without putting their foot into it, and while it is very desirable that officers should entertain each other, and bear testimony to each other's merits, I think that it would be better if they did not invite the reporters as well. No doubt they were there to hear the President's gratifying tribute to his Ministry and to the Dáil.  I do not know whether it was to the Dáil or to the Government Party.  But, honestly, I think that the sooner it is established as a custom in the Army and in the Police Forces that their heads are, like civil servants, to be seen and not heard, the better it would be for the State as a whole.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputy Mulcahy's interpretation of the statement made by General O'Duffy is correct.  It was not General O'Duffy's intention, nor was it his desire, to make any reflection on any resigned or demobilised officers.  The General did not speak from notes.  He addressed himself to what had been for some time a matter of concern to officers in the Army, i.e., that Commissions had not been issued.  There had been delay in the issue of Commissions. It had been originally intended to have had the Army Act not provisional but permanent.  Owing to many causes which it is not necessary to specify, it was found impossible to introduce and get that Act passed into law.  Therefore I introduced the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions Act) Continuance and Amendment Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>Before making the Proclamation establishing the Forces it was necessary to be in a position to at once issue the Pay Warrant.  The Defence Forces were duly proclaimed, and signed Commissions issued to the officers of the Army.  These Commissions were issued to the officers by the Executive Council on the recommendation of the Military Authorities, and the issue was evidence of good faith.</P>
      <P>General O'Duffy had been persistent in his recommendation for the issue of the Commissions.  It was in reference to the issue of these Commissions that General O'Duffy addressed himself in the manner he did, namely, that the officers who stood loyal had received their Commissions.  In that sense he had in mind only the officers then serving in the Army at the time of his appointment as G.O.C.D.F. and Inspector-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words in question were used without premeditation and more with a view to being complimentary than from any other motive.  Nor was there any <Col N="863" /> intention whatever to reflect on the record of any officer.</P>
    <P>If it be considered as such, General O'Duffy wishes it to be known that in the event of any person feeling <Col N="864" /> aggrieved by any remarks made by him on the occasion, he disclaims any such intention absolutely.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, November 6th.</P>
