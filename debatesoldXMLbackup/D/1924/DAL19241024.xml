      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why compensation has been refused to Mr. Patrick Hagan, Ryne, Killoe, Co. Longford, in respect of personal injuries inflicted by British Forces in Longford <Col N="212" /> on July 6th, 1921, also for the loss of cattle destroyed by the same forces during the same year; whether, in view of doctor's evidence to the effect that Mr. Hagan is still suffering from the effects of the illtreatment he received at the hands of the British Forces in 1921, he will have the case reconsidered with a view to granting compensation.</P>

      <P>The application of the person named by the Deputy for compensation in respect of personal injuries sustained on the 6th July, 1921, was carefully considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who came to the conclusion that the injuries received were not of a serious nature, and that the applicant's earning capacity was not impaired. I see no reason, therefore, why the case should be reconsidered.</P>

Gillen, Temple Street, Sligo, and would be settled as quickly as possible, and whether he is aware that up to the 15th October, 1924, Mr. Gillen has neither received the money, nor any reply from the Claims Officer, and whether he will investigate the causes of the delay in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think when progress was reported last evening that I was replying to certain questions addressed to me by Deputy Davin.  Deputy Davin is not here at the moment, but I might <Col N="215" /> perhaps finish what I had to say.  I was invited to explain the reason for fixing an age limit of 18 for females who had undertaken the particular work of serving in a bar of a licensed establishment, and what was the case or reason for any departure from that as respects daughters, step-daughters, sisters or nieces of licensed holders. There is just the case that in this latter class of cases the licensed holder has rather more interest in seeing good order, moderation, and so on, is preserved than in the case where the person behind the bar would simply be an employee in whom he has no personal interest.  It might be quoted as a hardship that the licence holder could not occasionally ask a daughter or a sister of sixteen years of age to help behind a bar at a busy time, or when he was called out on some particular business.  I would be prepared to meet that by saying that persons coming within that category could be so employed, but not below the age of sixteen years.  I think probably the view that there is a case for some such mitigation of the general provision would perhaps appeal to the Dáil generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to restrictions being put on the age, sixteen years or otherwise, of the publican's child.  A publican's son or daughter would have easy access to the premises and could get behind the counter.  That could not be prevented.  Children might get into the bar accidentally, and if a policeman popped in and caught them there he would bring the publican before the court.  We know what would occur then.  For that reason I think this matter should be let stand, as the Minister for Justice intended yesterday, when dealing with the question of not allowing any person under the age of eighteen, except members of the publican's family, to be employed.  I did not raise any objection to the age of eighteen, because I thought it was a reasonable thing.  I do raise an objection now, and I think the Dáil will hold with me that it is very dangerous for a publican, with a family, to have restrictions placed against members of his family going into the licensed premises. <Col N="216" /> As the Minister pointed out, the father and the mother of these children are looking after them, and I think they can do so, and that they have a greater interest in them, than the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Justice not to be led away by Deputy Davin or by other Deputies, who, perhaps, do not understand the circumstances.  If a policeman entered the premises just at the moment when a young person of fourteen or sixteen years of age was in the bar he could prosecute the publican, and according to another section of the Bill, if that occurred three times within five years the licence will be wiped out altogether.  I would ask the Minister to stand as firm in this matter as he did yesterday.  It is easy to get him to stand firm, and for my part he is too firm.  Deputy Davin, while supporting me yesterday, made a very elaborate speech.  I thought I had a very great friend in him, but I found out that he was a wolf in sheep's clothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Deputy would read the section he will have some of his fears removed.  The section refers to the employment of any female person to sell intoxicating liquor. If a child of nine years wandered by accident into the bar it would be all right as far as this section is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The prohibition is against any female person under eighteen years being allowed to sell any description of intoxicating liquor.  I think the Minister said yesterday that there was some possible doubt as to the implications of this section in view of the word &ldquo;employs.&rdquo;  I think it is necessary to have a clear definition of what is intended where the actual utilisation of the services of a female person under eighteen years, with or without pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think some case could be made for that when we are dealing with sisters or daughters or mothers.  Mother, by the way, is not mentioned in this.  It is hardly likely she would be under eighteen years of age.  I think it is going beyond the requirements when we include &ldquo;niece.&rdquo; Deputy Daly has pointed out an obstacle there.  In this country of wide families the niece may be a very far out friend, and the feeling of responsibility for her character may be a very attenuated one.  I would urge, if the Minister is going to concede amendment 46 or a combination of amendments 45 and 46, that he should not extend to the extent of &ldquo;niece,&rdquo; because that leaves a very wide range. It means that the invitation is to the publican to exchange with his own farout relatives and evade the law by bringing in a young person of sixteen.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is adopting Deputy Hughes's wording with the exception of the word &ldquo;niece&rdquo; there is one omission which I am rather surprised that Deputy Hughes has made, and that is there is no mention of the licence holder's wife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the amendment of Deputy Hughes at present, but we are discussing amendment 45.  The Minister, when dealing with this last night, made reference to amendment 46 and said that he looked on it rather more favourably.  I feel that to stipulate the particular individuals is wrong in law. To say that they are to be members of <Col N="218" /> the licence holder's family is, I think, broad and clear enough, and I do not see why we should have to particularise the relationship of the individuals who should comprise the family of the licence holder.  I think everybody will agree that the proper term is &ldquo;a member of the licence holder's family.&rdquo; The Minister said last night that he would be prepared to entertain a proposal to have sixteen years of age made the limit with regard to the licence holder's family.  I would be prepared to meet that to a certain extent, but I think that the two years' difference between the employee and the member of the family is not much of a margin to allow.  If the Minister would say fifteen years of age, which is a year over the school age, it would leave little room for complaint, and would not injure the Bill.  All the people who hold the unfortunate position of being in this particular trade are agents for the State, and they should get some facilities for doing their work.  I am as much against any liberty being given to them or against furthering the trade on lines that will be dangerous to the moral welfare of the community as any other Deputy, and I am inclined to have the trade cribbed, cabined and confined on that particular head.  This, however, is a matter for themselves in regard to their own families, and I think a little liberty should be given to have the age made fifteen for a member of the family, so that if they are behind the counter instead of being in the kitchen the publican is not liable to be brought up and his licence endorsed.  The licence holder is responsible for his family, and should see that nothing takes place that will interfere with their moral character of which the Minister is not the sole protector.  I think that the man himself ought to be the sole responsible authority for his own family.  If the Minister would accept fifteen as the age and allow the other portions of the amendment to stand, I would be willing to accept that compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGoldrick seems to be out for making work for lawyers, but I want to avoid that so <Col N="219" /> far as I can by specifying the people who should be there.  If amendment 46 is accepted I do not think it takes away from amendment 45 in any way. Amendment 45 says &ldquo;a member of the said licence holder's family.&rdquo;  I think that a sister, daughter, or step-daughter is a member of the licence holder's family.  We know that in this country there are a great many people in the licensed trade who have relations, and I think that extending the relationship to a niece is not going outside the licence holder's family.  I would ask the Minister when deciding between the two amendments to say that I have not gone too far by inserting the word &ldquo;niece,&rdquo; as it would do away with the hardship that might otherwise exist.  I would ask Deputy McGoldrick to withdraw his objection.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 6 to delete the word &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;sixteen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is a great hardship on any girl to be deprived of the opportunity of earning a livelihood at sixteen years of age.  It is specified in the Bill that no female is to be allowed to sell intoxicating liquors under eighteen.  If the parents of a large family are deprived of the opportunity of getting employment for some of their girls in publichouses I think it will be a hardship. Girls are marriageable at the age of eighteen, and the majority of them get married at that age.  If they do not earn anything up to the age of eighteen of course they make no return for the expense incurred in rearing them.  If sixteen were specified as the age I would be quite satisfied.  The girl of sixteen has as much sense as the girl of eighteen.  According to law, a girl can get married at twelve years of age, and a male at fourteen.  Surely a girl of sixteen should have a great deal more sense than a girl of twelve, and there could be nothing wrong in having her inside a counter.  I think the Minister should accept this amendment and give an opportunity to fathers of families of getting employment for their children, if they are able to get into the good graces of Deputy Daly, and others, to take one of their daughters behind the counter.  It would be only right to give them that privilege and afford them the opportunity of putting their children into a position to earn something for themselves at the age of sixteen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> This amendment, if accepted, will have the effect of preventing the employment of any person, male or female, except members of the family, under seventeen years of age.  The aim is to prevent, as far as possible, the engagement of boys for the purpose of selling intoxicating liquor, and to restrict the number of boys of that age, and even a later age, if possible, from going into that business.  The tendency has been to try to get into the publichouse business.  We want generally to increase the number of years that boys will have to go to school, and the purpose of the amendment is in keeping with that general intention, to reduce the number of young persons in the publichouse business, and to encourage the retention of boys at school as long as possible.  I think it is a bad proposition to employ for pay&mdash;that was the intention of the Bill at first&mdash;any boy or girl under seventeen years, and the amendments that have been spoken about rather effect the intention when this was first put down.  To &ldquo;allow&rdquo; any person to sell is slightly different from &ldquo;employing&rdquo; any person to sell. The object of the amendment is to restrict the number of persons who would be employed, meaning employed for pay.  I still think that allowing anyone up to seventeen, or under seventeen, to sell intoxicating liquor whether employed or not for pay, is bad, and I would ask the Dáil to agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment is a wise and good one, but at present there may be in existence legal obligations as between employers and employees affecting persons not up to the standard age laid down in the amendment.  I think some provision will have to be made in regard to the existing situation in this particular matter, but it would be wise in future that no boy under seventeen years should be employed in licensed premises, in the interests of education and in the interests of the moral welfare of the community.</P>

      <P>I would agree to the amendment if Deputy Johnson and <Col N="222" /> Deputy McGoldrick could find other employment for boys under seventeen. Deputy Johnson says these boys should be kept at school until seventeen.  I would point out that parents in receipt of small wages cannot keep boys at school until they are seventeen.  When parents rear boys to the age of fourteen or fifteen they must put them at some sort of labour in order to help them to pay the rent and support the remainder of the family.  If you accept this amendment you will have at a later stage in another Bill amendments introduced to the effect that no boy under seventeen will be allowed to get any employment, and that would be a great hardship.  Take, for example, the father or five or six children, who is earning 30/- a week; how can he keep his boys at school until they are seventeen? It is impossible, and Deputy Johnson knows that it is impossible. As I have said, I would be satisfied if Deputy Johnson and Deputy McGoldrick can find suitable employment for those they deprive of getting employed in the licensed trade under the age of seventeen.  I am sure neither of the Deputies is the father of a large family. If either was, he would not think of moving or supporting this amendment, because he would know what it is to rear a family with small wages, and that he could not keep his boys at school until they are seventeen.  Some artisans may be in receipt of £3, £4, or £5 a week, and even they cannot keep children at school until they are seventeen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to reject the amendment, unless the mover and supporter will find other means of providing employment for boys before the age of seventeen.  In some cases children are taken from school at thirteen years of age to earn 1s. 6d. a week picking stones off the land, or running messages, and they have to do that owing to the small wages their fathers receive. I would welcome such an amendment if it were possible to find some means of helping a man to rear his children and keep them at school until they are seventeen years of age.  Personally, I see no earthly means at the present time, with so much unemployment in the country and with the small wages <Col N="223" /> that the working people in the country are receiving, by which a working man would be able to keep his son at school until he is seventeen years of age.  I will vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>The average boy who is apprenticed to this business goes to school until he is about fifteen years of age.  Now, if we accept this amendment, he will be two years knocking about after leaving school until he is apprenticed to the licensed business. You might say that perhaps it would be better that he was not apprenticed to that business at all.  But as things are, we know very well that if you pass this amendment the boy will be unemployed for the two years after leaving school before he reaches the age limit, and in those two years he will be acquiring idle habits.  His father and mother will not be able to cultivate in him the virtue of obedience, and when he gets inside the counter of the publican, or grocer with a mixed business, his employer will not be able to make anything at all of him.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is a little too drastic.  I say that <Col N="224" /> because the age of seventeen is too high.  If the Deputy would alter his amendment so as to reduce that limit, perhaps he might get general agreement for it.  The age at the moment as the law stands for children leaving school is fourteen years.  If a boy wants to look for a position, and, if he has a taste for that business of assistant to a publican, the position will be that after leaving school he will have no occupation for three years while he is waiting to reach the age limit.  As things are, his parents would not be able to keep him at school after he had reached the age of fourteen.  For that reason I think that fixing the limit at seventeen years of age is a little bit too severe, and I think that limit might be modified.  I think if the figure were put at sixteen the case would be met and the amendment accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Daly's answer to my question throws light on this proposal.  Leaving the age limit at seventeen years, if at that age the boy is apprenticed for three years he is a fully qualified salesman at twenty. Of course, this business requires a great deal of apprenticeship!  If you reduce the age limit to sixteen years he is then a journeyman, as he might be called in another trade, at the age of nineteen&mdash;earlier than in any other trade.  I think that the proposition to make it seventeen years, leaving the apprentice, <i>mar eadh</i>, to be a fully qualified man at twenty years of age, is a very mild proposition indeed.  I will ask the Dáil to agree that seventeen years is quite early enough in which to ask any boy to learn the art and craft of selling whisky or drawing corks from porter bottles.  During three years the employer gets the advantage of that boy's services at a low rate of pay, and that is quite long enough.  Then the boy is twenty years of age when he becomes qualified as a fully-fledged salesman.  Bear in mind that there is another factor to be taken into account.  Selling implies also, or carries with it, the act of receiving money.  And it is very easy in this particular trade to refrain from handing up all that has been received.  Perhaps Deputy Daly would know something of that.  To leave a boy under <Col N="225" /> seventeen with that temptation is not right.  To leave a boy over seventeen with that temptation is bad enough, but let us keep the boy under seventeen out of it.  That is an aspect that is very important.  Anybody who has experience of the trade will agree with me that there is a great deal of that kind of pilfering.  I would urge the Dáil to agree that a boy under seventeen years of age should not be employed in this business.</P>

      <P>I object to Deputy Johnson's &ldquo;Lead us not into temptation&rdquo; policy.  If a boy is going to be honest, he is going to be honest.  And if he is going to be a rogue he will be a bigger rogue and a more accomplished rogue at seventeen or eighteen than at fifteen or sixteen.  As one who would like to see plenty of wages going into a labourer's home and into any poor person's home, I say that it would be better if a boy were a fully-fledged clerk at eighteen rather than be waiting until he is twenty.  In that way he would be able to carry home his wages to his mother instead of having him running around the country picking crabs or wasting his time in some other way.</P>

      <P>If we are going to accept this as a business, we are going to accept it as a business because it exists and because people are employed in it.  We must look at it relatively as at any other occupation.  I do not know when boys go as apprentices to the business of drapery, grocery, hardware and such occupations. I take it, it is after leaving school at fifteen years of age.  If we accept this amendment at all it must be approached in some other manner or from some other view point.  I think we must approach it from the point of view of giving them the same facilities as the others.  It is not fair to expect a young fellow going into this trade, having finished school at the age of fifteen years, should wait until he is seventeen years before he can go into a place of business.  I think this is the one business to which you do not want to attract the worst class of young man but the better class of young man.  It does not improve such a young man to <Col N="226" /> have him hanging around for two or three years after leaving school.  I think if you admit that a boy would go into this business in the same way as he would into any other business you will have to treat him in the same way as a boy going into any other business. I do not agree to this seventeen years limit.  I think fifteen years would be a fair limit to fix, and if you fix fifteen years there will be general agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that behind this question there is a principle of very considerable importance. From the discussions we have had in the Dáil about the educational standard we have almost unanimously come to the conclusion that it is too low.  The standard of education reached by those leaving our primary schools is too low, and it is essential, in the interests of the State, to raise that standard of education.  One of the ways in which you could raise that standard, and indeed one of the essential ways in which it could be raised, would be to raise the school-leaving age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>You have raised it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been raised yet.  The school-leaving age is fourteen years and it has produced a standard that is admittedly too low.  In order to get a higher standard for those leaving our schools and going into our trades and in order that they might be able to enter into competition with those leaving school and entering trades in other countries that we have to compete with, the school-leaving age must be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have amongst those leaving our schools a standard of education equivalent to the standard that prevails elsewhere.  The only way in which that can be done is by raising the school-leaving age.  The school-leaving age ought, in my opinion, to be raised to 16 years.  It has been pointed out in this particular trade that we have under consideration that it is a special trade, differing very materially from other trades.  You want boys entering that trade, in view of the surroundings and the temptations in it that do not exist in other trades, to have their characters formed much more than <Col N="227" /> would be necessary in the case of boys entering other trades.  Therefore you must have a higher age limit in the case of boys entering that trade than is essential in the case of other trades.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that a boy in that trade is not fit to meet what he is called upon to meet at a younger age than 17 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the age limit at which a boy would be allowed to leave school, and the raising of that age limit, is, no doubt, a very important one; but I do not think it is at all likely the age for leaving school will be raised to 17 years.  In the country districts those who send their sons to the licensed trade are to my own knowledge mostly small farmers and in some cases artisans. Some of those people have fairly large families and naturally they are desirous of sending some of their boys out to work.  Unfortunately, in this country we have not sufficient industries at present to send boys to.  We have not the work that we would like to apprentice them to; they cannot be apprenticed to certain trades, unfortunately, because the development of affairs that should have taken place here has not taken place.  I know farmers, and I know artisans also, who send their boys to be apprenticed to the licensed business. Luckily I have no connection, either directly or indirectly, with the drink trade; I have no connection with the trade in any form and I am not speaking on behalf of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the boys who are apprenticed, I believe they leave school at the age of fifteen years.  Of course if the school attendance laws are insisted upon, and the age limit for leaving school is increased, the boys will benefit by reason of gaining a higher education which will be an advantage to them.  In those circumstances they are not likely to be sent to the licensed trade.  I quite agree with Deputies who have spoken that many boys have to be taken away from school because their parents can no longer afford to keep them there; the possibilities are the parents are not in a position to continue the children's education beyond the <Col N="228" /> age of fifteen years, as their means will not allow them.  The parents are so positioned that they cannot permit the children to remain at school in order to reap the advantage of a higher education.  In many cases in the country boys are apprenticed at an early age in order that they may be of some assistance to their fathers, as the fathers have more than enough to contend with.  A man might apprentice only one of his boys; he might not want to have the second apprenticed.</P>
    <P>I think it would be much better in those cases to have the boys apprenticed rather than have them joining the number of idlers that we have in the country, picking up vices and spending their spare time, perhaps, in places that I would not like to mention here.  They are supposed to be places of amusement, but I may say that it is a very bad form of amusement for some of the boys.  If the amendment were to be adopted it would mean that many boys who could be apprenticed would be doing an odd day's work, possibly for their fathers.  In the meantime they are likely to forget what they have learned from their teachers at school, and the moral education they received there&mdash;the education that was to fit them for any work they might be called upon to do in their native country.  All that education and training is lost by the time they reach seventeen years. They would have to be sent to a night school or else they are going to be of very little value.  I object specially for that reason to Deputy Johnson's amendment.  If those boys have to go to that trade, if you recognise it as a trade, let them go immediately on leaving school, when their education, moral and otherwise, is about as high as ever they are likely to attain.</P>

If a young boy is kept at school until he is 15 years of age, and if he has to wait until he is 17 in order to be apprenticed, he is either doing something useful in his own home or otherwise going to the devil.  It may be that he would be kept on at school, if his parents are able to afford keeping him there until he is 17 years of age; but then it is scarcely likely that he will go to the licensed business.  The class of boy from which apprentices to the licensed trade are usually taken does not get a university education.  I could not imagine a man with a higher education going behind a bar.  I do not think the terms of this amendment could be agreed to.  It would not be right, and it is not treating the community fairly.</P>

      <P>It occurred to me in the course of the discussion that possibly a reasonable compromise in this amendment would be to fix the age at 16 years.  There is force and point in two lines that have been argued.  It has been pointed out on the one hand that people apprenticed to this trade do not earn anything for two years, and that the age of 19 or 20 years is rather advanced to have a young fellow earning no money.  If we fix this age of 17 years it means, as has been pointed out, a period of waiting and idleness for a boy after he has left school, and that period of idleness or knocking about may not be for his advantage or for the advantage of his neighbours. On the other hand, Deputy Good was quite sound when he said this trade was not exactly like another.  It is an occupation which involves dangers and temptations that do not exist in the hardware or grocery business, and that a boy going into that environment ought to go in with his character some way definitely formed.  Now, weighing up those two lines, one would think that 16 years in the present circumstances would not be an unreasonable age to fix.  If, later on, the school-leaving age is raised by law, then it seems to me that this thing, as Deputy <Col N="230" /> Gorey remarked, solves itself.  If boys are obliged to continue in school to the age of 16 they probably would not be going into this or any other occupation until, perhaps, they are 17 years of age. I would suggest to the proposer of the amendment that he ought to consider accepting sixteen as a reasonable compromise. It would, perhaps, need to be examined as to what extent existing contracts of apprenticeship would have to be specifically exempted by the Bill.</P>

I think it is very inconsistent, having passed a Section under which no boy under eighteen years of age can be served with alcoholic drink, in the same enactment, to allow a boy of sixteen to go behind a counter to serve drink, and to give him facilities, which he will have, as regards the freedom of a publichouse.  If the Minister preferred to have the age raised to eighteen to make the thing uniform, it would be much wiser than fixing the age at sixteen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGoldrick that it would be much better if this amendment specified eighteen years of age.  I would prefer it, but I thought to make a compromise and to endeavour to get general assent by putting the age at seventeen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that there are two classes of licensed houses.  There is the licensed house that sells nothing but intoxicants of one kind or another, and there is another, which the Bill, as introduced, hoped to abolish, and that is the mixed house.  I think that most Deputies who opposed this amendment, when speaking about apprenticeship, were thinking more about mixed trading, such as the grocery trade, the hardware trade, and the licensed trade. If there is to be abolition of the mixed trade, then we will be faced with the prospect of having boys apprenticed to the licensed trade pure and simple. If that be so, I urge that there is no case made out for putting a boy younger than seventeen to that trade. The question of attendance at school is mentioned.  Leaving out the question of raising the school age altogether, we have made provision for <Col N="231" /> evening classes, and we are hopeful to encourage the attendance at evening schools, continuation schools, and technical classes of one kind or another for boys.  You are depriving the boy who goes into this business of that opportunity. If he goes into it at sixteen years of age you simply say to him: &ldquo;You, at any rate, are going to be deprived of the opportunity of the evening classes.&rdquo;  Seventeen is even too early, I admit, but that is the term in the amendment.  In the cities, certainly, and in some of the towns, and possibly in the country districts, the purely licensed house is to one's very great regret, very largely, at the present time, the rendezvous for bookmakers and bettingmen.  Put a boy under sixteen years of age into that environment, and you are destroying him.  Let us then raise the age as high as we reasonably can.</P>
    <P>Take the other proposition that the mixed trade is going to continue, and a question comes up before a father, whether his boy is going to learn the mixed grocery and drink trade.  He goes to a shop at sixteen.  Surely one year behind the grocery counter can be served before he touches the drink side.  If he is going to learn the business, let him devote the first year or two to the general business of the grocery or hardware, or to the other business conducted in that mixed trade. We are not depriving that boy from going to such a business and learning it.  The amendment simply asks that he should not be engaged in the selling of drink before seventeen years of age. I do not feel justified in agreeing to sixteen years as a compromise.  I think seventeen should be taken as a compromise, or eighteen, and I believe seventeen is too low, but in view of the general conditions I put down seventeen as a reasonable proposition, and I cannot agree to withdraw from that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>One point in the argument of Deputy Johnson was that all the houses in the country districts should have separate departments, and should have separate people to deal with each department.  Deputy Johnson's ideas would be found to look very <Col N="232" /> rosy on paper, but I would like to find the small trader in the country with the mixed business who would be able to put a boy into one particular department and say that he shall not leave that particular department for one or two years.  We all know how business is carried on in the country.  Perhaps it is different in the cities, where they can do that, but to say that it can be done in the country, where you have groceries and sometimes cloth business, is not in accordance with the facts, and the boy has to attend to the one as well as the other.  It would be difficult to meet Deputy Johnson's suggestion.  If a house was large, and had different departments, the thing could be done, but in the ordinary case in the country it would be absolutely impossible to do it, and for that reason I think Deputy Johnson is quite wrong on this occasion. If he agrees to the suggestion put forward by the Minister, I think he would be doing what is right.</P>

He is going to handle more dangerous things than whiskey and he might give you a dose stronger than whiskey, but there is nothing at all about that.  This is all directed against the unfortunate publican. I think that there is no boy of seventeen who would knuckle down to going inside a counter for anybody. The boy of seventeen nowadays would be ashamed to handle a pen or to handle anything except a gun.  I object to seventeen.  I would agree to fifteen, when a boy would leave school and, as Deputy Dalton pointed out, with his education fresh upon him.  Deputy Johnson pointed out that he cannot go to the technical school.  As to that, the average business house in towns shuts up at 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, and if a boy likes he can go to the technical schools or the Irish school or any other school.

On the other hand, I think Deputy Johnson has put the case very clearly and fairly. I would say, even supposing it may be a hardship and a difficulty on the licensed holder, that we cannot ignore the fact that, to-day, the claim of the country is on behalf of our young people: to protect them, as far as possible from unreasonable temptation, and if it can be secured, to start them in life with a better education and a better outlook than young people had in the past.</P>

In the case of a boy of tender years, parents, in my opinion, had better put him to break stones on the road than to serve his apprenticeship in a publichouse, where his business would be to hand out drink.  The Minister has put forward a strong proposal for a compromise. On full consideration of the matter, I would ask the Dáil to reject that compromise.  In putting down the age at seventeen years we are not putting it any higher than the general opinion of the country would endorse. Let us, at the present time, ignore the question that has been raised by Deputy Daly about our young people going out with guns.  Let us look forward to the time when better things will happen for our young people than to have them going out with guns.  In so far as this Dáil is concerned, I think all of us ought to aim at a higher standard in the future than to put boys of fifteen to serve drink behind the publichouse counter, because certainly their characters are not formed at that age.</P>

The arguments that have been used in defence of lowering the age might have been used to defend the retention of the child chimney-sweeper and the child factory hand.  I do not think there is any real argument for this claim except the material one.  I agree that the publican may have some claim for compensation, but that is a matter we will have to look into.  We will have to see that injustice must not be done, but I think that we ought not to consent to anything that would lead to the deterioration of the youth of this country.

I would not even call it a compromise, because it has more of the elements of right about it than anything which suggests a compromise.  If the age of seventeen is left in and a boy is to apprentice himself, for, say, two years without any salary or only a nominal salary, you will have that boy, when he reaches eighteen or nineteen years of age, seeing other youths resorting to licensed houses and spending money while he has none to spend.  There is certainly a temptation there, and you are not treating the boy fairly in leaving him from seventeen to nineteen years of age in receipt of such a salary as will prejudice him in the eyes of other boys, such as trade apprentices, clerks, or youths in other occupations.  The school age is fourteen at present, and the boy has got two years before he enters this business. There is not a lot of difference between sixteen and seventeen years of age, as far as the use of reason is concerned.  A boy ought to be a sensible youth at sixteen, and to keep him from seventeen to nineteen without any hope of an increase in wages, having regard to modern requirements, is certainly unfair.  It has been suggested that there are certain places in <Col N="235" /> which it would be unsafe to put boys of tender years.  I think there is fair discrimination exercised by those who send boys to these places.  They are very particular about the institutions to which they send their boys.  There is always a reluctance to send them to places where the boys would be open to temptation.  There is no doubt that the ordinary small farmer cannot afford to keep a boy from sixteen to seventeen bringing in no money whatever.  It is all very well as a headline or as a pious expression of opinion to say that boys should not be subjected to temptation, but you cannot alter the fact that, in the present economic situation, parents cannot afford such an interruption in the life of a boy at that particular period.  I think that the age of sixteen is not a compromise at all, but a sound suggestion, and I think it ought to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I desire, also, to support the suggestion that the age should be sixteen.  As one who has had considerable experience in the various trades mentioned, I do not at all agree that the licensed trade has all the temptations that have been adverted to.  A boy working in a licensed house does not get out until 10 o'clock at night, according to the terms of the new Bill.  In other words, he does not get out at all, because if he is working in a proper house he will have to go to bed shortly after that hour.  On the other hand, a boy engaged in the drapery, hardware or grocery trades is free every evening at about 6 o'clock, and after that he probably spends his time knocking about the streets or in the picture house.  I suggest that such boys would be just as well off and perhaps better if they were working, as they would be if they were engaged in licensed houses. I consider that sixteen would be a fair age, and with regard to the other matter that has been referred to, I hope that we will soon see legislation introduced that will bring the school-leaving age up to sixteen.  That would then cover the entire age limit with regard to all businesses.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputy Johnson's intention <Col N="236" /> is with regard to his amendment, but I hope he will at least put it to the House.  I have heard the arguments used by the President and by Deputy Shaw, and I hope that the President will not think that I am plagiarising from his accustomed expression when I say that they did not greatly impress me.  The President pointed out that the ordinary small farmer could not afford to keep his son between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, but I would have thought that it would have been accepted that the type of boy that would be put into a licensed trader's business would be the licensed trader's son, not the farmer's son.  The majority of licensed traders in this country are admittedly not making a very bad business out of it, and the majority of them could very easily afford between those years to let their sons be more profitably employed than behind the counter.  Deputy Shaw clinched home one of the very strongest arguments used by Deputy Johnson.  I do not know whether he perceived it to be so or not, because Deputy Johnson had grounded his case on this, largely, that the boy who went into a publichouse or a licensed trader's business between the ages of fifteen and seventeen had during that time removed from him the opportunities of any extra education, and Deputy Shaw stated that the boy does not get out at all, because he would be kept there until the hour that the shop closed and then he would be sent to bed.  That is exactly the case that Deputy Johnson has put, that during these years the boy ought to have his opportunity, in common with boys in any other trade, of seeking out of hours education if he desires to do so. I hope that Deputy Johnson will put his amendment to the House, and I do so chiefly for this reason.  The Minister for Justice put it in this form, that when the boy had turned sixteen he had entered upon his seventeenth year, which was a very wily form of putting his argument.  But we do know that twelve months at that time of life means a very great deal more in the life of a human being than twelve months at any other time of life.  Between fifteen and twenty, a year can be <Col N="237" /> reckoned in formative influence as equal to four or five years at any other time in a man's life, and that one year is probably as critical a year as any other year in the whole of a man's life. During that year it is desirable that the boy should not be brought into touch with the influences with which he would be brought into touch if he were in the habit of being behind a publichouse bar all the time.</P>
      <P>There is another question.  Deputy Daly referred to prejudices.  There is no question whatever of prejudices, but there is, I think, a case of recognising the facts as we know them to exist. Whatever be the cause, we do know that very undesirable influences are in the habit of frequenting the publichouse. I hope that they are not the only people who are in the habit of frequenting the publichouse, but they are there, and those who will serve behind a bar are brought into contact with them.  Deputy Johnson mentioned the question of those who made &ldquo;books&rdquo; and those who engaged in gambling.</P>

      <P>I would remind Deputy Figgis that you can also learn very good lessons in those particular institutions, great lessons in Christian charity, in kindness, in humanity, and in many of the other virtues which, perhaps, you would not find in another institution.  Do not let it be assumed that these places are dens of vice.  They are not.  Some of them are dens of vice, of course.  But nevertheless, there is brought home to young boys some of the realities of life that are very useful to them.  I would like to tell the Deputy <Col N="238" /> that an examination of licence-holders will disclose that very few of their sons go into the business.</P>

      <P>I am not questioning in the least the substance of what the President has just stated. My argument was on the lines of the arguments of previous speakers, that there are temptations to be found in such places, and probably also these other lessons to be learnt, but the discrimination to pick between them is hardly likely to be attained by boys of sixteen.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the suggestion that sixteen should be the age, and I take this opportunity of entering a protest against the atmosphere of prejudice that has been created by unrealities in this House against the licensed trader.  I never heard such unreal talk in my life as I have within the past hour.  One would think that the licensed trader was someone that was unclean, whereas in order to get a licence the man's character from the time of his birth until he applies for the licence, practically, is investigated by the police authorities to see if there is anything that should prevent him from getting a licence.  I have known publicans when selecting apprentices, the majority of whom were small farmers' sons, requiring to be satisfied by the school teacher, by the parish priest, and by anybody that counted for anything in the country, that the boy was one of the best boys in the district.  To hear the talk going on to-day about grocers' assistants, one would think that they had an unclean record.  Will any Deputy show me any one case&mdash;I will ask for one case&mdash;of a failure in connection with grocers' assistants? Show me a case of a grocer's assistant with a bad character.  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the boy coming into the business must show a pledge that he is a teetotaller, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred to-day they are teetotallers, and are of the best class in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was engaged in the licensed trade; I am out of it now for some time.  I hold no brief for the trade, but I protest against the unfair atmosphere which has been created against it.  In <Col N="239" /> my time, at any rate, when a boy from the country came to the trade, the licensed trader looked after him, looked after his character in every way as if he were his own son, and entered into a solemn contract with the father that while he was a boy and under his control, he would see that he attended to his religious duties, and he would see, as far as lay in his power, that the boy would be a credit to the father and a credit to the house in which he served his time.  I say this because of the number of boys that I knew in the trade, who came to the trade as teetotallers, and the number of boys who went through the trade for many years and remained teetotallers, a number of whom to-day own their houses, and are still teetotallers.</P>
    <P>I now get away from the licensed trade, and I will put this point in support of the sixteen years.  In the country districts the small farmer with four or five sons is able to keep one or two at home.  He makes an effort to get another into the drapery business, and he sends another to Dublin to serve his time in the grocery trade.  The grocery trade in Dublin carries with it the serving of drink behind the counter.  I have seen a boy serving bread and butter at one counter, crossing to another and serving drink, and he served the drink without ever touching it, as if he were serving bread and butter and ordinary groceries.  I think it is unfair to make such an attack, to say that these boys coming from the country have not been able to look after themselves, when you look round and see their success and the good class of young man that is behind the publichouse counter to-day.  I very seldom speak here, but I hope that the suggestion of sixteen years will be accepted by the House, and that it will not ask those small farmers or those men in the country who send their sons to the grocery business in Dublin to keep them at home until they are seventeen years of age, probably walking about from the time they leave school at fifteen or fifteen and a-half years, until they are seventeen years.  I think it is unfair to the boy and to his father, who expects something of him when he is <Col N="240" /> about twenty years of age.  They come to serve their time at very small wages. I have seen boys coming to serve their time, and in order to keep them right, in every way they merely got small pocket-money and were clothed, for the first year.  For the second year they got a moderate salary, and for the third year a fairly reasonable salary.  After that they were free to leave the house they served their time in, and look for a better position, and I am glad to say that the majority of them that I knew turned out a great success.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Byrne, I do not very often speak in the Dáil, but when I do, I generally talk about a matter of which I do know something. Other people take up a lot of time airing their views about every subject under the sun that a great many people listening to them know very well that they know nothing about.  I have been twenty-five years in business, and I have put hundreds of apprentices through my hands.  They have been engaged in various ways, and I always found that the percentage of assistants that went wrong was very small, and that there was a great deal more out of other trades, on the grounds I have explained, that they had a good deal of time to go round the town and get into more serious temptation than they would get into in a publichouse.  There is an idea abroad, seemingly, that it is a place where there is a great temptation, but I am aware from my experience that if a boy is inclined to go wrong it does not matter if he is in the licensed trade or in any other trade, he will go wrong.  My experience is that boys go wrong much more frequently in the case of other trades.</P>

      <P>I do not want to rise too often, as I think I have spoken three times already, and Deputy Byrne said a good deal of what I wanted to say.  Behind some of the arguments that are used here is the imputation that young men engaged in the grocery or spirit trade have gone and are going wrong and are likely to go wrong.  I want to emphasize what Deputy Byrne said&mdash;that from my knowledge, and I have some knowledge of the young men in the trade coming from <Col N="241" /> the country&mdash;many of them from the county I come from&mdash;they make as good citizens and as clean livers as there are in any other trade.  I should say a lesser percentage of young men in that trade go wrong than in other trades.  I will not say they are better, but they are certainly as good.  Behind the whole thing is the implication that they are not.  It is a lie, and it is uttered by men who do not know what they are talking of, and who merely get up to air their eloquence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will make it plainer when I have finished.  This is used as a wedge to raise the school-going age.  Why not have the common pluck to face it and raise it without using this as a leverage?  What are parents going to do with their sons between the ages of fifteen, sixteen and seventeen?  Teach them to be poets and politicians?  We have seen some of our poets and politicians, and they are not a credit either to this Dáil or to the general community.  Talking about temptation, there is more temptation in any of the other trades in the city, more temptation outside on the streets, temptation in places all round the streets, and they are availed of as much, or more so, by men engaged in other businesses than by men engaged in the grocery or spirit trade.</P>
      <P>It has been said there are black sheep in the flocks of men in the spirit trade. I suppose there are, but there are black sheep in every flock&mdash;black sheep amongst our politicians, men engaged in politics whose names stink in the nostrils of decent men, fly boys in every trade, fly boys amongst politicians, and fly boys amongst the spirit trade, and when we start making comparisons we ought to be quite honest about it.  We should not try to insult the young men who are being brought up in this trade. If there are statistics to prove their accusations let them get them and prove them.  Behind it all&mdash;I am sure it is intended by a good many Deputies&mdash;is the implication that these are the most dishonest and most immoral of our citizens.  That is a lie and everybody knows it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am trying to make out.  These places are for producing the highest character of citizen that we have, and they are places where you should have no hesitation in sending your sons and daughters. There is really no reason why the child of four, seven, ten, and up to nineteen or twenty, should not be sent into these publichouses, boys or girls, so far as character-forming is concerned, and yet the Dáil has agreed that it is not desirable that a young female person should go into that business.  Why? Because there is a feeling in every man's mind here that the influences surrounding that business are not productive of the best character from the child.  The boy or girl arrives at a certain age, develops certain protective powers, and it may be quite safe, but the very arguments that are used by Deputies from convictions they have, that it is not well for women under a certain age to go into that business to sell intoxicating liquor, is the argument that I use for the boy under seventeen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not charging people engaged in the business with being less moral, efficient, or reputable citizens than others. I am not charging the employer of an apprentice with any less character than any other employer.  I am saying this, and I defy any person who has any experience to deny it, that the men who congregate at a publichouse bar relax very frequently, and get into the habit <Col N="243" /> of speaking about things that they will not speak about before their own sons and daughters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they do it more frequently when they gather in a publichouse.  There is no man who knows anything about it, and is honest, but will accept that position.  The case made by the President can be met if the employers in this business would pay the apprentices a certain wage instead of allowing them to go for the first year for nothing.  We are asked to pass a proposition here allowing the boy of sixteen to be employed in a publichouse up to 10 o'clock at night, any time from 9 in the morning until 10 at night.  For that two years he is receiving practically nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We know how well the Shops Hours Act is evaded and how little it is enforced.  The President and Deputy Shaw reminded the House, and I would ask the House to bear it in mind, that there is going to be a reduction in the number of licensed houses in this country for the future.  The publicans who are able to ensure that the character of the house is of as high a nature as is suggested, will have an opportunity to send their children to work in it, and there will be no room for people outside to find employment in public houses in the future.  Why is it that the publican does not send his boy to the business?  I have known dozens of publicans who dislike the business, and say quite frankly that they would not allow their boys to be brought up in the business.  It is not because the publican himself is of a bad character in any way whatever, but that he knows the influences the boy is subjected to are not good, and he waits until his boy is of an age to resist those influences to a much greater extent than a youth of sixteen can do.  Deputy Byrne and others still talk about apprentices to the grocery business.  I <Col N="244" /> am visualising what the Bill tends to, that there shall be a distinction between the grocery business and the sale of intoxicating liquor.  If you want to apprentice your boy to the grocery business, then this amendment will not interfere with it.  The publican will then have the grocery business allied with the liquor business.  The young apprentice can be maintained in the grocery until he is seventeen, and then finish his apprenticeship in the liquor side if he wishes.  There is no charge against the character of the people engaged in the business, but there is this definite recognition that the surroundings and the habitués of very many public houses, particularly in the towns and cities, are not of a character with which we would like our own boys of sixteen to be associated.  Deputy Byrne, I am sure, will admit that.</P>

The amendment could conceivably take the form of exempting persons who are at the moment in bonds of apprenticeship with employers in the trade.  Personally, I will vote for Deputy Johnson's amendment.

    <P>Debate resumed on motion by Major Bryan Cooper: &ldquo;That the charge of sixpence collected on all postal parcels originating outside An Saorstát should not have been imposed without consultation with the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the Dáil disapproves of,&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;Saorstát&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and is of opinion that this charge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to give the Dáil an opportunity of saying that it disapproves of the act of the Postmaster-General in placing a sixpenny <Col N="248" /> charge on all parcels coming into the Saorstát, and that it also disapproves of the act of the Postmaster-General in bringing this charge into force without first giving an opportunity to the Dáil to discuss it.  At the time the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget and introduced the 6d. statistical tax, he made a statement that it would be necessary in future to change the postal arrangements so as to have the postal system brought into line with the system of getting goods in by other channels.  On that occasion I took exception to the tax, but I got very little support.  I think that I was supported only by one Deputy.  Outside the House there was not a word of protest from the business interests of the country.  Now we find, when the tax has been enforced and when it is begining to affect the business interests, these interests are becoming very noisy and we are hearing objections all over the place.  It would have been much better if these people at that time got into touch with me or with others interested in the matter, and showed that they objected to this tax.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the tax is really a protective tariff, and if it has to be brought into force the proper means of doing so would not be by warrant of the Post Office but by introducing it, with other protective tariffs, at the time the Budget was introduced.  The reasons for this have not been given in the House at this stage, but have been given by the Postmaster-General in other parts of the country. I do not agree that these reasons are satisfactory, and that the benefits which he says will accrue to the country will actually accrue.  He says that the cost of getting parcels into the country is excessive, and that the Irish Post Office is paying for a portion of the delivery of these parcels.  If that is so, the remedy is not the remedy that is being taken, but some arrangement should be made with the British Postmaster-General to see that the rate of charges should be increased.  He says that it would have the effect of encouraging distributors to open establishments in this country and to get their goods in in large quantities and distribute them by the postal system of <Col N="249" /> the Saorstát.  If that is the case I say that he is doing exactly what we have been fighting against for a considerable time, and he is trying to increase rather than decrease the number of distributors in this country.  There has been much talk about the high cost of living being due to the large number of distributors, middlemen, and I think there is general agreement with that; but apparently the intention of the Postmaster-General is to increase still further the number of people handling goods and to see that the people handling goods between the consumer and the producer will have a profit.  If the Postmaster-General is aiming at that he may achieve his end, and he will succeed in increasing the cost of living.  If we are to be placed in the position of being able to carry on our business as it should be carried on, if we are to be enabled to compete with other countries, and not have our labour charges higher than those in other countries, one of the first things to which we have to devote attention is to reduce the cost of living and not to bolster up the number of distributors who would be connected with the trade in this country by opening establishments here.  It seems to me that there are real difficulties which will prevent such trade being established in this country.  Most of the articles brought in here through the parcel post are not manufactured in this country.  They are imported from England, and the Irish importers dealing in small quantities of goods will have to pay a higher price for them and will have to get them direct from the people who send them in by parcel post.  They will therefore have to add on their profits, thereby increasing the cost of the goods to the consumer and increasing the cost of living generally.</P>
    <P>Another point about this is the fact that it will affect the traffic in small parcels which takes place at Christmas. The Postmaster-General knows well that a large quantity of small parcels containing articles of small intrinsic value pass as momentoes of affection and friendship at Christmas time. People who receive these parcels will be subject to this vexations and annoying tax.  No matter how small the <Col N="250" /> value of the article sent them is worth they will have to pay the statistical tax.  The Postmaster-General maintains that it is in the interest of the business men of this country to have this tax in force.  We have a statement in the daily papers to-day which shows that by far the greater majority of business people are in opposition to it, and that they feel the advantages which they gain by it do not in any sense of the word counterbalance the disadvantages. I have here a cutting from one of the daily papers to-day containing some information with regard to voting papers which were issued by the Dublin Mercantile Association. I will read three of the questions which the Association sent out to their members by means of their trade paper, the <i>Dublin Mercantile Gazette.</i> In an edition of this paper a ballot paper was printed asking members to vote on three questions.  The first question asked was, &ldquo;Do you find that the 6d. parcel post delivery tax has helped your trade?&rdquo;  The answer to that in the case of 20 firms was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  In the case of 520 firms the answer was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  So that we have 520 mercantile firms who are receiving the <i>Dublin Mercantile Gazette</i> answering that they do not think the 6d. parcel post has helped their trade as against the 20 who think it has.</P>

      <P>The second question is, &ldquo;Do you expect that it will?&rdquo;  The answer in the case of 34 firms was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; and in the case of 511 the answer was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That is 511, as against 34, think it will not benefit their trade in the future.  The third question was, &ldquo;Would you prefer parcel post rates in force prior to August 31st, 1924, to the new rates with the 6d. tax added?&rdquo;  The answer was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; by 470 firms, as against 57 who said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  A vote of that kind indicates that they do not want it, that <Col N="251" /> they consider that it is of no benefit to the community.  That is the answer of one section of the people affected by this.  I believe the consumers will have to pay more for their goods because of the additional 6d. tax, and because of the additional profit that will be made if there are more distributors throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The only advantage to be gained is the advantage to the Post Office and to the State in having the charge which they make for their parcels brought up to a paying basis.  In view of that I consider that this worrying and annoying tax has not been justified, and not only that, but that the method of imposition of the tax without giving the Dáil the opportunity of voicing the views of the people they represent has not been fair and is not justified in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the amendment.  Of all the iniquitous taxes that have been imposed by the Dáil I think there is none to equal this.  As regards taxation, I think it is practically the last straw which the public can bear.  It would take a considerable lot to convince me that the Minister imagines that this tax is in any way going to help the State.  Supposing he does imagine such a probability I would like to know what comparison he would make between the cost and the profit to the trader, and I would like to know if he has taken into consideration in coming to the conclusion there what comparison he would make between the profit and the worry, trouble, anxiety and expense which the unfortunate trader who has to pay this tax and who is already over-victimised by the Customs has to undergo.  Some traders tell me that it takes weeks and weeks to get goods through the Monaghan Custom House at present, and what would it be if the Customs officials have to go through every package for the purpose of classification into the 6d. parcels?  What staff would the Post Office require to do this work?  I know the case of a lady living about six miles out of the town who bought some fish during the last month and she had to pay a double tax on it. <Col N="252" /> She made enquiries and she was told the reason for it was that there was a certain quantity of flat-fish and so many herrings and so she had to pay two 6d's.  I wonder does Deputy Johnson realise when he welcomes this tax that if a trader, say a grocer, got in a certain class of goods comprising 50 or 60 different articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case there is a tax to this effect imposed.  As I have said, our traders are almost knocked out of business because of it.  One trader told me a short time ago that the cost on his small shop at present is £200 a year more than in pre-war times.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>He gets a quantity of them.  Anyhow, because of the tax the cost of keeping his place has gone up considerably.  I wonder does the Minister realise that the business establishments along the border line cannot compete with similar establishments across the border, and at the same time pay their way.  If the Minister were endeavouring to assist traders beyond the border he could not do it in a better or more efficient way than by imposing such a tax.  Take the case of a chemist, with whose business I am more familiar. In the town of Clones, in the county which the Minister represents, take the case of an individual who goes to a doctor and gets a prescription.  He then goes to the local chemist and the chemist tells him that there is one item in the prescription which he has not got, and which he will have to procure from London, and he charges him 3/- for the prescription.  The following week the same man happens to be in the market town of Newtownbutler, and he gets the same prescription made up, and the Northern chemist tells him the same story about the item in the <Col N="253" /> prescription which has to be procured. He charges him 2/- for the prescription.</P>
      <P>The patient naturally concludes that the chemist in the Free State, in addition to securing his ordinary profit, which is 99 per cent., puts on an additional 33? per cent., whereas in reality the chemist has no more profit than his friend in the Northern part, because it costs him 7d. to get in the article and 2d. extra.  That is only one of the many things that happen up there every day.  The patient naturally comes to the conclusion that he will leave the trader in the Free State and deal as much as he can with the trader in the North.  That is only one of many instances of unfair taxation which the people have to bear compared with their Northern friends, who sometimes live only a mile or two distant.</P>
      <P>I understood that all along the Government were out against profiteering and out to reduce the cost of living; but I have come to the conclusion that it is otherwise.  The consumer will probably have to pay 1s. for an article that a trader procures at 7d.  As one Deputy has pointed out, the Minister is giving further assistance to the middleman who can buy articles in large quantities, and is meantime crippling the small merchant.  I say, without fear of contradiction, that the small merchants in the border counties who pay a considerable amount towards the support of this State in taxation, cannot much longer keep going unless taxes are reduced.  They find it difficult to make ends meet at the present time, between the high taxes and the cost of goods, not to speak of our own authorities preventing non-taxable goods from going out, except through the abominable system of smuggling. Quite a number of traders are practically facing bankruptcy, and I would advise the Minister to reconsider this matter and remove the disabilities from which the people suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that at least some Deputies are under the impression that in introducing this delivery charge on parcels I, by some strategy or another, evaded the obvious duty of informing the Dáil. <Col N="254" /> I wish at once to correct that impression. In the ordinary way, it is true, a Post Office occasionally varies its charges&mdash;I mean minor charges.  Those charges are so numerous that it has never been found possible or desirable to bring them forward before the legislature. In the case of our predecessors in the administration of the Post Office, they never found it desirable to bring those charges before their legislature, the matter being so minor in character. But in the case of maximum charges, charges which may reasonably be termed policy charges, those were in every instance submitted for approval or rejection.  I hope I have been careful enough to follow that example in the present instance, and if Deputies will refer to col. 4992 of the Dáil Debates they will find there a statement as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have decided, subject to the final approval of the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I think we may take it that his approval will be forthcoming &mdash;to reduce the parcel post rate to the English level, and to impose a charge of sixpence for examination and delivery of imported parcels.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>The 21st July.  Now, this is the normal line taken when informing the Dáil that certain rectifications in postal charges were about to be made.  It is not humanly possible, as far as I know, to give a more clarified notice.  That is clear and definite and unambiguous.  I told the Dáil that we had considered certain matters in respect to charges, that we had come to certain conclusions, that we had represented these conclusions for ratification for the Minister for Finance, and on the assumption that this ratification would be approved we intended to proceed. I submit if the Dáil had any grievance with the imposition of this delivery fee that certainly was the time to put forward that grievance.  It is the normal manner in which to make such representations, and I do not remember any very serious opposition <Col N="255" /> then being raised.  In all discussions which have taken place inside and outside the Dáil, the thing that bears most forcibly upon my mind is the fact that nobody has come down to bedrock and said that we are not justified in collecting the normal delivery cost on those imported parcels.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Dáil is already aware of the fact&mdash;I expect it is&mdash;that we import something like 3,000,000 parcels annually.  We export one-third of that number.  For the surplus of imports we receive, on an average, 3d. per parcel.  I wonder does anybody here contend that the Post Office can deliver parcels at 3d.  I never heard anybody say that we can, or even suggest that we can; we, ourselves, know very well that we cannot.  We know very well that at least three threepences would scarcely cover the expenses incurred by this delivery.  Now we have come to the conclusion that we have hitherto lost on an average 6d. per parcel on two million parcels.  In other words, we have continued, without the approval of the people, to collect out of Irish revenue the sum of 6d. and we have handed it over as a subsidy to English exporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Something in the nature of £50,000.  It is a very serious thing for a service losing something in the nature of half a million of money, to lightly hand over as a subsidy to English exporters the sum of £50,000. I wonder if any Deputy would approach his constituents and secure their approval for an expenditure of that kind?  Now, I am not very seriously concerned with the opinions crystallised in this Press report to-day. I have met large traders here and, strange to relate, they have expressed their approval of this introduction.  It would appear that when approached by the officials of the Mercantile Association they expressed a different <Col N="256" /> view.  I am rather inclined to think for the moment that they have not made up their minds on the subject, and they are prepared to agree pretty well with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs one day, and the officials of the Mercantile Association, who take the opposite view, the next day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will take his mind back a little he will find that the officials of the different Mercantile Associations&mdash;Chambers of Commerce and others&mdash;expressed their very definite views and gave a very definite lead.  They have merely sought in this instance to get support for that. I submit they have prejudiced the situation; but to suggest that after a month's experiment it is possible to say whether this delivery fee is likely to increase or decrease trade here is, in my view at any rate, an impossibility. I think the most that could be said for the action of the Chambers of Commerce and other Mercantile Associations is that they are rather hasty in their desire to support a step which was taken without due consideration. Time, and time only, will prove whether or not this delivery fee is a barrier to trade.  At any rate we have to consider the situation from a different aspect.  On the average we have been losing 6d. per parcel in handling these English parcels, and nobody has yet told us that we are entitled to put our hands into the taxpayers' pockets here and take their money in order to subsidise English wholesalers as against Irish competition, because that is what it all means.  There is more to be considered, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all very well aware that this onslaught of English goods is not helpful to home industry.  This is apart altogether from the strictly Post Office view point.  We are all very well aware that this onslaught, this medium kind of cheap transport of English goods is not helpful to home industry. We are equally well aware that many of these industries are at present in a <Col N="257" /> parlous condition and it is the duty of those responsible for the conduct of the Nation's business to see what can be done to stimulate these industries.</P>
    <P>Now certainly one of the ways is not to subsidise English industries.  That is the wrong direction.  We are also aware that there is a great number of people in this country who, for some reason or another,&mdash;and, certainly the reason is not in all cases that the English goods are cheaper&mdash;make it a point to get their goods from the other side. I wonder do they consider that this is fair to the shopkeepers and wholesalers here?  Do they consider that those people have to pay rates and taxes and that they give employment to our people?  Do they consider that they all have to make a living?  At any rate we feel that we are not justified in facilitating the destruction of our own wholesalers.  Deputy Heffernan referred to these intermediaries as a kind of evil that could well be dispensed with. I am sure that were we to continue the policy of subsidising their competitors it is only a matter of time when every shopkeeper in this country, in the logical order of things, should put up his shutters.  I wonder would the Deputies here desire that?  I wonder does Deputy Heffernan desire it? Does he think that diverting traffic to the wholesalers or retailers in London is improving the situation?  Does he forget that the wholesalers and retailers here also deal direct with the manufacturer, or does he believe that they are merely second-hand dealers buying from London wholesalers?  I do not know that we should have any particular desire to exterminate the intermediate dealer here.  He has come.  He is regarded as a necessity.  We, at any rate, regard him as a necessity in the provision of rates and taxes and employment, and if there is anything in the way of a State subsidy going, it certainly ought not to be diverted to his opponent.  There is no question of increasing the Post Office staff in dealing with this delivery charge.  It has involved comparatively little extra labour, and presents no material difficulties to the Service.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies emphasise the unfairness <Col N="258" /> of its application to the book trade.  In any departure of this kind, you are certain to involve a great many lines of business in inconvenience; but I doubt if any big departure has ever been made without similar difficulty arising.  We realise it would be all the better if the book trade could be made an exception, but we find in practice, that it cannot be.  The book trade is fairly well catered for.  I see no necessity to make further exceptions in its favour.  It really comes down to this:&mdash;On the assumption that the insistence of the Government that this shortage in the cost of doing the work of the people should be made good, and on the assumption that it is an inconvenience, are we justified in taking people's money and handing it over to that section which thinks fit to use the post as a medium of getting their goods?  We know very well that the bulk of the goods coming through here&mdash;and it is well known to every-body&mdash;could be equally well, and I understand, equally cheaply, secured at home.  Why should a man who secures these goods at home be compelled to contribute to his neighbour who may not be over-patriotic and gets his goods from the other side?  Why should I be compelled, for instance, to put my hand in my pocket and take out 6d. to pay for a parcel brought from the other side to my neighbour?  I secure my goods in Dublin.  They may, perhaps, cost me more, but I do not admit they do.  I make my living in this country and I spend my money here, and I set an example necessary for the life of the country and for its trade and employment. I help a man whose wife and family are, perhaps, hungry to get employment and a living.  I do not send my money out of the country, and why should I be compelled to put my hand in my pocket and say to my neighbour: &ldquo;I will help you to strangle my country?&rdquo; Why should I be compelled to do that?  I take myself in this case as the ordinary man.</P>
    <P>We have very great respect for the views of the Chambers of Commerce and of Mercantile Associations, but they are not the whole Irish community; they are merely the handlers of imported goods for the most part.  I <Col N="259" /> do not suppose they would deny that; they are the channel through which the goods come in for the common people. But the common people pay.  The importers do not lose this 6d., and, therefore, I am not prepared to pay more respect to their views than to the views of the ordinary citizens.  We do not represent the Mercantile Associations, but we do represent the whole community. I hold the community will not agree now or at any other time to take the money of this nation and hand it over to merchants on the other side of the channel for the purpose of facilitating them in their trade here.  If they want trade here let them pay for it. We want no profit by their trade.  We do not desire to prevent their trade in any respect.  All we say is: &ldquo;If you want to trade here, pay for it.&rdquo; That is an argument which has not been met, and unless it is met I am not prepared to consider any departure whatever from this proposal.</P>

      <P>The latter part of the Minister's speech reminds me of a speech I read some time ago by a Deputy who has not yet taken his seat in this Dáil.  He said when he wanted to know what the Irish people thought he looked into his own heart.  When the Minister wants to know what the whole Irish community thinks, even though their views are otherwise unexpressed, he looks into his own mind.  He ignores the Chambers of Commerce, and those actually engaged in trade and industry, and looking into his own mind he sees what the whole Irish community thinks, how unfair it is that they should pay, at one moment he said £50,000, and he said £500,000 at another moment, for the loss on delivery of parcels.  But after all his is essentially an unjust Ministry.  I have to pay as much for a letter which I send from a place eight miles from the City of Dublin as Deputy Cole has to pay for one which he sends from Cavan to the City of Dublin, or as the Minister for Fisheries has to pay for sending a letter from the town of Tralee to the City of Dublin.  That is absolutely unjust and inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the loss on parcels, no doubt <Col N="260" /> a person who only receives a parcel will be aggrieved to have to pay, but he is no more aggrieved than I am at having to pay 2d. on a letter for eight miles, while for the same amount a letter can be sent from the farthest part of Tirconaill to Dublin.  His Ministry is essentially an unjust one, because he cannot possibly make every charge he levies equitable.  As regards the question of the Irish wholesaler, for whom the Minister speaks with such sympathy, I do not know whether he has enquired into the matter, but if he has he will find there are certain ranges of commerce in which the number of articles required is so enormous that no Irish wholesaler can afford to sink the capital necessary to enable him to stock every branch and quality that may be required.  Take the case Deputy Cole spoke of&mdash;drugs.  That trade covers an enormous range of things that deteriorate very much when kept for any length of time.</P>
    <P>No Irish wholesaler could afford to stock every kind and sort of drug on the chance that it might be required. For articles of this kind, London is not merely the wholesale mart of the British Isles, but of a very large portion of the civilised world.  Buyers go to London, not merely from Great Britain and the Saorstát, but from all over the world.  Therefore, it is possible for the wholesaler in London to keep a much greater range and variety of drugs than the wholesaler in Dublin could afford to do.  You can never succeed in changing that, but what you may do is to cast a burden on the Dublin wholesaler of writing and getting these drugs in a hurry&mdash;and drugs are usually required in a hurry&mdash;and of paying the tax upon them.  That is the situation the Minister's policy creates, and it is not surprising that the Dublin wholesaler protests against it.</P>
    <P>I now come to the case of the Irish manufacturer, to which I referred briefly on Wednesday.  There is in my constituency a factory which manufactures stockings.  It competes outside the Saorstát with stockings manufactured in Nottingham and Leicester&mdash;and competes successfully on the whole.  These stockings are manufactured on machines made in the British <Col N="261" /> Isles.  The machines are composed of an enormous number of component parts, needles and other parts, the technical names of which I cannot recall at the moment.  The needles and other parts are constantly breaking, and, of course, when they break they have to be replaced in a hurry.  They have to be replaced by parts made in the British Isles, because there is no firm in the Saorstát making stocking machines.  Consequently they have to be replaced by parcels' post, and for every needle, for want of which the machine may be thrown out of action and a man out of employment, the proprietor has to pay an extra 6d., though the intrinsic cost of the needle may be little more than that.  That is a practical instance I desire to give.  I would be glad if the Minister would come with me to see the factory, and study the matter for himself.  I repeat that that is a practical instance of how this tax is hitting industry, and a practical instance of why it should not have been imposed without more consideration and more deliberation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a statement he made on 21st July last.  I never imputed any bad faith to the Minister when I moved this resolution.  I said he was acting within his powers, as he had a right to do.  I did not attack his good faith, but only his judgment. Now he comes here and says he made this statement on the 21st July.  I ask Deputies to carry their minds back to the 21st July.  On that date we were on the final stages of a very trying session, sitting every evening until 10.30, and utterly unable to comprehend all the aspects of any statement that was put before us.  There was no opportunity of moving an amendment and no opportunity of definitely challenging this issue.  I cannot accept the mere mention of a speech on the 21st July, two days before we rose at the end of the session, as sufficient justification for taking a step of this magnitude, a step which is not only a measure of taxation, but a measure of protective policy, because that is how the Minister has justified it to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There are three points on which I wanted to get information.  On one I have made a discovery.  I wanted to <Col N="262" /> know what was the loss on the old system. The Minister says it was £50,000. The next thing I want to know is: what is the cost of collection of this charge? The Minister suggested to us that it was trivial.  I find that rather hard to believe.  All over the country there are postmen going out every day collecting varying sums of 6d., 2/6 and perhaps 5/-.  They collect these sums and hand them in at the Post Office.  Does not that, I ask, involve a considerable amount of accountancy, and will not the accountancy involve a great deal of auditing?  Looking at that from the point of view of an ordinary business proposition, it seems to me that the constant collection of small sums of money is not a really economical method of doing business.  I would like, if possible, to know before the debate closes, what this tax is supposed to bring in: what is the estimated yield of it?  Is it going to be £50,000 a year, or is it going to be half of that sum?  That is the kind of information we ought to have had before the charge was imposed at all.</P>
    <P>There were some references made by the Minister for Finance the other night to the fact&mdash;and I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred to it to-day&mdash;that as a result of this charge reductions have been made in parcel post rates.  Deputy Heffernan quoted figures as to the number of people who would prefer to have the old parcels' post rates and no 6d. delivery charge.  These, mind you, are for the most part Dublin firms, firms who, if there was anything in the Minister's expressed policy, would benefit by the tax.  They say they do not want it.  As a matter of fact, any firm which is doing a reciprocal business across the Channel, sending parcels back and receiving them, sending goods out and receiving empties, or even a private individual who gets books from a library across the Channel because the books he requires cannot be procured in the Saorstát, loses 3d. on every parcel.  He saves, approximately, 3d. under the new parcels' rate, but he has to pay 6d. under the new delivery charge rate.  The Minister can hardly expect us to be grateful for a concession that <Col N="263" /> costs us 3d. on every parcel.  I would suggest, if the Minister wishes to realise his desire of saving money on the parcels' post, that he might consider some alternative as regards the method of delivery.  The Minister for Finance the other night said that parcels cost far more to deliver than to collect.  Of course they do.  If I have a parcel to send away I take it to the Post Office myself, but if there is a parcel to be delivered to me it is brought to my house by the postman.  Would it not be possible, I ask, in the case of the delivery of parcels, to have a notification sent by the Post Office when the postman is delivering the morning letters to the effect that there was a parcel in the Post Office to be called for. People could then call for their parcels, if by doing so it would be possible to reduce the delivery rates.  I believe that on the whole such a system as that would be welcomed by the public.  I merely throw out that suggestion to the Minister because I do not want to be unhelpful.  I realise the Minister's desire to reduce the present high cost of his Department, and I feel that the suggestion I have made might be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>As regards this charge, it has been justified to us as a tax, as a measure of policy and not merely as a method of redressing an unfavourable postal balance.  As a tax it violates every canon of political economy.  The essentials of a tax are that it should, as far as possible, be imperceptible, that it should be collected without being felt. The Minister for Finance apparently does not agree with that.  But that is the idea.  I do not say that the Minister for Finance achieves that, but it should be collected either on something that the consumer does not know he is paying on, or at any rate it should be collected at comparatively infrequent intervals.  A tax that you feel every day and every time that you get a parcel&mdash;perhaps once a week or once a month&mdash;a tax that is constantly coming on you unexpectedly and makes you put your hand in your pocket for 6d., is one of the most inconvenient and annoying forms of taxation that can possibly be imposed.  People should <Col N="264" /> have some regard to psychology in these matters, even when responsible for taxation.  I question whether income tax would be felt so severely if it were not for the forms that people have to fill up.  The more you annoy the taxpayer, the more irksome the tax is, the more it is felt.  The tax, for instance, on tobacco is very little felt, because the taxpayer pays without knowing it. I assert that this tax makes for discontent amongst a very large section of the community and that it is therefore an evil and a wrong one.  It is also the greatest barrier that has been created in recent years against unity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Every trader in Northern Ireland who is accustomed to getting goods by post from Great Britain will feel that it is an obstacle to his coming into the Saorstát.  I do not wish at the present time to emphasise that point, but it is a point that should not be overlooked. There is a limit to which taxation can be carried.  There is a danger that alone comes from the abstract point of view, taking up the detached point of view of the financial official, that taxation on an overwhelming scale may be imposed with disastrous results.  As I look into the future I seem to see a graveyard in which there are two headstones. On one is engraved the words: &ldquo;Irish commerce, Killed by Taxation,&rdquo; and side by side with that is another bearing the words &ldquo;The Cosgrave Government, Ditto, Ditto, Ditto.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment moved by Deputy Heffernan but not for the reasons that govern his own particular decision.  Deputy Heffernan's mind is definitely against what has been put forward as an essential argument in favour of this particular impost, whether it be considered as a charge by the Post Office or whether it be defended as a tax.  That is to say, he is against anything that is definitely protective.  I am not against anything that is definitely protective.  I do not like the word &ldquo;Protection&rdquo; as a fiscal description, but I do say that any form of tax that is adopted should be adopted with a view to giving the greatest possible amount of protective <Col N="265" /> benefits to this country that is consonant with its revenue-yielding properties. I am not opposed to that, but I am particularly opposed to this duty, and therefore I am supporting the amendment, because I think it has failed to do the very thing it set out to do, and that it has brought more injury than it has conferred benefit. Deputy Cooper referred to the principles of what are good and bad taxation. There is surely one principle of good taxation, that it should define for itself exactly what it wants to achieve, and that it should go directly to the achievement of that purpose.  This tax is not doing anything of the sort.  It is intended to do certain things; it is intended to confer a benefit on the Irish distributor and wholesaler.  Does it achieve that intention?  When Deputy Heffernan referred to this paper that has been circulated on behalf of the Mercantile Association, what did the Minister for Posts say in response?  He said that &ldquo;the people in the Mercantile Association&rdquo;&mdash;I am now quoting his words&mdash;&ldquo;were not the whole Irish community.&rdquo;  Agreed that they are not the whole Irish community, but they are that section of the community that the tax was intended to benefit, and the very people whose benefit was sought are the very people who now say that they do not believe any benefit is to be conferred on them by this tax. That is the chief merit and the outstanding value of this circular.  I am not saying&mdash;I do not think that it would be true to say, and I imagine that nobody is suggesting in this circular&mdash;that this tax is not giving a certain amount of benefit.  Of course it is giving a certain amount of benefit; I am not disputing that for a moment, but I suggest that the tax has done as much harm as benefit and that it is not discriminating enough in its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of books has been mentioned. It was argued here the other night.  I know that the majority of publishers, whether in Ireland or in England, when sending out books, prefer to send them out by the ordinary parcel post.  The majority of the books sent out in that way are handled by parcel post, and out of a hundred parcels of books which have been received <Col N="266" /> in Dublin this morning I venture to say that 98 or 99 are received by parcel post and not by book post. I gave the case the other day of books I received on that day, costing two and sixpence, with sixpence added.  As I said, that charge was not very considerable, but what does it amount to?  It amounts to twenty per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty on an article that was not intended to be taxed, because there was no publisher publishing that particular type of book in the Free State.  Take the case that was mentioned by Deputy Cole to-day.  Was it intended that that particular article should be taxed? Was it intended that any person manufacturing or distributing that article here would be benefited by that article being taxed?  Not a bit of it.  One could run down the whole range.  It would be very interesting to have set out the entire range of articles sent by parcel post&mdash;the Minister for Posts could very easily do it&mdash;all the different articles passing through the parcel post and declared, within one week, and I make this proviso, without seeing the list, that seventy-five per cent. of those articles are articles that are not manufactured&mdash;at least well over fifty per cent.&mdash;and probably the greater part of them would be articles the equivalent of which are not manufactured in the Free State at all.  Therefore, no benefit is conferred on the Irish manufacturer.  Therefore, in order to achieve a small benefit amounting to not more than twenty per cent. or twenty-five per cent., 75 or 80 per cent. of harm is done, and I say that any tax that only achieves so small a benefit in relation to so large an inconvenience and damage, must necessarily be a bad form of taxation.  A case was given to me of a lady who went into a Dublin shop to order a certain unusual colour of paint that she required.  There are unusual colours, I suppose; there are unusual hues, and patterns and forms, but she wanted this particular colour, and the shopkeeper said that he did not stock it; that there were not enough artists in this country to use that particular paint.  I really fail to see exactly where the humour is.  That particular commodity was not stocked, and the reply was made that it would not be stocked, that when it was <Col N="267" /> wanted, that particular article, not manufactured in Ireland at all, would be got by parcel post from the manufacturer in England, or France, or wherever it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a demand, but the demand was not of sufficient extent or sufficiently large, and we do know, and it is a matter of common knowledge, that there are many articles that are required from time to time by consumers in Dublin that are not stocked by Dublin shops in the ordinary way.  Many of these cannot be got in Ireland.  Many of them have to be got from British manufacturers, and in every case was it intended that the sixpenny tax should have a protective influence in that respect, because there was nothing whatever to protect?  What actually happened is that on what might not amount to more than two or three shillings an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 6d. was imposed.  I suggest that never was the intention either of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Posts. They never came to the Dáil and so their intentions in the matter cannot be discovered; but it is not the intention of those two Ministers that an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of varying degree should be charged on a large number of commodities that are not manufactured in Ireland in the first place, and in the ordinary normal course of business are not and will not be stocked in Ireland and where, therefore, special application will have to be made to the manufacturer in some other country, and where, therefore, a particular duty will have to be imposed on the receipt of that particular commodity by the person purchasing it in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was not the intention, I suggest. The intention was something else.  I recognise the intention, and I <Col N="268" /> would myself favour some form of imposition that would deal specifically with that one intention and achieve it; I would be prepared to support it in the Dáil.  The intention, I take it, is this, that where the article is manufactured in Ireland and is stocked by a shopkeeper in Ireland, and can be got from that manufacturer or that shopkeeper at something corresponding to the price that would be paid if it were got by parcel post from England, that that parcel should be purchased by the Irish consumer at the Irish shop or from the Irish manufacturer.  That is the intention.  That is an admirable intention, but I suggest the tax goes a very great deal further.  I do not deny that it might confer some part of the benefit intended, but I also see, and I think the concern that it has created amongst a large number of people goes to prove, that in addition to doing that it is doing a lot of harm; it is proving a considerable amount of irritation, and that is not accompanied by any adequate of benefit.  I think it is a bad form of taxation, that it is intended to be protective and is not protective.  I remember an argument that was used by the Minister for Agriculture.  He was arguing in another debate raised by Deputy Milroy against Protection, and he said that under a protective scale of tariffs the consumer would inevitably pay more.  I do not believe that that is a correct statement, but here anyhow is a case where the consumer must pay more.  In every case the impost is passed on to the consumer, who pays more, and the people who pass it on are the people who, according to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts, were to be benefited by this tax.  The people who belong to the Mercantile Association and the Chambers of Commerce were the people to be benefited, and they are the people who say that they do not like it.  Surely, that of itself is a condemnation of that tax.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan said this particular charge should not have been imposed by warrant, that it should have been imposed in some other way.

The Oireachtas then has an opportunity of pronouncing upon it.  If the Oireachtas denounces any warrant, it must be withdrawn or altered to meet requirements. The practice in Great Britain &mdash;and we have taken over the British law&mdash;so far as I can discover has been that warrants have not been laid before Parliament any great length of time before they came into operation.  In 1915 a very important warrant was issued increasing postal charges, making the first war increase.  The warrant was made on the 30th October, and it came into effect on the 1st November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister for Finance permit me to ask a question on that head?  Is it not the fact that before that warrant was issued, the particular change was justified in the Finance Act of that year? I think you will find that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.  In any case there are hundreds of other warrants, and the usual thing so far as I can discover is, that if the change is of importance it is notified generally in the Budget statement: for instance, in Great Britain to the House of Commons.  Then the warrant is made and laid on the Table, and the House can take action on the warrant either by way of taking no notice and so approving, or of calling for revision or withdrawal of the warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that this matter was distinctly in the air.  It was mentioned by me, and I regret the <Col N="270" /> misunderstanding that occurred in connection with the undertaking which I gave and which, as I told Deputy Cooper the other day, was not, unfortunately, couched in the explicit language that it should have been.  If it had been couched in explicit language the misunderstanding would not occur. But it was mentioned specifically by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I presume, when his estimates were before the Dáil.  It now comes before the Dáil.  It is now laid on the Table. The Dáil can take any action on it now in precisely the same way that they could have taken action if the warrant had been laid on the Table before it came into effect.  Any action or any line that the Dáil wishes to take is in no way prejudiced by the lapse of a few weeks during which the warrant has been in operation.  Indeed anybody who cares to oppose it, can now get ammunition and support from a number of people in the country that he certainly would not have got if the warrant had been laid on the Table before it came into operation, so that I think there is no just cause of complaint in that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cole referred to a great number of matters, but I do not think many of them had anything to do with the postal delivery charge.  He talked a good deal about Border traders and about traders in Clones.  I was speaking to a small trader in Clones, and what he said to me was: &ldquo;So far as I am concerned the postal delivery charge and the statistical tax are a d&mdash;&mdash; nuisance, but I think they are good for the country, and I hope they will be continued.&rdquo;  It is entirely misleading to refer to this delivery fee as a tax.  There is no profit being made in dealing with these parcels even at the increased rate.  Nothing more is being exacted from the public than meets the cost.  It is entirely wrong to speak about a tariff necessary for performing a service as a tax.  It is in no sense a tax.  It might be regarded as a tax if although service was given, the amount of the fee was greater than what was necessary to meet the cost.  Roughly, the delivery fee will bring in £60,000 a year.  The loss caused by the reduction of the charges on parcels in the Saorstát <Col N="271" /> will be about £40,000.  The Exchequer gains about £20,000 a year, but there is still a loss on the parcel post business, and the reference to this matter as a tax is simply attempting to prejudice the issue by use of words.  I do not think that we can deal with this matter on the terms of the hard cases and the exceptional parcels.  Deputy Figgis has referred to the lady who sent for cosmetics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few cosmetics coming in.  Seventy-five per cent. of the parcels are soft goods or drapery, as they are called.  Those other cases are entirely exceptional. I cannot say&mdash;perhaps the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may say&mdash;what percentage of the parcels is the sort of goods that are produced here or that could be stocked here in as large quantities as in London.  Ninety-eight per cent. of the parcels are of that description, and all the talk we have refers to 2 per cent. of the parcels of the country.  I do not think we can deal with a matter of this kind on the basis of suiting the needs of 2 per cent. of the people who are getting parcels in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan talks of increasing the number of distributors.  It does not matter if the people here have to support the distributors.  It is no better for them that the distributors should be in London rather than here. If we bring the distributors here, we get the employment that there is on the other side of the Channel at present, and that is an advantage to the country.  I have no doubt there is an enormous quantity of retail trade done in the country, without any advantage to the purchasers.  People who advertise in cross-Channel newspapers, with a large circulation, have an advantage over people who do their business only on this side of the water.  We know that there are cross-Channel newspapers with a big circulation here, and the result is that there is an enormous <Col N="272" /> parcel post trade done which is of no real benefit to the purchasers.  They could do it as well here.  It is undesirable also that you should have a big section of your distributing trade done in that way.  It interferes with the efficiency of the shops on this side. Deputies may have compared a town at a great distance from a big city with a town close to it.  The town close to the big city has inferior arrangements for distribution, and a shop at a distance will be able to serve you much better.  If a considerable amount of trade is done with English retailers it reduces the standard of retailing in this country and tends to make the service dearer for those who do not do their trade by parcel post.  I think the commercial advantages are all in favour of those who try to change the present system.  There is far too great a number of people in the commercial community whose idea of carrying on the work of the Saorstát is that the setting up of it should make no difference. We find great difficulties here, but we have said, and I believe, the reason this country is backward is because the system of government, the laws enforced, and the system of taxation were not designed to suit this country. One of the reasons why the struggle for freedom was made was to enable us to make changes to go ahead.  There are too many people who think we should go along in the old rut and that now, having got our freedom, we should not attempt to use it.</P>
    <P>That is not my point of view.  I think we must in some cases experiment and change, and try to lift the country out of the rut.  The sort of mind that exists, thinking there is no good administration or government except in imitating what is done on the other side and continuing the state of affairs that existed here, is entirely wrong.</P>

I think that is the first right of freedom.  If we do not exercise that, there is no use in getting self-government.

      <P>I have been listening to this debate with mixed feelings.  I have been listening to Deputy Cooper referring to the very important fact that this tax would not help Irish industry.  Reference was also made to the stocking industry, where the people interested forgot to get a supply of needles.  If they have to send for a needle when it breaks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They keep a supply of needles, but to keep a supply of every size and range would involve too much capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that in the case of anyone who has machinery, the important parts of which are breakable, such as needles, the least that person could do would be to take in a supply, so that the factory would be kept going and so that there would not be any break in the work.  As to the people who are getting those parcels on which 6d. is charged, I know that it is not to the working people they are going.  I know that the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; is coming to this country and that certain people who read it try where they are going to get bargains.  I am afraid <Col N="275" /> those parcels are going largely to people who do not employ labour. They are not going to working farmers of the type of Deputy Wilson or others.  I think it is quite possible that the Government will soon be asked to subsidise the farmers of the country so that they may carry on their business and live.  It will be necessary to subsidise them, and Deputy Heffernan will find that it will be necessary to subsidise those who are not barley growers.  It is certainly not for us to charge to Revenue £40,000, £50,000 or £60,000 that the delivery of these parcels involves, so that English manufacturers can get their parcels into Ireland. Why should the produce of English factories be sent to this country, unless those who want them will pay for them?  The Post Office cannot deliver those parcels free.  The expense has to be met out of revenue.  Deputy Heffernan referred to mementoes and tokens that are sent at Christmas time, and that come from outside the country.  I can assure Deputy Heffernan that some of the most beautiful and artistic mementoes can at present be manufactured in the West of Ireland and that they are being sent to London, and even to France.  As such things can be got at home, there is no necessity at Christmas time to import mementoes from England.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that <Col N="276" /> the time might come when that could be done and that we might get our Northern friends, to whom reference was made, to come in.  I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is justified in this matter and that we should not be asked to pay specially for the delivery of parcels from across the Channel.  To do so would be, practically, subsidising workers across the water, in many instances, to the injury, perhaps, of workers in this country. The cost should certainly not be charged to revenue nor to the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently the Minister for Justice said that there was reason in everything, but somehow I am afraid he overlooked his colleagues on the ministerial benches.  It is true that reason is very desirable in legislation but I realise that it is not a need or an essential.  Whilst listening to the speeches of the Postmaster-General, the Minister for Finance, and Deputy D'Alton one is only too painfully conscious of the weak and flimsy defence which they put forward for this charge of 6d.  The Postmaster-General&mdash;I was going to say Deputy Walsh, but perhaps I was only anticipating time&mdash;said that the proper time for discussing this tax was on the 21st July.  Surely the Minister is blessed with a conveniently short memory. Surely he must have known that the Dáil at that time was working at full pressure, that all the time had been allocated by the Government, and that there was no possibility of referring at extreme length to this tax.  What would have been the use of discussing it?  The Government had a mute and passive majority behind it, and you had an unenlightened people who did not take sufficient interest in their own concerns.  I believe that it was best to wait until the incidence of the tax was felt and until the volume of public condemnation had grown, to attack the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the defence fell under two headings, none of which was in any way substantial and did not carry conviction.  I believe that the idea of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is to repair <Col N="277" /> and make good a certain loss on postal packets, and he said that three millions of parcels were coming into the country by post from Great Britain and only one million going out from here and that that entailed a very serious loss of revenue.  He says in addition that we had to reduce the postage rate in Ireland by 3d. in order to equalise with Great Britain.  I submit that that 3d. goes to the benefit of the people here, to the retail houses having a distributive trade by post, that it goes to their advantage, and that they are benefiting to the extent of another 6d.  The Minister's idea seems to be to discourage the use of the parcel post from Great Britain.  It is what he would consider an equilibrium, but, taking it from the right point of view, he gets so much for each parcel delivered and he has overhead charges which he cannot reduce.  I am not aware that even the presence of a surplus on our side of two million parcels throws extra or undue work on the postal service because the postal service is for the benefit of the community and you cannot reduce it below a certain limit.  You cannot deplete the staff.  It is not economic to do so.  The staff has to be maintained no matter how much or little it has to do.</P>
    <P>By some perversion of economic instinct the Minister endeavoured to reduce this traffic.  Remember, the Post Office is a cash institution.  It is a carrying company, and the cry of carrying companies is that they want more and more traffic, but the Minister says he does not need it.  I am not surprised that the Post Office is being run at a loss while we are doing things to irritate the public so that they rather refrain from using the post. The Minister also was inclined to attack the officials of the Chamber of Commerce, suggesting that they did not represent the views of the people in condemning this 6d. tax.  He said in effect that they should wait and see how the thing worked.  It is quite possible that some Deputy would put up something here in the nature of a strong case for a reduction of wages. I wonder would Deputy Johnson wait until the reductions took place and the <Col N="278" /> effects were visible?  Would he wait until this thing was condemned and the results demonstrated?  His intuition would at once force him to stand out against it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, those officials in the Chamber of Commerce protested, and they acted rightly in protesting against the imposition of this 6d. tax.  I hope that the fallacy of saving the Post Office is disposed of.  It is the people here, your own citizens, whom you are taxing.  The distributing houses in Great Britain do not pay this tax.  It is put on here and collected at the threshold of the consumer.  The position seems to be that we are like the dog in the fable who was fed with a chop from his own tail; it was not good for the dog and it destroyed the tail.  I think I have the word of the Minister for Finance for it, that the goods coming through the parcel post from Great Britain are largely articles of apparel.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that a 6d. tax on an article of clothing is a protection to Irish industry? It can be no such thing.  For instance, does the Minister for Finance suggest that a tax of 6d. on an overcoat valued at £5, is a protection to Irish industry?  I am really ashamed at such an argument being put up.  The question was raised of subsidising England. I fail to see that we are subsidising England in this.  After all, it is only a readjustment of burdens; it is only taking money from one pocket and putting it into another, or rather, it is taking it out of the pockets of everyone in this matter.  Deputy D'Alton wanted to suggest that the Farmers' Party were standing in their own light. No such thing.  We want something like fair competition.  I do not think the State has a right to put any distributive business here in a favoured position, and to give a monopoly to them of trade and let them charge more or less what they like.  That would be preposterous. I feel strongly on this, and I will vote for Deputy Heffernan's amendment.</P>
