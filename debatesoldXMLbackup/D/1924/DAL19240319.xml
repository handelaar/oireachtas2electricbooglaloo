      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he received during the last nine months any representations from the Ministry of Defence as to the necessity for providing schemes of employment for demobilised men; if such representations were made, what were the dates and nature of such representations, and what steps were taken by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to comply with such requisitions from the Ministry of Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>, replying: The Ministry of Industry and Commerce does not receive requisitions from the Ministry of Defence as to the provision of employment.  The Executive Council has considered from time to time proposals for absorbing demobilised officers and men into employment, and the following measures have been adopted with that object&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Preference is given to demobilised soldiers for temporary employment in all Government Departments, and for posts as messengers, caretakers, park-keepers, and similar occupations.</P>
      <P>2.  A percentage of appointments in the public service filled by competitive examination has been reserved for demobilised soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> 3.  Preference is given in the placing of Government contracts to firms employing demobilised soldiers.</P>
    <P>4.  Appeals have been published and have been circulated to public bodies and private employers requesting that demobilised men who left employment to join the Army be reinstated, and that preference be given to demobilised men in filling new vacancies on their staffs.</P>
    <P>5.  It is a condition of the large grants that are being made available for road work that preference be given to demobilised men. The same condition will apply to any other works carried out with public funds.</P>
    <P>A Resettlement Section has been established in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce which, in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, has the special duty of endeavouring to secure employment for demobilised officers and men.  Through the agency of this Section, employment has been found for over 2,000 men since demobilisation began.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware that a large number of employers in the City of Dublin, including some public boards, have refused to reinstate demobbed men who left their employment to answer the call to arms some time ago; and will he take some steps to make a special appeal to these employers to have these men taken back to their employment?</P>

    <P>The figures include men, women, boys and girls.  The amount paid in benefit through the Dublin Exchange for the week ended 14th March, 1924, was £5,300, and the average amount paid in each of the seven weeks ending on 14th March was £5,200.  The steps taken or to be taken for the relief of unemployment generally were explained by the President in his statement in the Dáil on the 14th December last.  Particulars of the special steps taken in respect of demobilised men have been given in the answer to the previous question by the Deputy.  As the Deputy was informed in reply to his questions on 14th November and 11th December, the City of Dublin shares in the general arrangements made for the relief of unemployment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why a claim for Unemployment Insurance Benefit in respect of Joseph Moroney, Cornmarket, Ennis, has been rejected by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>, replying: Joseph Moroney, Cornmarket, Ennis, lodged a claim for Unemployment Insurance Benefit at Ennis on the 22nd January, 1924.  As he had no previous account with the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and as no contributions had been paid on his behalf at any time, his claim was disallowed under Section 7 (1) (i) and 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  It was, however, ascertained <Col N="2108" /> that he had been in employment that was insurable, and steps are being taken to recover from his then employer the contributions that should have been paid to him.  It is open to Mr. Moroney to take civil proceedings against the employer under Section 24 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.</P>

      <NameTxt>SEAN O LAIDHIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that employees of the Athlone Woollen Mills, who only work every alternative week, have been refused unemployment benefit at the local Labour Exchange, and, further, whether he is aware that workers obtaining one day's work in any week have also been refused benefit at this Exchange, and if he will state generally the position of such persons under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>, replying: For some time a section of the employees engaged at the Athlone Woollen Mills have been working on short-time arrangements by which they are employed five days out of each fortnight.  These workers therefore are unemployed for periods of seven days continuously, separated by less than one week's employment. They therefore satisfy the rule that &ldquo;two periods of unemployment of not less than six days separated by an interval of not more than six weeks are treated as a continuous period of unemployment.&rdquo; The Athlone Woollen Mill workers who are affected by the short-time working arrangements generally have qualified for the receipt of benefit during their spells of unemployment and they have been paid accordingly. In one case a worker's continuity of unemployment was broken by his working during the &ldquo;off&rdquo; period and he <Col N="2109" /> was therefore not qualified for benefit in respect of that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries if he will state if a trawler, S.S. Urie F.D., No. 163, was found illegally fishing in the prohibited area off the North Tirconaill coastline; whether such matter was reported to his Department in September last; if it is intended to institute a prosecution on this and similar reports from same area, and whether he will state the cause of delay in bringing these cases before the Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR FISHERIES (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>These two questions hang together, the only difference being that one is a general question and the other refers to a particular case.  I, therefore, propose to answer them both together.</P>
      <P>The steam trawler Urie F.D., 163, was reported by local fishermen to have been fishing illegally in the vicinity of the North Tirconaill coast on Tuesday, 10th July last.</P>
      <P>A <i>prima facie</i> case having been established, the papers were sent to the Chief State Solicitor on the 19th Aug. with a view to a prosecution.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, the same action will be taken on similar reports from any area, provided that the evidence forthcoming is sufficient to give a reasonable expectation of securing a conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am given to understand that the <Col N="2110" /> delay in bringing the case of the Urie and other similar cases before the Court is due to the fact that certain legal questions arising out of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann have not yet been settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that answer, I would like to ask is the Minister aware that unless cases of this kind are brought speedily, they are no deterrent, and in view of the fact that he stated more than two months ago that a number of cases of this kind were pending, will be try to expedite matters?</P>

      <P>Before we go into Committee on this Bill, I would like to indicate that the procedure adopted has been that a Bill was introduced, and read a second time, containing provisions for the amendment of Section 6 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act.  Now in Committee, it is proposed to amend Section 13 and Section 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Dáil go into Committee to consider the Third Stage of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill.  I am aware of the facts, as stated by you, A Chinn Chomhairle, but I think it is only a very technical matter, as the same Bill is being amended, and the amendment that I have put down to the title of the Bill, covers both these amendments, although these are perhaps outside the scope of the Bill as read a second time. I would ask Deputies, seeing that we have come to that point, to be a little liberal in construing the matter, because with their consent we would be able to take these two amendments on the Third Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendments are out of order, Deputies cannot take them.  This is much more than a technical point, as the Minister would discover if he brought in the Bill himself and somebody else brought in the amendments.  It is a very important point.  We had, for example, the Damage to Property Act, which contained a particular date after which no person could receive compensation under the Act, but in response to pressure from various quarters, the President, when Minister for Finance, brought in an amending Bill extending the date.  I think very grave objection would have been taken if, in Committee on the Bill to amend the date, various other amendments had been introduced. That would clearly have been outside the scope of the Bill as read a second time.  The procedure adopted in reference to these amendments is wholly wrong, but as there is a certain amount of urgency we may be able to arrive at some settlement of it.  The procedure adopted is clearly wrong.  If the Minister for Local Government were bringing in a Bill to amend the Electoral Act, for example, in regard to the machinery for conducting elections in University constituencies, I am sure he would make a good point <Col N="2127" /> of order against an amendment which was of much greater scope than anything concerning the machinery of, and elections for, University constituencies. That is the real issue, and it is a quite important one.</P>

      <P>I think it would be far better that the Minister should bring in a new Bill if he wants these two new Sections embodied.  I believe it is very desirable that we should keep something like order in these matters and learn that the passing of Acts of Parliament are serious matters.  I object to taking these new Sections on this Bill.  It was passed on the Second Reading on the assurances of the Minister that it was quite a formality, and we accepted that.  As a matter of fact, as far as I am concerned, I did not even go to the trouble of looking to see what the effect of the Bill was. That is a confession I make which I ought not to make.  I certainly did not take an interest in the two new Sections, because I do not think it is reasonable that new Sections, in such circumstances, should be introduced on Committee, and I would suggest to the Minister that if these two new Sections are important he had better bring in another Local Government (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, and call it Number 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move as an amendment to delete Section 4.  The Section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition to the persons now disqualified for serving on juries, any person who is not registered as a Dáil or Local Government elector shall be absolutely disqualified from serving on any jury, inquest, or inquiry whatsoever, and the names of such persons shall not be inserted in any jurors books or jurors lists.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the very sweeping character of this Section which, by the way, shows that any person who is not registered as an elector shall be absolutely disqualified from serving on any jury, inquest, or inquiry whatsoever, I think the words of the Section hardly convey what the Minister meant or what he says it meant.  But apart from that I submit it is very unwise to put this temptation in the way of citizens to get themselves written off the electors' list and thereby to get themselves written off the jurors' list.  The Minister himself has said certain things appropriate to the situation when he referred to the unwillingness of electors to cast their votes.  Fifty per cent. or more of the electors in one constituency quite recently thought so little of their votes <Col N="2129" /> that they refused to record them. Probably the same experience will be repeated to-day.  Now if fifty per cent. of the electors are so careless about the rights of the franchise it is quite arguable that a very large proportion of these careless electors are also liable to jury service and if they can, by getting their names off the register of electors, also get their names off the jurors' list, as I said at an earlier stage, it is a very good bargain.  Many people care nothing about the right to vote. They might fight for the right to vote but when they get it they do not care whether they are on the list, or not, and if they are on the list, they do not exercise their right to vote.  Now we are asked to say that if a careless person disregards his right to vote and can find a way of getting his name struck off the electors' list he will, by that fact also, be cut off the jurors' list.  I am surprised that the Minister should bring forward such a proposition.  I would rather think the view of the Minister would be that if a person is not careful enough, or at least is not filled with sufficient sense of civic duty to exercise the vote, and to look after the securing of his vote, he would be punished by being compelled to serve on juries; but we are about here rewarding a man by eliminating him from the responsibility of serving on a jury if he also can find a way of getting his name off the electors' list.  If this Section is allowed to remain it seems to me that the necessary corollary should be that there should be a penalty imposed upon the officials responsible for putting names upon the register of qualified persons. We have not imposed such a penalty.  I think that Deputy McCarthy would be able to inform the Minister responsible that it is quite an easy thing to get one's name struck off the register and I am not prepared to agree that the mere failure to find the place upon the electors' register should not merely disqualify&mdash;because that is hardly the word to use in the circumstances&mdash;but excuse a person from serving as a juror.  One is amused to read this word &ldquo;disqualification&rdquo; as though it were an honour to be sought, Perhaps it ought to be, but in fact it is not.  People do not fall out with each other in order to be allowed <Col N="2130" /> to be put upon a jury.  But we tell the country that it is a disqualification that we impose on them unless they get their names put upon the register.  It is rather topsy-turvey, and I submit it ought not to be here in this Bill, and therefore I move the deletion of this Section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in seconding that amendment.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that one of the duties the Dáil should urge upon citizens to discharge is that of serving on juries, and that it ought to make difficult the task of those who would like to get rid of that duty.  This Section also, in my opinion, creates a state of affairs, in connection with the list of voters or of persons who should be on the register, that is not very desirable. As Deputies are aware at the moment that duty is very largely cast on the rate-collector to the local authority. The rate-collector, in discharge of that duty, applies to the householder or his representative for the names of the persons in the house who are entitled to be on the register.  We can all imagine that if the absence of names from the register releases people from the duty of attending as jurors, the register in future will be of a very limited and very unsatisfactory character.  That, to my mind, would be a very undesirable state of affairs, to say nothing at all of the condition that might be brought about by the efforts of some to get off that list who should be on it; so that, looking at the matter from all points of view, it should be the object of the House to delete such a clause as this, and on the other hand, to encourage all persons who should be on the jurors' list, and should serve as jurors, to discharge the duty attaching to citizenship.</P>

      <P>I do not quite follow Deputy Good in his objection. So far as I can see, the proposal in the Bill insists that jurors shall only consist of those who have sufficient public spirit to wish to exercise the franchise. The Deputy says that it is a very undesirable state of affairs, but I cannot see that that is the case.  I am not wholly convinced by Deputy Johnson's argument.  On a previous occasion in <Col N="2131" /> connection with the Punishment of Offences Bill, Deputy Johnson was somewhat sarcastic in connection with a speech made by Deputy Wolfe, because he said that the clause the Deputy was supporting was not supported by the argument he brought forward to support it.  I venture to think that Deputy Johnson is hoist to-day on his own petard.  His argument is a differentiation between those who are on the register and those who do not exercise the vote.  There I am not in agreement with him, but this is not the proposal before us.  If the Deputy said that everybody who is on the register and who does not vote should be liable to serve as a juror, and that such people should be the only people liable to juror's service, and that those who did not record their votes should be compelled to come into Court and discharge their duties as jurors, that I say would be a very desirable proposal, but it is not the proposal before us, which is a proposal to extend the disqualification from serving on juries to people who are disqualified by not being registered as a Dáil or Local Government elector. They are not a large number.</P>

      <P>If the Revising Barrister has a certain discretion and it is known that there is a widespread endeavour to avoid jury service, the Revising Barrister has a perfect right to dispose of them and say that they must be put on the list.  It is like the constitutional obligation that existed long ago in England on the part of the constituencies to their representatives. There was a constitutional obligation on the constituencies to support their representatives, but it was found that they could not be enforced because there were always people ambitious to sit in Parliament, and they said: &ldquo;If you return us we will not make you pay.&rdquo;  There is always a way out, and if it is once found that the jury is shrinking the Revising Barrister will naturally consider objections more carefully, and he will insist in compelling people to have the franchise, whether they want it or whether they do not.  I think the point is a minor point.</P>

      <P>When three such wise men as Deputy Johnson, Deputy Good and Deputy Cooper find themselves at variance on a question, it is clear that there is much to be said on both sides.  I have been listening to the discussion.  I confess that I cannot see or quite grasp the point raised by Deputy Johnson that it is really possible for an individual who is properly qualified to escape jury service. If the Deputy will follow me to the extent of reading Section 1, Sub-section 2, he will see&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the registration officer to include and identify in the prescribed manner in the electors lists to be prepared by him pursuant to the Electoral Act, 1923, the names of all persons in each registration unit in his registration area appearing to be qualified and liable to serve as special jurors or general jurors or to be disqualified or exempted from so serving.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A juror at present must be a rated occupier of premises of a certain valuation. The Deputy will agree that that is a fair description of the present qualification for jury service.  Rated occupiers of premises can scarcely <Col N="2133" /> escape getting their names on the register.  It will be the duty of the registration officer to mark those liable for jury service.  He will work from the valuation list, and he will mark rated occupiers as qualified to vote and liable to jury service.  That sums up the situation, as we see it departmentally, and we are not satisfied that it will be possible for any individual qualified for jury service to escape the duty of jury service.  I explained, speaking at an earlier stage of the Bill, that this Section is inserted as a precaution to cover a type of case which is not known to us to exist, namely, the case of a person who is qualified to to be a juror but is not qualified to be either a Dáil voter, a Seanad voter, or a Local Government voter.  If Deputy Johnson or any other Deputy knows of any such type of case, I shall be glad to hear it.  The fact is that unless there were a list of 100 or so cases in each county they would not be worth the trouble of making special provision for.  The scheme set out in the Bill is that the jurors list is made out from the electoral list, which should contain, and does contain, so far as we know, the name of every potential juror.</P>

      <P>I think between the Parliamentary Register and the Local Government Register it will be found that on one or other of these lists there is the name of every potential juror. The only effect of this Section is to make it quite clear to the Registration Officer that he is under no obligation to embark on a roving inquiry outside the electoral list in search of any case which may possibly exist but which if found to exist would not repay the trouble of the search.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Attorney-General <Col N="2134" /> was here he would probably explain that the words following on jury must be interpreted as <i>ejusdem generis</i> and therefore containing the same qualifications and disqualifications. An inquest there does not mean necessarily and does not mean in fact the ordinary Coroner's inquest, but there are such inquiries as sheriff's inquiries and so on which people with the jury qualification are called upon to act assessing damages and performing functions of that kind.</P>
      <P>The weight of the argument seems to be with the electoral lists, that neither the Parliamentary list nor the Local Government list is cast iron and that therefore it is not proper to take the jury list from one or other or both of these electoral lists.  There have been criticisms of the register, but in administration you must follow the maxim of taking that thing to be done which ought to be done.  You cannot legislate on the basis that in fact certain things which ought to be done properly ought to be done fully and so on are not being carried out in that way.  Theoretically the list of Parliamentary electors and the list of Local Government electors should exhaust the possibilities of persons liable for service on juries.  The Deputies, even those whose arguments tend the other way, will agree with me that in the abstract and theoretically the name of every person liable to serve on a jury should appear on one or other or both of these lists as a Dail voter, a Seanad voter or Local Government voter.  If that is granted then the case for the Bill, and in particular the case for this particular Section, is established.</P>

Under this Bill, he will answer me that wives are liable to serve, but wives can get off service on juries much more easily than the persons who ought to be the rated occupiers. If there was a desire in a great many cases to avoid service why should the Government come in and assist these people by giving them an opportunity for further disqualification?</P>

      <P>I would like to state, on Section 2, the result of the International Conference which caused us to postpone the further consideration of the Bill.  The Conference was held between representatives of the British, French, Dutch and Belgian Governments to consider the fixing of common dates for the beginning and ending of Summer Time.  It is understood the Conference has recommended that Summer Time for the present year should commence on the night of March 29th and end on the first Saturday in October.  The representative of the British Government found he could not agree to the commencing date, as legislation would be required before any alteration in the present date could be made in Great Britain, and it would have been impossible to pass any legislation for the purpose in the time which remained.  The same position exists here.  It is necessary to give due notice to railway and steamship companies, so that their time tables may be prepared and any changes in them made.  Furthermore, serious difficulties would be caused these companies by any difference between the Saorstát and Northern Ireland in the dates between which Summer Time operates.  As regards future years, the Conference recommended that Summer Time should come into force on the first Saturday in April and end on the first Saturday in October.  The proposals of the Conference have not so far been given definite effect to in any of the countries concerned, and it would be premature to make any changes in the ending date by legislation until it is clear if a common date will be adopted by the other countries. If such a common date be adopted, other than that fixed in the Bill for the termination of Summer Time, the Government will consider whether an <Col N="2137" /> amending Bill should be introduced later on.  That is, in substance, the net result of the International Conference that was held, and, as a result, there is no factor which causes us to make any alteration in the times fixed under Section 2 of this Bill.</P>

    <P>We hope to have this Report and the evidence printed and circulated before the 28th March.  I think it is advisable that the time be extended so that a complete statement of the position can be submitted to the Dáil.  For that reason I propose that this Report be now adopted and that the Committee be given until the 28th March next to complete its findings and have the evidence circulated.</P>

          </row>
          <row>
            <entry>
(i.)  Gurb iad amháin atá oiriúnach mar ionaid, agus ina bhfuil an minimum riachtanach de shlí istigh, agus atá ar fáil fé láthair no is féidir a chur ar fáil chun a sealbhuithe laistigh d'aimsir réasúnta agus gan costas as cuimse ná: Tigh Laighean, an tOspidéal Ríoga i gCill Mhaighneann, agus na príomh-fhoirgintí agus na foirgintí eile atá i gcearnóg Chlós Uachtarach Chaisleán Bhaile Atha Cliath.  Bheadh slí níos fairsinge agus níos caothúla san Ospidéal Ríoga agus i gCaisleán Bhaile Atha Chliath ná mar a bheadh i dTigh Laighean.  Ach mar gheall ar' a dheacracht do lucht gnótha agus do lucht gairme na Cathrach dul amach chun an Ospidéil Ríoga ní fhéadfadh an<Col N="2143" />Co-Choiste a mhola go ndéanfí rogha den ionad san.  Rud eile is deimhin leis an gCó-Choiste, sara mbeadh sé réasúnta oiriúnach chun a shealbhuithe, nár mhór £70,000 ar a luíod do chaitheamh leis an obair a bhainfadh le dul isteach ann agus le hatharuithe tigh-chreatlaigh, agus níor bh'fhéidir na hatharuithe sin do dhéanamh laistigh de thréimhse ba lú ná bliain agus is dócha nár mhór bliain go leith chuige.  Faid a beifí ag feitheamh mar sin do caithfí fanúint i dTigh Laighean agus dul fé n-a thuille costais nár bheag le rá chun an áit a dhéanamh oiriúnach do riachtanaisí an Oireachtais a bheadh ag dul i méid i gcaitheamh na tréimhse sin.  Ní raibh os a chomhair ag an gCó-Choiste an t-abhar as a bhféadfí a mheas cadí an tréimhse a chaithfidh imeacht sara mbeidh an buan-árus soláthruithe, ach ní gnó praiticiúil, dar leis an gCoiste, suim chó mór le £70,000 do chaitheamh agus moill chó fada do dhéanamh chun árus ná beadh ach sealadach do sholáthar, go mór mór o thárla go bhfuil an tOspidéal suidhte chó neachaothúil sin.</entry>
            <entry>
(i.)  That the only suitable sites, providing the necessary minimum of housing accommodation and at present available or capable of being made available for occupation within a reasonable time, and without prohibitive expenditure are: The Leinster House, the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, and the main and other buildings in the square of the Upper Yard of Dublin Castle.  Of these the Royal Hospital and Dublin Castle would supply housing accommodation of a more ample and convenient character than would Leinster House.  The Joint Committee cannot, however, recommend the selection of the Royal Hospital owing to the existing difficulties of access by<Col N="2144" />the business and professional life of the City.  Further the Joint Committee is satisfied that before it could be made reasonably fit for occupation an expenditure of not less than £70,000 would be required to defray the cost of migration and of structural alterations, which latter could not be carried out within a period of less than a year and probably of a year and a half.  During this waiting period the occupation of Leinster House would have to be continued and further expense of a substantial amount incurred in making it suitable for the increasing needs of the Oireachtas during the interval.  The Joint Committee had not the materials before it upon which to form an estimate of the period that must elapse before the permanent accommodation is provided, but the expenditure of such a large sum as £70,000, with the consequent delay to be incurred for the purpose merely of temporary accommodation, did not commend itself as a business proposition, more especially in view of the inconvenience of situation.</entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry>(ii.)  Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal áfach tá suidheamh an Chaisleáin go han-oiriúnach agus maran láithreach bonn, is go luath, d'fhéadfí dul isteach ann, agus ní bheadh an caitheamh rómhór.  Ach nior bhfoláir don ChóChoiste cuimhneamh go bhfuil sé ceaptha do sna Cúirteanna Bhreithiúntais cheana féin agus gur cuireadh iad isteach ann tar éis airgead do chaitheamh le hatharuithe agus le feistiú ba ghá agus, maran féidid áit oriúnach eile atá ar fáil do sholáthar dóibh, ní féidir don Chó-Choiste a mhola go ndéanfí rogha den Chaisleán.</entry>
            <entry>(ii.)  The Castle upon the other hand is excellently situated and capable of early if not immediate occupation while the expenditure would be comparatively small.  But the Joint Committee was confronted by the fact that it has already been allotted to the Courts of Justice and occupied by them after expenditure upon necessary alterations and equipment, and unless some other suitable and available location for the Courts can be obtained, the Joint Committee cannot recommend the selection of the Castle.</entry>

            <entry>
(iii.)  De bharr an dá áit sin do dhúna amach, nil fágtha ach Tigh Laighean. Is ró-léir don Chó-Choiste a neambúntáistí agus a nea-dhóthanaí atá sé fiú amháin mar árus sealadach ach is dó leo gur féidir luíodu maith a dhéanamh ar na nithe sin má tógtar na coda den bhfoirgint atá ar seilbh fós ag Cumann Ríoga Bhaile Atha Cliath, lasmuich de sna coda san a bhaineann leis an Saotharlann Radium.  Ar na coda a tógfí amlaidh bheadh dhá sheomra fhairsinge órnáidithe ar an gcéad úrlár agus dhá sheomra chó-réire ar an dara húrlár, seomraí ina mbeadh slí go leor i gcóir<Col N="2145" />suidheanna an tSeanaid, 'na bhfuil slí chó cumhang acu fé láthair, agus i gcóir na gCoistí a dheighleálann le Billí Príobháideacha.  Mar fhreagra ar iarratas ón gCó-Choiste tháinig buíon láidir toscairí o Chumann Ríoga Bhaile Atha Cliath go dtí ceann de sna cruinnithe, agus ba dheas uatha é, agus do chuireadar in úil go dian gurb é a dtuairim, tar éis triail na bliana atá caithte, gur chuaidh sé go mór chun dochair agus chun ceataí don Chumann an tOireachtas do bheith i seilbh agus dá leantí den tseilbh sin agus dá leathanuítí í gur mhór an chontabhairt do shéan an Chumainn é mara gcuireadh sé deire leis an gCumann. D'aontuigh an Có-Choiste go hiomlán leo nuair adubhradar gur éirigh roinnt céadta ball as an gCumann de bharr an ní sin ach is dó leo gurb iad riachtanaisí an tSaorstáit is mó le rá agus is ceart a bheith ar tosach, go mór mór ós deimhin leo gur féidir an cheataí agus an chailliúint airgid a bhain don Chumann cheana agus a bhainfidh dóibh fós do luíodú go mór tré árus sealadach do sholáthar dóibh in áit éigin eile agus cúiteamh airgid a thabhairt dóibh.  Na hoibreacha móra gnótha agus ceárdais atá ar siúl acu, le hoiread creidiúna dhóibh féin agus le hoiread sochair don tír, is ag Droichead na Dothra bhíd sin, san áit ina mbíd na Taisbeántaisí acu, ach is chun aoibhnis chuideachtanais do sna baill agus chun taisbeántaisí colaíochta agus ceoil is mó a húsáidtí Tigh Laighean.  Tháinig na Toscairí go dtí cruinniú eile den Chó-Choiste agus i dtéanta luighe ar na hagóidí a bhí curtha in úil cheana acu do shineádar isteach ráiteas ar a gcúis agus, ar a iarraidh sin dóibh, do chuir an Chó-Choiste an ráiteas san le n-a dtuarasgabháil mar fho-scríbhinn.  Sé tuairim an Chó-Choiste gur chóir gurb é gnó an Rialtais slí go leor do sholáthar i bhfoirgint éigin oiriúnach in aice le Tigh Laighean mar sheomraí léitheoireachta agus mar leabharlann iasachtach thiomchuir do bhaill Chumann Ríoga Bhaile Atha Cliath amháin no neachtar acu oiread airgid do sholáthar dóibh agus is gá chun a chur ar a gcumas árus sealadach mar sin do sholáthar dóibh féin. Níor dhearmhad an Có-Choiste go<Col N="2147" />dtiocfidh as nách mór iomlán Tighe Laighean a bheith tógtha suas ag an Oireachtas, fiú amháin go ceann tamaill, go gcaithfar tuille airgid a chaitheamh agus tuille maith mór, leis, i dteanta cúitimh do Chumann Ríoga Bhaile Atha Cliath, ach bíodh go mbeadh an costas iomlán geairid don mhéid a bhainfadh leis an Ospidéal Ríoga do chur in oiriúint bheadh an méid seo le rá fós i bhfabhar do rogha dhéanamh de Thigh Laighean, sé sin, nár ghá don Oireachtas aistriú as an áit ina bhfuil sé, agus bíodh go mbeadh an scéal cothrom eatorra maidir le nithe eile, tá Tigh Laighean i gceartlár na cathrach agus tugann san búntáise dho ar an áit eile.  Rud eile: tá na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí tagtha ina thaithí agus le corp taithí tá sé gan bheith ró-dheacair dóibh cur suas le pé nea-chaothúlacht a bhaineann leis.  Dá bhrí sin molann an Có-Choiste iomlán Tighe Laighean d'fháil agus do chimeád, ach amháin na coda atá luaidhte cheana, bíodh go bhfuil a fhios acu nách réiteach thar barr ar an bhfaidhb san ach réiteach atá dosheachanta agus an scéal mar atá sé. San am gcéanna tá súil ag an gCóChoiste, ar mhaithe leis an gCumann, go scarfar le seilbh Tighe Laighean chó luath agus is féidir é gan dochar do riachtanaisí an Oireachtas.</entry>
            <entry>
(iii.)  In the result, by the process of exclusion Leinster House alone remains.  The Joint Committee fully realises its disadvantages and inadequacy even as a temporary provision, but is of opinion that these can be materially modified if the portions of the building still in the possession of the Royal Dublin Society, save those devoted to the Radium Laboratory, were taken over.  The portions thus acquired would include two decorated and spacious rooms on the first floor and two corresponding rooms on the second floor which would afford suitable accommodation for the sittings of<Col N="2146" />the Seanad, which is so inadequately housed at present, and for the Committees dealing with Private Bills.  A very influential deputation from the Royal Dublin Society, in courteous response to a request of the Joint Committee, attended one of the meetings and were emphatic in the expression of their belief as the result of their experience of the last twelve months that the occupation by the Oireachtas had already caused serious loss and inconvenience to the Society and that the prolongation and extension of this occupation would be a dangerous menace to its welfare and possibly to its existence.  The Joint Committee quite accepted their assurance that it has already been responsible for the resignation of some hundreds of its members, but it regards the needs of the Free State as of prior and paramount importance, especially as it is satisfied that the inconvenience and financial loss to which already the Society has been and will in the future be subject can be materially mitigated by the provision of temporary accommodation elsewhere and by pecuniary compensation.  Its great business and industrial activities in which it has engaged with so much credit to itself and advantage to the country are mainly controlled and carried on at Ballsbridge where its Shows are also held, whereas Leinster House has been mainly used for catering to what may be described as the social amenities of its members and for the holding of scientific and musical demonstrations.  The Deputation attended a further meeting of the Committee and in addition to emphasising their previous objections handed in a detailed statement of their case which at their request the Joint Committee has inserted as an appendix to its report.  The Joint Committee is of opinion that it should be the business of the Government to find ample provision in some suitable building in the vicinity of Leinster House for reading rooms and a lending and circulating library for the exclusive use of the members of the Royal Dublin Society, or as an alternative that they should be supplied with the necessary funds to enable them to provide for themselves this temporary accommodation.  The Joint Committee has not forgotten that the<Col N="2148" />occupation practically of the whole of Leinster House, even for a temporary period, will involve substantial further outlay in addition to compensation to the Royal Dublin Society, but even if the total cost approximated to that involved in the adaptation of the Royal Hospital there would still remain in favour of the selection of Leinster House the fact that it involves no change in the existing location of the Oireachtas, and even if other considerations as between the two were evenly balanced the situation of Leinster House, in the heart of the City, weighs down the scales in its favour.  Further, the Deputies and Senators have got used to it, and familiarity has even bred some measure of toleration for its inconvenient surroundings.  The Joint Committee therefore recommends the acquisition and retention of the whole of Leinster House with the exception of the portion already mentioned, conscious that it is not an ideal solution but one that is inevitable under existing conditions.  At the same time the Joint Committee hopes that in the interests of the Society the occupation of Leinster House will be terminated at the earliest date, consistent with the needs of the Oireachtas.</entry>

            <entry>(iv.)  Mar bhuille scuir, ba mhaith leis an gCó-Choiste luighe ar an méid seo: o bhí ortha claoi go dian leis na tearmaí scóipe, le cúrsaí áruis shealadaigh amháin, níl aon bhaint ag na nithe atá ráite acu i dtaobh na n-ionad ndefriúil le cúrsaí buan-árus do sholáthar agus ní ceart leigint do sna nithe sin éinne do chlaona chun aon taoibh sna cúrsaí sin.</entry>
            <entry>(iv.)  In conclusion, the Joint Committee wishes to emphasise that as it was strictly confined by the terms of reference, to the question of temporary accommodation solely, the considerations it has urged in regard to the different sites have no bearing upon the question of permanent accommodation and should not be allowed to prejudice it in any respect.</entry>

    <P Just="Center">ROYAL DUBLIN SOCIETY.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OCCUPATION OF LEINSTER HOUSE BY DÁIL EIREANN.</P>
    <P>The Royal Dublin Society was established in the year 1731 for the promotion of Husbandry and other useful Arts and Sciences.</P>
    <P>It is the oldest body of its kind in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Museums, Botanic Gardens, National Library and Art School were founded far back in the eighteenth century by the Society, and through the watchful care of the Society, with its intimate knowledge of local requirements had been brought to a high state of efficiency.  This work was carried on by the Society with funds derived from members' subscriptions and donations, together with a surplus balance of successful Agricultural Shows held on the Lawn and Lands around Leinster House.</P>
    <P>In addition, Grants were made by the Treasury of from £5,000 to £10,000 annually to be expended in like manner.</P>
    <P>For many years prior to 1877 the Government had been urged to increase these Grants to enable the Society to extend the usefulness of the institutions named.  This, however, the Government declined to do, unless on the condition that the whole expenditure should be administered by a Department directly responsible to Parliament.</P>
    <P>The terms under which the Society would consent to this change were agreed upon, and the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act of August, 1877, ensued.  This Act transferred the lands and buildings of the Royal Dublin Society to the Government.  It also transferred the collections of the Society with certain exceptions.</P>
    <P>Both transfers were made for the purpose of the Act which purposes are by the Act declared to be:&mdash;To promote the study of Science, Art, and Literature in Ireland; to erect a Science and Art Museum; to establish a National Library; and to maintain the Royal Dublin Society in the exercise of its functions.</P>
    <P>The Society had expended £48,600 on the real part of the property to be transferred irrespective of the Collections, and in 1877 it was estimated that its value at the time of the passing of the Act had increased to £75,000.</P>
    <P>Of the £48,600, £47,700 had been expended by the Society out of its own funds on the purchase of Leinster House (£20,000), and the necessary additions and alterations from 1815 to 1877.</P>
    <P>The consideration given to the Society in 1877 for the land and collections named was a sum of £10,000, and, in the words of the Act of Parliament: &ldquo;Such other considerations as may be agreed upon or would accrue to the Society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What these &ldquo;other considerations&rdquo; were to be had already been settled in various interviews which took place between the then Chief Secretary for Ireland, the Secretary of the Treasury, and representatives of the Society.</P>
    <P>Briefly the principal ones were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Occupancy of Leinster House free of Rent, Rates and Taxes, and that a free and liberal consideration shall be accorded to the wants of the Society in this direction.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Society to be allowed to continue to hold its Agricultural Shows, etc., on the Lawn and Lands around the House.</P>
    <P>In order to effect the Agreement come to the Society's Representatives met in conference, Lord Sandon, representing the Educational Department, the Right Hon. W.H. Smith, M.P., the Treasury, and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Bart., the Irish Government.  The Society's delegates submitted that £75,000 was the estimated value of the Society's property proposed to be surrendered and claimed for the Society full compensation therefor; after which the Government submitted an outline of its proposal, which, with some modifications, was that subsequently agreed to, the grounds put forward by the Government being that all that was proposed was for the advancement and public advantage of Ireland, which should be encouraged by the Society <Col N="2151" /> and repeated assurances were throughout given by the Government representatives to the Society's delegates that the agreement which should be come to with the Society would, at all times, be construed and carried out in the most generous and liberal way towards the Society, that Government had no other desire or intention; upon the faith of which and in order that Ireland should not lose the great benefits so promised to be conferred on it by the proposed Act, the proposals were acceded to by the Society's delegates. Throughout these negotiations the Society was not represented by either a Parliamentary Agent, Counsel or Solicitor, which demonstrates the Society's desire to carry out in the spirit of what was best for Ireland rather than demanding its legal rights.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the transference of a portion of the Society's work and staff to the Government, the Society consented to receive temporarily an inconvenient amount of accommodation in Leinster House pending the erection of new buildings for the Science and Art Department contemplated by the Act. Relief was partly given in this direction on the completion of the Museum, etc., and further accommodation was promised when the erection of Government Administrative buildings in the vicinity were completed.  An additional room was granted to the Society by the Department in 1921.</P>
    <P>The Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1877, when the Act dealing with this subject was before Parliament was informed by the Council of the Society in response to his enquiry that &ldquo;the accommodation which the Society will require in Leinster House depends on the functions which it shall in future perform.  It is accordingly impossible to state the exact amount of accommodation which would suffice; but the Council are of opinion that it would be advisable to reserve for the use of the Society the whole of Leinster House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The spirit undoubtedly prevailing and since acted up to was to treat the Society with a liberality which its work and traditions deserved, especially as it had been freed from the control of a Government Department and as a voluntary <Col N="2152" /> institution unaided by State subsidies should be given that opportunity of carrying on its valuable work with greater energy, and that increased facilities for that work would be required by the time the Library and Museum Buildings, then in course of construction, were completed.</P>
    <P>In 1880 it was found advisable by the Government to recommend the discontinuance of the holding of the Society's Shows around the House as provided for in (b).  The Government offered an alternative site in Phoenix Park, together with a grant of £20,000.</P>
    <P>Ultimately it was agreed in consideration of the payment to the Society by the Government of £25,000 the Society should discontinue holding the Shows in Kildare Street, and with the grant the Society purchased a portion of the present Ballsbridge site and removed certain Halls from the vicinity of the House and re-erected same at Ballsbridge. One Hall was purchased from the Society by the Government for £1,000 and continues to be an annexe to the present Museum (Textile Exhibit).</P>
    <P>In 1897 the present Lecture Theatre and Laboratories were erected and furnished at a cost of approximately £15,000, towards which the Government contributed £5,000.  This building replaced a previous Lecture Theatre which had become totally inadequate for the growing demands of Members and the Public interested in the Society's Scientific and Educational work.</P>
    <P>At the time the Act of 1877 was passed the future of the Society was uncertain. Many anticipated that the loss of Government support would cause the Society to dwindle into insignificance, but the Council, recognising to the full the great asset it still retained in its headquarters, Leinster House, and the privileges accorded of occupying it free of Rent, Rates and Taxes, a very vital financial consideration, worked with an enthusiasm to provide an institution which would be recognised as worthy of support in the educational life of Ireland.  The reconstruction of its governing body providing for three sections, each with its recognised duties and responsibilities, has <Col N="2153" /> resulted in the Society becoming even stronger.  Its work to-day is unequalled by any other similar body and referred to throughout the world as a striking illustration of the country's practicability by the voluntary active service of the members of the Society's Council and Committees which is the means of producing such excellent results in the many spheres of its activities.</P>
    <P>This has been possible by Leinster House being the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; within and around which the Society has enhanced its reputation and Members have flocked to its support.</P>
    <P>When the late General Michael Collins, after inspecting the House among several others, expressed a desire to hold the first Provisional Government Assembly in the Lecture Theatre his wish was most readily complied with by the Society as a National necessity. General Collins generously acknowledged the offer and expressed the hope to the Society's Director that the great inconvenience caused to the Society would not exceed eight months. Nearly two years have now elapsed, and the present decentralisation is seriously affecting and jeopardising the work of the Society, apart from it incurring additional expenses (at present approximately £500) by the renting of Theatres, etc., and increased temporary staff rendered necessary in continuing the Society's usual operations.</P>
    <P>The Society's work and functions are now scattered between most unsatisfactory rooms in Molesworth Street (provided by the Office of Works), Leinster House, Royal College of Surgeons, Theatre Royal and Ballsbridge.</P>
    <P>Upwards of 650 old Members (representing an income of £1,400 a year) have resigned on account of the restricted privileges now available in <Col N="2154" /> Leinster House, and this wastage must continue unless the serious problem, from the Society's standpoint, is quickly solved.</P>
    <P>The Council therefore ask that the Theatre and various rooms occupied by the Government be returned to the Society by not later than the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>It is the considered opinion of the Council that if the present occupaney of Leinster House continues, the Society must necessarily become disintegrated. Members will not consent to the indefinite curtailment of their privileges, and the separate administration of the several branches of the Society's work must inevitably destroy the bond which has hitherto held the Society together and enabled it to do what it has done.</P>
    <P>The Council crave that the Government will grant the Society the earliest relief from its present unfortunate position.  It is not a mere private advantage for the Members of the Society which they now ask but those reasonable facilities on purely public grounds, and with the desire to promote the welfare of Ireland which has been the one actuating impulse of the Society during the nearly two centuries of its existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That it be referred to the Joint Committee appointed under Order 7 of the Standing Orders of the Dáil and Seanad relative to Private Business to report on the following proposed amendment of the said Standing Orders, viz., in Order 40, line 9, after the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; to insert <Col N="2156" /> the words &ldquo;or an Associate of the Royal College of Science, Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The existing Standing Orders debarred those who were only Associates of the College of Science from availing of advantages, such as signing Bills for prospective schemes in the Saorstát. Consequently, many young students are forced to go elsewhere for employment, because the Standing Order makes them ineligible for engineering appointments under the Government of the Saorstát. I note that the British Government have recognised the Associates of the College, and I understand that similar recognition is given in the Indian Office and in the Colonies generally.  I note that Deputy Cooper has tabled an amendment, and if the idea is to make the necessary change suggested in my motion, I have no objection to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put down the following amendment on behalf of the Committee:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; in line 1, and to substitute in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;Order No. 40 of the Standing Orders for Private Business be referred to the Joint Committee on Private Business to be reconsidered, and that the Joint Committee be requested to report any amendments therein which may be desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle's motion appeared on the Order Paper when the Joint Committee dealing with Private Bill procedure was sitting.  We took the motion into consideration, and we considered it would be very desirable that if Standing Order Number 40 were to be reconsidered it should not be merely a specific instruction to us to consider it in respect of one amendment only, but we should be entitled to reconsider the whole Standing Order, and make such recommendation as we thought desirable.  I would remind Deputy Doyle what the purpose of Standing Order 40 is.  The promotion of a Private Bill lays it within the power of the promoters to compel private individuals, corporations, and local authorities to go to a considerable amount of expense, and, therefore, it is necessary to insert a safeguard so that <Col N="2157" /> no Private Bill shall be promoted by what may be described as men of straw. It is necessary that they should be men of some standing and responsibility, and Standing Order 40 provides that their plans and specifications and estimates shall be drawn up by a competent person, and the definition of that competent person is set out in the Order.  All the qualifications set out there are recognised technical qualifications.  The Associateship of the College of Science is also a recognised qualification.  I do not want to give Deputy Doyle any pledge.  In the first place, I could not pledge the Committee, and in the second place I do not want to pledge that we will accept and include the College of Science.  We have had representations from it already on the subject, and they were carefully considered, and the general view was that these people ought to belong to a trade union organisation. Certainly that was the Labour view.  It is quite possible that a man might have his mere college experience, and might not have any practical work.  Our main interest is to get the highest possible technical qualifications.  In the interests of the public as a whole, who are liable to be put to very great expense by Private Bill legislation, we are obliged to get the highest qualifications possible. Therefore I would urge the Dáil to adopt the amendment, and to let the Joint Committee go into the whole Standing Orders.  The Committee can then consider and make whatever recommendations they think fit.  It would then be open to Deputy Doyle to move that our recommendations be not adopted.</P>
    <P>I think a more satisfactory result will be achieved by letting us reconsider the whole Standing Order, and formulating not only our recommendations but our reasons for the recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">

      <P>On general grounds I approve of this amendment. I do not think it is a proper thing to modify Standing Orders submitted to us by a Committee without first taking the view of the Standing Orders Committee.  I would not like to have <Col N="2158" /> it thought for a moment that I agree with what Deputy Cooper has said as to university qualifications not being really satisfactory qualification.  I sincerely hope that the Committee will not adopt the alternative course which he has suggested.  I think there is too great a tendency to belittle university qualification.  However, in supporting the motion, I wish to take this opportunity of expressing my disagreement with Deputy Cooper on that point.</P>

If you want alter a Standing Order it ought to go back to the Committee for reconsideration. But I am sorry to see that Deputy Cooper has joined the ranks of the Trade Unionists.  I am afraid that is a retrograde step for him.  His plea that the professions should copy the trade unions is, I am afraid, rather a retrograde step, too, because the professions leave it open here to pass your examination and become a member of the organisation, taking out your qualifications, whereas I think trade unions are working as close boroughs.  I am afraid you will not get into a trade union by competitive examination.  I only wish to express my sorrow at Deputy Cooper's reference to professional men in trade unions.</P>

      <P>On a point of procedure perhaps, rather than of order, I would like to say I feel a little doubtful about pursuing this subject at the moment if the Minister concerned is not available, and the President who has been doing his duty in this House is unable to be present because of illness. I feel that anything I have to say will be in a sense talking to the air or to the Reporters, and inasmuch as something I have to say can only be answered by the President himself, and not by the Minister for Local Government, unless he has made himself aware of the assurances and the promises made by the President, that the pursuance of this motion at this stage is <Col N="2160" /> perhaps not fitting&mdash;I will use that word.  I do not want to move the adjournment of the debate again, because it has been hanging fire too long.  I feel it is unfortunate that we should be discussing this matter which certainly is of some importance expressing the feelings on this side, without the presence of the Minister responsible, but if the House desires I shall go ahead.</P>

      <P>The absence of the Minister for Local Government is a very material factor, I take it, but I think that the President's name should scarcely be coupled with the matter. The Minister for Local Government is responsible under the Constitution exclusively to the Dáil, and the motion in Deputy Corish's name must therefore be held only to concern the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no need to be reminded of the position of the Minister for Local Government or the position of the President in this matter, and I shall try to keep the thing in the bounds of order.  The motion reads:&mdash; That the Dáil disapproves of the policy of the Minister for Local Government so far as it has been made known through the general activities of his Ministry.  As I read that motion the policy of the Ministry of Local Government so far as made known through the activities of the Minister will include sins of omission as well as commission, and if the Minister has powers which may be exercised, and if he declines to exercise these powers then I take it that it is part of the policy of the Minister to decline to exercise certain powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but he can hardly call that activities.  If that were so the motion should read: &ldquo;so far as it is known through the general activities or inactivities of his Ministry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the activities of the Department are so taken up with certain sections of its work that it has not a sufficient staff to take up other sections, then the activities of the Department act as exclusive of the other powers which it might exercise <Col N="2161" /> but does not.  Deputy Lyons, in the course of his speech, very adroitly attacked the Minister, but tried to keep on the right side of him by excusing him and saying that the blame rested upon his predecessor; that the Minister was not responsible for the amalgamation schemes, but that he was more or less bound to carry them through, though possibly he disapproved of them.  Unfortunately we are in the position of not knowing what the views of the Minister are regarding amalgamation schemes and their extension, and regarding quite a number of the activities or powers and responsibilities of his department.  We would feel very relieved, some of us, if we knew, for instance, that the Bill which is being presented to the Dáil, known as the Housing Bill, had or had not his approval. Presumably the housing policy is a policy of the Department of Local Government, but we have not heard from the Minister for Local Government whether the present Housing Bill contains his policy in regard to housing or whether he approves or disapproves of it, or whether it is ample and satisfies the present requirements, or whether he is dissatisfied with it and prefers to leave the responsibility for it on other Ministers.  Similarly, in regard to Old Age Pensions, while the Bill that is at present before the Dáil may be said to be mainly a financial Bill, the administration of the present law is under the Department of the Minister for Local Government.  We can only surmise that it is on his authority that the more rigorous enforcement of the Old Age Pensions' Act is being carried out.  I think it would be well if the Minister would present to the Dáil the text of the instructions which he has given to the Pensions Officers regarding the valuation of means and perquisites, so that we could find out what is his interpretation of the law in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the circulars have been sent out from the Minister's Department informing the Pensions Officers that they must follow a certain course when valuing claims for <Col N="2162" /> pensions, and it is important that the Dáil should know what is his policy in regard to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  Does he approve, and is it with his instructions, or rather are his officers acting under instructions of other people when they apply the new methods of valuation to the means of recipients or applicants for old age pensions?  We have not been informed of what the Minister's views are upon these matters except by occasional questions, and we have not had the advantage of his advice, approval or criticism of the Pensions Bill which is now before the Dáil and which his Department will have to administer.  In the course of the discussion Deputy McGoldrick dissented from certain propositions that, I think, were made by Deputy Corish regarding the powers of local authorities and the exercise of these powers without interference. Deputy McGoldrick suggested that it would not be sound policy and that it would not be good for the people concerned to allow local authorities full sway in matters, say, of fixing wages, because the local authorities, he suggested, were more reactionary in such a matter than the Government.  There may be something in his contention in regard to some local authorities, perhaps in regard to the authority which governs Tirconaill, but Deputy McGoldrick forgot when he was making these remarks in defence of the Ministry at the expense of the County Councils that the Ministry itself had, as a matter of fact, given instructions and made it practically mandatory that these local authorities should make reductions of wages, and presumably from the tone of their communications the greater the reduction the more approval the local authority would receive from the Local Government Department.  I call attention to the circular issued in November last by the Ministry of Local Government which, I think, has not been recalled. That circular quoted from a statement made by the Minister for Finance, and specifically called attention to certain paragraphs in that statement to the effect that &ldquo;the Government could not consent to allow the economic interests of the country to be conducted in a manner that <Col N="2163" /> would raise or keep prices or wages above the normal level at which they should fairly stand at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably the Minister for Local Government was to be the judge of how they should stand, and as to what was fair in the matter.  He goes further in the circular and says that the existing rates of wages must be reduced, and instructs the councils in the first place to insist upon &ldquo;a reduction of the present high wages paid to road workers.&rdquo;  That is a direct instruction, or shall I say an incitement to the county councils to do the thing which Deputy McGoldrick suggests that they would be too much inclined to do of their own volition, and that it was better to leave a matter of that kind in the hands of the central authority in Dublin, because the central authority would put a check upon the niggardliness of the local council.  I want to draw attention on this point to a matter which has arisen within the last week, and again following the incitement issued from the Ministry of Local Government.  In North Tipperary the county council finds itself in this position, that a certain sum of money had been allocated out of the road grant to this county council.  They had been informed that it was intended that this was to be special money set aside for the reconstruction of roads, and designed to relieve unemployment, and, of course, it was not to be allowed to reduce in any way the estimate to be placed upon the councils for ordinary road maintenance or ordinary road work.  But I read that there was to be a reduction of the local estimates in virtue of the fact that the county council is receiving money from this grant, and that part of the grant is actually being expended in machinery, £2,400 out of a grant of £23,000.  That machinery, of course, was not intended to relieve unemployment in this country, inasmuch as it was to be purchased in Scotland. The rates of wages have been reduced considerably in that county, and having got the wages reduced, then they propose to relieve the rates of some of the burden which otherwise would have been placed upon them, and because of the grant from the Central Fund the local rates are to be relieved, and the total amount <Col N="2164" /> to be spent on the roads is actually to be to that extent reduced.  I wonder has that the approval of the Minister for Local Government?  Has he accepted the decision of the North Tipperary County Council in that matter, and what will he say when they retort&mdash;&ldquo;You prompted us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You tempted us to do this thing, and now you can have nothing to say in the way of a reprimand.&rdquo; In this circular the Minister for Local Government says that all new works not urgently required should be rejected or postponed until a substantial improvement is effected in the condition of existing works.  That is going entirely in the opposite direction from public policy, such as has been found to be desirable within the last twenty years.  When trade is bad, when employment is scarce, and unemployed men are lining the roads waiting for a job, the local councils are told they must cut down expenditure, they must not undertake any new works until employment becomes plentiful and labour is scarce.  Is that the considered policy of the Minister for Local Government? Deputy Egan, in the course of his speech on this matter, said many curious things.  One thing he said was that we had objected to National Army men, on demobilisation, being given employment. That is entirely wrong.  Never has any objection of the kind been made from these Benches.  We have objected to the dismissal of men ordinarily employed on road work to make way for National Army men.</P>
    <P>While on this point let me say that there is a good deal of cant spoken about this question of employing National Army men.  Nine-tenths of them, before they were National Army men were labourers, or shall I say nine-tenths of the labourers before they were National Army men worked with their fellow-labourers, and were members of the same organisations.  There has been no conflict of interest and no conflict of opinion regarding their rights to go back into civil life and to take up civil work when demobilised.  I would ask the Dáil to bear in mind that many of these men who have spent a year or two years in the Army were unemployed before they went in, and those who did not go in have been unemployed very much <Col N="2165" /> since.  If it comes to a case of giving preference to those who have greatest need, the men who were not in the National Army have just as much right to the preference as those who were, but we claim that whether they were in the Army or not, if they were willing to work they ought to have a fair chance of earning a livelihood, and earning a livelihood at a reasonably decent rate of pay, a living wage.  Deputy Egan challenged us to say what was a living wage. He had failed to find out what was a living wage.  I suggest to Deputy Egan that he will not dissent from this as a definition of a living wage: &ldquo;A sum sufficient to provide a man and his wife and an average family with nutritious food, sufficient clothing, and decent housing accommodation, and to pay for the education and amenities that the modern community expects good citizens to enjoy, and to provide a reserve fund for sickness and old age.&rdquo;  Will Deputy Egan accept that as a definition of a living wage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy put a figure on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Deputy Egan if he is going to accept a certain proposition as defining a living wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want you to put a figure on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Egan accepts the proposition and can persuade his colleagues and impress upon the Government the necessity of recognising and accepting that as a definition I will ask him to say whether he considers that a man ought to have a living wage, and whether a living wage is due to the men who are prepared to work for a livelihood.  You can fix your figure once you find out the costs of these things which are requisite and necessary to provide a decent livelihood. And when we speak of a living wage we have in view a livelihood in decency for a man and a family.  If we have a conception of a living wage which we can convert into cash once it is accepted that conversion can be found round the table.  But let us have an understanding as to what we are driving at in the beginning.  I defy the Minister for Local Government to provide <Col N="2166" /> that living out of the wages which he is insisting on as a maximum to be paid by the Local Councils.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the grant were, I think, Deputy Egan said, that existing rates of wages must be reduced.  Quite right.  Those were the conditions of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I do not think I said that. I said that the existing rate of wages should not be more than was paid for work in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether Deputy Egan said what I have quoted or not, as a matter of fact those are the instructions of the Minister, that existing rates of wages paid by local Councils must be reduced.  I have a note in inverted commas as if it were stated by Deputy Egan &ldquo;that existing rates of wages must be reduced.&rdquo;  Deputy Egan admits having said that the wages on these road works should not exceed the agricultural wages in the district. I want to know whether Deputy Egan and the Minister for Local Government stand over that statement.  Does the Minister maintain the position of the circular dated 27th November, saying that existing rates of wages must be reduced in regard to road work?  Does he further maintain the position of circular R. 35 dated 27th November, that the Council in the first place should insist upon a reduction in the present high wages paid to road workers? Or does he take the position that was quite definitely laid down, before, I think, he became Minister for Local Government, that in this work of reconstruction on the roads the rates of wages to be fixed were to show a difference in favour of the road labourers of 6d. a day, as against the agreed rate for agricultural labour in the district? This matter was under discussion in the presence of a representative of the Minister's Department, a representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and a representative of the Ministry of Finance, with the President in the Chair.  Representatives of the Trade Union Congress Executive were present, and it was very clearly stated that the intention in regard to this <Col N="2167" /> road work was that it was not to be considered as relief work, or treated as relief work, and that it was not intended to affect the ordinary rates of pay for ordinary road workers.  It was specially designed to meet the case of unemployed men who were not ordinarily employed on the roads, and the rate of pay to be fixed was to be something less than the ordinary rate current in the district for road maintenance. It was to be above the local agricultural wages.  At a second interview the sum stated was 6d. per day differential in favour of road workers.</P>
      <P>There is not the slightest doubt about that statement.  That was the statement made in the presence of these officials of Departments, the President in the Chair.  But the Department for which the Local Government Minister is responsible shortly afterwards sent out a circular letter in contradiction of every point of that assurance given by the President to that deputation.  Instructions were given that the ordinary rate of wages must be cut, and that agricultural rates of wages in the district must determine the rates of wages for road labour under these new schemes.  But, mark you, even that proposition was not adhered to by the Minister in every place.  Where the agricultural rate was higher than he thought desirable, he fixed a rate for road labour at less than the agricultural rate.  I want to know whether the Minister has taken a line of his own on this matter and, if so, will he divulge that line to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the President had no right to take this matter out of his hands and that he had the right to go on his own course if he dissented from the line taken by the President.  But the Dáil has a right to know what the policy of the Minister for Local Government is on such a matter as this.  Is he being instructed by the Executive Council in regard to these financial questions?  If so, why does he allow the Executive Council to break its definite promise?  He knows, through his officials, what the assurance given to that Trade Union Congress Executive deputation was.  I say that they have departed from a very specific undertaking <Col N="2168" /> and the Minister is responsible for that departure.  He has treated this whole question of road work as relief work, and as supplemental to Poor Law activities.  I say that is not the way to deal with a problem of this kind, and that we have a right to know, in so many words, what the policy of the Department is.  If it is as I have outlined, then it deserves the condemnation of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We also want to know something of the intentions of the Minister regarding the abolition or supersession of local governing bodies.  So far as one can see from the activities, it is the policy of the Minister to dissolve publicly elected, local administrative bodies and to supersede them by a bureaucrat sent from headquarters.  In this matter we only know of the happenings after they have taken place and we hear whispers of intentions that are to be embodied in Bills.  So far as we are able to understand the Minister from his policy, he has no faith in local administration; he has no faith in popular election.  He believes that the local councils that were elected four years ago, at the instigation of the party to which he belongs, are quite incompetent, that the members of these councils, which he helped to elect, are not worthy of any further confidence; that, as a matter of fact, because by the machinery that exists, such councils could possibly be re-elected, then the machinery must be scrapped.</P>
    <P>That seems to be the state of mind of the Minister: that because he and his party which put in local councils of a particular colour and of a particular quality&mdash;because in the putting in of these councils they made mistakes and chose the wrong men, or chose men who are incompetent for their work&mdash;then the whole system of local administration should be scrapped and local bodies should be deprived of their authority and their power.  That, I say, is a fair deduction from the activities of the Department, so far as they have been made known and so far as one can divine from the whispers that have been allowed to percolate through the doors of Merrion Street.  I think the Dáil ought to be informed what the Minister's view on <Col N="2169" /> this matter is.  We also ought to be told whether he is satisfied that such abuses as he thought had occurred under local administration have been entirely eliminated by Commissioner administration.  Does he think that Commissioner administration is so much more competent&mdash;and not only more competent, but so much less liable to corruption&mdash;that it should be extended and that local bodies should be scrapped and localities deprived of their right to administer their own affairs?</P>
    <P>This view, so far as we can gather from the Minister, that Local Government is a failure, that we are to centralise administration, that voters in local matters are not to be trusted, is surely not what was expected of an Irish Parliament and an Irish Government.  It was not intended we should proceed to destroy the very foundations of popular government by removing the powers from local authorities over their own affairs.  I think before the Minister goes very far with his present policy he should let the Dáil know what his mind is on this matter.  I think, too, that we should hear from him whether he desires or intends to put into operation some of those measures which are laws, and which have not been operating within the last three or four years?  He is very prolific in giving orders to local authorities, what not to do.  Will he give them some instructions what to do, to exercise powers which they possess, and which, in fact, oblige them to put into operation? Will he, for instance, instruct the local authorities to put into operation the Blind Persons Act, of which we have been hearing something about during the last two or three weeks?  Will he instruct the local authorities that they are to put Section 2 of that Act into operation? That Section requires County Councils to make provision to the satisfaction of the Minister for the welfare of the blind in their districts?  Have they carried out that order to the satisfaction of the Minister, because, as a matter of fact, nothing has been done.  Is that what gives satisfaction to the Minister?</P>
    <P>Then we want to know what is his policy in regard to the medical treatment of school children?  This is <Col N="2170" /> one of the mandatory Acts which imposes upon county and borough councils the obligation to make provision for medical inspection, and, where necessary, treatment of school children. If the Council fails to carry out the duties in this respect the Minister may appoint paid persons to do the work.  What of the Minister's policy with regard to the medical treatment of school children?  Has he given a single word of instructions to the local authorities in this matter which affects in the main the children of the workers and which, if put into operation, would save many troubles in later life?  The cheapest possible form of medical provision and probably the very best investment that could be made would be this medical treatment of children.  I suggest to the Minister that that is an Act which he ought to be very glad to see made operative.  There are organisations of which he knows the existence that would be very glad to co-operate, and I suggest that he is in duty bound to make the Act operative and see that it is administered faithfully, and made as widespread as possible.  I wish to say the same with regard to the Act for the feeding of necessitous school children.  This is not compulsory.  It is quite an optional Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed, as I submit, to enforce, or, shall I say, to suggest to the local authorities, especially urban authorities, the wisdom and urgency of this Act, and the need for it to be put into operation.  It may be said that the local councils have not been anxious to put this Act into operation.  True, and perhaps it is unfortunate. But has the Minister made any attempt to impress upon the councils the necessity for putting this Act into operation?  I would like to know also whether the Minister has satisfied himself that the policy of amalgamation of the Unions is working out well, and whether he intends to persist in, and to extend that policy?  The late Minister for Local Government spoke of the Bill which legalises amalgamation as being primarily and mainly intended for the purpose of legalising the existing schemes and to enable the schemes which had been very far advanced to be made operative.  I would <Col N="2171" /> like to know from the Minister for Local Government whether he intends to persist in this amalgamation scheme; whether he has been satisfied that the carrying out of these schemes has been done with due regard to the humanities; whether he is satisfied that the closing of the District Hospitals has not done any hardship to the sick poor.  I have had complaints about the inhumanity that has accompanied the closing of many of these local hospitals, and while it may be true that centralisation of the main workhouse is justifiable and desirable, it is not just and it is not desirable that the local hospitals should be closed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the Dáil some indication of his policy on these matters, and not to leave the Dáil in silence and in ignorance regarding the working of this, almost the most important part of the Government, inasmuch as it touches the lives of the people at so many points.  I would ask the Minister to take the Dáil into his confidence in regard to these questions which have been raised in this discussion and not to leave us to ferret it out by question and by an odd word of criticism here and there on the estimates. That is not the way to conduct the business of the Department, and more especially the Department whose Minister is directly responsible to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke) MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before plunging <i>in medias res,</i> I would like to deal very briefly with a few incidental matters that were raised in the course of this discussion.  Judging by the general tenour of that discussion it would appear that by an extension of the doctrine of original sin I had become responsible for the acts of all my predecessors in this Department whether under the old or present regime.  I am charged with a responsibility for high salaries and emoluments to county Secretaries, for the inefficiency of Assistant County Surveyors, for the clumsiness of the machinery by which the Agricultural Grant is conveyed to the local authority and for the breaking down of the machinery for the collection of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very unfair to <Col N="2172" /> charge me with the responsibility for all these matters.  Most of them can only be remedied by legislation, and in the short period during which I have been in office it would be impossible to bring in legislation dealing with all these matters.  I may say with regard to County Secretaries that I am in total disagreement with their present high salaries, and in any appointments I have made already, and in any appointments I shall make in the future, I will see to it that the salaries are very much reduced, even though the work of the County Secretaries in the future will be much heavier than in the past.</P>
    <P>With regard to Assistant County Surveyors, in the Local Government Bill that I am now bringing forward, I intend to make these wholetime officers, and I hope by so doing to do away with much of the dissatisfaction that at present attaches to that position.  With regard to the Agricultural Grant I will deal with that matter later on.  It is a pretty big question.  I do not see that Deputy Corish has any reason to complain about my policy with regard to the collecting of rates seeing that I have through the very drastic Bill now before the Seanad given increased powers to the rate collectors and sub-sheriffs for executing decrees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the policy of amalgamation, like Deputy Corish, I was only an ordinary member of the Party that first of all adopted that policy; but I may say I am in thorough agreement with the policy of amalgamation, if for no other reason than that it has resulted in a saving of 20 per cent. all round.  I know that as yet we cannot say it is operating with complete satisfaction, but when we take into consideration the very difficult period through which we have passed, and that in very few cases has the scheme been put into complete operation, I think it is too early for us to form any opinion as to its merits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has taken me to task for my policy with regard to local bodies.  I may say I am very reluctant at any time to get rid of local authorities, and it is only when very great pressure is brought to bear on me that I agree to hold an inquiry, and, if necessary, to get rid of those bodies and put <Col N="2173" /> in Commissioners.  I am by no means of the opinion that the Commission system is the ideal system, or that eventually it would be any freer from corruption than the ordinary system. It is only a temporary expedient, and an expedient that perhaps would not have to be resorted to only for the exceptional conditions through which we are living.</P>
    <P>With regard to the housing policy, I am in thorough agreement with the President in his housing scheme.  The Bill was introduced by the President because he has a particular interest in the matter, and he had this Housing Bill already drawn up before I became Minister for Local Government.  I believe, under the circumstances, it is as good a Bill as could be introduced.  A complaint has been made about the North Tipperary County Council, and I am very glad to be blamed for the actions of county councils, and for not taking them to task.  As a general rule, the blame is all the other way.  When that grant was being issued, or before it was issued, instructions were sent to various local authorities to the effect that the money supplied in the grant was not to be considered as an abatement of the ordinary estimate for road maintenance under the various county councils. If the local authorities have so considered it, they have done it against my instructions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has waxed eloquent on the subject of the living wage.  He has done so without any advertence to the present situation, and I consider that is the main feature of all the criticism of my Department, to which I have listened here during the last week.  In fact, before Christmas there was another grand offensive launched against me which I had not an opportunity of replying to.  On the whole, I have not been very much impressed by the statements of the various Deputies on the opposite Benches.  If I were impressed by anything, it was by the wisdom and the forethought of those ancient Irish scribes who always prefaced their books with an accurate description of the time and place at which, and the purpose for which, they wrote.  If the Deputies opposite had taken a leaf out of the book of those ancient scribes I do not think <Col N="2174" /> they would have treated this matter <i>in vacuo</i> as they did, and they would not have left me at times under a great difficulty to find out whether they intended their speeches to apply to Utopia or some particular age of the millennium; whether their speeches were made with the purpose of showing what this Government could do if it had the best of all possible citizens and the best of all possible worlds, living under ideal conditions, or whether they were intended to apply exclusively to Saorstát Eireann in the third month of this year of Our Lord, 1924.  It is about time that Deputies on the opposite benches began to realise that we are not yet living in a normal period.</P>

      <P>A short time ago we were living in times as nearly as possible the exact opposite to normal.  This nation has just emerged from a life and death struggle of a kind well calculated to test the strength and endurance of a political organism far more powerful and consolidated than what we have. The infant state of which we are the present curators only escaped, as if by a miracle, from being strangled at its birth, and those who stood sponsor for it had to withstand a challenge which, in fury and intensity, has seldom been equalled.  It was a challenge of an armed minority consisting of two sections, one seeking the political objective of a paper Republic and the other the social objective usually associated with triumph, the most extreme shade of the red flag.</P>

      <P>Both of them were trying to lead to anarchy and chaos, and treading the road to a condition of affairs in which revolution, having completed its circle of civil war, anarchy, pestilence and famine, would eventually have been stamped out by the intervention of one or other of the powers of Western Europe that would never, under any circumstances, have permitted this country to be set up as a western outpost of Bolshevik terrorism in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have saved Ireland from that, we <Col N="2175" /> have saved her from the worst consequences of that challenge, we have saved her from anarchy, we have saved her from the intervention of a hostile army, and we have saved her from famine.  But we have not saved her, and we could not save her, no power on earth could save her, from a great deal of want and suffering, the inevitable consequences of the reckless defiance of political and economic laws of which during the last eighteen months we were the witnesses and the victims.  We may let that pass now, if the undemobilised soldiers of the Dublin Corporation will let it pass.  There is nothing to be gained at this stage by saying &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  Our object now and our business is to try and get back to normal conditions, and to try by every means in our power to alleviate the want and the suffering that have followed as a consequence of this rash rebellion.</P>
    <P>With this object in view, as it principally concerns my Department, the first thing I have to do is to look to our resources, the resources that we can call upon by taxation, whether local or national, to relieve the distress that prevails, and to endeavour to get back to normal conditions.  In looking at our resources we should endeavour to bear in mind that the resources of Ireland will not partake of the quality of St. Brigid's cloak, with which, I am sure, Deputy Colohan is familiar, and which we are informed, increased in compass with the owner's ambition.  The re-resources of Ireland are not of that particular kind.  Let us see what are the resources that I can call upon in the shape of rates and taxes to relieve the unemployment and the distress which constitute a great part of the work of my Department.  In looking to our taxable resources, I do not intend to include the profits derived out of trading amongst ourselves, for although they do in a certain way constitute negative wealth, still they create nothing, and add nothing to our national resources. Neither are they in the true sense of the word taxable, for they ultimately throw back taxes on one or other of our wealth-producing resources.</P>
    <P>Without going too deeply into that <Col N="2176" /> very vexed and difficult question, the final incidence of taxation, it is no exaggeration to state that in a country where the great portion of wealth is derived from the soil, taxation from whatever source immediately derived, must ultimately terminate in the soil. Ireland is not a great mineral producing country; she is not a great manufacturing country.  Only fifteen per cent. of our exports consist of manufactured goods.  She is not a great commercial country, she is not in the position of Great Britain, a great portion of whose wealth is derived from her carrying trade.  Agriculture is really the rock upon which the Saorstát is founded.  Seventy-five per cent. of the wealth produced in this country consists of agricultural goods, and for a long time agriculture will have to be regarded as our main source of raising taxes.</P>
    <P>We have another potential wealth-yielding asset which does not always get the credit it deserves, namely, the fact that Ireland is, or rather was, under normal conditions, an attractive place to live in.  This constitutes a potential source of wealth in two ways &mdash;one transient and the other permanent. First of all, to encourage tourists is a good source of wealth to all European countries, and the principal source of revenue to some, and should certainly be a great source of wealth to Ireland, with its world-scattered race, naturally interested in Irish history, topography, and social institutions, if encouraged as it has been discouraged during the last few years.</P>
    <P>It is also responsible for the fact that a great deal of foreign wealth flows into this country every year. At the present time there must be over £150,000,000 on deposit in the banks of the Saorstát.  There are no figures available as to the exact amount, but on a rough calculation it must work out at about that.  A great deal of the interest earned on that money is derived from foreign countries.  You have also to bear in mind the fact that there are a great number of people living in this country, a great portion of whose income is derived directly from foreign investments.</P>
    <P>In taking stock, then, of our taxable resources, we may leave aside mineral wealth, wealth derived from manufactures <Col N="2177" /> and wealth derived from a carrying trade.  We have a few great industries like the brewing industry, but they are very badly handicapped at present by their overhead charges, and the fact is that they cannot stand any higher taxation, and if relief does not come very soon it is pretty certain that a great many of them will go under.  Neither need we take into consideration our carrying trade.  It is practically non-existent.  Let us see, then, how far we can call upon the other two sources of wealth that I have mentioned &mdash; agriculture and wealth derived from foreign sources. With regard to agriculture, its index figure, as the Minister for Agriculture informed us some time ago, stands at 40.  The index figure for the agricultural labourer stands at between 60 and 80, and the index figure for the cost of living at 80.  It was 80 then, but it is something higher now.  The index figure for rates stands at between 150 and 200.  In other words, everything since the war has gone up in proportion to, and at the expense of, agriculture.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Johnson deprecates taking agriculture as the standard for the regulation of wages, but agriculture being the basic industry of the country, and having to depend on the foreign market, and therefore being exposed unprotected to foreign competition, must be taken as the standard by which all economic values in the Saorstát are measured if we are not to be driven headlong into bankruptcy. I think some time ago we heard here that we will have to change our attitude with regard to the importance of this great industry.  At a critical period in the industrial history of England, when an Act of Parliament made the woollen industry the staple industry of the country, and so that this source of the nation's wealth might be kept constantly in mind, woolsacks were placed in the House of Lords on which the Judges sat.  To this day the seat of the Lord Chancellor is a woolsack.  Some ceremony equally striking would be amply justified here to stir up our people to a realisation of the importance of agriculture.</P>

      <P>If sacks were placed in the seats occupied by Farmer Deputies it might serve that purpose.  At all events, agriculture is not a paying business at the present moment.  How, then, is it going to provide money for the relief of unemployment or profits or taxes for any purpose?  The farmer is not making any profit, but his farm is there as security.  We can go to him and say, &ldquo;I want £50 from you in the shape of rates or taxes for the relief of distress or the relief of unemployment. We know you are not making any money, but your farm is worth £2,000. You can pay the money out of your capital, and if you have no capital you can mortgage the farm and get the money out of the bank.  If you do not do that we will get the money by selling your farm or your live stock.&rdquo;  That is the principle on which a certain proportion of the rates and taxes are being raised at the present time.  That is the principle on which any further taxation for the relief of distress or unemployment would also have to be raised.  I am quite prepared to admit that at a critical time like the present we should be prepared to travel certain lengths along that path, but how far is it expedient, how far is it just or equitable to tread along that path, particularly in view of the fact that in a great many cases the people who are going to be relieved at the expense of the farmer have been but recently engaged in an inveterate conspiracy to paralyse and to smash by strikes his industry, and to paralyse that industry which is now the only thing that stands between them and starvation.  Would I be justified in dragging this money out of the farmers' pockets and creating a situation throughout the rest of Ireland similar to that which exists?</P>

      <P>What I was asking was would I be justified in dragging this money out of the farmers' pockets to create a situation throughout the rest of Ireland similar to that which recently obtained here in the County Dublin, where the farmers, finding it impossible to pay their labourers 43s. a week, and the men not being allowed to accept less by their Unions, had to let the men off and go out of production themselves, only to find that these very same were employed shortly afterwards at 52s. a week on the roads.  This wage of 52s. ultimately comes out of the same pockets, the pockets of the ratepayers, who were unable previously to pay them 43s.  I say I would not be justified in taking up such a stand, and I say the least the farmer should have is the right to expect that these men working on the roads should not be given more wages, or at least, very little more, than what he is compelled to pay himself.  The workers, judging by pre-war standards, are from 20 to 40 per cent. better paid than is the farmer himself, and in addition, I say it is the duty of these men on a farm to work more industriously and more conscientiously than if they were doing work that was yielding their employer a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other sources I have spoken of, the wealth derived from foreign sources, you may leave out the tourist, since he is not available <Col N="2180" /> at the present moment, save to remark that increased taxation by increasing the cost of living and the cost of travelling, will not encourage the tourist.  The same may be said with regard to those living in the country on foreign incomes.  In fact, in their case, it has to a great extent occurred already.  Thousands of wealthy people have left this country and no one has come to take their place, because, owing to the general turmoil and the absence of social amenities, and of the high rates and taxes, there has been nothing to attract them.  High taxation, like strikes and industrial turmoil, has also the effect of frightening away capital which might otherwise be inclined to invest in Irish enterprise, and also of keeping money tied up idly in the banks which might otherwise be working profitably.  Idle money, like the idle man power, is of very little use, if not actually harmful.  It may be said that the Devil makes work for idle money as well as for idle hands.</P>
    <P>It will thus be seen that our resources for relieving unemployment are very limited.  With those limited resources we are prepared to do our utmost to see that no one in the Saorstát goes hungry this spring. When you take into consideration the state of Europe, and the condition through which we have passed in Ireland during the last few years, it will be admitted that this is a fairly considerable task.  In any measures that we take for relief of this kind, those who will have first call on us are the demobilised soldiers of the National Army, the men who played a most dangerous and difficult part in saving our country from anarchy.  In making still further demands on the already over-burdened taxpayer the least he has the right to expect, and that it is our duty to concede, is that he is going to get value for his money, and that the money is not going to be converted into an economic weapon to make his position even less tenable than it already is.  That is the standard from which I have to approach my duties as Minister for Local Government. I may say that the policy of my Department is not so much my policy as a policy of necessity.  A <Col N="2181" /> great deal of criticism has been directed as to the wages fixed under our road schemes.  These wages were drafted by a Committee of experts from our various Departments&mdash;Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and Local Government.  In order to prevent any further curiosity about the matter, I shall read for you the findings of that Committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee understood that it was the intention of the Government to base the wages to be paid in rural areas roughly on something (say 3s.) above the rate paid to agricultural labourers. Memoranda from the Secretaries of the Ministry of Local Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are attached, which contain information generally as to the principles on which the Committee was requested to recommend scales of wages to be paid in the various localities.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first place, the Committee consider the possibility of fixing a flat rate to be paid for such work all over the country, whether in rural areas, urban areas or City Boroughs.  After careful consideration, the Committee decided to recommend that it would not be practicable to have such a flat rate, and more particularly, that there would have to be a differential, certainly as between the rates paid in the city boroughs and the rural areas, if not between the rates paid in urban areas and in rural areas.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In considering the rural areas, the Committee recommend that the county should be taken as the unit, and rates fixed for the whole of each county.  This decision was arrived at because the county is the unit for road schemes generally, and the wages paid to existing road workers under the County Council schemes vary from county to county.  It seemed, therefore, that less disturbance would be caused by taking the county unit when it had been decided to have varying rates in various districts.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to the broad principles of fixing the rates in rural areas at a few shillings above the agricultural labourers' rate, the Committee bore in mind the amount of the dole, which varies from 15s. for a single man to 23s. for a man with a wife and three <Col N="2182" /> children.  Further, regard was had to the present pay of a soldier, as the bulk of the men employed on these road schemes would probably be demobilised men.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In fixing the exact number of shillings to be added to the ascertained rate for agricultural labourers, the Committee decided that in rural areas the total rate should not exceed 30s. per week in any county unless there were very special and exceptional reasons. The Committee had in mind the case of County Dublin, where, owing to special circumstances, there might be reasons for fixing a higher rate than 30s.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the other hand, the Committee felt that where the agricultural rate was very low there might be reasons why more than 3s. should be added to the ascertained rates, as, in their opinion, too low a rate might not be sufficient incentive to get anything like a proper output of work, and might accordingly prove uneconomic.  Without framing definitely a downward limit, the Committee were agreed that a rate below 26s. would be too low.  It should be added that, so far as the Committee could gather, rates so fixed would in practically every case be considerably lower than the rates actually paid at present by County Councils to existing road makers and could not, therefore, be held to prejudice any adjustment of wages desired by County Councils.  On the other hand, as it has been for a long time the practice to pay road workers something more than agricultural labourers, the Committee could not see that payment of a rate a few shillings higher than the agricultural labourers' rate would in any way disturb the agricultural labourers' rate.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As it was understood that the work on these schemes would be spread over a period of fifteen months at least from about February or March, 1924, the Committee recommend that the rates at present fixed should be subject to revision about November, 1924, when the whole position could be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee further considered the possibility of arranging a system of payment by results, and decided to recommend that in those districts in <Col N="2183" /> which it was practicable, systems of piecework should be instituted for all the road schemes.  In this event the time rates would be largely nominal rates on which the piecework rates could be based.  On the general knowledge which the Committee possessed, that in industries where piecework prevailed, it was usual for pieceworkers on the average to earn one-third more than time-workers, it was felt that it would not be improper to anticipate that pieceworkers on the road schemes would earn about one-third more than time-workers.  The Road Engineer of the Ministry of Local Government explained to the Committee that in some counties, for various reasons, a piecework system would be impracticable, but he agreed that in a great many districts it could be adopted with advantage.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the matter of the rates to be paid in Urban Districts, the Committee decided to recommend that the Urban Districts should be put into three grades as follows:&mdash;Class 1, 30s.; Class 2, 35s.; Class 3, 40s.  These amounts were determined on the principle that the highest rate in any county was 30s., and it was felt that in certain smaller towns this rate would be equitable. In towns of larger size, 35s. and 40s. were chosen as intermediate stages to the figure of 45s., which was fixed for Waterford and Limerick, and 50s. for Dublin and Cork.  In determining the grade in which any particular town should be placed, regard was paid to the size and importance of the town and to the comparative level of rates paid in the town.  The Committee decided that as on general consideration the Urban Districts of Pembroke, Rathmines, Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, and Dalkey are practically part of the City of Dublin from a wages point of view, the Dublin City rates of 50s. should be allowed for these townships.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee recommend that when the Local Authorities are being circularised on this subject the rates shown on the attached Schedule should be regarded as maximum rates.  It should be pointed out to the Local Authorities that the amount of the <Col N="2184" /> grant available for any district would not be decreased if a rate lower than the maximum were paid.  It may be that in certain districts the men who will get the advantage of this money may be prepared to take a lower rate spread over a longer time when they understand that the amount of the grant is fixed irrespective of the rate paid and that they would get full advantage from the money available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the Agricultural Grant.  I think Deputy Corish complained that we had deprived him of something like £52,000 worth of grants.  As a matter of fact, the exact amount of money held up from Deputy Corish's constituency is £13,982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to clear up this question of Local Taxation Grants, I will read you a statement on the matter. It is a very complicated matter, and it is very unfair to blame one particular Department for delinquencies. There is a whole chain of circumstances in connection with payment of these Grants, and there is no particular reason for taking up one link of the chain more than another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of Local Taxation Grants the position is briefly as follows: &mdash;On taking over the control of government, arrangements were made for the release of all grants withheld during the British administration.  These amounted to about one and a half million pounds, and by September, 1922, this sum had been paid over to local authorities.  In the distribution of the grants normally payable for the financial year ended March, 1923, difficulties arose in consequence of large amounts of land purchase annuities which were in arrear.  For the purpose of meeting deficiencies in Land Purchase, there was established a Guarantee Fund under the Land Purchase Act of 1891. This Fund is financed primarily out of Local Taxation Grants, which consist of the Estate Duty Grant under the Probate Duties Act, 1888, one half of which is payable to County, County <Col N="2185" /> Borough, and Urban Councils as road authorities, and one-half to County and County Borough Councils in respect of Poor Law expenditure to be applied in aid of the poor rate; the Agricultural Grant provided under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898; the Exchequer Contribution being a grant in aid of Labourers Acts Loans prior to 1906 in respect of which instalments are still outstanding; and the Licence Duty Grant which is provided under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, as amended by the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1902.  The last named grant is payable to County and County Borough Councils in respect of Medical and Educational expenditure by County Boards of Health to County Borough, Urban and Rural Councils in respect of Salaries of Sanitary Officers, to County and County Borough Councils in respect of maintenance of lunatic poor, to County and Urban Councils whose districts are affected by a charge in respect of guaranteed railway or harbour undertakings where the amount of the charge exceeds a sum of sixpence in the pound.</P>
    <P>Land Purchase Annuities are fixed at amounts sufficient to pay the charges for interest and sinking fund arising from advances under the Land Purchase Acts, and when annuities are not paid punctually as they fall due half-yearly, charges fall on the Guarantee Fund to which Local Taxation Grants are hypothecated.</P>
    <P>The Estate Duty Grant forms the first item of the cash portion of the Guarantee Fund to meet deficiencies in the land purchase account.  By the Irish Land Act, 1903, the Agricultural Grant is added to and made applicable to the purposes of the cash portion of the fund next after the Estate Duty Grant.  The Exchequer contribution is also liable for this purpose, while the Licence Duty Grant forms part of the contingent portion of the fund.  The sums required for the Land Purchase Fund in the case of each county are withdrawn from the Guarantee Fund under certificates of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Under the Irish Land Act, 1909, local bodies are relieved of all liability in <Col N="2186" /> connection with the issue of stock for the purpose of land purchase.</P>
    <P>In consequence of arrears of purchase annuities, the Estate Duty Grant for the financial years ended in March, 1922, and 1923, and the Agricultural Grant for the half-year ended March, 1922, were absorbed in the Guarantee Fund. The latter grant, and a proportion of the Estate Duty Grant for 1922-23, have been repaid to the Guarantee Fund out of arrears of annuities which have been recovered, and have recently been distributed to local bodies.  The only grants applicable to the period up to the 31st March, 1923, that are still absorbed in the Guarantee Fund are the Estate Duty Grant for 1921-22, and a portion of same grant for 1922-23, the total of which would amount to about £300,000.</P>
    <P>Grants to the extent of more than half a million pounds have recently been issued to local bodies.  They consisted of £462,415 5s. 6d. in respect of Agricultural Grant for the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, and an advance in respect of the half-year ended 30th September, 1923; £34,557 19s. 6d. in respect of instalment of Estate Duty Grant for 1922-23; and £36,153 12s. 5d. Exchequer Contribution for the year ended 31st March, 1922.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Grant for the current half-year will normally fall to be paid next month.  The position will then be further reviewed.  If, in the meantime, there is continued improvement in the repayment of outstanding arrears of land purchase annuities, the full benefit will be given to local bodies.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, it seemed that an effort was made to place me in the position of economising solely at the expense of the poor and of the labouring class.  One of the sections of my department which came into being in December, 1921, is the Trade Department.  The object of this Department is to make it possible for local authorities to purchase in the cheapest wholesale market, instead of buying retail at very high prices.  If the Dáil achieved nothing else in Local Government except the setting up of this Trade Department, I think it would deserve well of the country.  We have <Col N="2187" /> been attacked for setting up this Department from a different angle to that of the Labour Party.  I will just quote a few instances of economies effected by this Department.  I take the figures at random from contracts made by various bodies in the middle of the year 1922, and our prices are given for the purposes of comparison &mdash;the prices of the Trade Department.</P>

    <P>I could continue quoting until Doomsday examples of the same kind. Those are our efforts at economy, and no one can say that those economies are being effected at the expense of the labouring classes.  I do not believe I could do any more to effect economy, unless I took a leaf out of the book of the Independent Labour Party and attended the various councils divested of my raiment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present during the whole of the debate to-day, and I do not intend to detain the Dáil very long.  The most burning question at the moment is the administration of the present Amalgamation Scheme.  I have experience of this scheme since its inception, being one of those who accepted it when it was first brought about. I did not accept it at that time as a means whereby better administration in the interests of the people would be brought about.  I did not believe it could be so.  It was simply accepted by the people of Ireland and their representatives on the public boards to give those who administered in the name of Dáil Eireann at the time, a name in the country and a standing as people who were out for economy and to counter the arguments of those against them. County Meath, I think, was one of the <Col N="2188" /> first counties that adopted the amalgamation scheme.  All the District Hospitals were closed up; the destitute poor were taken distances of from thirty to fifty miles to a County Home in Trim; the seriously ill were taken similar distances to the County Hospital in Navan and they were housed there for a considerable period under conditions that it was scarcely fair to expect the ordinary farmer to house a stall-fed beast in the winter season.  They were placed under conditions that were most inhuman, and that would appeal to the human heart of any individual, if there is any individual to-day in the Ministry of Local Government, or on the benches behind the Minister for Local Government, possessed of a human heart.</P>
      <P>Unfortunate beings were taken into a Home in Trim; they were left in wards where there were no window panes, no fires, or no heating accommodation of any kind.  They were placed there in that position, and there they are to-day in the very same position.  Who is accountable for their being in that position? It is the Minister for Local Government.  We can say that the late Minister has been accountable for a good deal of it, but I am in a position to state that the present Minister is equally accountable, for since he came into office as Minister for Local Government, appeal after appeal has been made by the County Board of Health for sanction for the expenditure of a sum of £7,000 to place this building in a proper and habitable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite those appeals and despite the appeals of other public bodies throughout the county, not one word has been heard about the sanction.  Although the elected representatives of the people were appealing to the Minister for Local Government, he failed to hearken to the appeal, while he received at the same time people who called themselves representatives of the ratepayers, and took their version of the situation before the version of the elected representatives of the people.  I think this is the negation of democracy, and we hear a good deal from the Ministerial Benches about democracy. I think democracy is dead, so far as Ministers in this House are concerned and so far as these who support <Col N="2189" /> them are concerned.  A system of home help was inaugurated under the amalgamation scheme throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-six Counties.  That system brought with it untold hardships that we have been unable to rid ourselves of since its inception. In the past, under the old administration that many of us, if not all of us, fought bitterly against and tried to rid the country of, it was usual that the unfortunate poor would receive their allowance at least once a week.</P>
    <P>In some counties, such as Westmeath, I understand from a statement made by some Deputy behind the Government party&mdash;I think it was Deputy Egan or Deputy Shaw&mdash;it is administered once a fortnight.  But I can say that as far as the County Meath is concerned, it is only administered once a month, and under the present system of amalgamation they are unable to administer it oftener.  Increased staffs have to be employed. The relieving officers were abolished, and we were told we were to have economy; but the next thing was that two special officers were appointed with the title of Home Help Inspectors. Complaints were made against them. They were not working satisfactorily. The next thing is that the Department sends down an order to appoint a Superintendent. And who is the Superintendent that is appointed?  The Vice-Chairman of the Board of Health.  This is maladministration and corruption of the worst kind.  Here is an appointment of a Vice-Chairman of the Board of Health and a member of the Meath County Council to a position in the paid employment of the Council, and sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government.  I think the Minister for Local Government ought to be ashamed of himself for having to admit such a thing as that. Under the Local Government Act that we are working under at present it is laid down that no member of a Board or Council can accept any position of place or profit under the Board so long as he is a member of that Board.  Here is a matter where the Vice-Chairman of the Meath County Board of Health, a privileged gentleman and presumably a man who was in the heart of the Minister for Local Government, or some Minister before him, comes along and <Col N="2190" /> makes application, and through jobbery by the Board of Health he is appointed and he is sanctioned by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I think they have been compelled to do so.  A short time ago I heard through the country that members of District Councils were being employed by County Councils in road work.  Representation was made to the County Surveyors in different counties, <Col N="2191" /> and I know in the County Meath that the present Chief of Transport or County Surveyor had representations made to him, and in accordance with his sympathies for the workers he came before the quarterly meeting of the Meath County Council, and he pointed out under the clauses that I have just quoted in the Act of 1898 whereby a member of the District Council was not entitled either to hold any position or place of profit under the County Council so long as he was a member of the Rural District Council.  This occurred at the dictation of people of the ratepaying or farming class.  These unfortunate men were road workers before they were elected to the Boards, they were road workers under the occupation of Britain in this country, and when they were returned the old Local Government Board did not object to them.  They were allowed to carry on.  Dáil Eireann came along and allowed them to work on.  Why?  Because at that time these men were the most prominent in the country both in public life and on the field of battle, and they were the only people that were of any assistance to the Dáil Eireann Ministry at that time.  The fight was over.  The fight was won.</P>

      <P>The British were out of the country.  The services of these men were no longer required on public boards.  If the late Minister would only jog his memory he would find that if these men were put off public Boards between 1920 and the signing of the Treaty you would not get one of those people who raise an objection to them now to come forward and accept a position on those Boards.  The people who shout the loudest about these men being on public Boards were the men who would not go on the public Boards then. To-day they are anxious for the position; once the fight is over they are anxious to get positions there, and the Minister for Local Government is going to assist them.  I did not hear the Minister speak of the abolition of the Rural Councils, and what his intentions in the matter are.  It has been very <Col N="2192" /> widely broadcasted throughout the length and breadth of Ireland that it is the intention of the Minister for Local Government to abolish Rural Councils. We are told that democratic representation of the people is to be again poisoned, and that the autocratic poison is to be administered to democracy to put an end to it.  After many years' agitation in the British House of Parliament that Act was passed establishing District Councils and the people, both the ratepayers and the poor, have found that they have got better administration through the District Councils than they had through the system that went before it.  But now we are told that these District Councils are to be abolished.  The Minister for Local Government is going to put an end to them.  They are incompetent; they are wasteful.  They are of no practical use. They are to be wiped out as encumbrances on the nation.  I say they are not encumbrances.  They are the elected representatives of the people until such time as the Minister for Local Government is prepared to have them replaced at an election.  I have been a member of a District Council since 1920 and I know that District Council that I am a member of, and other Councils throughout the length and breadth of Meath have appealed to the Minister for Local Government for an election. Labour is anxious to have an election. We are not a bit afraid of an election. Let the Minister for Local Government have an election.  Why should he try to abolish the Rural Councils?</P>

      <P>Unless by privilege.  The Minister has been referring to the housing question and he is satisfied with the President's Housing Bill.  He has not told us of his own housing policy.  I am sure that the housing question is a burning question in every rural district in Ireland.  In Dunshaughlin in 1913 they had a scheme for the erection of 28 houses, and for something like nine months the District Council has been making representations to the Ministry relative to the erection of the houses.  After a good deal of pressure, and after deputations waiting on the Minister, he has agreed by letter to sanction the erection of 12 out of the 28 houses.  He is giving the District Council authority to raise a loan.  We have not asked the Minister for any money in connection with the construction of the houses. He sanctions the erection of 12, and the position now is that there is no one in occupation of the remaining plots which have been closed in for the last 13 years and are subject to the trespass of the stock of the wealthy land-owner who has property beside the plots.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is serious he ought to allow the public boards to complete the scheme that was begun under British rule.  I do not see why he should take upon himself the authority of holding up the District Councils from completing the erection of these houses.  Where does he get that authority from?  The old British regime gave the District Councils authority to purchase plots and to erect houses.  Now the Minister for Local <Col N="2194" /> Government in Dáil Eireann denies the right of the District Councils to erect the houses.  I hope the Minister will change his mind in regard to the erection of houses at Dunshaughlin.</P>
      <P>I would like to know on what grounds the Minister has set out a wage of 30/- a week for road workers?  The fairly well-thought-out speech of the Minister has not explained that matter very clearly.  Why does the dictator again come into existence to instruct the representatives of the Meath Co. Council and every other Co. Council in Ireland?  Why not leave the administration of affairs in the hands of the elected representatives of the people? Why establish a dictatorship?  Why write to a County Council and inform them that they must pay 28/-, 30/- or 32/- a week?  Where does this authority come from?  It has never been known of before.  It is unprecedented. In the old days under the British regime grants came from the British Ministry of Transport without any condition. The grants were handed to the people who were then administering local affairs, and these people never squandered one penny of it.  They are the people whom Deputy Gorey and his party represent to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it because that in some of the public boards there are Labour men, in some instances in the majority, that the Minister for Local Government has seen fit to brand these men, because they are simply Labour men and representatives of the ordinary workers, as a body of incompetents, squanderers, and misappropriators of the public funds?  Is that the reason?  I take it, it is.  Why treat the County Councils as school children? They are the elected representatives of the people, and they are the people who have been placed in the position that they have to administer local affairs of each particular county.  He has made some mention in this Committee report that they anticipated that the Minister would be prepared to pay to the road workers a rate of 3s. a week over the rate paid to agricultural labourers.  I do not think that the reading of that report has done very much good.  It has not enlightened me, at all events, and I do not think it has enlightened many.  It was a good way of filling up a Ministerial statement and endeavouring <Col N="2195" /> to satisfy the craving minds of the hawks of economy outside.  It has gone that far.  But does the Minister for Local Government recognise that the road worker, no matter what class of road worker he is, is only a casual worker receiving employment for four or five weeks, and then unemployed for five or six weeks, and perhaps after five or six months taken on again, and dismissed again in a few weeks?  Why put him on the same level as the agricultural worker?  He is not a permanent employee.  If you take the County Meath in the summer time you will find that all the men who are employed on the roads throughout the length and breadth of the county number only 98. In the busy season they are not employed. It is only for four or five months that there are 500 men employed on the roads in Meath.  What are they doing the rest of the year?</P>

      <P>I am sure the agriculturists that he has boasted about do not call on them to save the harvest, because there is no harvest, there is no tillage.  They do not require them to go out and stand in the field, and look at the cattle grazing, and admire the cattle, with their happy masters jingling coins in their pockets.  These arguments and the well-prepared speech that has boosted up the case of the farmers have not gone one inch further to allay the distress, the hardships and the privations of the unfortunate road-workers, and the Minister can never say, and he would not be justified in saying, and could not honestly say that to strike this rate of 30/- per week to give employment for men is going to relieve the farmers of their responsibility from giving employment, because the men working on the roads are men that never got employment from the farmers.  They are men who are idle for months and months without exception.  The farmers' representatives must have been very happy listening to the Minister, but certainly the Labour Deputies had no cause to be thankful for what the Minister uttered about them.  It has really no foundation and no substance, <Col N="2196" /> and it was unfair, and very unfair, to allege that men getting employment on the roads were men that could get alternative employment on the land, for there is no employment on the land of Ireland.  The Minister, in his speech, and he must have been very serious about it, because the speech was well prepared, alleged that he was out to protect agricultural industry from conspiracy.  I would like to know from what conspiracy, and I would like to know who is it that is conspiring. Does the Minister allege that we here on these benches are conspiring?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Labour is not a conspirator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Labour is not in sympathy with anybody that would conspire to destroy the agricultural interests in this country.  He spoke of Waterford and Tipperary, but he cannot accuse deputies on these benches of conspiring with anybody to ruin the agricultural interests, and I do not think he is in a position to say that the leaders outside this House have done so.  He alleged that the Trade Union leaders would not allow men to accept a wage lower than that paid in the County Dublin.

It is the case that the men themselves decided not to accept it.  They directed their representative to accept nothing less. It is a false impression to draw that <Col N="2197" /> the representatives of the Trade Unions throughout Ireland are the dictators of their members.  They are not. The leaders are the servants of the members of the Unions, just as we are, and every other deputy in this House, are the servants of the people who send us to the House.  This Dáil is not the master of the people.  The members of the Dáil are the servants of the people, just as the Trade Union officials outside this House are the servants of the Unions.</P>

      <P>I suggest, at the outset, that the Minister for Local Government has not in any sense of the word tried to reply to the statements made by me in moving this motion.  He has given us a lecture on economics which we get every day in the week from the newspapers.  The Minister for Local Government is an abler man than he gets credit for, because in his statement he has deliberately set out to get the farmers to ally themselves on his side, with the definite object he appears to have in view of cutting down the wages of the workers in this country.  There is no question whatever about it.  According to the circular that his Ministry has sent out to the various Councils in the Saorstát and the inference we can draw from it, that is the deliberate intention of his Ministry.  He has told us that a certain Committee has been set up inside his Ministry with the object of agreeing upon what wages should be paid for road work in the Saorstát, and he said his object was to get back to normal as quickly as possible. I could quite understand him <Col N="2198" /> making that statement if he had the two-fold object in view of getting back to normal as far as wages were concerned, and at the same time asking the Executive to do something by way of bringing back food prices to what they were during the period when these wages would have been looked upon as living wages.  In the course of his lecture on Economics he said in one breath &ldquo;there is no money in the country,&rdquo; and a few moments afterwards he said &ldquo;that money is lying idle in the bank.&rdquo; Now, these two statements are in direct conflict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister did, and I am sorry if I misquoted him, but that was the inference I drew from what he said.  At any rate, he spoke at length of the position that was created by the acceptance of the Treaty in this country.  He spoke at length of the civil war that raged here for the past twelve months.  It appears to me that the statement made by the Minister for Local Government is a sort of stock statement that every Minister delivers from the Government Benches on any occasion when any criticism is levelled at any particular Department.  I cannot for the life of me understand why such statements should be made by a Minister in order to protect himself against what is, to my mind, a just indictment made against him in connection with the policy he is carrying out as Minister for Local Government in this country.  I cannot for the life of me see what relation there is, or ought to be, between the happenings of last year in this country and his activities or inactivities in connection with his Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that in the course of the deliberations of this Committee they took into consideration that a certain amount was being paid to the unemployed by way of dole.  That, to my mind, but shows the basis upon which this Committee set out to deliberate, and I want to ask Deputies in this Dáil, who profess to represent the people of the country, if this is a proper way to approach a matter of this kind.  I ask Deputies to try and visualise and to try <Col N="2199" /> and realise the hardship inflicted on the working classes for the last five or six years in this country.  The working classes have been called upon, in all the periods during which this country was engaged in fighting for its national existence, to make sacrifices, and it has made the biggest percentage of sacrifices and that is what they get at the end of it all.</P>
    <P>We have been told by Deputy Egan, I think it was, that we object to ex-National Army men being employed as road workers.  We do not do anything of the kind.  We have a greater respect for the National Army men than Deputy Egan and his party, because we refuse to be parties to use them as a medium for cutting down wages in this country. In other words, we refuse to acquiesce in their being used as blacklegs, upon their fellow-workers, because that is what the Government is doing with them.  I think it is very bad treatment to mete out to men who went through the country with their lives in their hands, and it is not a policy that one would expect from an Irish Government that says it is the voice of the people.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if they consider it is the voice of the people to ask working men to keep their wives and families on 28s. a week.  I had occasion to interview the Ministry on this very matter and I was told this was only relief work. I asked did they understand or realise that immediately it became known in the different counties that the Government stipulated a certain wage, private employers would use that very fact as a lever to cut down the wages of the workers, and I was told that they did not expect anything of the kind.  I want to tell the Minister that just a week ago, last Monday, when the Wexford County Council agreed by one vote to accept the grant on the condition specified by the Minister of 28s. a week, not half an hour afterwards the wages of the ordinary road workers were cut from 40s. to 28s.  If that is not a specimen of the action of the Government in helping the local councils and the local employers to cut down the wages of the workers, I do not know what is.  I was very glad to hear the answer of the Minister to Deputy Lyons, that he would not sanction a wage that was not a reasonable <Col N="2200" /> one, and I think he would want to search his conscience for a long time before he would be able to find that 28s. a week was a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his statement said that I blamed him for what his predecessor did.  I want to get out of the Minister's mind at this stage the idea that I want to make any personal attack upon him.  I do not. He is unfortunately in the position of Local Government Minister at the moment, and no one respects him personally more than I do, but I do not think that An Ceann Comhairle would allow me to say anything about his predecessor in connection with the motion I put on the paper.  He says I accused him of being responsible for the breakdown in the collection of rates.  In that connection I want to say this: that I consider the Local Government Department did not pay sufficient attention to the question of the collection of rates in the various counties in Ireland.  We have had the spectacle in the counties of rate-collectors doing their very best in order to get people to realise their responsibilities in that connection, and to pay their rates.  We had the Minister for Local Government sending out circulars pointing out to the Councils the necessity there was for doing so. These people were brought to the courts and decrees were obtained against them, but when that happened the Minister never made any effort to bring pressure to bear on the Minister for Home Affairs to get these decrees executed, and that laxity of duty on the part of the Local Government Department is responsible to a great extent for the position the Councils find themselves in to-day.  So far as agricultural grants are concerned, I am not at all satisfied with the answer of the Minister for Local Government.  I made a statement in that connection, and he said that I made a statement in the beginning of this debate that the Wexford County Council were owed £52,000.  I repeat that statement.  The Secretary of the Wexford County Council has gone very carefully into the matter, and in consequence of the communication he received from the Department he has come to the conclusion that we were owed £52,000, and since this motion was tabled for discussion <Col N="2201" /> the Wexford County Council has got something between £18,000 and £20,000.  Perhaps if the motion had been put down sooner we might have got it sooner, but certainly the fact is as I state, and I do think in view of that fact that the withholding of these Grants from the various County Councils in the Saorstát is responsible for these Councils being in debt.  The Minister for Local Government is lacking in his duty unless he brings before the Executive the difficulties and the disadvantages in the way of not paying these Grants to the Councils when they should be paid.</P>
    <P>Now to come back to the question of low wages paid to the road workers under this Grant.  I said the day I moved this motion that in my opinion the Minister has no right to stipulate the wages under this Grant, and he has not yet convinced me, and he did not deal with the matter from any point of view to-day that would convince me that he has that right.  I suggest that he stretched his imagination in accordance with his economic thought in this particular, and that the inference that anybody would draw from the particular section of the Transport Act would not enable him and would not entitle him to fix wages. That has not been done by any of his predecessors, nor by the British when they were in this country, and it is a sorry day that an Irish Ministry that we set up should stoop so low as to take advantage of the situation of a particular class in order to deprive the worker of his just right when he does a just day's work.</P>
    <P>The first thing the Minister dealt with was the Housing Bill, and he stated that he was in entire agreement with the President as far as the Housing Bill was concerned.  Now, so far as I am concerned, and I have some experience of urban housing, I do not think this Bill is going to have any effect whatever upon the housing question. I may be wrong, but I think it is deliberately framed with the object of cutting down workers' wages.  I say that the private people in the Saorstát at the moment are not concerned from the same point of view of housing the people as a Government <Col N="2202" /> should be, or as a local authority should be.  If they come into it at all they will come into it from a purely speculative point of view, and that is not the way the housing question ought to be approached at this particular juncture.  The Minister has spoken about the warfare that has prevailed in this country for the past five or six years.  He seemed to forget that that particular argument could be used in many different ways.</P>

      <P>The housing of the working classes has been neglected for the period he had under survey for the reason that a state of chaos prevailed in this country.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the manner in which he approaches this question is not going to do anything effective so far as the housing of the working classes is concerned.  To my mind, it is absolutely essential that the local authorities should be taken into the confidence of the Ministry and given the advantages of this Bill, if there are any advantages in it, in order that the working classes should be properly housed.  I placed a certain proposition before the President, and the Council of Municipal Authorities placed the same proposition before him, whereby the house he proposed to build for £500 could be let to a tenant at 8s. 6d. a week.  That was turned down.  I do not know for what reason.  I do think everybody will agree that if the housing of the working classes is to be tackled effectively by people with collective responsibility, those who represent the people will have to tackle it, and not those who come into it for purely speculative purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not remember that the Minister said anything about the amalgamation of Unions other than what satisfied him was that there was a saving all over the country in Poor Law administration to the extent of 20 per cent.  I want to ask the Dáil, and I want to ask the Minister, is that the way that the health of the people is to be measured?  Will the effect upon the health of the people and the treatment meted out to the aged <Col N="2203" /> and the infirm be compensated for by a 20 per cent. reduction in taxation?  Will a 20 per cent. saving in administration justify a bad amalgamation scheme?  I said at the beginning that I am entirely in favour of amalgamation, but if we are going to have amalgamation, let us have amalgamation that will treat the poor properly.  The amalgamation that was rushed through in 1920 was rushed through as a political expedient, and the people in the different counties were promised an enquiry as soon as the amalgamation was in force for twelve months.  That promise has never been fulfilled.  Several counties have made representation to the Minister in question, but a deaf ear has been turned to them.  I would ask the Minister to do something to relieve the unfortunate poor, who have suffered so many hardships in connection with amalgamation schemes.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to say whether it was his intention to abolish District Councils or not.  In this connection I would like to say that the Minister's apparent distrust of the various Councils in Ireland is certainly savouring of very bad taste.  I would ask him to remember that the Councils which he does not trust now are the same Councils which his predecessor or his predecessors used in order to fight the British Government.  They were good enough in 1920 and 1921 to fight the British, but they were not good enough now to trust to regulate the wages of their employees.  I would ask him not to be too harsh, and to wait until the Election comes along, and if these people do not voice the sentiments of the ordinary man in the street let the electors deal with them.  As I said in the beginning, I do not think the Minister made any effort to reply to the criticisms levelled at his Department.  I do not know whether he deliberately refrained from that or not.  As I already said, he gave us a lecture on economics. Other statements were made by different speakers.</P>

      <P>I think it was mentioned in the report of the deliberations of the Committee that 6d. per day in advance of the agricultural wages paid in any particular district should be the agreed rate for road work.  I do not know whether the Minister agreed with that or not, or whether it was Deputy Johnson stated it.  So far as the rate for the County Wexford is concerned, the rate suggested by the Minister for road work is 4s. 6d. a day, or less than the local wage, and that is certainly not in accordance with the recommendations of his own Committee. It just shows the indiscriminate methods used by this Ministry in approaching different subjects.  I would ask the Minister to again review this whole situation so far as wages are concerned. I think I have proved by the reference I made to the action of the Wexford County Council that the action taken by the Minister is being used by employers and other people to reduce the standard of living of the people in the country.  It is all very well to talk about the state of chaos that has prevailed in this country for the past year or eighteen months, but it is reasonable to ask are the workers and the poor always to suffer because of certain actions in this country?  I do not think it is fair to ask them to take all the hardships that are going, and I would appeal to the Minister to review the whole situation.</P>

      <P>I move the adjournment of the Dáil until 3 p.m. to-morrow. This morning Deputy Johnson asked me a question, on private notice, as to certain military activities in the northern portion of the city last night, and I promised to make a statement on the adjournment.  One cannot deal with last night's incidents simply as <Col N="2205" /> isolated incidents.  For a proper understanding of them and of the action that has been taken by the Executive Council as a result of them, it is necessary to bring the minds of Deputies back at least some days.  I have here a time-table of events in connection with the troubles within the army.  I find that on the 6th of March a document, purporting to be an ultimatum, and calling itself an ultimatum, signed by Major-General Liam Tobin and Colonel Charles Dalton, was handed to the President; that on Friday, the 7th, that document was considered by the Executive Council, and that an order was issued by the Executive Council for the arrest of Messrs.  Tobin and Dalton. On that date also, Mr. Joseph McGrath, Minister for Industry and Commerce, tendered to the President his resignation. On Saturday several houses, including the house of Mr. McGrath, were visited by the military in search of wanted men&mdash;that would be on the Friday-Saturday night.  On Saturday, 8th March, the Executive Council decided to place Eoin O'Duffy in Executive Command of the Army.  On the 10th March that position became operative, and General Eoin O'Duffy was appointed Officer Commanding the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann.  On Tuesday, 11th March, the President read a statement, regarding the situation, in the Dáil.  He read the document which he had received, signed by the two officers.  Mr. McGrath, on that date announced his resignation as a Member of the Executive Council, said that he would make a statement to the Dáil, and made a charge that the situation which had arisen in the Army was brought about by &ldquo;absolute muddling, mishandling and incompetence on the part of a particular Department of State.&rdquo;  The President named the following day, after Question Time, to allow Mr. McGrath to state the reasons for his resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 12th March the President announced: &ldquo;The Government is satisfied that the events which have happened call for an inquiry, which the Government will cause to be held into the administration of the Army.  The Government is prepared to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in view of his statement, <Col N="2206" /> with regard to how this inquiry is to be carried out,&rdquo; Deputy McGrath expressed himself satisfied with the President's announcement, and did not propose to make any further statement until the inquiry takes place.  On resuming at 7.30 p.m., the President read a second document dated that day&mdash; namely, 12th March&mdash;received from Messrs.  Tobin and Dalton.  On the 14th March General Eoin O'Duffy was appointed, in addition to his appointment as General Officer Commanding the Forces, Inspector-General of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann. On the 15th of March the Cabinet considered the personnel of the Committee of Inquiry into the mutiny, and, subject to the consent of the persons selected, arrived at the following decision:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Professor Eoin Mac Neill, T.D., Minister for Education (Chairman).</P>
    <P>Mr. Commissioner James Creed Meredith, K.C.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. McGilligan, B.L., T.D.</P>
    <P>Notification of consent from these persons reached the Government on the 18th instant.  On Tuesday, 18th March, the functions of the Inspector-General of the Forces were approved by the Executive Council and gazetted.  The terms of reference of the Committee of Inquiry were drafted and approved by the Executive Council.  A copy of a letter written by the Minister for Defence to the Members of the Council of Defence, setting out the attitude to be adopted towards the officers implicated in the mutiny, was read and approved by the Executive Council.  On the night of the 18th of March you had a raid on certain premises in Parnell Square for wanted men, and the arrest of several officers.  That is the time-table leading up to the situation which now confronts us.</P>
    <P>There is an item which does not appear on that time table and to which I propose to refer.  The following letter was sent by the President to Mr. McGrath on Monday evening last, 17th instant:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been in consultation with the Minister for Defence and General O'Duffy on the matters which you raised with me this morning.  I regret <Col N="2207" /> that we had not arrived at this decision before now:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  By Thursday, 20th March, at 6 p.m., all arms and equipment removed from barracks to be returned to the place or places from which they were taken:</P>
    <P>(2)  Persons concerned in the removal of such material to surrender at the place from which such material was taken to the officer now in charge of such place;</P>
    <P>(3)  On presenting, after such surrender, parole to the officer in charge, such parole will be accepted, and the persons concerned allowed out under open arrest;</P>
    <P>(4)  Absentees from duty shall surrender by 6 p.m. on Thursday. Their parole being presented will be accepted, and they also will be allowed out under open arrest.</P>
    <P>Thursday has been mentioned as a convenient date to give time.  It is desirable, however, that no delay should be occasioned in giving effect to paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the President's letter to Mr. McGrath.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Defence, at a meeting of the Executive Council, presented the following document: It is headed, &ldquo;Copies to the Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General; memo.  18th March, 1924.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President has instructed that all persons who left their posts, or unlawfully took away military stores during the recent mutiny, be dealt with, from the point of view of arrest, on the lines indicated in the following paragraphs 1 to 5:</P>
    <P>(1)  By Thursday, 20th instant, at 6 p.m., all arms and equipment removed from barracks to be returned to the place or places from which they were taken;</P>
    <P>(2)  Persons concerned in the removal of such material to surrender at the place from which such material was taken to the officer now in charge of that place;</P>
    <P>(3)  After such surrender, on presenting parole to the officer in charge, such parole will be accepted and the persons concerned allowed out under open arrest;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2208" /> (4)  Absentees from duty shall also surrender by 6 p.m. on Thursday, the 20th instant, and on their parole being presented it will be accepted. They also will be allowed out under open arrest.</P>
    <P>(5)  Thursday is only mentioned as a convenient day to allow a certain amount of time, but it is desirable no delay should be occasioned in giving effect to the terms of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4).  Suitable instructions should be wired immediately to all G.O.C.'s, and by them to their officers concerned, to secure that effect is given to the terms of these instructions so far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>(Signed) AIRE COSANTA.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be noted that this document from the Minister for Defence to the other members of the Council of Defence is couched in terms identical to those used by the President in his communication to Mr. McGrath of Monday evening last.  There is a matter which I have mentioned and to which I wish to refer again in some detail. That is the position of General Eoin O'Duffy with regard to the Army. General Eoin O'Duffy, as Deputies are aware, was appointed General Officer Commanding the Defence Forces. Speaking as one member of the Executive Council, when that appointment was made my conception of it was&mdash;it was a wrong conception&mdash;that the appointment placed General O'Duffy in supreme executive authority over the Army and over every man in Army uniform.</P>
    <P>I visualised it as placing him in the same position with regard to the Army, as he recently occupied with regard to the Civic Guard.  I visualised his relations with the Minister for Defence and his responsibilities to the Minister for Defence for the Army, as the relations which existed towards me with regard to the Civic Guard when General O'Duffy was Commissioner of that Force.  That was wrong, and the fact that it was wrong transpired later, when it became clear that the Departments of the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, and the Chief of Staff are regarded as Military Departments of the Ministry of Defence, <Col N="2209" /> and by a general routine order, of which I have not at the moment got the exact number or date, but which I think was issued in December last, the functions of each one of these three officers were defined and their responsibility to the Minister was defined.</P>
    <P>General O'Duffy became aware that there were limitations to his powers, and to his authority over the Army inasmuch as he had no authority over any of these three officers, and they had no responsibility to him.  When that fact was represented to the Executive Council, we added to General O'Duffy's functions as General Officer Commanding the Forces the office and functions of Inspector-General.  It is better to state the functions and definition of the Inspector-General clearly.</P>
    <P>The duties of Inspector-General of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann are: &ldquo;To inspect the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann and the Administrative Offices of Defence (Chief of Staff's, Adjutant-General's and the Quartermaster-General's), the training, discipline, fitness and efficiency of their personnel of all ranks; the suitability, condition, supply and maintenance of their arms and equipment; the suitability and condition of their barracks and other posts, and generally to review the organisation and administration of the Defence Forces of the Saorstát, and to report thereon to the Executive Council through the Minister for Defence, and to offer such suggestions in relation to organisation, instruction, personnel, equipment and administration as may result from such inspection and review.  He may make his inspection or review in any particular case personally or by deputy appointed by him.  The Inspector-General shall have free access to all such reports, files and other information in the possession of any department or office of the said Forces as he may think fit to require, and he shall be at liberty to enter opinions or observations on any report, file or minute.  The Executive Council shall provide such office staff and equipment as will be necessary for the work of the Inspector-General.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That office and those functions were conferred on General O'Duffy, not in substitution of, but in addition to, his <Col N="2210" /> functions as General Officer Commanding the Forces.  The Departments of Supply, as they might be called, back behind him, were not subject to or responsible to him; but over this Department and in relation to this Department he had his powers and his functions as Inspector-General.  With regard to the Army machine proper, he had complete executive control and authority.  He stood, then, as it were, between the Ministry of Defence and its three main Military Departments and the Army proper.  Over the Army proper he had his executive power and authority as General Officer Commanding the Forces.  Back behind him in the Supply Department&mdash;I am not sure whether I am using that word quite accurately, as I am not very well versed in the technicality of Army matters&mdash; he had his powers of criticism and report, and his powers of Inspector-General.</P>
    <P>Now, General O'Duffy was anxious that he and everyone else should understand clearly what his real position was, what his real powers were, what his limitations were, so that there should be no unnecessary friction, no overlapping, no chance of any countermanding of orders.  On yesterday, at a meeting of the Executive Council, a memorandum from General O'Duffy raising these matters was considered, and the powers of the General Officer Commanding the Forces of Saorstát Eireann were at that meeting fully discussed, fully understood, and fully agreed upon.  So that I may be fully accurate, let me say that it was also agreed that these would be drafted out and presented to General Eoin O'Duffy this morning for any final comment he might wish to make on them.  It was agreed by all persons at the Executive Council meeting, and by General Eoin O'Duffy, what exactly his powers were. This is the draft.  I have read the definition of the functions of the Inspector-General. This is the draft of the functions attached to the office of the General Officer Commanding the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Executive Military Command over all the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann, including all units, Corps, Services, and all ranks.  He shall be <Col N="2211" /> responsible for (1) military policy as far as the immediate military situation is concerned; (2) the operations necessary for national security and public safety; (3) distribution of the forces; and (4) military intelligence in furtherance of the purposes aforesaid.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be argued&mdash;although it was agreed that this draft in its final from would come up for final approval&mdash;that last night General Eoin O'Duffy was not the General Officer Commanding the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann having the powers set out in that document.  Particular action was taken last night&mdash;military action. It was not taken after consultation with General Eoin O'Duffy, and it was not taken after consultation with the Executive Council as a whole or any member thereof.  It was taken on the responsibility of the Minister for Defence in consultation, I understand, with the Adjutant-General.  That action was considered at a meeting of the Executive Council this morning.</P>
    <P>It was not long under discussion before the view emerged very clearly that by the majority of the members of the Executive Council, the action that was taken was regarded as cutting across the obvious and necessary implication of the letter sent by the President to Mr. McGrath, on last Monday evening, and of the order of the Minister for Defence to the Chief of Staff, to the Adjutant-General, and the Quartermaster-General, dated the 18th March, which on yesterday received a kind of <i>post factum</i> approval and endorsement by the Executive Council.  That was the position that emerged.  The majority of the members attending this morning's meeting held the view that the action taken last night cut across Government policy as embodied yesterday in the <i>post factum</i> approval and endorsement of this memo. from the Minister for Defence to his colleagues on the Defence Council.  When the Minister for Defence realised that the Executive Council, or those of us who were active, were not prepared to endorse and were not prepared to stand over the military operations of last night, which <Col N="2212" /> were entered on without consultation with the Government, which were entered on without consultation with the General Officer Commanding the Defence Forces appointed by the Government, the Minister for Defence withdrew from the meeting, expressing his opinion that it would be better that the situation should be considered by ourselves, and that he would be available if required.  It was considered by ourselves and, in a personal way, I regret that it falls to my lot to announce to the Dáil, and through the Dáil to the country, the very grave and important decision which was arrived at by the Executive Council, or what was left of it.  That decision was communicated to the President by Dr. MacNeill and the Minister for Finance, and regarding it the President has expressed approval.  That meeting this morning decided to ask for the resignation forthwith of General Seán McMahon, Lieut-General Georóid O'Sullivan, and Lieut.-General Seán O Murthuille, their resignation not from their Army ranks&mdash;let it be understood that we were not taking or purporting to take Army action&mdash;but from the administrative positions which they have held up to date.</P>
    <P>That meeting also decided&mdash;one was a decision which we considered we were entitled to come to ourselves: that is the decision regarding the three officers&mdash;to convey to the President its view that he ought to ask for the resignation of the Minister for Defence. That was not an action which we were entitled to take, but it was something that we conveyed to the President. Now, with regard to the resignations of the three officers, after the meeting I asked the Minister for Defence to come to see me.  He came from Portobello to see me, and I communicated to him the decision of the Executive Council with regard to the three officers, General Seán McMahon, Lieut.-Gen. O'Sullivan, and Lieut.-Gen. Seán O'Murthuille.  The Minister for Defence, thereupon, informed me that that would involve his resignation also, and that he would make a statement to the Dáil.  I had not told the Minister for Defence, because I regarded it as something that perhaps I was not entitled to disclose in the circumstances, <Col N="2213" /> that that meeting which he had left had decided to recommend to the President that he should ask for the resignation of the Minister for Defence. That was something which the President would have to exercise an independent judgment about.  I could not prejudice the result of the President's independent judgment of the matter by making a disclosure to the Minister for Defence.  I therefore simply accepted it that because of the action of the Executive Council in calling for the resignation of these three officers, the Minister for Defence would resign, quite apart from any decision that the President might or might not come to on our message.</P>
    <P>It is a common thing nowadays to rail at secret diplomacy, to attribute to secret diplomacy most if not all of the ills which our present-day world is suffering from.  Without pronouncing in any dogmatic way upon that view, I would like to suggest to the Dáil that in a certain delicate complexity of circumstances it is not always advisable, not always in the public interest, to drag everything out for mongers of gossip, every relevant circumstance, every charge and counter-charge, every allegation, true, or half true, or not true at all.  It is factors like that which weighed with the Executive Council ever since this Army pot boiled over.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was to make a statement here.  From what we knew of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to state here, and from our judgment of the situation, it would not be in the public interest that that statement should be made.  As I said, speaking some time ago, charges and counter-charges would have been bandied about; statements would have been made and contradicted, statements which, whether they were true or false, or half true, could not have redounded to the credit of the State or the credit of the country as a whole.  And time was spent, a long time was spent, in an endeavour to convince Deputy McGrath that such a statement ought not to be made, and an undertaking was given that an enquiry would be set up into Army administration, and that he would get every opportunity of having such charges as he might care to formulate thoroughly sifted.  I think <Col N="2214" /> there was some slight misunderstanding on the last occasion.  When we spoke of a Cabinet Committee, a Cabinet enquiry, we did not necessarily mean that the Cabinet in person would enquire, but we meant that an inquiry would be constituted by the Cabinet, which would report to the Cabinet.  I have named the personnel; I have read the Terms of Reference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has read the Terms of Reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me.  The Terms of Reference are very simple, very broad:&mdash;&ldquo;To enquire into the facts and matters which have caused or led up to the indisciplined and mutinous or insubordinate conduct lately manifested in the Army.&rdquo;  Now, on that undertaking Deputy McGrath postponed, or abandoned&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;his intention of making his promised statement in the Dáil.  He was prepared to accept it, that his charges should be enquired into, should be definitely formulated and enquired into by a Cabinet Committee, and the promised statement was not made.  Deputy McGrath then interested himself in seeing that the situation which had developed in the Army should be, as far as possible, righted.  He, all along, was emphatic that the original document from these two officers need not be taken literally or tragically.  He was emphatic on the point that these officers did not intend to challenge the basis of Parliamentary representation or the fabric of ordered, responsible Government, did not challenge the right of the people to decide their political issues, and a document was received, as I have stated, explicitly withdrawing and repudiating the original document, and signed by these two officers.  It became then a question of deciding the action that should be taken with regard to those who, in varying degrees, might be said to have participated in a mutinous revolt; in varying degrees, one must classify them.  In a class apart, you have two men who signed the document which was presented to the President.  You have, then, men who absconded with arms, men who absconded without arms <Col N="2215" /> and men who sent up resignations.  I take it that the letter which the President sent to Deputy McGrath on Monday last, after consultation with the Minister for Defence and General O'Duffy, was an attempt to clarify a somewhat obscure position.  It was accepted by the Minister for Defence and communicated by him to the other members of the Defence Council with the intimation that suitable instructions should be wired immediately to all G.O.C.'s and by them to their officers, and so on.  We regard the action taken last night as cutting across what was Government intention and Government policy with regard to an extremely dangerous and an extremely delicate national position.  But I do not want any Deputy nor any member of the general public to come to the conclusion that the resignation of certain high Army Officers was demanded by the Government simply and solely as a result of last night's activities.  That is not the situation.  At a discussion which took place the day after this document was presented, the view was expressed at the Executive Council that this particular personnel was not the personnel to deal with a mutinous revolt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally expressed that view emphatically and gave reasons, and one other member of the Executive Council stated that he, within the last few days had, as he put it, come to the decision that these men had been too long in their positions, that something in the nature of a sense of proprietorship was springing up, and that he had intended to move for a change at the top of the Army.  He went on to develop the view that he regarded the document served by these officers on the President as cutting across that, and argued that because the removal of the Army Council was one of the terms of this challenging document, the removal of the Army Council was not possible in that particular set of circumstances, or at that particular time.  I want that grasped, that there were those who hold, and hold strongly, that whereas, in the abstract, a change in the headship of the Army might be considered advisable, that the concrete existing circumstances <Col N="2216" /> were considered by some, by a majority, in fact, as constituting an obstacle to that course.  Whether the decision to refuse in the concrete set of circumstances to consider a proposal for the removal of the Army Council was wise or unwise we will not pause now to consider very deeply.  It was passed by, it was put aside as a thing which in the face of the mutiny, in the face of the document, in the face of the fact that their removal was one of the things called for in the document&mdash;could not then be considered. But when this personnel, or members of this personnel, without consultation with the Government, without consultation with the General Officer Commanding the Defence Forces appointed by the Government, took a particular action calculated to have, possibly, grave reactions within the Army and throughout the country, calculated perhaps to set the heather on fire, the heather we have been so assiduously attempting to quench and damp down, a different set of circumstances arises.  We have decided that the public interests, the best interests of the public, of the State, of the Army itself, call for the removal from their administrative positions of these three officers.</P>
    <P>General O'Duffy has been informed that he is now in complete Executive control and authority over every man in Army uniform.  The Minister for Defence is resigning.  He will make a statement.  To-morrow morning somebody will be assigned the duties of Acting-Minister for Defence.  Let me say here that we have not been satisfied within ourselves, and within our own counsels, that the matter of this mutiny could be dealt with simply on the assumption that 100 per cent. of wrong was on one side, and 100 per cent. of right on the other, that it could not be dealt with as a mutiny could, and should, be dealt with in countries that are more normal, by Governments that are more normal, and in armies that are more normal.  Let me say here that while we never got any definite official information from the Minister for Defence that that was so, that the view was gradually borne in on the minds of some members of the Executive Council, at any rate, that there existed in the <Col N="2217" /> Army factions, organisations, societies&mdash; call them what you wish&mdash;but cleavages and combinations, at any rate, that do not exist and should not exist in normal, disciplined armies, that the personnel was too much in the forefront, too much in evidence, so much in evidence that it overrode discipline, for discipline to be discipline must be impersonal.  Let me say, too, that we were not without evidence that that impersonal discipline does not exist in the Army, that generally, naturally with diffidence, as being Ministers in the political headships of other Departments, naturally with a certain reluctance, a certain hesitation, the view was forming in the minds of members of the Executive Council that there was danger that the Army was not unequivocably, unquestionably, without reserve, simply the instrument of the people's will, expressed constitutionally through the Dáil, and through the Executive appointed by the Dáil.  If that view is right, if that half-formed view&mdash;shall I call it&mdash;is right, that it was a question of rival combinations, there was a lot to be said for the view that you could not strike at one of these combinations through the medium of another.  That certainly was the factor operating in my mind when I expressed the view to my colleagues in the Executive Council that the mutiny could not be dealt with by the particular personnel that were then in control, and I would have been willing personally to face the suggestion that we were caving-in to a particular term of the challenging document that was served on the President by the two officers.  I incline to the view that I have said enough about the past.  Many, perhaps, listening to me will incline to the view that I have said too much about the past.  I want to say this about the future, that the position now is that General O'Duffy is in complete control of the Army, of every man in military uniform, that he will expect and exact, by virtue of the powers conferred on him by the Government, absolute discipline, absolute loyalty, absolute obedience from every man in military uniform.</P>
    <P>General Seán McMahon is at the moment absent from town.  I have received, through the medium of General Mulcahy, the resignations of Lt.-Gen. O'Sullivan and of Lt.-Gen. O Murthuille, <Col N="2218" /> and these resignations have been accepted.  To-morrow, the Executive Council must appoint an Acting Minister for Defence, and the difficult, the admittedly difficult and the admittedly delicate situation that exists must be handled by General O'Duffy, in close consultation with the Executive Council as a whole, and the particular person who is appointed to act temporarily as Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I would like to add one note.  The action that has been taken has not been taken without adverting to the fact that the officers whose resignations from certain administrative positions have been asked for have done great service to this country, great service for the people of this country in the past.  There is recognition of that; there will always be gratitude for that, but in national affairs one has to accept it that it is not by the water that has passed that the mill is turned, and in this whole matter, as in other matters, the country must realise that it is impossible to carry on administration on the basis of swopping records: that there can be advertence to past service in public matters only to the extent to which that past service may be considered to give promise of useful public service in the future.</P>
    <P>In political affairs, in national affairs, from the very nature of the case there can be no such thing as gratitude, <i>qua</i> mere gratitude.  It is all like the Coral Island that is built up by the insects coming along and doing their particular little bit of work, and of some other insects coming along and building on top of them.  We have come to the conclusion&mdash;and I do not use the word insect in any derogatory or defamatory sense&mdash;that these three men in those three positions have done all the useful work that they are capable of doing and that in the set of circumstances which has arisen, and which now exists, other men must take up the lines and carry on, and build upon their work, improving it, and eliminating whatever is found to be loose or whatever is found to be bad, but recognising at the same time that a big work has been done and a big task has been undertaken, and to a very large extent achieved by those officers who went before them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> I would like the thing faced in that way, not regarded in any sense as vindictive action against these men, not regarded as in any sense throwing discredit on these men, but simply recognising that it is the view of those who have the responsibility of choice and decision in grave matters of this kind, that in a particular set of circumstances these three officers had reached the limit of their utility, and that their particular National service, and particular public work can now be better done by other men.</P>
    <P>Situations do sometimes arise in which it is a mere waste of time to advert to merits, to go into merits as regards individuals; situations do sometimes arise when it is a case of <i>res ipse loquitur:</i> that whatever the merits be, whether this charge be true or that charge be true, whether such an allegation can be successfully met and countered and beaten down, or whether it cannot, that the thing speaks for itself. Men may sometimes be rendered inoperative, their future utility may be prejudiced beyond hope of recovery by what is known as incurable unpopularity. It will be said later, no doubt, that these men, with the work they had to do could not but tread on many corns, could not but raise up for themselves dislikes and prejudices running to slanderous rumours, and running to charges unkind, uncharitable, and maybe untrue charges, but we have to act simply in a grim and impersonal way, and we have formed the view that these three officers are no longer efficient in the Public Service, and have not a useful future before them in these three administrative positions.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Army situation has been unsound for a very considerable time back, that there was a very grave menace, what I described as an abscess reacting on the general health and the general morale of that organisation.  To what extent it was there with the full knowledge of the responsible heads of the Army, and with the full knowledge of the Minister responsible for the Army, is a matter which the three gentlemen who have been appointed to this grave task must inquire into.  That inquiry will proceed.  Any charges that are to be formulated will be sifted, and <Col N="2220" /> will be reported upon, but quite apart from that inquiry or its results, we felt that if a healthy situation is to be restored within the Army, if a safe and sound situation is to be attained for this State and its people, that the action which we decided upon this morning, which we duly communicated to the President, which we now communicate to the Dáil, and through the Dáil to the people, was the right and sound and proper action in all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have made the extraordinary mistake of not answering the particular question that was addressed to me.  I have here the two official reports, one of which the Minister for Defence presented to us at the Executive Council meeting this morning, and the other which he handed to me later in the day.  The following is the first report which we received:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;19th March, 1924.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Information was received at 9.30 last night of a meeting of Mutinous Officers in Devlin's, Parnell St.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Troops were despatched to the scene and the house was surrounded. Owing to the standing instructions that we have no authority to search houses, owing to the state of war ceasing to operate, the troops did not effect an entrance, but searched people as they came out of the premises.  The ordinary customers having come out and there being no move on the part of the officers who were there, reinforcements and further instructions were asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Orders were given to have the house raided and the officers in the place arrested.  By the time troops were in position to have this order given effect to it was 11 p.m., and it was found that the house was barricaded, and would necessitate using force, and probably fire-arms, in order to effect an entrance.  This development was reported and instructions asked for, and sometime before 12 p.m. orders were given to have the house taken.  Troops moved into position in the neighbouring houses and the order was gone ahead with.  The troops had no difficulty in effecting an entrance, and having <Col N="2221" /> searched the house could find nobody. Having, however, got out on the roofs, they found the following officers:&mdash; Cols. Jas. Slattery, Chris. O'Malley, Fk. Thornton, Commdts. Pat McCrea, Jos. Shanahan, ex-Commdt. Leahy, Commdt. Joe Dolan, Bob Halpin, Pk. Griffin, Chas. Byrne, A.D.C. to the President; Lieut. Ml. Collins.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seven revolvers, 1 automatic, and 50 rounds of ammunition (3 rounds being dum-dum) were found on the officers.  All the houses in the Parnell Street, Moore Street and Moore Lane block were searched during the night, but nobody else was arrested.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Attached to this report there is a special note.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. J. McGrath, Minister for Industry and Commerce, and Mr. Dan McCarthy, T.D., arrived on the scene at 10 o'clock, and remained there until a late hour in the morning.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The G.O.C. Dublin mentioned that it was felt that three of those who were in the house escaped, but there is no confirmation of this.  Earlier in the night, at about 11 p.m., one man was seen on the roof, and failing to halt when called upon to do so, was fired on and returned to the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one report.  It is the first which we received.  There is another report which was handed to me in the course of the day by the Minister for Defence.  It is signed by Major-General D. Hogan, G.O.C.  Dublin Command, and is addressed to the Minister for Defence.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Report on Operations</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Parnell Street Area&mdash;18/19th March, 1924.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Consequent on information to the effect that a meeting of the mutinous officers was being held in Devlin's, Parnell Street, Colonel McDonnell and a party of nine troops proceeded to the place, arriving at 9.30 p.m., 18th instant.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On arrival a few troops were placed at the front and back of the premises, and Colonel McDonnell approached the front door.  Inside latter Comdt. J. Dolan and ex-Comdt. J. Shanahan were standing.  Colonel McDonnell told them they could consider themselves under arrest, as although <Col N="2222" /> he could not enter the house for them he would wait until they came out.  Colonel McDonnell ascertained that there were a number of others armed inside, and consequently he 'phoned Command Headquarters for reinforcements and further instructions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Adjutant-General was 'phoned for the instructions, and gave orders to enter the place, if possible without using force.  These instructions and reinforcements reached Colonel McDonnell at 10.30 p.m.  The latter placed a cordon of troops around the whole square in which Devlin's house is situated, and approached the shop, into which he got without obstruction. A number of civilians were in the shop.  These were interrogated and ordered out.  He then found that the `mutineers' had barricaded the stairs and were evidently preparing to fight, as guns were plainly discernible in the dark.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the possibility of a fight, Colonel McDonnell 'phoned for further instructions, and the Adjutant-General gave orders to force the place, and put the whole party under arrest.  These instructions were confirmed verbally to Colonel MacNeill at 11.50 p.m.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;About this time a number of men were seen making their way over roofs in the rear of Devlin's, and three shots were fired at them by sentries, but apparently without effect, as the men disappeared.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At 12.45 a.m. sentries were placed on adjacent roofs, and a party of troops were rushed up Devlin's stairs.  Here they met with no opposition, and found the house empty and a window open on to the roofs.  The latter, which are very extensive, were then searched, and about 2 a.m. a party of men, lying concealed between two roofs, called on one of our search parties to surrender. The latter ordered the men to surrender themselves, and Colonel F. Thornton, acting as latter's spokesman, said they would surrender if cordon of troops was withdrawn.  He was told by the Officer i/c (Colonel MacNeill) that only unconditional surrender would be accepted.  Thornton then asked for a guarantee that his party would not be fired on if they came out <Col N="2223" /> of hiding.  This was agreed to, provided they came out singly and handed up their arms.  They then did this, and the following were taken into custody:</P>
    <P>Colonels&mdash;Jas. Slattery.</P>
    <P>Patk. McCrea.</P>
    <P>C. O'Malley.</P>
    <P>F. Thornton.</P>
    <P>Commandants&mdash; Patk. Griffin.</P>
    <P>C. Byrne (A.D.C. to President).</P>
    <P>Joseph Dolan.</P>
    <P>Rt. Halpin.</P>
    <P>Ex-Comdts.&mdash;Joseph Shanahan, Leahy, and</P>
    <P>Ex-Lieut.&mdash;M. Collins.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following arms and ammunition were surrendered:&mdash;7 revolvers, 1 automatic pistol, and about 90 rounds. One revolver, and three newly cut `dum-dum' bullets were discovered on the roof near where the party hid.  An abandoned `Overland' motor was also discovered in Moore Lane.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The prisoners were then taken into Devlin's and searched, but nothing further was discovered.  Mr. Jos. McGrath, T.D., who had arrived earlier, accompanied by Mr. D. McCarthy, T.D., asked permission to stand the prisoners a drink&mdash;permission for which was not refused, in the circumstances. Mr. McGrath stated to the prisoners that their arrest was not authorised by the Government, but was solely military action.  Also, that even so, they should not have been arrested, as the troops had only warrants to arrest three of them.  It was pointed out to Mr. McGrath that our instructions were to arrest the whole party, and that, in any event, a warrant was not necessary in the case of officers found committing conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. McGrath was very disagreeable to the Officer i/c troops, and would have been detained himself were it not for the fact of his position in Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The prisoners were placed on tenders for removal, and when turning at O'Connell Bridge for Collins Barracks, Colonel Slattery jumped from a tender and tried to escape.  A few shots were fired at him without effect, but he was <Col N="2224" /> pursued and safely recaptured in a couple of minutes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole party are at present detained in Arbour Hill Barracks.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As it was believed some others might have escaped on to the roofs, it was decided to search all the houses, etc., in the Parnell Street, Moore Street, Moore Lane area.  This search was carried out and proved fruitless.  The troops were withdrawn to barracks at 10.40 a.m. to-day.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No casualties occurred and no documents were got, although a large quantity of torn paper was discovered adjacent to where the party had hidden.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I may also mention here that while the raid was in progress Messrs.  Cuddy, Cuffe and Devlin arrived in cars, but were not allowed through the cordon. I am of opinion that had our troops arrived an hour later a very interesting `bag' would have been got, as preparations for a meeting had been made in one of the rooms in Devlin's.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the two reports, and, naturally, the reading of them should have formed part of the statement which I made to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which had better be cleared up.  There seems to have existed up to last night some doubt as to whether or not the resignation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce had become effective; whether he was or was not a member of the Government. The position is that Deputy McGrath's resignation has become effective.  He is continuing as a matter of convenience and as, I think, a matter of constitutional strictness, to perform the functions attaching to the political headship of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce until such time as his successor is appointed.  Let me say, also, and I think it should be said, that the Government, or such members of it as are on the active list at the moment, recognise that this series of events and the resignation of two Ministers constitute for them a problem and a situation which will need very full and very grave consideration.  That is not overlooked. Deputies, of course, understand the situation at the moment.  The President is ill, and, under very strict orders of his professional advisers, is refraining <Col N="2225" /> from public duty and, so far as possible, in the circumstances from worries about public problems.  We will need some little time to consider the situation amongst ourselves.  Probably over the week-end it can be discussed and considered, and given the time, thought and attention which it deserves, and we will be in a position more fully to place before the Dáil next week the line of action which it is proposed to pursue in regard to this whole matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do propose to follow the Minister for Home Affairs into some of the points and matters raised by him.  I feel that, to a very large extent, the matters that have been touched on by him are matters that are <i>sub judice</i> owing to this inquiry that is being held, and may be <i>sub judice</i> in view of some other inquiry that perhaps the Dáil will find it necessary to ask for.  I just wish to speak here to the question of my own resignation and the circumstances of it. I regret very much to have to tender my resignation in circumstances that are, perhaps, difficult for the Executive Council and for the Dáil as a whole.  I am confident myself that there are no reasons affecting the stability either of the Government here, or the country, or the Army, that would prevent my doing so.  I am strengthened in that feeling by being told now that other members of the Government were proposing that my resignation should be asked for.  I have been in a difficult position for some ten days past.  In an urgent and important national matter I was tempted to appeal to the Dáil over Party.  I had to take into consideration that an Executive Council has its important constitutional position in our Constitution here.  I was deterred, as I say, from appealing to the Dáil over Party by the fact that the Executive Council had very serious responsibilities on it from the point of view of administration, and I was not willing to interfere with the Executive Council's work even to that particular extent.  My reasons for tendering my resignation now are simply that I cannot stand over condoning mutiny to such an extent as to foster it and to prejudice discipline in <Col N="2226" /> the Army, and that I cannot stand over ill-considered changes in Army control, from the point of view of the effectiveness of that control, particularly at the present time, when you are in the middle of a period of re-organisation that began a couple of weeks ago, and that was not due to terminate until the 25th March.  The action taken last night was taken because of the law embodied in the Defence Forces Act.  The disciplinary Sections of the Defence Forces Act are matters that arise out of tradition, matters that have been found traditionally necessary in order to preserve discipline in armies.  The law was passed here by the Dáil last year.  It is the personal responsibility of the Adjutant-General; it is the responsibility of the Minister charged with the responsibility of the Army to see that that law is put into effect, and I contend that no Minister, however great be the collective responsibility that he may feel, and no Executive Council can change the law which is passed.  The letter that was framed to Deputy McGrath on Monday in my presence contains suggestions that it was thought possible would be acted upon by the officers who had committed offences recently against discipline.</P>
      <P>It did not change our position from the point of view of putting the provisions of the Defence Forces Act into operation.  It did not, and could not, be allowed to cross the path of officers, responsible for the maintenance of discipline in the Army, to the extent that they could allow officers who had committed offences, either by deserting their posts, or by taking away material belonging to the Army, or by engaging in a conspiracy that might have had disastrous results, to walk and meet openly and publicly in the streets or in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of the genesis of the mutiny, a body has been set up to report on that.  I may say that the three officers, whose resignations have been called for to-day by the Executive Council, addressed to me some days ago a request that the inquiry to be held into these matters should be held publicly.  I had not decided in my mind to press that aspect of the matter on the Executive <Col N="2227" /> Council, and I am not even yet decided in my mind to do so, but I feel that a large portion of the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs to-night may have the result, when I examine the matter and think over it, that it may practically force me into the position of asking that these matters that have been referred to by him there, by suggestion and innuendo, should be made matters of inquiry, the evidence at which will, at any rate, later on, be made public.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the spirit of the mutiny, however, I think some words are necessary.  I personally, and all our Army officers that have stood loyal to their work, have been in the position of keeping our mouths shut while lying rumour and suggestions of all kinds have been spread throughout the city and the country as to what the actual position with regard to us is and what our mentality is.  I think it is desirable, therefore, to make one or two remarks with regard to the spirit of the mutiny or to read one or two documents that will carry the suggestion in them as to what the spirit of the mutiny is.  The resignations that were solicited in Cork ran in this form:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I so and so, do hereby request that you tender to President Cosgrave on my behalf my resignation from the Free State Army as a formal protest against the action of the Army Executive Council in their continued and studied neglect of the best interest of the country, as evidenced by their action in continual demobilising of officers who have endeavoured to place our country on the road to complete freedom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the form in which resignations were solicited.  The resignation from a prominent officer in the Waterford Command, ran:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hereby tender my resignation from the Army as a protest against the demobilisation of old I.R.A. men, while ex-British officers and soldiers, and men, who never during their lives gave one hour of voluntary service to Ireland are being retained as officers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When approached subsequently by <Col N="2228" /> some follow officers and urged to explain his attitude in his resignation, he said he could not leave down a man like Tobin, who had been put into a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; job; he should have been made Commissioner of the D.M.P.; that there were at least 12 men retained in the Army who were ex-British officers, and that as long as any of those were retained no pre-truce officer should be demobilised. The matter of making nominations and selections for demobilisation were made in a way that I think it well to mention at this particular moment.  In consultation with the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General. I made the first nucleus of nominations to the positions on G.H.Q. staff, the Commands and the Brigades. Each G.O.C. was then given a certain number of complete battalions to nominate officer personnel for.  Heads of Corps and Services were invited to send in their nominations to positions. especially on the establishment, as far as their own services were concerned.</P>
    <P>In that way nominations were made to every position on the establishment that had been prepared in detail and to every position in the reserve.  Lists for demobilisation were carefully gone over at meetings that in process of development lasted from the 12th February to the 21st February, inclusive.  The officers who sat over that particular work were General McMahon, Chief of Staff; Lieut.  General O'Sullivan, Adjutant-General; Lieut-General Shean O'Muirthuille, Quartermaster-General; Major-General D. Hogan, G.O.C., Dublin Command; Major-General Peader McMahon, G.O.C., Curragh; Major-General McKeon, G.O.C., Athlone; Major-General Sweeney, G.O.C., Donegal; Major-General Michael Hogan, G.O.C., Claremorris; Major-General Prout, G.O.C., Waterford; Major-General Michael Brennan, G.O.C., Limerick; and Major-General D. Reynolds, G.O.C., Cork.  When the complete lists of nominations and lists of demobilisation were definitely settled there were about 90 names of officers left, whom various G.O.C.'s were anxious should be retained for the present.  In order to avoid the situation of eliminating men who might be considered better than perhaps some who were actually put down on the actual reserve that was proposed <Col N="2229" /> as establishment, I stated I would take those 90 odd officers and accept them as an additional reserve because of the fact that it might be anticipated that a certain number of resignations would come about, and that a number of officers whom we proposed for retention might be turned down on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>The position then arising out of these demobilisations is that certain events occurred.  The Executive Council take up a particular attitude, they pursue a line of conduct that in my opinion is condoning mutiny and is fostering mutiny, and is prejudicial to the discipline of the Army.  They take the extraordinary step arising out of and as an immediate sequel to the arrests made last night of officers who had committed offences, of removing the Chief-of-Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General, and of doing it in such a way as to take them from their tables, dropping the pen out of their hands, planting them outside the door, and telling me when I say that the position of the reorganisation is such that their deputies have not yet reported there&mdash;when I say I have no officer that I consider suitable to take up their work, telling me that that will be their responsibility, and that it will be the responsibility of General O'Duffy&mdash;a man who has been taken from work that he was wanted pretty badly at, and placed in a most extraordinary position, in what was supposed to be a time of crisis, perhaps a time of fighting.  The extraordinary position has been taken up of placing a man who was away from military work &mdash;who had not been in touch with the work of the Army, or the development of the Army for many months past; who practically had not been in touch with the Army in its definite development at all; who had applied himself to an entirely different outlook on things &mdash;of placing him in charge of the Army in a time of crisis, with the necessary reaction on the Army, that the men who, whether in high rank or low rank, were capable of dealing with the situation of the last two years, and the machine that was capable of doing it, could not give from amongst its officer personnel a man capable or trustworthy enough to be put in charge of the Army <Col N="2230" /> at the present time.  The suggestion has been made here that certain people felt that the Army as it exists to-day, could not be relied upon to be the obedient and willing instrument of any administration carrying on as an Irish Government.  I say that is an absolute mis-statement of fact, and if people were very concerned from that particular point of view, I suggest to the Dáil they would not take the extraordinary steps that the Executive Council are taking to-day in removing the three principal officers in the Army.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly confident that General O'Duffy in his new and very difficult position will get absolute and scrupulous service from every officer in the Army who is untouched by the mutiny which we have been speaking about for some days, and you may thank the men who have been turned down so ungraciously as they have been in the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs for the spirit of the Army.  It is such that it will serve any administration the people will set up and will conduct itself in circumstances as difficult as the circumstances which the Executive Council to-day are making for a body which has only grown into an Army in the last few years.  You have discipline in the Army in spite of many things, in spite of the interference of Ministers with individuals in the Army.  I should like to say with regard to suggestions made regarding the Chief of Staff that I do not know what the decision is in the minds of other members of the Executive Council.  I would like to say that the members of the Executive Council have allowed themselves to be impressed by story and rumour with regard to those persons. It has been suggested to you that men may become unuseful by their considerable unpopularity.  The Adjutant-General is a person responsible for discipline in the Army, and can very well be regarded as having run great risks of unpopularity.  The Quartermaster-General is looked upon as ultra political.  We were all ultra-political when we came on the threshold of the independence of our country, and if there is one outstanding fact for the last two years, it is how completely and how scrupulously <Col N="2231" /> politicians who took upon themselves the duty of soldiers have kept themselves from political action and talking. They have left the arena of politics entirely to those who are the elected representatives of the people and have effaced themselves in the uniforms of soldiers in a way that is one of the outstanding facts of the last eighteen months in the country. It has been suggested here that those men look for gratitude.  Those men look simply to do the duty that comes their way.</P>
    <P>Some days ago the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General tendered me their resignations, and I told them my outlook on the matter was that they should carry on.  They accepted my judgment and withdrew their resignations.  They tender their resignations now asked without any cause stated, and tender with them their commissions because they might at least have expected when their resignations were asked for that they would be informed of the reason why, and they might&mdash;I put it as my own opinion &mdash;be more ceremoniously dealt with than told to drop their pens and clear out. As I say, I do not want to go into the suggestions and implications that have been made here to-night.  I simply want to be very definite in my expressions of opinion with regard to last night's action, that the action was taken in carrying out the law passed in Dáil Eireann last year, that the Adjutant-General was commissioned to carry out that law, and he did it.  He had my consent by telephone in doing it.  I consider the Executive Council is not in a position to alter the law to any extent, except according as it is altered here.  They can interfere with any sentence passed and exercise their discretion with regard to that particular sentence. Taking up the attitude apart altogether from calling for the resignation of the three officers, my position this morning was that the attitude adopted by the other members of the Executive Council with regard to the raid last night was such that I could not retain my responsible position as Minister for Defence.  The attitude taken up with regard to that was, that in carrying out the law in relation to <Col N="2232" /> the law passed here we were cutting across the path of policy supposed to be adopted by the Executive Council. That is a thing I could not stand over, particularly in circumstances that have since arisen, and in the greater and graver tendencies on the part of the Executive Council to condone the mutiny there has been, and which, as a result of their condonement, has been fostered.  It was only carrying out the law to go and arrest those officers last night.  The suggestion was made that it was done irregularly without the knowledge of General O'Duffy.  General O'Duffy has not yet taken up duty because his position was not defined to him.  His position as Inspector-General was defined to him in words yesterday. His position as G.O.C., in Executive charge of the Army proper, as distinct from the military portions of the Ministry, was only framed in words last night by the Attorney-General in consultation with myself.  It was communicated over the telephone this morning to General O'Duffy by me in order that he might think over it and see what, if anything, had to be added to it in order that he might take up his responsibility, because his attitude was that he could not take up his responsibilities unless his position was defined, and he could not be expected to take up his responsibilities or issue orders until this was done.  The action that was taken last night was an action that was putting the law into effect; refusing to put the law into effect is condoning mutiny and fostering it, and my resignation is tendered because I could not stand over that.</P>

      <P>I had no intention to intervene in this matter this evening, nor am I going to make any explanation except with regard to some statements made here, particularly the one which the Minister for Home Affairs read.  I am not going into the merits of the case at all, but I want to make my position clear.  I want to let the Dáil and the country know of what I call a miserable, dirty attempt to try and mix up matters and to try and place me in the false position of being one of those responsible for bringing about this most unfortunate position. The Minister for Home Affairs referred to the raid on my house.  I had made <Col N="2233" /> up my mind not to make any reference to that.  I refused to tell the Press that such a raid did take place, but since it has been mentioned, I may say I believe that the raid took place for one reason, and one reason only.  Coupled with that, the statement that has been made here to-night and the report of a raid that took place last night, I must make my position clear.  At 10 o'clock on Friday week last, I left the Council Chamber where the Executive Council meeting had taken place, at which I tendered my resignation.  Within eight hours my house was raided for the two officers, Major-General Tobin and Colonel Dalton.  I asked the officer had he instructions to search the house, and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That he was told to accept my word.  I told him that there were no officers there.  A ring on the telephone would have just done the same thing.  If I was considered sufficiently bad, sufficiently foolish, to harbour these men, knowing what I did know, surely my word should not have been accepted.  A definite instruction was given to the officer that my word was to be accepted.  I made up my mind&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that that raid was made to connect me and link me up definitely with the trouble, and put me in a false position before the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I arrived home at 12 o'clock.  I received information that this place was surrounded, and I got into touch with the Vice-President and told him of the situation.  I then left my house and came back into town. I tried to get into touch with Mr. McCarthy, the Chief Whip, for one reason only, and that was because he was aware of the arrangements that had been entered into, and which I considered had been broken.  I failed to get in touch with him.  I arrived on the spot myself and saw the officer in charge, and asked him what was the position.  I asked him whom he was looking for and how many, and I got very little information.  I quite understand the position, as his orders were secret.  While I was speaking to him Mr. McCarthy arrived.  This was not 10 o'clock, as stated in the report, as it was after 12 o'clock before I left my home.  I consulted with Mr. McCarthy, and I suggested that I should go into the house where the <Col N="2234" /> officers were supposed to be, and if possible to get them, if they were there, to go away.  I approached the officer, with the proprietor of the house, and asked his permission to go in, telling him my reason for going, and he agreed.  I went into the house and found it empty.  The proprietor went a little further than I did and got on to the roof and was nearly shot.  That was his own look-out, and perhaps it was his own fault for so doing.  I came out and told the officer in charge that I could find nobody. He then told me that he was awaiting instructions from headquarters before taking the premises.  I then asked him to allow me back, and I rang up another Minister to tell him the seriousness of the position.  I tried to get in touch with the officers with the one object of stopping any firing which might occur, and I am satisfied that the one sole object of the raid was to create trouble.  My effort to try and get in touch was to stop any shooting, no matter who was there, and to try and get them if possible to surrender.  Some of you must know some of the men who surrendered, and I am more proud of them to-day than I ever was, because of their action.  The Minister for Home Affairs read out a report, but he did not read all that was in it.  Some of it is struck out.</P>

      <P>Pardon me.  I read all the report except one sentence. I asked the Minister for Defence whether it was his view that it should be treated as an official report and read in its entirety.  He drew his pencil through one sentence which he did not think should be read.</P>

      <P>I am not going to say what it is, but I say that if the Report is as true as that statement, which was not read, and which a pencil has been drawn through, very little reliance can be placed on it.  Mr. McCarthy was present, and I ask that nobody speaks before him now.  He was present when I asked the officer to allow me to see the prisoners before he took any away, and again I did so, with a view to saving any possible trouble; because I had actually to get between some of the prisoners <Col N="2235" /> and one of the officers who took their surrender.  I wanted to see things properly and smoothly carried out all the time without one shot being fired, because I knew what one shot would mean.  He told me that they were ready, and that I could go and speak to them.  The officer in charge and the second officer in charge were present.  I asked had he any warrants.  He said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; that he had warrants for three. I asked how and why he was arresting the others.  I had very good reasons for asking those questions&mdash;very, very good reasons.  He told me &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that he had written instructions, written orders from the Adjutant-General, to do so.  That is all I said.  I did not say to the prisoners that the Government were not behind this action.  I said no such thing.  It is quite apparent that some of this report that was read here this evening is taken from the Press.  I did say to the Press that I understood&mdash;and I do say now&mdash; that it was purely a military action, and that the Government had not been consulted.  At that time it was merely an expression of opinion, and I think it has been confirmed by the statement of the Minister for Home Affairs last night.</P>
      <P>Now, the night that my house was raided, the houses of several of my friends were raided.  And, strange to say, in this report to-night some of my friends are mentioned as having turned up on that spot last night who were not there at all.  That, also, I can prove to the satisfaction of everybody.  They were not there at all last night, and they are mentioned there as turning up at ten o'clock or some hour last night. The raid on my house and this statement and the innuendoes contained in it are with one object, and one object alone&mdash;to place me in a false position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My efforts to settle this thing extend over 15 or 16 months.  I tried everything that was humanly possible to bring about a settlement, without result. It came to this point: I took certain action.  I am satisfied I took the right action.  I did promise to make a statement.  I was prevailed on not to do so.  I am prepared, and will make that statement, and give all the facts and details to the tribunal that is suggested. <Col N="2236" /> As I said in the beginning. I had no intention of speaking on this matter.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Home Affairs put the facts clearly before you.  I do not want to go into the merits or demerits.  I say it is shameful, it is disgusting, and I do hope it will never happen to another Minister or member of the Free State Government that when he takes action with honest motives, this method will be used to try and place him in a false position before the country.</P>

      <P>When I asked the Minister at Question Time whether we would have an opportunity to debate this issue, I did not realise the very serious situation which had arisen&mdash;a situation that may endanger the fabric of the State.  We have now a third of the Executive Council resigned, and I feel that further debate of this kind, until we have more time for thought, may be very injurious.  I would suggest, if the Vice-President is agreeable, that the Dáil should adjourn now, and that an opportunity should be given for discussion&mdash;I think it will have to be earlier than next week.  We shall have, I think, to discuss this matter to-morrow. If the Vice-President would move the adjournment of the Dáil until to-morrow we could go on with this discussion then, having considered and thought the matter out.  I think it is very wise to refrain from any rash statement, and if the Minister would take the course I suggest it would give us an opportunity of debating the matter to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I agree generally with what Deputy Bryan Copper has said on this matter.  One does not want to be tempted into saying things one would be sorry for.  I will say <Col N="2237" /> this: having heard the lamentable stories we have heard as to the situation that has been created within the Executive, notwithstanding the fact that it is apparent that both the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Defence&mdash;and I am sure every other member&mdash;seem at one in the intention of insisting upon discipline in the Army and loyalty to the Civil Authority, notwithstanding that fundamental agreement, they have been existing for months apparently without having been able to arrive at the means of insisting upon that discipline and that loyalty to the Civil Authority. I have said all that was necessary to be said about the conduct of those members of the Army who sent in the ultimatum.  I have not said all I would like to say, and all I have thought, about the events subsequent to the discussion of yesterday week. I think it is, as I said at first, lamentable that this state of affairs should have arisen amongst men who seem to be at one absolutely in the desire to insist that political influence from within the Army shall not be sought to be imposed upon the political Executive of this country.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much the spirit of Deputy Cooper's suggestion and the restraint exercised by both himself and Deputy Johnson in dealing with this matter.  It is an entirely new matter to Deputies.  It is naturally a blow and a shock to Deputies, and, unlike ourselves, they have not had the opportunity during the day of, at any rate, some kind of reflection upon it and upon its possible and probable reactions.  I think it would be a good thing to postpone further discussion until the adjournment is moved to-morrow <Col N="2238" /> evening.  While I say that, let it be well understood that if there is a desire in any part of the House to prolong this present debate, that, equally, would meet with the approval and consent of the present Executive Council.  But if there is a general feeling that we should adjourn now and that such discussion as might follow would take place to-morrow night on the adjournment, we are agreeable.</P>

      <P>Peter Dempsey, Rathangan, U.I. Book No. Kildare/645 claimed benefit at Kildare on the 4th January, 1924.  Reference to his account with the Unemployment Insurance fund showed that no contributions had been paid on his behalf at any time and the claimant was, therefore, not entitled to credit of contributions in respect of his army service under Section 7 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923.  It was, however, ascertained that previous to his army service Mr. Dempsey had been engaged in insurable employment for a period of 14 weeks ended April, 1922, about <Col N="2120" /> which time he joined the Army, and that contributions had not been paid on his behalf in respect of that employment.
