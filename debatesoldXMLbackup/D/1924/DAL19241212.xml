      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 3, sub-section (1), of the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1924, which has just passed through the Dáil, it is intended that ex-Army men brought into Special Benefit by the Bill can begin completing their waiting week now.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has put down this question, as it draws attention to a point to which I had intended to give as much publicity as possible during the discussions here on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions for the receipt of Special Benefit will be the same as for ordinary Unemployment Benefit. Among these is the condition that six days' unemployment, known as the waiting week, must be proved before an applicant is eligible for benefit.  No <Col N="2557" /> benefit is payable for these six days. It may, therefore, be fourteen days before an applicant actually receives any payment.</P>
    <P>The paragraph referred to in the question was included in the Bill to enable the waiting week to be completed now, so that the ex-Army man may be entitled to receive payment, if he satisfies the other conditions, as soon as possible after the passing of the Bill. For this purpose he should, if unemployed, attend the Unemployment Exchange to sign the register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph referred to in the question was put in specially to meet the case of the ex-Army men.  It was thought they would be the only people who might be prevented by the terms of the Bill from receiving payment before Christmas. It was believed, in the case of the others, inasmuch as this waiting week would already have passed for most of them, that the payments would be made.  This was to meet the only possible exception that seemed likely to occur.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the number of prisoners who have been released following on the Government's declaration of an amnesty; the number of prisoners whose cases have been reviewed and in which decisions have been reached; the total number of prisoners who would be entitled to have their sentences reviewed under this declaration, and if steps will be taken to expedite the proceeding so that these prisoners may be released before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 28th August last there were 861 male prisoners in custody exclusive of 48 persons then detained under the Public Safety (Powers of Arrest and Detention) Act, 1924.  630 of these were sentenced and 231 were on remand or awaiting trial. Of the 861, 269 had been released from custody in the ordinary course by the 22nd November.  There then remained 592.  Of these 592, there were 475 where either the offence was committed outside the period 6th December, 1921, to 12th May, 1923, or where the nature of the offence and the known character of the prisoner were such as to make it reasonably clear that no question of any special mitigation could arise. There were, therefore, on that date, 117 cases which had to be examined in detail before any careful decision could be taken as to whether there were cases amongst them coming within the spirit of the Executive Council's resolution. This involved a considerable amount of work.  It was decided as a first step to make an effort to pick out the cases of least doubt for immediate action and to follow up with a more detailed examination. As a result of the first step, 6 prisoners had the unexpired portion of their sentence remitted on the 26th November; and proceedings were discontinued in 7 cases in respect of thirteen offences.  That left 104 cases to be examined.  The analysis of these cases will be completed before Christmas. I understand that the vast majority of them could not by any standard be regarded as anything but cases of ordinary crime.  If there are <Col N="2560" /> any remaining cases which might be said to come within the spirit of the Executive Council's resolution, I believe that the number will not exceed 20, and a final decision will be taken before Christmas.</P>

There are no persons detained under the Public Safety Act for offences which could, by any stretch of the imagination, be termed political offences.  The cases of persons so detained are reviewed, as a matter of fact, automatically from month to month, and there is a tendency and a willingness to release such persons whenever the conditions in their area renders that course possible, or when they are willing to enter into recognisances to keep the peace with their neighbours in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that the goods store and the parcel office at Dungarvan Railway Station were feloniously entered on the night of the 19th November, 1924, and a very considerable quantity of property taken away. The surrounding circumstances point to the fact that the outrage was committed by persons who had a thorough knowledge of the premises.  In the course of their investigations the police thought it prudent to search the houses of two railway employees, and they obtained the necessary search warrants which the law provides for such purposes. The houses were duly searched, but nothing incriminating was found.  I merely state these facts for the Deputy's information, and I am unable to see that there is anything which calls for special comment.

If it is necessary to mention a particular time for that, I will have to mention a rather late hour: 7 p.m.  That long sitting involves an hour's adjournment for lunch, and a half hour's adjournment for tea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  It is due that I should say a word in explanation of that.  Normally, there would be substance and point in what Deputy Davin <Col N="2564" /> said yesterday, that it is scarcely reasonable, at the close of the session, when there is pressure of business, to bring in a Bill which cannot become law this side of the Recess.  But the point is, that if the principle of this Bill were approved by the Dáil, I would proceed administratively to act almost as if the Bill were law.  I would not do anything, of course, that I would not have legal power to do, but the trend of administration would be based on the fact that the Dáil approved the principle of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to enter my protest against the tactics adopted by the Vice-President and the Government in depriving Deputies of their rights. Two hours from 2 o'clock are allowed Deputies on Wednesdays and Fridays for private business, and now we are told that the Government require all the time and that private business can only come on after 7 o'clock this evening.  I do not think it is fair to expect Deputies to remain here until 7 o'clock to-night, for the purpose of considering private business. I think the Government should facilitate the discussion of, at least, item 8 on the Orders of the Day, as it has been on the Order Paper for nearly a fortnight.  That is not too much to ask.</P>

Private business would be dealt with, under Standing Orders, from 2 o'clock until 4 o'clock to-day.

I have personally facilitated the Government on two occasions, in connection with this Motion, by allowing them to go on with public business. Now, we are told that it cannot come on until 7 o'clock this evening.  Could not the Minister take this Motion at 2 o'clock and proceed with public business after 4 o'clock?</P>

      <P>When progress was reported last night, Amendment 3 was under discussion. The amendment, as altered last evening, would read: &ldquo;To add at the end of Section 2 the words, &lsquo;Provided that such director shall not be entitled to vote on any proposal to cancel or alter the agreement referred to in line 31 of the Preamble to this Act.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to address myself to the merits of this proposed amendment when the time for adjournment came last night. I had emphasised the point that I considered that any such amendment would be a variation of the undertaking providing for a director, and would consequently be a breach of the agreement. Even though that is not a point for your consideration, A Chinn Comhairle, on the question of order, it is a point that I would urge on the merits. There has been an agreement entered into&mdash;this much talked of agreement. On the one side, the consideration was the right to nominate a director.  That director was intended to be a director, with all the powers which any other director has, and any cutting down of his powers would, I submit, be a breach of the agreement.  There is a further point, that if the agreement be read it will be seen that there is no specific provision made for cancellation or variation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, indeed, a specific provision <Col N="2568" /> that it is to continue until 1940.  That provision occurs towards the end of the letter of the 19th November, which forms part of the agreement which has been circulated to Deputies.  There is no other provision in it with regard to time.  There is that point, that it is to be, as far as the L.M. and S. Railway Company are concerned, binding on them for the period up to 1940.  There is no specific provision laid down with regard to cancellation or variation.  It is, of course, possible to vary it or cancel it by agreement.  But it is a matter of agreement, the question of voting does not come in, and the question of whether or not this director has the right to vote, is not material.  The amendment seems to me (1) to be capable of interpretation as a breach of the agreement, consequently defeating the whole object of the Bill, and (2) to be useless&mdash;absolutely useless.  It may lead to a mischevious interpretation, and it is absolutely of no use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson, in speaking on this amendment last night, endeavoured to persuade the Dáil that he was a much simpler individual in regard to matters of this kind than I know him to be.  Deputy Johnson was on an Irish Railway Commission, which sat from 9 to 12 months.  As a member of that Commission, he had placed at his disposal documents, agreements and figures relating to railway matters, which members of this House have never had an opportunity of seeing. Therefore, so far as his knowledge of agreements and statistics in connection with railway matters is concerned, I make bold to say that it is greater than mine.  Consciously or unconsciously, he endeavoured to persuade the House that there was nobody in the Dáil in a position to deal with this particular agreement, except the Minister and myself. By referring to me in that way he tried to imply that because I was a part-time employee of one of the companies concerned, it was my responsibility to explain every aspect of the agreement to Deputies.  That is certainly not the position.  It is true that if the Minister brings in a Bill of this kind, Deputy Johnson is entitled to place the responsibility upon the Minister's shoulders and make him justify <Col N="2569" /> his action in doing so.  But it is not open to him to insinuate or imply that I have any direct responsibility, on the part of the company, to assist the Minister to get this Bill through.</P>
      <P>So much for that part of the argument. He made the extraordinary statement, which was supported by the interjection of Deputy Mulcahy, that the Great Southern Company were actually bullied into this agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Mulcahy knows&mdash;and I think he does know&mdash; the Chairman of the Great Southern Railway Company&mdash;the past history of that gentleman, and his many connections in regard to matters in this country, he would know he is past being bullied into anything.  It was not possible to bully him into taking back into the service&mdash;from the Governmental point of view&mdash;men who were victimised out of the service, and who supported Deputy Mulcahy in the fight in pre-Truce days.  The bullying aspect of the case may be left out altogether.</P>
      <P>It may be true, to an extent, to say that I do naturally know something about the effect of this agreement; but in reality, if we wanted what Deputy Johnson looks for, the particulars of the concessions, we would have to get a blackboard and chalk in the Dáil, supply Deputies with slates and pencils, and then lectures could be delivered by some railway rates expert and, perhaps, members of the chartered accountants' associations in this country, with a view to proving what Deputy Johnson is not prepared to prove.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>None from me, at any rate; I did not say anything.  Taking the amendment on its merits, even if it were inserted it would be unworkable, and this unknown and unnamed director, who is going to bully and rule the railways of this country in future, would not be so foolish, in a body of sixteen, as to put to a vote the cancelling or otherwise of this agreement. This agreement, like all agreements, is made between an equal number of representatives of interested parties.  The same applies in labour disputes as in railway matters.  If it is to be cancelled, it will be cancelled by agreement between the full number, and it cannot be cancelled by one member of this new amalgamated company as against fifteen others.  Even if the amendment were inserted there would be nothing gained, and, in practice, it would be unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume we had another public concern outside railway matters, and that you had, for instance, a business with Deputy Johnson as director.  Suppose that part of that business was a fish and chip shop, another part dealt with hardware, and another section <Col N="2571" /> was a beer department.  Would Deputy Johnson, as a director of such a concern, say that he had a right to interfere in the hardware and the beer departments, but that he had no right to deal with the business in the fish and chip shop section?  Take a case from the Trade Union point of view. Suppose I was a member of a Union and worked in an industry.  Suppose that Union catered for other workers in other industries.  If I was a member of the Executive of that Union, would it be imposed on me, by Deputy Johnson or anybody else, that I should be denied the right to take part in discussions on different matters?  I could argue my own case against this ridiculous amendment, but we have wasted time on the matter already, and if Deputy Johnson feels sufficiently keenly on the subject to put it to a division, let that division be called and then let us record our opinions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin is very kind to the Minister.  He has raised quite a number of questions, but I would like to draw his attention, and the attention of the Dáil, to the fact that the amendment was put in before we had any opportunity of reading this so-called agreement.  My aim in putting down the amendment is to limit the powers of the director, who is to be appointed by the London, Midland and Scottish on this Irish company in exchange for certain concessions.  Of course, a somewhat new light has been thrown on the business by the Minister's remark last night&mdash;and this satisfies Deputy Davin, no doubt&mdash;that the new director is really being appointed because of the fact that the London, Midland and Scottish is in reality creating, as part of its contribution to the share capital, new stock, this concession having been valued by the Tribunal, the capital value of the concession, as estimated, being created and being ostensibly the share capital of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least the contribution of the London, Midland and Scottish to the capital of the new company warrants the Minister in promising to agree that the London, Midland and Scottish should <Col N="2572" /> have a director on this railway.  There are possibilities, of course, that questions will arise as to whether the agreement refers to the modes of division and the termination of arrangements of one kind or another.  There will be questions arising, I have no doubt, that I cannot foresee.  If such questions did arise within the board, surely it is not reasonable to suggest that the watch-dog nominee of the London, Midland and Scottish should have a voice in determining the policy of the Irish company on a matter which might mean loss or gain to itself, or alternatively to the London, Midland and Scottish?</P>

      <P>The watch-dog placed in the position by the London, Midland and Scottish Company, with the assent of the Dáil, on the Irish Railway Board, will be able to exercise a considerable amount of influence in the interests of the London, Midland and Scottish Company.  I want to curtail that influence, if possible, and the object of this amendment is to indicate the desire of the Dáil that that influence should be curtailed when it comes to discussing the terms of the arrangements and agreements that have been entered into, that may be entered into, or any revision of them.  It may be the precise terms of the amendment would not secure that; but, at any rate, if the Dáil approves of the intention, there may be a possibility, on the Report Stage, of amending the phraseology. The main point, however, is deciding whether the Dáil wishes that this director to be appointed by the London, Midland and Scottish Company to help the Irish Railways Company in the interests of the London, Midland and Scottish Company, shall have unlimited powers&mdash;that is the point I want to put before the Dáil, and I hope the Dáil will support me in the view that I have expressed.</P>

      <P>It would have been much simpler for Deputy Davin to say: &ldquo;After all, members of the Dáil, this Bill has got a Second Reading; we took a division on it, and why not let it rest at that?&rdquo;  That is practically <Col N="2573" /> what his remarks, with regard to this particular amendment, mean.  The board of the amalgamated railways, while itself the board of a private company from one point of view, is the nearest approach that we have yet got, here in Ireland, to what we call a vocational council.  It is the bringing into focus of the complete outlook on the control of our home railways; but it is also the bringing into focus of general intelligence, general understanding and general discussion on railway matters from the detached point of view.</P>
      <P>We will be constrained in our outlook here, on general railway matters, by the views of the principles that will be formulated from time to time in connection with various matters by this amalgamated board.  So that we are introducing into a machine of that kind an outside director, a director of a railway company which is not belonging to this State and is not concerned in the interests of this State, but who has been put on because of a business arrangement that we cannot get complete details of, or a complete understanding of.  The director is put on in a manner which some of us, at any rate, regard as most undesirable from the point of view of developing the national position here.  If we do not put in this amendment, we are going to give him, at some particular time, a veto on the Irish consideration of the question as to whether or not there should be a director of an outside State on our Amalgamated Railway Board.</P>

They will not in any case influence the decisions of the Irish <Col N="2574" /> railway directors.  The only fear that I have in the matter is that the director is to be nominated by the London, Midland and Scottish for a consideration of £20,000 a year, which they may withdraw at any moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I do not understand what vocational councils are, but it is well to remind the Deputy that after the first year this will be a self-elected body, elected in secret and no information will be given as to the grounds on which these people will be selected.  We heard a great deal when railway disputes arose and when the Railway Act was going through the Dáil, about the number of widows and orphans dependent on shares held in railway companies, and we also heard about the number of charitable institutions, Catholic bodies and others having financial interest in railway concerns. Would Deputy Mulcahy look through the list of these thirteen directors and the thirteen officials who have been nominated, and tell me how many of them represent Catholic institutions and widows and orphans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I made use of the expression &ldquo;vocational council&rdquo; in connection with this matter in the sense that if the people who have interests in the railway companies elect for a railway service, that is as widespread and as national as the Amalgamated Company will be, a certain number of directors to do their work, they will be elected by most people in the country as persons who know most <Col N="2575" /> about railway work here.  From that point of view people will be inclined to look to them for information and guidance in all matters dealing with railway work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The spectacle of General Mulcahy endeavouring, in the absence of chalk and a blackboard, to explain to Labour Deputies what a vocational council is, and taking as his first example of such council a railway directorate, is very entertaining, but I do not think that it is bringing us any length in dealing with this matter.  I cannot get away from feeling that Deputy Johnson has been indulging in some of those exhibitions of a light type to which the Minister for Local Government referred yesterday.  Recently I noticed that there was a familiar ring in the Deputy's speeches, but I did not know where they came from until I got hold of a novel of the good old melodramatic type in which the usual story is unfolded&mdash;how the rich man, with a beautiful daughter, falls into the grip of a moneylender, who comes along finally and threatens the daughter that if she does not marry him, he will lend no more money to her father.  That seems to me to be the position here.  If we do not elect the director we will get no more money. Deputy Johnson is afraid that the director to be appointed is going to have what Deputy Mulcahy first called a veto, but then weakened his argument and called it a vote, and that this £20,000 must continue against our wishes, as if in these circumstances there was no other way out of the difficulty. Can this Bill not be repealed if it is contrary to the wishes of a large section of people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I have no belief in the power of the London, Midland and Scottish Company to bully the new amalgamated company.  I do not believe in granting this supposed superiority to certain people. It is evident that close co-operation is desirable, and this is one of the ways to achieve it, and there has been consideration on both sides.  If Deputy Johnson's attitude of mind is that nothing should be done by Saorstát Eireann to its own advantage if, while securing that advantage, it brings, incidentally, advantage to somebody else, I must say that I cannot see how any agreement is ever going to be entered into with anybody.  Agreements generally are bilateral and have consideration <Col N="2577" /> for both sides.  If the Deputy persists in that attitude, that a thing which helps this country and also helps somebody else must be ruled out, I say that on that basis there could be no agreement with anybody.</P>
      <P>Suppose, for instance, that in regard to this question of sugar beet, which is so very much in the air, it was decided, as it has been decided in other countries, that some outside, expert body were to come in and build a factory, that the Government were to subsidise it, put up portion of the capital, and that there had to be an arrangement with the Government which would enable foreigners to have part control or to co-operate in the control of such factory, would Deputy Johnson object if we put ourselves under the control of a Dutchman, Frenchman or Belgian? Would his argument be that because this factory is going to do benefit to these people, even though it does more benefit to the Saorstát, it should not be proceeded with and no agreement should be entered into?  As I have already said, this amendment is useless and effects nothing, but it will do damage if it can be interpreted as a breach of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that I am taking up an attitude which makes it impossible for any agreement to be entered into by this country with any other country, for advantage to this country, which did not preclude the possibility of advantage being derived to the other country by it, and that, if we take commercial relations, we should not enter into any agreement which incidentally gave advantage to another organisation.  That, of course, is a mere parody of anything I said or indicated.  I have been sufficiently versed in the development of social organisation, whether political or economic, to know that mankind is growing more and more interdependent and that the advantage of one may be, and usually is, the advantage of another, that there is mutual advantage, and that we ought to aim at mutual advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example, the Minister suggested sugar beet production.  I would say, quite distinctly, that if sugar beet <Col N="2578" /> and its production were as essential to the life of Ireland as the railways are, and if there was competition between British sugar beet production and Irish sugar beet production, I would certainly preclude, or deny, the right of a British sugar beet company to establish itself in a responsible position to decide whether or not Irish sugar beet should be continued, or to influence the policy of the Irish company.  That is if Irish sugar beet production were as essential to the life of Ireland as Irish railway administration is in connection with transportation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the objection to the principle has disappeared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The railway service in Ireland is a public service on which the whole economic life of Ireland largely depends and, in my view, it should be developed for the social and industrial advantage of the country. The Dáil, on the other hand, knows that it has been the theme of many essays and economic writings that Irish railway policy has influenced Irish national and economic life in such a way as to feed and serve British railway interests at the cost of Irish industrial interests.  That is the proposition, and if that is true, and any member on the other side of the House denying it would be going contrary to past protestations, I say that to bring any influence on the Irish railway system which would tend to perpetuate that policy is wrong in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the principle to which I am objecting, because the Irish railway service is a national service and is as essential, or ought to be, to the national life as, shall I say, the Ministry of Local Government.  Suppose you brought into the Ministry for Local Government a British railway director, or into the Ministry for Finance a nominee of the British Government, to assist, advise, and help&mdash;and, of course, it has always been the contention that the nominees of the British Government in every country have always been for the benefit of the other countries&mdash;this is, in my opinion, analogous.  The proposition is that the British railway service shall put in a director on an Irish railway <Col N="2579" /> concern to look after British interests. We know, unfortunately, that the railway directors at present in charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am answering the Minister's challenge about the principle. I submit that when dealing with the directorate we have to consider the directorate as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These directors have advanced a policy which conformed with British railway policy, inasmuch as it was beneficial to shareholding interests in Irish railways as a purely commercial undertaking. The Minister can have all he asks if he can disassociate Irish railways from national, economic, and <Col N="2580" /> social policy.  It is because Irish railways should subserve national policy that I object to the nominee of the British railway service influencing that policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer Deputy Johnson briefly.  His argument seems to be that it is necessary, from the point of view of the nation, to object to British railway control.  One director on a board of sixteen means British control, and therefore we must object to one director&mdash;that is his argument. I do not admit that the appointment of that one director means that he is to have control.  I do not see how anyone could argue that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I am obliged to make one or two further observations in regard to this Bill.  First of all, I think that it is only right to point out that the Deputies who, for good reasons, from their own points of view, opposed the passing of the Bill, have neglected a very important fact, that under the Railways Act there is a tribunal, an Irish tribunal absolutely, which will be there for the purpose of <Col N="2582" /> checking any anti-Irish influences that are likely to be brought into the administration of the railways by the inclusion of this director.  Therefore to that extent a good deal of the suspicion is unfounded.  There is another thing which I hope Deputy Mulcahy will take steps to remedy as soon as he can, so far as his own views and vote will go; that is, that this agreement, obnoxious as it appears to him, can be cancelled as soon after the 1st of January of the coming year as he and the majority of Deputies will decide to place the fate and future of the Irish railways in the hands of the Free State Government, and free from any of these extraordinary influences which are likely to be brought into the administration by this bulldog director who has been so often referred to.</P>
      <P>I want to say I believe, from my own experience, that the passing of this Bill will do more than anything that has yet been done to develop the tourist traffic of this country.  If the Bill was turned down, from what I know of what is likely to happen, there would be a disagreement between the parties who can do a good deal for the tourist traffic, and it would be seriously interfered with; the traffic that might otherwise come into the Free State area would be diverted to the Northern area, where we would not be in a position to control it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from practical experience, and I am sure that Deputy Johnson will realise that without co-operation internationally between the railways and shipping companies tourist development cannot be assisted and encouraged; that is a fact; let Deputy Johnson dispute it if he can.  Deputy Johnson has made an extraordinary statement, that it is the function of the Irish railway companies to foster and develop trade internally. He is overlooking the fact that people have to travel outside their own country on business on some occasions, and for pleasure on others, and that we are not, up to the present at any rate, a self-supporting country.  I have on one or two occasions, when travelling on the Continent during the last two <Col N="2583" /> years, read the type of article that was written in the Continental &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; endeavouring to prove to anybody who would read it, and particularly to tourists, that this country was a very unsafe place to come to or to live in.  I think that that type of propaganda should be counteracted wherever possible by the representatives of the Free State in France or Italy, and even in America.  Judge Cohalan has recently referred to the benefits that are likely to accrue to this country by the development of the tourist traffic. I notice that Deputy Mulcahy smiles when I mention the name&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I smiled at this insistence on tourist traffic, tourist traffic, tourist traffic, as if none of us would have to work if we had a sufficient amount of tourist traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourist traffic brought to this country in pre-war days a sum of money estimated at £6,000,000, and I think that Deputy Mulcahy and everybody else will agree that if there was a revival and, perhaps, an increase of that traffic it would be to the advantage of the State, and that the money that would be spent by tourists would be spent on food and other things which are produced by the farmers and distributed by other people, and consequently it would provide employment in the natural course of events.  I made a statement on the Second Reading of the Bill for reasons that were then correct, but which I want to qualify to an extent, and in qualifying it I may say that it was made in agreement with two other representatives of the railway trade unions, who are more concerned in this matter than I am.  I said: &ldquo;It is correct to say that the conditions of service of the employees of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in Ireland, England and Scotland are the best enjoyed by any railway workers, whether in Ireland or England, at present.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was aware when I made that statement that two matters were the subject of negotiation between the representatives of the staff in Ireland and <Col N="2584" /> the management in England, two matters that deeply concern a section of the staff.  Negotiations were going on at the time, and in deference to the desire of the trade unions who were responsible for the negotiations I refrained from referring to them.  One of the matters has been settled to the satisfaction of the staff concerned, and the other is still outstanding.  To that extent I qualify the statement that I made, by expressing the hope that in the very near future the other matter which is still under negotiation will be settled to the satisfaction of the parties concerned.  I think it is only fair that I should qualify that statement, which was made by agreement with those concerned in the matter for other reasons than I had in my mind, or were known to me when I made the statement.  There was one other matter which I tried to get in by an amendment, the present position of the Dublin South Eastern staff&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, it has been argued, of course, that the real value of this Bill was that it was going to assist the tourist traffic.  If that is an argument for the Bill, it is the only argument of any validity that has been put forward, and is it not in order to discuss it on the Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I did not hear that argument, but Deputies will agree that I have to look on this matter in a particular way.  What I was contemplating was that if Deputy Davin's discussion was continued and we had a general discussion on the tourist traffic it would be very difficult to hold it within the scope of this Bill. I did not hear the argument advanced with regard to tourist traffic; perhaps I was not in the Chair at the time.  How would we transact our business if a line like this, taken by a particular Deputy, were to be followed up by other Deputies, because the line taken up by one Deputy must be allowed to be followed by other Deputies, since all Deputies are free and equal?</P>

      <P>The position last night was that I moved the amendment and that the Minister put forward a counter proposal, not quite accepting the principle of proportional representation, but making it obligatory that the representatives of the county council on the board of health should be elected according to area.  I am afraid that that could not be accepted on this side of the House, because it would vitiate the whole principle of proportional representation as far as those <Col N="2587" /> elections are concerned.  Our intention is that the board of health shall be representative, as far as possible, of the respective parties returned to the county council at the election.  The proposal of the Minister that they should represent areas, rather than personnel, is not tenable and cannot be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Heffernan put down the amendment, I spoke to him about it and offered him this suggestion.  I pointed out to him that it was more important that each electoral area should be represented rather than each party.  He agreed with me, and I thought that whoever moved the amendment would be of the same opinion.  However, that does not appear to be so.  During the discussion, on the other stages of the Bill, this point was particularly stressed, that the board of health should be representative of every area.  It was stressed even more than the point that each party should have representation.  I have been trying to see how I could give effect to that, and I consider that the main thing, at all events, is to see that each electoral area has representation.  It was with that view I put forward my amendment.</P>
      <P>I have been thinking over the matter since, and I think I can give effect to the two ideas by inserting at a later stage, perhaps in the Seanad, an amendment to the effect, first of all, that each electoral area should be represented, and, after that, that the remaining representatives on the board of health should be elected by proportional representation. That would secure the two objects.  If you have, for instance, got four electoral areas in a county, that will mean that you will have, first of all, each area represented on the county board of health.  After that, there will be six remaining representatives, and these can be elected by proportional representation.  That will combine the two, and I should think satisfy Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us more information as to the number of electoral areas in the various counties?  He has given us an instance of a county having four such areas. <Col N="2588" /> But supposing a county had six.  The board of health is confined to 10 members. The method of proportional representation might be acceptable, but it does not really secure proportional representation if you have too small a number to be elected by that method, and the result sought for would not be ensured.  Perhaps the Minister would give us a little more information as to the number of electoral areas in the counties.  If there are no counties with more than four electoral areas, then the balance of six members might secure a, certain amount of representation for all the groups of opinion in the council.  But with less than, say, five, it is not very easy to get anything like proportions, even though you adopt the transferable vote method.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of members on the county council would depend upon the Bill, but six is the largest number of electoral areas in any county.  That would mean, in any case, that four members could be elected by proportional representation in each county.  At the present rate of formation of parties in the country, it is very hard to say how many parties you may have, and you probably might have more parties in the county council than members on the board of health.</P>

      <P>I cannot guarantee, no matter how many members are put on the board of health, that there would still be a member representing every body of opinion.  I think if you have four representatives, representing four different parties, it is as much representation as any one in reason could expect. I cannot go any further than I have done.  I have gone as far as I can, and if that does not meet the Deputy's views we must only take a vote on the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil disapproves of the delay which is taking place in carrying out the provisions of the Land Act, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion I do not intend to say anything that could be regarded as a personal attack on the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, on any Minister of the Executive Council, or on any individual employed by the Land Commission. But I think it is necessary that some disapproval should be shown by the Dáil of the slow methods adopted by the Land Commission in carrying out the provisions of the Land Act of 1923.  It is a well-known fact that about 75 per cent. of the people of the country have no stake or interest in the country.  You have, on one side, a certain class who are supposed to be the owners of the land of the country.  This class numbers only a few.  On the other side, you have thousands of people who are born into the world under the same circumstances as this particular class, but for whom there is no land available.  We were told that the Land Act of 1923 was really introduced on behalf of the masses of the people and not on behalf of a certain class of the community. So far, we have had no proof of the work done by the Land Commission. We have had no proof as to the lands divided or handed over to the people under the Land Act of 1923.  It was in order to get from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture some information as to when the sufferings of these uneconomic holders and landless people <Col N="2590" /> will be eased that I put this motion down.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will do everything in his power, in his reply, to try and cloak any mistakes or delays made by the Land Commission.  I feel sure that the reply will be that the Land Commission is doing everything in its power, and that a certain amount of land&mdash;some hundreds of thousands or millions of acres&mdash;have already been purchased by the Land Commission.  I ask the Minister, here and now, if he can say how many congested areas have been relieved and how many estates have been divided?  From one end of the Saorstát to the other, have 100 acres been divided under the Land Act of 1923 and handed over to the uneconomic holders?  I say there have not. There are, of course, lands which were in the hands of the Congested Districts Board, prior to coming under control of the Land Commission.  That land was purchased by the British Government and was handed over automatically in the names of the tenants chosen by that Government to the Saorstát Government for division by the Land Commission.  These lands, I admit, have been divided in the different areas where they are situate, but I maintain that there have been no lands divided under the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>As I said on Wednesday week, the Land Act is 18 months old, and surely we should expect something from an Act that is 18 months old?  We expected that some benefits would be achieved by that Act.  I may be told by the Minister that he does not want to take drastic measures to compel the owners to hand over the land.  But I would like to point out that every man born into this world is born against his will.  Seeing he comes into the world, he must live upon the surface of the earth or not live at all.  I do not see how any individual can claim ownership of the land.  No set of individuals have the right to claim that they are owners of the land.  To my mind, the land is the property of the State, and those individuals who claim to be owners of the land are only trustees for the State.  In other words, the State has entrusted to them a portion of the <Col N="2591" /> lands of the country.  I think it is nearly time that that trust should be taken from the hands of the few and should be transferred to the thousands of people willing and able to work these lands.</P>
    <P>I am sure that neither the Minister for Lands and Agriculture nor the Ministers of the Executive will say that they are under a compliment to me for bringing forward this motion.  It has been proved that in the recent elections only 45 per cent. of the people recorded their votes. Why was that?  Simply because the remaining 55 per cent. have no interest in the country.  They have nothing to live for.  Small farmers and uneconomic holders and landless people have nothing to look forward to.  You had the Land Act introduced for the purpose of election propaganda.  It was introduced in 1922 in order to safeguard the position in 1923 by getting a big majority for the Government.  During the time of the passing of that Act and afterwards, I said that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was sincere and that the Land Act was introduced to meet the uneconomic conditions.  Since that statement was made by me frequently in the country, I was compelled to put down this motion to draw some statement from the Minister regarding the working of the Act.</P>
    <P>You have in this country thousands of people who have no earthly means of livelihood.  It is a sorrowful sight for any Deputy to witness, week after week, hundreds of young men and women leaving this country to make a living in and build up a foreign State. If they had any means of living at home, they would be of benefit to this State.  But they leave the country at the age of 18 or 20, and they give their brains and intelligence and strength to the building up of another country. Surely it is time that this should cease. Surely it is time that we did something to enable the people of this country to live at home?  I quite understand that it may be a quest on of money and that the financial condition of the State may not be very healthy.  But now that England has agreed to guarantee the Land Bonds to the value of £30,000,000, there should be no further difficulty in <Col N="2592" /> purchasing and dividing these lands. The Land Commission, if they take a serious view of this question, can easily improve the conditions of the people.</P>
    <P>I know an old gentleman with 1,500 acres.  He had only a man employed on that land.  The Minister for Justice is laughing.  I can only tell him that this same man was fined last year because he did not pay the licence duty on his dog.  These are the men whom it is sought to retain in the country.  These are the men whom we want to have control of the land.  If the poor man has a cow which wanders along the road and, confronting a Civic Guard, blows her breath upon him, he is prosecuted and fined 5/-.  It as a well-known fact that unless the position of the people is improved and that the lands are divided in the coming year, there is going to be such a land campaign as has never before been experienced in this country.  I am not a bit ashamed to say here that that campaign has been already started.  It is nearly time that we forgot the idea of class and looked to the real interests of the people.</P>
    <P>It is nearly time that something would be done for the poor, struggling, uneconomic holders and small farmers. It is time their position was improved. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is the only Minister at the moment who can, in a true sense, relieve the distress amongst the unemployed.  In every town you have large numbers of agricultural labourers, small farmers and their sons, looking for work.  Very large numbers of town workers, who were engaged in factories and shops, are now unemployed.  There are too many labourers spare in every town.</P>
    <P>If an employer posts a notice in his window indicating that a man is required, there will be at least fifty or sixty applicants, and some twenty or thirty of those should really be living comfortably on the land.  When the lands of Ireland are divided, there will be, I submit, sufficient employment for agricultural workers, and it will not be necessary for them to seek employment in towns.  As a consequence, it will relieve unemployment in towns; there will be more work for town workers. The agricultural labourer or the small <Col N="2593" /> farmer will have his position improved when he gets a portion of land.</P>
    <P>I would like lo touch upon the matter of unpurchased tenants.  When the Dáil was passing the Land Act of 1923 we were told unpurchased tenants were getting a half-year's arrears wiped out; we were told they would not be penalised as rewards arrears.  What way have they been dealt with?  In every case where an unpurchased tenant was not in a position to pay, proceedings were taken against him and he was decreed. Very large numbers of decrees have been carried out.  That condition of things is very unfair.  In 1920, when the real war-cry in the country was: &ldquo;Do not recognise England; in fact, denounce her works and pomps,&rdquo; poor, struggling small farmers and uneconomic holders, being patriots in their own particular sense, thought the best thing they could do was to retain the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that the unpurchased tenants who came under the Land Act would be seen to immediately.  So far they have not been, and it is nearly time the Minister would do something in order LO relieve distress amongst them.  I desire to touch upon the delay that is taking place in connection with Land Bank Tenants under the ]923 Act.  In some eases Land Bank Tenants are paying to the extent of £7 10s. 0d. an acre.  The land they have is worked by trustees; the trustees are responsible to the bank and the tenants had to borrow.  They were not lucky enough to be able to afford money without borrowing.  They borrowed from the bank and are paying 7 per cent.  The Land Bank advances two-thirds and the tenants pay, on that, 5 per cent. They lodge the full amount to the bank and in place of getting <Col N="2594" /> interest on the one-third, they have to pay 4½ per cent. on that one-third.  They have never received any communication indicating how much they are in debt or when it is likely t3iat the lands will be their property.</P>
      <P>Part 3 of the Land Act has been drafted specially to deal with Laud Bank tenants, in consequence of numerous deputations and communications received by the Minister.  Up to the present the Land Bank tenants are in the same position as they were in 1921 and 1922; there is no improvement. I think the Minister should make some satisfactory statement on this point.  As regards distress in the different districts, that could be relieved by the Minister if the thousands of acres in the hands of the few at the moment were distributed amongst the thousands of people anxious and tiling to work them.  If that could be done, it will be one of the best things that this Dáil has ever countenanced. I feel confident that when the Minister is replying, his statement will be so satisfactory that it will raise the hearts of every uneconomic holder and landless man.</P>
      <P>I believe it will give those people a better sense of responsibility towards their country; it will make them believe. in the true sense, that they are genuine citizens and are looked upon as such, and not as slaves; it will indicate that it is the intention of this Government, as it was the intention of the Government that has evacuated the country, to look to the interests of the people in a proper manner, and that it is determined to improve the condition of the uneconomic holders and so prevent the possibility of starvation and want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government is anxious about the welfare of the country, and if it holds the opinion that it is composed of the only men in this country able to govern, then I put it to the Government that it is nearly time the welfare of the populace, particularly the uneconomic holders and small farmers, was considered. If those now in power desire to retain control, they should at once put the sections of the Land Act into force and so prove to an other <Col N="2595" /> wise doubtful people they are genuinely interested in helping them forward and are not anxious to fool them, as to all appearances they have been fooled up to the present in connection with this Land Act.</P>
    <P>I could, of course, speak for six hours upon this question, but I have not the least idea of doing so.  I am sure other Deputies are anxious to voice their opinions and to do their utmost to get some satisfactory statement from the Minister in order that the position of those unfortunate individuals whom we represent shall be improved.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  In doing so, I wish it to be clearly understood that I have no complaint against the Land Commission or its officials.  I am only too well aware of the enormous difficulties that have to be contended with in trying to get required particulars from the last remnant of landlordism in Ireland. What I do suggest is, that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will give a promise that as soon as an estate is purchased there will be no unnecessary delay in having it divided amongst the people.  Heretofore, as Deputies are aware, during the time the Congested Districts Board was in operation, when an estate was purchased it was often kept in hands for 10, 12 or 20 years. I require an undertaking from the Minister that there will be no unnecessary delay.  I am sure he will give that.  If he does, the people will be satisfied that a serious effort will be made to put the Act into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion I feel I am voicing the opinions of all uneconomic holders in the Saorstát.  They believe, as I do, that the Land Commission has not been sufficiently active in acquiring and distributing the farms and grazing ranches that are immediately available. We all know the problem is a big one. bristling with very many difficulties; but with an efficient and highly trained staff, such as is in the service of the Land Commission, it should be possible to expedite the transfer of the larger number of farms and ranches throughout <Col N="2596" /> the country.  That is, of course. provided always that they are not hampered by undue interference or influence from interested quarters.  I have a complaint to bring forward.  I was requested by one of my constituents, who is Secretary of the Maynooth . branch of the &ldquo;Back to the Land&rdquo; Association, to draw the attention of the Minister and the Dáil to it.  His letter reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has been brought under our I notice that certain farms in this district have been acquired by the Land Commission and handed over to men who held the grazing rights only.  The following is an instance:&mdash; A farm at Rathcoffey, one hundred and thirty acres, on the Aylmer estate, has been given to the grazier tenant by the Land Commission. Adjoining this farm there are five uneconomic holdings with an area of from five to ten acres each.  If the above state of affairs is permitted to continue it will be impossible to obtain land for uneconomic holders and landless men.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He says further:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following resolution has been unanimously adopted by the branch:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That we the members of the Maynooth Branch of the Back to the Land Association call upon the T.D.'s for Go.  Kildare to ask that Dáil Eireann issue orders directing that land acquired by the Land Commission be distributed amongst uneconomic holders and landless men instead of the present practice of accepting as tenants &lsquo;land ranchers&rsquo; who held the grazing rights thereby creating the worst form of landlordism with its attendant evils, unemployment, poverty and emigration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the information which I have just read is correct &mdash; I hope it is not &mdash; I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to put a stop to such a proceeding.  He has repeatedly told us there is not enough land to go round.  If that is the case, I do not see why these land ranchers should be given large holdings, while uneconomic holders are condemned to a hard living on small, farms. If this practice is allowed to continue, <Col N="2597" /> it will bring about a land war, and anybody who has experience of the laud war of the 'eighties does not, I am sure, want a repetition of it.

      <P>I do not agree with all the statements made by Deputy Lyons, and, in particular, I must contest his assertion that the right of private ownership in land should not be recognised.  At the same time, however, I think he ought to be commended for the attempt he is making to ginger up the Land Commission.  To show how urgent is the demand for speeding up the operations of that Department, I desire to cite one or two cases in my constituency which may, perhaps, be typical of other parts of the country. The first to which I would allude is the Verschoyle estate at Cloney, Co. Kildare. This is really an urgent case.  I have here statements from people living on the property, and I have no doubt of their accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The landlord combines the functions of landlord and agent, one in regard to land which he owns himself, and the other as agent to a relative who owns portion of the land in the vicinity.  This gentleman arrogates to himself the rights of a feudal baron.  He has set up a system by which he can inflict fines on tenants, and he is able to enforce them.  If a tenant, for instance, allows a cow to trespass on the road he is cited before this baronial court and a fine is inflicted.  Deputies may ask how such fiae is enforced.  It is enforced by the denial of access to the bog which is the only bog in the vicinity in which the people can get fuel.  There are some 25 tenants on this property with holdings ranging from one rood to six acres, but there are some larger farmers as well.  The tenants allege that in 1923 the landlord made exorbitant demands for the right to cut turf, and an agreement was not come to. Some people went on the bog and cut turf and proceedings were taken against <Col N="2598" /> them by way of injunction and damages and costs amounting to £1,800 were given against fourteen of these poor people.  In addition, £276 was awarded against the larger tenants. There are 400 acres available for division in the landlord's hands, and it is high time that the lands should be divided amongst the people, who should be rescued from their very miserable position.  They should be given access to the bog which has been denied them this year as well as last year.  This gentleman will, no doubt, contest the operations of the Land Commission to the fullest extent because he is a very litigous gentleman, and the sooner the Land Commission gets busy with him the better.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the case of the Dobbs. estate, which is also in County Kildare: The people there occupy a dreary stretch of bog.  There are 185 tenants and the average valuation is £7. Deputies can imagine what sort of holdings they possess.  As far back as 1909 the miserable conditions under which these poor people live were recognised and the estate was surveyed and mapped by the Land Commission officials. The matter was allowed to hang over and upon the outbreak of the European war it dropped out of sight.  On the pairing of the Act of 1923, with which the Minister's name is so honourably associated, representations were made again to the Land Commission, and several deputations waited upon the heads of the Department.  Promises were made that steps would be taken to have the lands divided and, at the same time, land was designated which would be available for distribution.  Up to the present, however, no relief has been afforded to these poor people and their case is really urgent.  They have lost the turf crop which was their main means of support, as they were in the habit of cutting turf and vending, it in the neighbouring towns and to the farmers outside.  They have, in addition, lost the corn and hay crops owing to the flooding of the Blackwater River.  I do not charge the Minister or his officials with any intention of holding up the Act, but I say that increased activity is urgently needed so that such <Col N="2599" /> bodies of tenants as those which I have cited may be afforded the benefits of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that a Deputy from Longford and Westmeath has introduced this motion, because I know the work which the Land Commission has done, particularly in Westmeath, and I am aware of the fact that 30,000 acres have been inspected in Counties Westmeath and Longford, of which 2,500 have actually been acquired, and I am also aware that before New Year's Day 800 acres will be divided amongst the people.  There are large numbers of people who seem to think that division of land simply means an inspector going to an estate one day and having the land divided within a week.  I am aware of the great difficulty to which the Land Commission have been put in connection with tracing owners who reside in England, and of other great difficulties in acquiring those lands.  I am also aware that the Land Commission inspectors are working overtime very considerably. and, so far as Co. Westmeath is concemed, I have no complaint whatever. On the contrary, I congratulate the Land Commission upon the magnificent work which it has done there.  Longford may not have done quite so well, but at the same time 30,000 acres have been imported upon, and every day that passes means that some of that land has been acquired and will be divided in the near future.  Deputy Lyons should know that Rome was not built in a day, and he ought to wait a little while longer.</P>

      <P>I think that this motion of Deputy Lyons will do good, not that I approve of all he says.  I approve, however, of his statement that he was sure that the Minister for Agriculture would have a good reply.  The Minister was down in Mayo recently and met face to face the people who are suffering, and in every case they were satisfied with the statements he made. I am sure that he will also give a satisfactory explanation to-day, and for that reason I welcome the motion as giving him an opportunity for, repeating the statements he made there.</P>

      <P>There is undoubtedly a great deal of impatience in the country on this question of the division of land, and it is very natural, considering how the people are situated.  Even if the years were good people would have enough to do to eke out a living on those small holdings, but when we consider how bad both this and last year were from the point of view of farmers, we can understand how their impatience is intensified.  It is very difficult to persuade them, as Deputy-Shaw pointed out, that this division of land cannot take place immediately, but it is a matter of life and death to them.  Their hopes began to rise when the Dáil first met, and these hopes were further increased when the Land Act was passed. They are in a very difficult position. That is looldng at it from their point of view, and anyone who knows the situation cannot but sympathise with them and their impatience.  I know very well that there is another point of view, and any Deputy can easily picture for himself the enormous difficulties of acquiring these ranches by ascertaining their rental and finding out all about title, how many people want increased holdings, and how much laud is available for division.  It is a tremendous problem, but it must be accelerated as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture has not sufficient inspectors or sufficient staff he must increase the number.  The division of the ranches even in one county would tax the resources of his present staff, and he must make up hia mind to treble and even quadruple his staff, as people are getting impatient and our opponents are making political use of the delay, unavoidable though it may be, by raising doubts in the minds of these poor people, and they would give little consideration to any explanation as to the cause of any legitimate delay.  I welcome the motion because it will give the Minister another opportunity to state the exact position and to give the assurances that are necessary and that will be accepted now as before.  At the same time, I would urge, as we all urge, upon him to do his best to accelerate the division <Col N="2601" /> of land and leave no stone unturned to carry it out as quickly as it is humanly possible to do.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be privileged to speak on an important motion like this, in view of the fact that a generation of Irishmen has grown up since I stood on my first platform in defence of the policy which the Government are now trying to have carried into effect. Like the previous speakers. I have not much fault to find with the Land Commission up to the present.  I have a very long experience of the working of the various Land Acts, and I know the difficulties with which the Minister and his staff have to contend.</P>
      <P>There are innumerable difficulties, and we all know that for the past few years due to the turmoil and disturbance in the country that not alone his Department but every Department of State was topsy-turvy, due to the unfortunate strife between the different sections in our country.  However, I am glad to say from my experience of the various Departmeilts that the Land Commission is at present in ship-shape and that the Estates Commissioners, so far as I know, enjoy the confidence and esteem of the people.  In the past there was a belief, and a just belief, in the minds of the people, that under the British regime a number of the officials and inspectors and the Commissioners were political partisans and not in sympathy with the aspirations of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such is not the case now, and there is a sign that Ireland is to be governed at last iii the various Departments of State by men of Irish ideas.  These are <Col N="2602" /> a few aspects of the question and I think Deputy Lyons's motion, as Deputy Sears has said, will serve a useful purpose in helping to direct the attention of the Minister to them.  One is the case of lands taken over by trustees and bought by monies advanced through the Land Bank.  I want the Minister to make some statement as to what he proposes to do in those eases. Some months tgfl Deputy Davin asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he could state the approximate date when the Land Commission would be in a position to take over Land Bank estates in Offaly area, whether the arrears of annuity due to the National Land Bank can or will be paid out of the security deposit and the balance returned to the societies; and if holdings will be vested in the occupiers or societies on the appointed day in any cases where Land Bank estates have been previously or already divided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture stated in reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having regard to the procedure necessary under the Act, it is not possible to state when the lands purchased by societies or bodies of trustees by means of advances made by the National Land Bank will be vested in the Land Commission under Part III. of the Land Act, but the cases will be dealt with by the Commission as expeditiously as possible. The arrears due to the bank will, under Section 52 of the Act, be included in the price.  The deposit must be handed over to the Land Commission and will be dealt with then as provided by Section 53 of the Act.  That is to say, they have discretion either to retain or refund it. On the appointed day the lands will vest in the Land Commission, who will then, under Section 55, have to make inquiries as to how the lands have been managed by each society, and if they are satisfied that the conditions of the section have been fulfilled, they will vest the land in the society.  In other cases where these statutory conditions have not been fulfilled the Land Commission will have to deal with the lands under <Col N="2603" /> the second sub-section of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, I asked a question of the Minister as to how much land was bought through money advanced by this Land Bank, and he told me roughly about 18,000 acres.  An Act was paused in this Dáil &mdash; I was not here when it was passedtaking over the liabilities of the Land Act.  You have the case where a number of trustees in districts purchased lands in a manner similar to the purchase of lands by advances made by the National Land Bank.  So far as I can gather from information received from the Minister and his Department, the Land Commission will take over these lands at a price which they think them worth, and if there is any deficit between the price paid by the purchasers and the price offered by the Land Commission, the trustees or societies or other guarantors will have to suffer loss, but in the Land Bank cases I understand they will have to suffer no loss, so far as my reading goes.  I would like enlightenment on that.</P>
    <P>People say why should one section of the community be indemnified against loss under this Act and another section not.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  You put, and I would like to call the Minister's attention to this, the Land Commission in a very awkward position sometimes about some of those cases.  During the trouble the Republican Government set up a sort of Land Commission of their own.  They actually had judges who tried cases and fixed the prices of land.  A legal man, or some ex-land official, was sent down to fix the price of the land, and the judge awarded that price to the owner.  Those acts were nullified in the Dáil by another Act of Parliament, and these lands were afterwards and are now being offered to the Estates Commissioners. I know several cases like that. In one case I know that the man was offered between £9,000 and £10,000 for the farm, the price awarded by the person who went down to settle the case.  The Land Commission, afterwards sent down one of their men, and his price for the farm was £4,000.</P>
    <P>A lot of friction has arisen over that. <Col N="2604" /> You have cases where, in order to evade the Land Act of 1909 the landlords set up what were known as bogus tenancies. I think that any tenancies created after the 30th September, 1909, were counted in the meaning of the Act of 1909 as bogus tenancies.  The landlords kept on the graziers to hold the lands, and they created these bogus tenancies.  These tenancies were legalised under the Act of 1923.  They came under the heading of future tenants, and I quite agree that it was a difficult thing for the Minister, for they were not too numerous to exclude them, and he had to let them in.  I would like the Land Commission, when taking up those estates, to remember that their interests were very little, for they were a gift to these people in order to gain the Land Act of 1909.  For that reason I do not think they are entitled to as big a price as men in whose families the lands have been for a great many years.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the case I would like the Minister to deal with is this question of congestion.  I would like to know what is the intention of the Land Commission with regard to the division of lands.  In the past this was a serious problem, and I think the Minister has upon his shoulders a greater responsibility than any other Minister in undertaking this task, which is a huge one, and he should receive every support. It is very hard to please the people of the country, and in dealing with this question the Minister will want the cooperation, support, and sympathy of all parties in the Dáil if the question is to be dealt with in a manner satisfactory to the various interests concerned.  Nine counties are scheduled as congested districts, and the people in these congested districts eke out a very miserable existence.  I know most of the congested counties, and I saw them in a very bad state, especially in the West of Ireland, about 25 years ago.  Undoubtedly, the Congested Districts Board did make a great transformation in these districts.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose to do now with regard to the land problem in the West?  You have in Connaught, and other areas like Gonnaught, big land owners living in the most congested <Col N="2605" /> parts.  It is the intention of the government to acquire these lands from graziers or big farmers so as to relieve the congests in these particular areas, or is it the intention of the Land Commission to migrate them into other counties where there are lands available for these congests?  If it is the intention to migrate them, I would advise the Minister to be very cautious, because in some counties not scheduled as congested there are many uneconomic holders.  I think the people who are looking across the ditches on those broad acres will feel very sore and aggrieved if the local needs and requirements are not provided for before anybody is brought in from an outside area.  That is the position, and for that reason both Deputy Shaw and myself have tried, and I think it would be a good thing if other Deputies would do the same, to get a list of the uneconomic holders in each district, and send that list to the Land Commission, and let it be put on the files, and the inspector who goes down to inspect these various estates can inquire into the merits and demerits of each case.  That would simplify matters, and it would be helpful to the Land Commission. There is also come criticism, or a lot of disapappointment, about some of these fee farm grants.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling; I hope what I have said on the subject is sufficient.  I think we are all anxious, and I am sure nobody is more anxious than the Minister, that immediate steps should be taken where the provisions of the Act are not being complied with to set to work at dividing these lands.  We all see that there are a great many people leaving our country, and if the regulations regarding emigration were not so strict there would be more, because of the great unemployment that exists in all parts of the State, and the natural tendency of the people is to get out of it.  In the past we said that it was not emigration but transportation.  We do not want that system to continue under a native Parliament.  We are anxious to see people who were born in the country remaining in it.  We believe that we ought to try to pull together, to try to develop the industrial resources of the country to the fullest extent, and that there is plenty of room for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1851 the population of the country was over 8,000,000, and from 1851 to 1911 no less than 4,218,016 Irish men and women left their native land.  I do not think on the face of God's earth that any other country can point to such a drain on the people as in the country of which we are citizens, and I hope <Col N="2607" /> that this Act will do something to icmcdy that state of affairs.  I consider it is a great Act, and without going into controversial matters, or politics if you like, I think that the Treaty, if it gave to the people no other power than to sol up a legislature which would finally dispose of the land question, would have induced me anyhow to take the action which the majority of the representatives of the Irish people took in accepting the Treaty.  It was a very sad state of affairs to see the depopulation, emigration and conquest by famine, fire and sword that the people had to go through for the last fifty years.  I hope that is finished, and as one who never would have been in the Dáil, or would never have entered the stormy sea of Irish politics but for this question, I am delighted to see that our native Government has tackled the problem in such a fashion, and I believe that the Act, when its terms are carried out, will finally dispose of it to the satisfaction of the entire country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesMulvany" hpid="Mr. MULVANY Mr. MULVANY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MULVANY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this matter has been raised by Deputy Lyons.  This matter of the divison of the land is one to which I have always given a good deal of time and attention; the division of the ranches amongst uneconomic holders and landless men, and the restoration of the evicted tenants is a matter which has always appealed to me.  We have the 1923 Land Act in operation for the last eighteen months.  The Act contains provisions for the restoration of evicted tenants, to make uneconomic holders economic, and to give land to landless men who are able and willing to work it.  We have in the constituency that I represent, Co. Meath, forty-two live branches of the Back to the Land Association, with a county executive. I have, on various occasions within the last five or six months attended meetings of these different branches. These branches are live, active branches in every ease, with a big membership. Everywhere I go the question is put to me: &ldquo;Why the delay; why is something not done?  We have not as yet seen one ranch divided in the County Meath.&rdquo;  I am not here to say one <Col N="2608" /> word in condemnation or denunciation of the Minister or Ills Department.  I believe he has his hands full and I am sure that he is doing his best.</P>
      <P>But after a year and a half of the existence of this Land Act, I think we might now at least expect some results. and the sooner we have some results the better.  I know that amongst those members of the Back to the Land-Association there is growing a great feeling of unrest and discontent, and the sooner they see that the Minister is in earnest, that the Land Gommisaion and its officials are in earnest in carrying out the provisions of the Act, the better for the peace of the district.  It is certain, and I think every Deputy will admit it, that we are overdosed with promises in this country. We have often heard it said that there is a certain place to which there is a broad road which is paved with unfulfilled promises, and a place where water would realise a fine price.  I am sure that the Minister will give us a promise this evening and I hope that it will be one that will not be another paving stone in this particular road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My particular idea in taking part in this debate is rather to get information from the Minister, and I would suggest in connection with that, that it might be worthy of the consideration of the Minister that he should come here and tell us what he is doing with regard to the Land Act, rather than that we should have to get our knowledge from the reports of election speeches in the papers. The whole working of the Act is to a certain extent a blank, and we know very little about it except what we can glean from local sources.  I want to deal with it from a different angle from that taken up by other Deputies.  I want to refer to the ordinary unpurchased tenants who come under the 1923 Act, and I would like to learn from the Minister if any estates have yet been vested in the tenants and, if not, when will some be vested?  Does this depend on the payment of compounded arrears of rent, and if so, does the Minister think he will be able to get any of these arrears of rent within a reasonable time?  As the Land Act <Col N="2609" /> stands I believe the tennants are bound, where they owe three years', rent, to pay two and a half years', and there is a possibility of getting a hair year's rent added to the purchase money.</P>
      <P>I have always held that the real flaw in the Land Act was the question of arrears of rent, and I think it was a very unwise thing to pass an Act which demanded from the tenants two and a half years rent in a year, less the ordinary abatement of 25 percent.  I believe that there are many tenants who are not in a position to pay this.  It is hardly necessary to emphasise the reasons. In portions of the country tenants live in very disturbed places, and they have very little opportunity of making their business pay.  In my own county they suffered extreme losses from circumstances for which the Minister had no responsibility.  I refer to the seizure of the creameries and the injury to the farmers owing to the loss of their milk.  The point is this: that owing to those losses the farmers are not able to pay their compounded arrears of rent, and in order to get them to pay in full the vesting of the land is held up, and for that reason the Act is delayed.  I would suggest that it is time that an amending Act was brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that until an amending Act is brought in there will be delay, that the Act cannot be put into force in full.  Now, there is the question of the fixation of the annuities for the lands of non-judicial holders.  I have not heard that Land Commissioners have come to any land that I know of for the purpose of fixing the annuity, and until such is done, or until mutual agreements are arrived at between the landlords and the tenants. the Act cannot come into force. I would suggest that a certain amount of speeding up is necessary with regard to that.  In connection with the acquisition of land for the purpose of division. I think it is time that the House had more definite information as to what is being done and as to how the work is being carried out.  As I understand it, <Col N="2610" /> when an estate is being divided, Land Commissioners will be sent down with full powers, and the division of the I estate will lie with these particular I commissioners.  While I may have a good deal of confidence in them, and while they may be well qualified for the work.  The fact remains that these men are strangers to the district, and I think that in view of the enormous quantity of land that is to be divided, it in unwise that the power to select the men who are to be the tenants of the land should be in the hands of one or two men who are unknown to the district and who do not know the people. Their sources of information are limited, and they may very easily be led astray.</P>
      <P>I think that something should be done in the way of setting up committees or seeing that some accurate source of information is available, so that knowledge of the men who are applying for the land may be obtained.  I have had several &mdash; I might say numberless &mdash; applications from men who are looking for land, all classes of men, uneconomic holders, evicted tenants, and in some cases landless men.  I have sent in recommendations to the Land Commission in cases where I consider these men were suitable, but I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that my recommendations are not used. I have not been consulted, and I do not see any prospect of being consulted, as to men who would be suitable to get land. I believe that any Deputy who represents the people of his constituency, as I presume we all do, should be consulted with regard to the division of land. Somebody who knows something about I the conditions of the country will have to be consulted, because a strange commissioner will not be in a position to select the best men.  Some scheme will have to be devised in view of the great quantity of land to be divided.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has any special formula in connection with this matter, if any particular class of men have first claim. because I maintain that evicted tenants should have first claim, and that they should, if possible, have first claim to the land from which they were evicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never heard it stated that they have <Col N="2611" /> first claim.  There are certain estates from which men were evicted a considerable time ago, in some cases 70 or 80 years ago.  Where you could get one or two representatives of the family that was evicted from that particular land, that is to say, men who would be fit and capable of managing it, I think they should get a portion of it.  I may tell the Minister that if something is not done in the case of men whose ancestors were evicted, there will be friction, and perhaps crime, in certain parts of the country.  I am not very keen on the speeding up of this division of land.  I think there should not be any reckless of careless speeding up.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to have ten men put on land who would make a good use of it, and who, in twenty years' time, will be found working it successfully and economically, than to have fifty bad men put on land who would let it out in grazing and only grow hay on it.  Probably in five years' time you would find these men trying to dispose of the land altogether.  Hence I say that in the selection of the men for land the greatest possible precaution should be taken to see that only suitable men, that is to say, men capable of managing land, will be selected.  I do not sec how that can be done under the present system, and I am inclined to think that some other system will have to be devised if suitable men are to be placed on the land.  In connection with the speeding up of the division of land, there is a point to which I would call the Minister's special attention.  It is this: That the division of land in a wholesale fashion cannot be successful unless it is combined with some system of agricultural credit.  If you put men on land who have no capital they will not naturally, be able to work it, and the result will be that they will be obliged to dispose of it in a very short time.  That is what will happen if there is an indiscriminate giving of land to men who have no capital and who are not in a position to finance themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Heffernan in pressing for the speedy buying up of the many estates on which there are unpurchased tenants throughout the country.  Enough <Col N="2613" /> has been said, I think, about speeding up the division of the ranches.  There is another phase of the question which is possibly, I think, a larger one than the other, and that is the one concerning the very many non-purchased estates that we have in the Saorstát. With Deputy Heffernan I would ask the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if any single estate in the Saorstát has yet been vested in the tenants.  In cases where court rents have been fixed, there is no need for delay in getting on with this work if you have the landlord's title.  Where that is satisfactory, and where court rents have been fixed, I do not see why any delay should be incurred at all.  The delay means that these tenants are deprived of a ten per cent. reduction.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the vast body of unpurchased tenants that we have throughout the country should have the first consideration of the Minister.  It was for these people that the Land Act was mainly passed.  A delay extending over years has taken place in their cases, and even now after the Land Act has been passed there is no sign that they are going to reap the full benefit of the provisions of that Act.  They are still only reaping a reduction of 25 per cent.  I do not see why the Land Commission should not settle the cases of these people at once.  I ask the Minister to look into the cases of these struggling tenants.  They have been paying rent for years that they should not have been paying and they have been very hard hit.  Their cases do not call for any division of land.  They are practically settled except where no rents were fixed by the courts.  All that is needed is to fix the rents and name the &ldquo;appointed day.&rdquo;  There is nothing, in my opinion, that would give such satisfaction to the general bulk of the people of the country than the naming of the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; on a few estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little grievance against the Land Commission.  I cannot charge that body with inactivity as I am aware they have been working fairly well for some time past.  I am aware, however, that in the case of estates inspected by officials of the <Col N="2614" /> Land Commission about seven months ago no announcement has yet been made as a result of their inspections, and that is causing a good deal of disappointment. The uneconomic holders and the congests in the localities around these estates which were inspected have so far got no idea as to the intentions of the Land Commission, but I take it that the Land Commission is endeavouring to deal with the land question in a broad way and not in a parochial way.</P>
      <P>I know that the Land Commission, so far as my constituency is concerned, has made inspections of numerous estates.  In fact, on some of the estates inspectors have been down three or four times, and I am also able to state that offers have been made to the owners of land in my constituency by the Land Commission.  There is one thing that I feel is the cause of delay, and that is what I might describe as the lack of energy of the Land Commission in not forcing the owners of the landed property of the country to give the necessary information as required according to the 1923 Land Act.  I can state definitely that for the past six or seven or eight months there is an estate in my constituency in connection with which I have been in communication with the Irish Land Commission, to see that a tenant who was evicted, or whose parents were evicted some 50 years ago, would be reinstated, and on each occasion that I communicated with the Land Commission, I got the reply that the necessary information had not been received from the owner of the property. That is a state of affairs that should not continue for seven or eight months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a month is quite sufficient to get this information, and if the owner of the property fails to give the necessary information to the Land Commission, the machinery of the law should be made to operate against him. The demand of the people at the present moment for the division of the land is very great and there is no need for me to emphasise a matter which Deputy Mulvany has already referred to&mdash;the existence of a powerful organisation in both his constituency and mine.  It is not the number of <Col N="2615" /> branches that counts.  Probably the Minister for Lands and Agriculture may say that there are half a dozen in one district and twelve in another, but I can give the sum total of it, and I can say that from the latest return there are over 5,000 members in one county, all uneconomic holders and landless men, all the sons of people who have been deprived of their lands in darker days, and who to-day look forward to the 1923 Land Act to be put back in their proper place as the owners of the soil of their fathers and forefathers.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will endeavour to see that this machinery for the acquisition and division of untenanted lands of Ireland will get more immediate and careful consideration in future with a view to expediting the intentions of the Land Act of 1923.  The Minister probably when he gets up to reply will tell us that the Minister for Finance has something to do with the matter, or probably on the other hand he will say for himself that there are not funds available.  Whether we can rely on Press reports or not&mdash;sometimes we do have to rely on them&mdash;a statement was made by the Minister in the West of Ireland not very long ago, in which he said that the Government intended to allocate 33 million pounds for the acquisition and division of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>You said it was the intention of the Government to use the 33 millions for the acquisition of land. However, that is not the thing I want to get at.  There is no use in saying <Col N="2616" /> you are pushing forward the provisions of the Land Act by making promises to the people like that on an open platform. These are not the things that are going to improve or better the position of the unfortunate people who are waiting for development in the line of the acquisition and division of the lands in accordance with the provisions of the 1923 Act.  All these promises give people food for thought, and it also gives people who are agitating for years and years for the division and the acquisition of the lands food for resenting delay, and I may state, as some other Deputies have stated here, that the people in general are not at all satisfied at the very great delay that is taking place in carrying out the very many provisions of the Land Act that the small farmer, uneconomic holder and landless people expected to be carried out in a much shorter time.  There is no use in saying we are progressing or speeding up this particular item of great national importance, the division of the land, or any of the other provisions contained in the 1923 Land Act, and getting up and stating on a public platform that there is so much money, or that it is the intention of the Government to utilise so much money for the acquisition and division of land, if we are not prepared to give full force and effect to these statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this House should be the first to be acquainted with that.  I discovered the other morning in the Press where another matter was mentioned in the British House of Commons, that the British Parliament were prepared to guarantee something like 30 millions to the Irish Free State for the purchase of land within the Saorstát. Probably that is the cause of the delay. Probably the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has been waiting until the British House of Commons took this line of action.  Probably it is on the expectation of the result of the action taken the other day by the members of the House of Commons or the British Minister for Finance that the Minister made his promise when he was down in Mayo.  All these promises would amount to nothing if the British House of Commons did not act as it has acted. I do not believe in making promises to <Col N="2617" /> the people that cannot be, at the moment of making them, made with a thorough idea that these promises can be fulfilled.  I do not believe in camouflaging the matter in the slightest.  It is not good enough, because, as I said before, if you make a promise, and the promise is not carried out, it gives the people food for thought, food for argument, and in the end probably food for revolution.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have trouble, in agrarian matters, it will be the most serious trouble that the nation was ever confronted with.  It has been so always, because you will have 75 per cent. of the people of Ireland involved in such a revolution.  In regard to the case quoted by Deputy Colohan when he was speaking of the Aylmer estate near Maynooth, he stated this ranch was held on the 11 months' system for a number of years by certain people, and that the Land Commission in the end thought it well to make them tenants. Is that state of affairs going to continue throughout the length and breadth of the country?  If that is so, there is no necessity to stand up here and speak at all in the interests of the uneconomic holders or of the landless men.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with the Aylmer estate, but I rely on the statement made by Deputy Colohan here to-night, and I am prepared to believe that what he has stated is quite true because these ranchers are taking possession of the property.  By allowing them to do so you are defeating the provisions of the Land Act, and there and then putting an end to what we are seeking to have done here tonight, the speeding up of the provisions of the Land Act of 1923.  I do not want to detain the Dáil very much longer, but I would say that if the Minister is serious in wishing the agricultural community of the Saorstát to develop, and the agricultural industry to develop, he must put the provisions of the Land Act into operation more speedily than he has been doing in the past.  I have sympathy with the arguments of Deputy Wilson and with the arguments of every Deputy in relation to the failure of the Land Commission or the Minister for Lands and <Col N="2618" /> Agriculture to see that the provisions of the Land Act are put into operation more speedily.</P>
    <P>While I do pay tribute to the Land Commission for their activity in the inspection of lands I do not believe that 18 months should be lost in those formalities of inspection and making offers. My opinion is, if the owners of those large ranches, such as exist in my constituency of 3,000 acres, did not supply the necessary information to the Land Commission, the law should be put into operation to make them do so.  We have congestion in North Meath as well as Cavan, and other places mentioned the other day, and I trust, in the interests of the development of the industrial resources of this country, that the Minister will speed up the operation of the 1923 Land Act.</P>

You have the Clifford estate, the Lynch-Blosse estate, the Kelly estate, the Palmer estate, the Fitzgerald and Lord Sligo and Oranmore estate, but no attempt was made to divide up those lands during that period.  They are letting them every year and making a profit.  If that is going to continue much longer I can assure the Minister and this House the tenants will take the matter into their own hands, as they are tired and disgusted with those delays.</P>

      <P>Every Deputy has taken the precaution to say beforehand what I would probably say.  Various reasons have been given for the alleged delay. Deputy Lyons mentioned money and Deputy Hall suspects that that is the reason also.  I cannot admit that there has been any delay.  Here are the figures.  In a normal year before the passing of the Land Act of 1923, the average sales put through by the Land Commission could be valued at £3,000,000.  That is the average.  The Land Act was passed in August, 1923, and was given to the Land Commission to administer in September, that is one year and three months ago.  Since then something over £3,000,000 worth of <Col N="2619" /> pending sales have been disposed of out of a total of £8,000,000 taken over.  That is No. 1.  No. 2 is that £1,056,000 worth of land has been gazetted or provisionally vested under the 1923 Act.  There is close on £1,000,000 vested.  With regard to untenanted land, there is about £650,000 worth.</P>

Either two or three estates have been actually divided. That is a total of £4,650,000 worth of land, of which £1,650,000 is under the 1923 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say at the moment. There are at least 70,000 tenancies vested in the owners under the 1923 Act.  There is something like £70,000 worth of untenanted land vested in the Land Commission under the 1923 Act.  £300,000 worth of land has been inspected.  The price has been agreed, and £400,000 worth of land has been inspected, and the price has been proposed.  Speaking in terms of acquisition and division of land alone, the average work for the Land Commission is £3,000,000.  The work for the last year and three months has been as follows:&mdash;£3,000,000 out of £8,000,000 have been disposed of as well as taken over.  The gazetting was actually £1,059,562 worth of tenanted land under the Land Act of 1923.  In addition you had the fixing of the price, or an agreement for fixing of the price, or a proposal for price in the case of £600,000 worth of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take those figures and see where the delay has been.  That is land purchase. <Col N="2620" /> The Land Commission has dealt with £4,600,000 worth as against £3,000,000 under ordinary circumstances.  In addition, the Land Commission this year had to arrange for a reduction in rent of 25 per cent. for about 100,000 tenants left unpurchased.  That was an extremely difficult task in view of the fact that it had to be done accurately. The rent had to be fixed accurately, and it was an extremely difficult task owing to the atmosphere in which most people thought that the proper way to deal with communications from the Government was to ignore them.  That work has been done in respect of every single tenant.  In addition to that, practically all the preliminary work in connection with getting exact particulars as to the areas and conditions generally of the various tenanted estates to be purchased under the Act has been done.  In addition to that, all arrears of land purchase annuities amounting to over £1,000,000 had to be dealt with in the latter half of 1923 and the beginning of 1924.</P>
    <P>The arrears of land purchase annuities are now reduced to normal dimensions. Those are five or six facts in connection with what has been done this year.  £4,000,000 worth of land has been disposed of, and a reduction has been arranged for every tenant left unpurchased by twenty-five per cent., arranged with sufficient accuracy to enable all purchase money to be fixed. The preliminary regulations, rules, etc., in connection with the Act of 1923 are practically completed.  It was necessary to make these regulations accurately and to draft forms accurately. The compulsory provisions of the Act were automatic.  It was not likely that a landlord or a tenant would endeavour to evade the Act by claiming that the Land Commission had no jurisdiction to take the land.  It was much more likely in the circumstances that anybody, whether he be tenant or landlord, who wished to evade the automatic provisions of the Act, would challenge the procedure on the ground that a certain notice was wrong, or served irregularly. For that reason is was impossible for the Land Commission to carry through a sale until practically everything was completed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2621" /> For that reason it was necessary to prepare the notices and prepare the procedure with absolute accuracy.  That has been done.  As I said, the arrears problem has been dealt with and reduced to normal dimensions.  In view of these facts, I think it is inaccurate, as some Deputies have said, to suggest that there has been any delay on the part of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission has done this year about twice as much work as was done in a normal year by the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board.  Personally, I have nothing but gratitude for the loyalty, efficiency and energy of the Land Commission in this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree that the acquisition and subdivision of land is very necessary and very important.  I am not going, as some Deputies do, to blame the Minister for Finance on the question of staff.  There was sufficient staff.  It was an indoor and not an outdoor staff that was required for a lot of this work. Now that the work has been done an outdoor staff is required and is being obtained.  As the preliminary work has been done land purchase can proceed in future with even greater expedition than in the past.  I am not going to accept the suggestion that local committees should be formed so as to get the land.  That work must be left to the Land Commission and to Land Commission officials.  They are the best judges. The Land Commission is not constituted for the purpose of suiting the political exigencies of any party, and for that reason I think it would be impossible to set up these local committees.  I am afraid they would hardly achieve the result the Deputy desires.</P>

      <P>From the poor law valuation. With regard to Land Bank societies, they present certain difficulties. These things were a little irregular with regard to title, and it was rather difficult to get full particulars in regard to these societies.  However, the titles are now investigated for, I should say, more than half, and notices under Section 51 are published in the case of eleven societies.  With regard to land bought by committees, I think that practically every estate bought by a committee in the country has been inspected.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me a question, whether the land would be divided as soon as the estate is vested.  It certainly will, and the Land Commission policy is that it should be divided, even if it is impossible to make improvements, or make fences until a later date.  Various estates were mentioned &mdash;the Verschoyle estate, the Dobb estate, and some cases were quoted by Deputy Colohan.  The Land Commission, in fact, has done twice as much in one year and three months as was done in normal years.  The complaint might as well be made that all the work under the 1923 Act has not been completed, as the complaint that a particular estate, in a particular constituency, has not yet been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Conlan says about the Verschoyle estate applies, I should say, to every other estate, in every constituency, not divided.  Either the Land Commission should have completed land purchase in one year and three months, or, on the other hand, if we cannot expect that, there must be some estates not yet acquired.  Every Deputy thinks his is the one particular case that is an extremely bad one.  Business cannot be done on those lines.  The Land Commission officials could not be hopping from one county into another.  Undoubtedly, to deal with these estates now they must face <Col N="2623" /> the work on some fixed plan until land purchase is absolutely completed.  It will take, I should say, seven or eight years.  There will be some estates undealt with.  The day the last estate is acquired, completed, and divided, no Deputy will be in a position to get up in the Dáil and say: &ldquo;There is an estate in my county that should be taken over.&rdquo;  Until that day comes complaints will be made.  I claim, and I think most Deputies will agree, that the Land Commission has been working very hard and with all possible expedition.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion here that if there was not an improvement there would be such a land agitation as has never occurred in the history of Ireland. That does not make my flesh creep one bit.  We had to face a great many agitations from unreasonable people who wanted to take the law into their own hands, and if the situation occurs again we will deal with it.  I do not know what Deputies views are in these matters, but I hold that I should tell the truth even when it is not popular in a particular place.  I know every other Deputy in the Dáil only makes public statements when he is in a position to tell the exact truth.  My point of view is that I ought to tell the truth, even though it happens to be unpopular in particular places.</P>
    <P>I stated in Mayo that it would take £30,000,000 to complete land purchase. That is a fact.  I stated in Mayo that it would be the policy of the Land Commission or the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture to see to it that congests who had first claim would be dealt with, even if they had to be taken outside the congested districts.  I repeat that here.  I repeated it in some other parts of the country where it was not quite so acceptable.</P>

We are tired of hearing that.

      <P>The Deputy quoted a case of what he called a grazing tenant. The decision of the Land Commission is clear on that.  They can sell to future tenants, but only to tenants who may be either present or future tenants. But they can sell only to tenants.  On the other hand, they can acquire lands for the relief of congests in the order I have already mentioned.  When the Deputy speaks of a grazing tenant he is using a term I do not understand. If a tenant is a future tenant they must sell to him, unless they require the land for congests, and there is no other land available.  Otherwise they must sell to a person who is a tenant. They have no option in the matter.</P>

      <P>While this Vote is under consideration, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to the indiscriminate processes which have been issued for the alleged non-payment of annuities in the County Donegal.  A large number of these processes were issued early in October, and some others, I think, were not served until November or the beginning of December. I allege with a considerable amount of authority that these processes have been issued for rents or annuities already paid.  I brought this matter to the notice of the Dáil some months ago, and a promise was made then that it would be investigated and looked into; but, so far as I am aware, no investigation has been made, and the matter was not looked into.  I gave several glaring and concrete cases to the Minister where two processes were issued for the one amount.  I gave other cases where processes were issued for amounts partially paid.  There seems to be a system in the Land Commission, and among Land Commission officials, whereby when receivable orders are sent up with money for payment of annuities these receivable orders are retained for six, and in some cases twelve months.  I gave cases that I have here now from Donegal.  I gave the case of two Dohertys, Daniel and James, and in these cases the money, amounting to £3 15s. 2d., was sent forward from Mallin Post Office on the 23rd October, 1923.  The receivable order accompanied it, and was received by the Land Commission, but was never returned.  Now, these two men are processed before the Circuit Court at Lifford.</P>

      <P>This a clear matter of injustice, and though some Deputies may laugh I can assure them that these tenants are respectable landowners, and I think they have no right to be sneered at or laughed at by a Labour leader.  A man named William Campbell, &ldquo;Carndoagh,&rdquo; Carndonagh, was processed for £9, one half-year's annuity, on the 12th December, 1923. He received no receivable order since.  I would like to know from the Minister is it for the purpose of manufacturing cases for solicitors that all these processes are issued.  Some very serious allegations of this kind are made. These processes are issued for the Circuit Court in Donegal.  They could be issued to be heard before the District Court.  The District Justice has power to hear cases up to £10.  These people could be cited before a District Justice, and they could state their own case without having to employ any solicitor, and the District Justice could investigate and decide the matter without extra expense to <Col N="2629" /> these people.  Not very long ago several processes were brought up before District Justice Goff at Carrick-macross District Court at the instance of the Land Commission, and the cases were dismissed.</P>

      <P>I was saying that I read in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; some time ago that processes were brought by the Land Commission against annuitants before District Justice Goff, at Carrick-macross, in the County of Monaghan. These processes were investigated by the District Justice and dismissed, because the people were able to prove that they had already paid the amounts that they were processed for.  Is there any ambiguity about that?  The same thing has occurred now in Donegal. Several of these people have been processed for non-payment in lieu of rent and Land Commission annuities, and I allege, from statements that these people made to me, and from proofs with which they have furnished me, that part of the money, in the case of some of these people and the whole of the amount in some other cases, has been already paid to the Land Commission. The land collection department of the Land Commission send down a list of defaulters from their head office in Dublin to the State Solicitor in Donegal, in the month of August or September, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the annuitants or owners in Donegal remitted, because the banks refused to accept payment after the usual fourteen days, and these people send the Receivable Orders for these amounts.  The Land Commission never communicates with the State Solicitor in Donegal, and he simply takes up the list and proceeds to recover from the people.  I will give an instance that came under my own <Col N="2630" /> notice a fortnight ago.  The money was remitted in this case on the 17th November, from Carndonagh, in the shape of a bank draft in a registered letter to the Land Commission amounting to £1 16s. 3d.  On the following 22nd the Land Commission sent on a registered letter enclosing a process.  I am pleased to see the Vice-President is enjoying this revelation.  This matter is a very serious matter for these unfortunate people, a very large number of whom are unable to pay law costs. A very large number of these people got their last year's seed from the County Council, and there is a very large number that will have no potatoes or oats this year at all.  That is not a matter for either enjoyment or laughter.</P>

      <P>Certain portions of it. The Land Commission is costing the country as much as £600,000; it is a great State Department, but the business methods that they have in connection with the collection of annuities would disgrace a country book-maker, or a country auctioneer's office.  I call upon the Minister to appoint a committee of three and not exceeding five Deputies, to inquire into the method of collection of annuities and payments in lieu of rent, because there is grave dissatisfaction at the present time in the County Donegal, and some other counties too, if the Deputies had the courage to get up and expose it.  But it has been left to me to do that.  I do not intend to occupy the time of the Dáil at any great length.  Some Ministers may think I have done it a bit too forcibly.  However, I have put the facts before them.  I will be able to prove several cases I have already <Col N="2631" /> stated and I do not think the Minister himself should fear the appointment of this committee, or have the least dread of appointing a committee to endeavour if it can be possible to substitute a better method of collection, whereby the question of the issue of these processes for Land Commission annuities and the question of payment of costs by unfortunate people who are not able to pay them will be obviated.</P>

If the Deputy read the Vote he would find that the money is to facilitate a very large number of tenants who are not able to meet their payments, and that it will be repaid to the Exchequer as soon as it is collected from the tenants.  There is a very large number of unpurchased tenants in the Saorstát who are not in a position to pay 2½ years' arrears of rent.  There is no use in taking these people to court and getting decrees against them.</P>

      <P>The total collection of payment in lieu of rent for a year is about £900,000.  There is £125,000 wanted at present to make up arrears in that collection.  There are arrears at present of about £140,000 in the collection of payment in lieu of rent, out of a total collection of about £900,000. There is another gale about to mature and in two or three months, probably, the arrears would have increased.  It is for that reason that £200,000 is asked for.  Why is there such a sum in arrear?  It is because the Land Commission do give a certain amount of time to deserving tenants before pressing for payment.  Under the Act of Parliament, this money has to be found by the Dáil if not paid by the tenant purchasers, and people who owe payment in lieu of rent.  The Land Commission could issue processes against defaulters immediately after the gale-day and probably decrease this amount. They do, however, give time in genuine cases and this is the result.  The amount in arrear is very small compared with the total collection.</P>

      <P>I understand that.  I want some information as to the methods by which outstanding amounts will be collected.  The Minister has said that the Land Commission is empowered to process any tenant who has not paid on the day after the gale day.  I do not think such methods should be adopted by the Minister.  We have had too many sad experiences of tenants being taken to court and decrees got against them, and of evictions in this country.  I sincerely hope the Land Commission, are not going to adopt those methods and send sheriffs to seize the property of the unfortunate tenants.  I hope they will facilitate the tenants by giving them time to pay.  I do not know whether I would be in order in replying to some statements made by Deputies in reference to the Motion I had down on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>It has been decided before that the only question that can be discussed on a Supplementary Estimate is the purpose for which the estimate is submitted.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy would like me to say is that the rent has not to be paid.  I am not saying that. With regard to Deputy White's point, it is quite possible and, in fact, probable that processes will be served on the wrong persons in a case like this, where there is such a big collection and because of the general confusion of the times.  It would be a miracle if that did not happen.  What is happening in most cases is something like this: the tenant-purchaser has not paid his annuity.  His name is sent down to the State Solicitor.  The State Solicitor writes to the tenant once or twice.  The tenant does not answer.  Then the State Solicitor sends out the process. The process is served.  The next thing that happens is that the tenant sends up the amount of the process, without <Col N="2635" /> any costs, to the Land Commission. That, of course, could not go on.  A collection could not be carried out on those lines.  A process has been issued and served&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>A defaulting purchaser's name is sent down to the State Solicitor. He writes to the tenant.  The tenant does not reply.  Then, feeling that it is dangerous to delay longer, he sends the amount to the Land Commission. Next day a process is issued by the State Solicitor, who knows nothing about the payment.  That happens quite often.  The Deputy must know that as well as I do.  It happens, too, that after receiving the process, the tenant sends the amount to the Solicitor without costs.  In these cases, the State Solicitors must get their costs. You cannot get a solicitor to work for nothing.  He is as well entitled lobe paid as a doctor or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the State that is to pay these costs?  I would like to assure the House that a considerable amount of confusion is caused at the present time in the collection of annuities and payment in lieu of rent, on account of the habit that tenant purchasers have got into of not paying on the gale day, when they should pay, if they are able to pay.  They wait for a demand, or two demands from the solicitor, and then they ignore them.  The process <Col N="2636" /> arrives.  After three or four days, they come to the conclusion that it is not safe to delay any longer, and they send along the money to the Land Commission. The Land Commission could not do business on those lines.  The Land Commission have no Department to receive the money.  They would have to set up a sub-Department for the purpose of receiving annuities in that way.</P>
      <P>There is a regular way of paying annuities.  They should be paid on receivable order through the local bank.  The amounts would be received then in the usual way by the Land Commission. There would be no confusion, and the matter would be dealt with in the ordinary way.  When a large cumber of tenants adopt a different attitude, the whole procedure is changed and things are bound to get into confusion. I will not say that tenants are going to avoid paying costs where processes have been issued by the State Solicitor and the money is afterwards sent to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission has to notify the State Solicitor of the receipt of that amount.  The correct thing to do, for book-keeping purposes, would be to send it back to the State Solicitor. Where you give the collection of a debt to a solicitor, you must leave the collection to him and deal with the matter in that way.  You cannot very well accept payment of a debt in that way and make no arrangements about the payment of the solicitor's costs.  That is what is happening in about 75 per cent. of eases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that with such very large arrears, there will be mistakes made. There will be a certain amount of confusion but, on the whole, that is unavoidable. It is an extraordinary coincidence that the people who complain that they do not get back the receivable ordprs are the same people who have been making that complaint for the last ten years.  The Land Commission have their names.  The people who arc in arrear with their annuities and who are complaining now that they do not pet the receivable orders are, to a very large extent, the people who always had been in arrear with their annuities and whose cases had to be dealt with <Col N="2637" /> through the solicitor.  That is, perhaps, a little more than a coincidence, but it is a fact.  I am a little bit suspicious about those cases in which people do not receive their receivable orders. There are cases in which mistakes were made. I have investigated them.  The mistakes were made either by the State Solicitors, or through clerical errors in the Land Commission.  That is bound to occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent my own receivable orders on the 18th July last for the May instalment, and I did not get them back until the 24th August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was extremely quick.  I would ask the Deputy to remember that what he should have done to conform with the usual practice was to go into a bank and lodge the receivable order and the money in the btok. It would come then up through the proper channel to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>That is the condition of affairs in the Land Commission, where they have to collect payments in lieu of rent, annuities, and all the rest of it, which amount to about £4,000,000.  They have a regular procedure there.  Now, all the tenants are endeavouring to set that regular procedure at sixes and sevens.  You have a proportion paying through the bank to the Land Commission, sometimes with and sometime without receivable orders.  You have others sending money to the Land Commission directly, with or without receivable orders.  Then you have some sending moneys through solicitors, some with and some without receivable orders.  There is an utter absence of regular payment, and there is general confusion over the arrears question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the Deputy's own case, for instance.  Instead of paying his annuity into the bank in the ordinary way, and seeing that it went to the Land Commission, he sent up the receivable order to the Land Commission. That must be dealt with as a special case, and then the receivable order must be returned.  The money must be <Col N="2638" /> put to a special account in order to keep the accounts properly.  It has to be transferred to the right account and so forth.  We hear complaints about extra staff, and all the rest of it.  Let me say that 20 per cent. of the time of the Land Commission staff is occupied in doing work like that that they should not be doing, and that they need not be doing if there was any responsibility and reasonableness and rational outlook amongst the rank and file of the tenants.  I do admit to th Deputy that there have been mistakes made, but let those mistakes be put up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a suggestion. Extend the period for receiving the money in the bank from fourteen to twenty-one days.  That will give them an extra week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

That will reflect the money that will be recovered. It is really providing for something in the form of a loan.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head (a) of this Estimate might I draw attention to a case which was brought under my notice in connection with the payment of a gratuity to the dependents of a member of the National Army who was also a volunteer of the Irish Citizen Army in 1916?  I would like to know whether, in the ease of this young man, who served continuously during and from 1916 and also in the Army, and who died recently, his mother or father or other dependents can claim the gratuity which he himself would have got had he lived.  In one case to my own knowledge, a reply was sent to the mother of a soldier in which it was stated that as the form was not completed by the person who rendered service, she was ineligible for any grant.</P>
      <P>There are very few cases of the sort that I refer to.  I suggest, in view of the good service rendered by this youn^ man from 1916 onwards, his mother or his dependents ought not to be deterred from the gratuity that the young man himself would have got were he alive.  I have only the one case in mind at the moment, and I am prepared to submit details of it to the Minister.  If there is any possibility of doing so, I hope he will deal sympathetically with it and the few cases of the sort that exist.</P>

It is, I agree, the sort of matter that should meet with some consideration. There is, of course, a general principle.  At a special period when you are discharging men from an army you may give grants which you would not give at a later period when men would be in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the time at which this Vote, paper was distributed makes it difficult to deal with the question as, perhaps, it ought to be dealt with.  Matters that we would like to have brought up in detail cannot now be touched upon, because the special information contained in those <Col N="2641" /> papers was not brought forward in time.  I think we have a right to complain on that score.  On the general question of the sum involved, I think we are entitled to some explanation from the Minister.  The estimate under sub-head (a) shows the sum is now to be increased by £9,000. The sum under sub-head (b) is increased from £36,000 to £83,000, adding £47,000.</P>
      <P>In (e) there is an increase from £1,000 to £3,500.  (f) is an entirely new Vote.  These may, of course, all be easily explained, but I think that we should have an explanation. For instance, &ldquo;Extra statutory provision of hospital treatment for ex-soldiers within limits approved by the Minister for Finance, £12,000&rdquo;&mdash; that is a new sub-head, and we have no explanation. I am pretty well satisfied, even without the explanation, that such treatment is justifiable, but before going further with the discussion I think we ought to have the explanation.  I would like to have more information in respect to sub-head (g) as to the respective groups of ex-officers and men affected by the pensions under Section 4 of the Pensions Act, 1924.  For instance, I would like to have particulars as regards these ex-commandants and majors, ex-colonels and major-generals, and ranks higher than ex-major-generals. A little more information is, I think, desired before we proceed to discuss the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I may be able to give the Deputy some general information, but not the information he desires as to the number in each rank. It has been found that the number of applications for pension forms is 20,082. Up to the 6th of this month, 19,280 forms have been sent out.  Letters applying for forms and receiving attention, number 802.  A considerable portion of the latter number is in the Six Counties and is being attended to in a different manner.  That may seem a large number, but I think that Deputies will note that there are a number of people applying for pensions who are really ineligible.  It takes a good deal of time, care, and patience on the part of the committee examining the claims before applicants can be brought up to receive their pensions.  As a matter of <Col N="2642" /> fact, the number of pensions adjudicated upon to date is very small, but every available case that has complied with the regulations has been adjudicated upon and they are getting on with the others as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>The reason that this Vote is brought in is that the pensions are payable from the 21st October, and it was thought desirable that as many as possible of those which have been found to be in order should he-paid before Christmas.  This is an entirely new Vote and comes up under the Act of 1924, and amounts to £26,500.  That is the estimate which it is expected will bring us to the close of the financial year.  In all probability it will be found that that estimate is a liberal one and, at the rate at which cases are being disposed of, I do not believe that the amount of that estimate will be reached.  A number of forms have yet to be sent in, while those that have not been properly filled have to be sent back.  It would be much better for the persons concerned to conform with the regulations, as if they did so, the cases could be dealt with more expeditiously.  The other question which Deputy Johnson raised is brought about by wounded cases.  Hospital accommodation is being provided for those men, and where men can be made better by such treatment it is being given, and it is intended to continue it.  In the long run it will save money for the State.  Some pensions are granted for three months and others for six months, and the parties concerned must come up again for examination.  That explains why the Vote under this head is so large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us how much of this expenditure under sub-heads (a), (b), (e) and (f) is likely to be a recurring expenditure?  The Minister points out that this is an application for £26,500 in excess of the original estimate, but I think it is rather more. As I understand, it is one of £95,500, and of that only £26,500 applies to Section G, for pensions granted under the Act of 1924.  There are other items apart from that amount, the details of which one would like to have.  Can the Minister say <Col N="2643" /> how much of that is expenditure that is likely to be recurring, as this item is growing enormously?  Last year we were told &mdash; I am speaking from memory &mdash; that when this Act was brought in it would involve a liability of £100,000 per annum.  Now it has grown to the extent of £200,000, and one would like to know whether it is likely to grow further or to diminish.  It is a very considerable sum, and a very considerable additional burden on the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy the figures he asked for, but I can assure him that a good proportion of that money in A and B is non-recurrent. The gratuities given will not recur in the estimates, and a big proportion of the £47,000 will not be recurrent expenditure.  These people have been dealt with and done with. Since I came to the Ministry I have signed a good many paying dockets granting these gratuities to men and their dependents, and I have followed in that the course laid down by my predecessor. I have done nothing without the full consent of the Army Finance Officer, and I followed the precedents laid down before I came into office. You may take it that most of that money will be non-recurrent expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the gist of this complaint.  I am not going to say that the Minister or even his predecessor is responsible for this, but I would draw the close attention of the Minister for Finance to the fact that quite apart from the merits of these items we have had these Supplementary Estimates within six months under the Army Pensions Act of 1923.  Somebody was at fault in March last, or prior to March, in preparing the estimates.  The Act was passed in 1923, and estimates of some kind had been made.  Certain figures were put before the Ministry, I am sure. and also before the Dáil.  We were asked to vote the figure of £109,000 and that sum was voted.</P>

    <P>I am not saying for a moment that the additional sum is not required, or should not be paid.  I assume that the <Col N="2644" /> increased sum is just as necessary to be administered as the smaller sum, but there is a great fault attributable to somebody owing to the necessity for coming forward with an estimate for an additional £90,000 and £109,000 within eight months.  That, I thinly, is one point of complaint, and a very serious one, because the question of the method of estimating and coming to the Dáil with supplementary estimates is, I think, one that has to be taken notice of, and serious notice.  Have any new factory intervened to require these additional sums?  What has happened to make it necessary to have the supplementary Vote?  That is the position I want to have explained.  Why were they not able to estimate more closely in March last, or has some new method of allocation been evolved? I think some justification for the very great increase in the estimate is required from the Minister for Finance, or the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that this is an instance of bad budgeting, and that a very serious under-estimate of the amount required was made, but I think we may attribute it to the comparative inexperience of the Department concerned on this question of pensions.  They were dealing with the question almost experimentally, for they had only just begun to pay pensions, and, I fancy, had formed no clear estimate as to the amount required.  Some of these increases may be due to greater leniency. I do not think anything could be more injurious than that extreme severity and extreme rigidity should be adopted towards men who have served the State so well.  The point I want to raise is in regard to subject G.  There is a very great difference between the amount of pensions granted to ex-N.C.O.'s and men, and that granted to officers.  Officers of the rank of Commandant, and above that, obtained very much more than half the total amount voted.  The ex-N.C.O.'s and men, who were most numerous, obtained only £2,000 out of a Vote of £26,000.  I hope the Minister will tell us the reason for that.  It may be, and probably is the case, that it is very <Col N="2645" /> much harder to investigate the claims of ex-N.C.O.'s and men, and that they are better able to call on officers in high positions in the Army to give references as to their services, but one would like to know whether these difficulties have arisen, and whether in the next year's pension estimate, for instancv, the balance will be rectified.  I think when we voted the Army Pensions Act we were of opinion that a very considerable sum of money would go to the men who have served in the ranks.  We are now voting £27,000. What proportion does that bear to the total Vote that would be required for a year?  For what period is that?</P>

      <P>Are there a great many claims under investigation?  Can this be regarded as normal, and can we say that it is a vote for three months? From the 1st October to the 1st April would be six months.  Can the Minister gay that the claims outstanding would swell the vote very considerably. I think we are entitled to know, not in detail but generally speaking, what charge is to be laid on the shoulders of the taxpayers by these Army pensions. I think the Minister for Finance did give an estimate when the Act was passing through the Dáil, but, obviously, that is open to revision according to experience in administration.  I hope the Minister will give some idea as to what we are likely to have to bear in the future.  If the total vote will not be more than £60,000 for a year, I think we would be well rid of that charge, and feel that we had done our duty to those who served the State, at comparatively a light cost.</P>

      <P>I rise with some hesitation to discuss this vote.  I am not very conversant with the subject covered by the vote, and I would not like in any way to minimise the obligations the Dáil is under in connection with the matters of pensions to men who have been incapacitated, but I do and must criticise this supplementary vote on the grounds, first of all, that the Minister for Defence has said that he considers the amounts budgeted for <Col N="2646" /> will not he necessary as a whole.  I say that it is very undesirable for any of the Departments of State to come to the Dáil for an amount of money that is not fully disclosed as being required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I said it may not be necessary, but it would all depend on the degree of expedition with which the work is done.  If claims come in which are properly authenticated, the probability is that amount will be required, but if claims are not authenticated, that amount of money, will not be required. Probably we will not be able to go through as many of them as will absorb that Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That only strengthens my argument, for the Dáil is always here to consider a supplementary Vote, if required.  I would rather have twenty supplementary estimates come up than take the assertion of the Minister for Defence that he is budgeting for an uncertain amount of money on claims that they will never consider. In this particular Department, the Army, we know, of course, that there has been a good deal of trouble from time to time, and one would feel, inclined to ask the Minister for Defence a question on what I might call discipline in the Army.  That may not arise on this particular Vote, except that it is an Army Vote.</P>

      <P>What I want to bring out is this: The Dáil was asked to consider this Bill, and to pass the Bill with an estimate from the Minister for Defence at the time of the probable cost of the Bill.  The probable cost of that as estimated was considerably less than what the Minister for Defence says he wants to-day.  That in itself shows that the position was not fully understood by those who brought forward that Act.  Now we all know that any legislation of the nature that holds out plums for the consideration of possible applicants is a thing that requires careful examination in its working. The Minister for Defence says that he <Col N="2647" /> has already got in 30,000 application forms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do wish to withdraw that.  I did not mean it in that sense.  I was talking of human nature, and I was dealing with the question that when a certain sum of money was known to be available the ordinary tendency is in the direction of considering the Government and the State as getting money very easily, and in the direction that the expense of this is really something of an unknown quantity.  If I had conveyed any impression to any Deputies that I accused them of using their position in a way they were not entitled to do, I certainly <Col N="2648" /> withdraw any such imputation as not being within my intention to put, forward.  I was really only dealing with the question of the tendency that arises, when money is available, to use it rather freely, and my position here, of course, is that I do say, and the Minister for Finance will.  I think, bear me out, that the conditions surrounding us at present have to be very closely watched in connection with any expenditure that is undertaken by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who have been acting on the Committee on Public Accounts have been learning something about the necessity for estimating closely, and I think that Deputy Hewat has voiced the views of every member of that Committee, which probably may be made clear shortly, that estimating should be made as close as possible, and in the case in question we have had to get an estimate very much higher than the original estimate.  Deputy Hewat raised the question as to whether the new estimate is beyond what will be spent. The Minister for Defence suggests that in certain contingencies it will not be spent, but if the Department can get through claims satisfactorily then it is likely that it will all be required, but that if the Department cannot get through them more quickly than at present it will not be all required. This is in respect of sub-head (d). Deputy Hewat also says that if the work is accelerated so that a further Supplementary Estimate is required, it is better to come for a Supplementary Estimate than to put in for a large sum now on the off-chance that it may be required.  I think that Deputy Hewat is right in the line he has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have learned that it is a common fault with Departments, probably even the Department of Defence, that when money is in the Department there is a better chance of persuading the Minister for Finance to allow it to go out than if it has not been voted, and there is a greater chance of, shall I say, careless expenditure, using &ldquo;careless&rdquo; in the literal sense, or an absence-of strict watchfulness when the sum has already been voted than when it has to be called for.  I think on these grounds Deputy Hewat's comments are <Col N="2649" /> quite justified, and unless the Minister gives us, shall I say, a clearer assurance that the sum estimated for is likely to be required before the end of March we ought to reduce the Estimate to the sum which he is confident will be required.  If in the meantime a further sum is wanted let him come with a further Estimate, and justify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Estimate, and I think it is really necessary to do something for these men who have sacrificed their time, have got wounded, and in some cases have lost the use of their limbs.  The total sum of £198,000 is not, I think, at all too much for the State to give in pensions to the large number of men who have made sacrifices on its behalf.  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to one aspect of the case that I hope will be considered by him with a view to getting more adequate payment than those already awarded to certain persons who are entitled to receive pensions.  In some cases where men have lost the use of their right arms an amount of 12s. 6d. per week is granted, and I think that is altogether inadequate.  A man who has lost the use of his arm and is not able to carry on his usual work should get more than 12s. 6d.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to expedite the bringing forward of the amendments that were to be added to this Act, in connection with giving some compensation or gratuity to the dependents of men who have lost their lives through disease contracted whilst in the Army.  I feel quite confident that this money would be well spent and in the best interests of the State, and that those poor fellows are entitled to it. I am sure every Deputy in the Dáil fully appreciates the services rendered by these men, and that no Deputy will object to their getting a little pension or gratuity to enable them to keep body and soul together.  I sincerely welcome the Estimate, and I hope the D6il will allow it to go through without any opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, extremely difficult for a Department dealing with a new Act to estimate very closely what its requirements will be. <Col N="2650" /> It is almost impossible for the Finance Department to ask questions that will probe the matter very much, especially when we are dealing with conditions such as we have to deal with here. There was no register and no record of the number of men who had been wounded.  Nothing had been done to tabulate the material that existed or to collect the material until the Act was passed.  There were men who were wounded in 1916, and there were other men who were wounded during the subsequent period, but there had been no examination of them from any official source.  There was no record at all that they were wounded, and, as Deputies will understand, it was an exceedingly difficult thing to arrive at an estimate that would be an accurate one.  We had none of the material that the Department of Defence would ordinarily have for forming this estimate, and that explains why, in the case of the wound pensions the divergence between the amount now found to be required and the original estimate is so great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the extra statutory provision for hospital treatment, that is undoubtedly, I think, justifiable. There are men getting wound pensions and it is better, I think, to give them hospital treatment, in order that their condition may be improved, and that, perhaps, the wound pension may be unnecessary or may he reduced.  I think it is better for the men themselves that their health should be improved, rather than that we should continue to pay them wound pensions.  I think it is desirable from that point of view to give them hospital treatment.  I think it is also durable to give hospital treatment to men who are making claims and who come up for examination. The extent to which we may depart from that is a matter about which I am not altogether satisfied.  It is a matter which still remains to be determined, whether men who are not receiving wound pensions, but who are ex-soldiers, should receive hospital treatment.  We have, of course, recently discharged large numbers of men from the Army.  Their financial condition in all the circumstances is not <Col N="2651" /> often very satisfactory, and it may be justifiable to give certain hospital treatment to these men, although they may not be actually entitled to wound pensions, in view of their recent discharge from the Army.  That is a matter that we can only deal with to a very limited extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons referred to the need for legislation to include men under this Wound Pensions Act who are not at present included, and their dependants, in the case of men who died of disease contracted in the Army.  There, again, the difficulty is exceedingly great, because men were admitted to the Army without any medical examination or without sufficient medical examination.  Men were taken in when the great crisis arose in 1922.  They were hurried into the Army at that time.  We got them wherever we could get them, and as quickly as we could. As everybody knows, there was the greatest possible disorganisation at the time, and men were admitted into the Army whose health would not justify their admission in ordinary circumstances. It is extremely difficult, in the case of men who may suffer from disease now to know whether that disease was attributable to Army service at all.  Men developed tuberculosis. We do not know whether they had it when they want into the Army. We do not know whether anything connected with their duty caused the contraction of the disease.  The matter is one of very great complexity, and it is one of the matters which are under examination at the present time.  I put it to deputies that it is not an entirely simple matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of an over-estimate under G, I would point out that this is a matter that is being dealt with by the Board of Assessors, who determine, but who have no responsilnlity for the finances of the matter. They simply deal with the evidence put before them in each particular case.  If there were three times that amount there it would have nothing to do with them It would have nothing to do with them if there was no money provided at all until the next financial year came on.  The Board <Col N="2652" /> would have nothing to do with that. because their only duty is to examine the evidence and find whether a man had service and if he was entitled to the pension, and to what extent he would come under the Act I do not know whether I am preventing the Minister for Defence dealing with this matter, but there was just one point raised by Deputy Cooper in regard to the number of ex-Commandants and ex-majors, which, I may say, is very easily explained.  The people who are entitled to these pensions are people who had pre-Truce service and also National Army service.</P>
    <P>The number of pre-Truce men was small, and in the circumstances that arose a great many of them were promoted and attained to high rank.  I do not think that anything like one-half of the claims put in are genuine claims. The number of men who actually were out in 1916 and who had continuous service right through, serving in the National Army, must really be very small indeed.  I would not like to mention a figure, but it is not one-tenth of the men who claim that There is no doubt that, under an Act such as this, any amount of fraudulent applications will be made, and that even by exercising the greatest care, fraudulent applications will go through.</P>
    <P>I have had a good deal to do with the Police Pensions Act I have been as careful and as conservative as I could in dealing with that Act, and I have turned down many people for whom a great case was made, and yet I have found that people got through who were not entitled to.  Not long ago, after a man was given a pension under that Act, a certain Major-General in the Army came in and gave information which proved clearly that that man was not entitled to a pension. Therefore, I say that even by exercising the greatest care, people who are not entitled to a pension will get through.</P>

In spite of the masses of claims that must be refused, the heaviest end&mdash;the claims of the higher officers&mdash;is the end that is most easily dealt with.  The man with a high record is easily traced.  It is easy to trace his career and to get evidence. It will be more difficult to determine the cases where the claimants are men of lower rank, such as N.C.O.'s and men.  As the Committee gets on with its work, it will throw heavy expenditure on to the Exchequer in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for gratuities for dependents of men who were deprived of their occupations owing to illness.  I know that these gratuities will not be abused. The Minister says that he has no guarantee that these men contracted the disease during their service.  I only ask these facilities for the men who passed the medical test before joining the Army.  Surely they had a doctor, and you must take the certificate of the doctor as evidence that the man was in perfect health when joining the Army.  At the present time you have a very large number of men who were discharged from the Army and who are not able to work, and a great number of men who died as a result of disease contracted during service.  I think that something should be done for the dependents of those people and for those who are not able to work.</P>

Now, before we get to <Col N="2654" /> the close of the year, we have practically doubled the amount of that estimate.  That is a serious feature of it, and another very serious feature that arises on pensions is that the amount we are called on to pay in pensions in this State is really excessive.  This year alone, in estimates&mdash;I do not want to go into them in detail&mdash;we are called upon to pay a sum of £5,000,000 for pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable portion of the pensions.  It is old age pensions, superannuation, and these Army pensions. That is, approximately, a sum exceeding 30/- per head of the population of the Free State.  It is time we got a little more cautious and a little more careful about granting pensions. Pensions are going to place the State in a very serious position financially, and the figures I have mentioned show that the burden has already reached very serious proportions, and we should be accordingly cautious about adding to that sum.  Therefore, I would urge on the Minister and on all Departments, in connection with pensions, that we want to be exceedingly cautious in view of the size these figures have already reached, about adding to them in any way.</P>

As a result of the speech just made, the Government may start to economise on these people, whereas the pensions mentioned by the Deputy were all given on Treaty rights, to big officials, who went out under the Treaty.  I hope the Minister of Finance will not let the speech just made by Deputy Good interfere with his fair judgment on any claims that may come forward from Army men.</P>

With regard to what <Col N="2655" /> Deputy Good has said, no pensions are granted to any person except pensions that are granted under Acts passed by this Dáil, and if this Dáil says to any Minister&mdash;I do not mind in what Department, whether it is Defence, or not&mdash;that certain things are to be done and on a scale laid down by the Dáil, that Minister must carry them out.  If Deputy Good can persuade the Dáil that this Pensions Act should not remain in force beyond this year, I am sure he will be satisfied, but I do not know that he will be able to get many Deputies to agree with him in that matter.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Lyons' motion is concerned I think it was answered by the Minister for Finance.  These pensions are based on the percentage of disability, and they are all scrutinised very carefully by the Committee that is sitting on them.</P>

As far as the <Col N="2656" /> Estimate is concerned generally, the estimate was only an estimate, and, as the Minister for Finance has stated, there was no data when the original estimate was made out under the 1923 Act, and at the moment nobody could make any close estimate of the amount required up to the 31st March next. Without any statistics the estimate is made up in the Department by a very efficient officer, an officer, who, I think, everybody will agree, was never extravagant and who every Deputy will admit, kept a very tight finger on public moneys.  These estimates are made out either by him or under his supervision.  I will say that as far as he is concerned he never does anything extravagant, and I do not think he did anything extravagant in these Estimates. He made them up to the best of his ability without having any figures to go on.  He had no data to go on, and if he did not allow enough in the original Estimate put forward that was a matter which nobody could foresee&mdash;how many people would be getting gratuities, wound pensions, etc., and the sum he has asked for in excess of that estimate, to carry us to the end of the year is, I think, a moderate estimate, taking into consideration the many claims to be met, and I hope the Dáil will pass it.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister again of the matter I raised a few days ago on the question of unemployment benefit for seamen, resident in the Free State, who are employed on British and Northern Ireland owned ships.  As the law stands, owing to the failure of reciprocity being arrived at, these men are likely to be deprived of benefits from all Governments.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce practically promised myself and one other Deputy who raised the question on that day, to bring the matter forward again, and he would let us know exactly what he was doing in the matter.  I have a letter in my hand from a trade union in England concerning Irish seamen.  This is a paragraph: &ldquo;It appears that action must be taken within a very short time by the authorities on this side (that is, the British Government), either with a view to making arrangements for payment of benefit, or if this arrangement cannot be made, then the recording of a formal decision that Irish seamen on British ships are not insurable for unemployment purposes so as to prevent the collection of contributions for which the men will get no return.&rdquo;  The letter goes on to say, &ldquo;If your Minister would continue the pressure and open up negotiations again with this side, if he will do that, I am convinced it will not be in vain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, apparently, is the result of conversations held with British officials. This party who writes the letter in England believes that if our Minister puts on additional pressure and continues negotiations, it will have some result.  I merely rise to ask, in view of the Minister's statement the other day, not to break off the conversations that have been going on concerning these matters.  I understand also that the Government of Northern Ireland are considering the matter and trying to arrive at some satisfactory arrangement that will give benefit to their people in the Free State.</P>

      <P>The history of the position with regard to medical students who got their qualifications in the Saorstát and who were, previously to 1923, validly registered on a general Medical Register, begins, as far as this House is concerned, with the introduction of the Medical Bill, 1924, on the 16th July.  On that occasion I outlined the situation this way.  I said it had been believed that, through the joint action of a section of the constitution and of a certain adapting Act passed in this House, the position as it existed prior to the setting up of the Free State, had, in fact, continued.  Sometime very shortly before the introduction of a Bill into the House, the point had been raised from the other side that there was some doubt.  I myself attended a conference to have this point cleared up, and the conclusion arrived at was that doubts still remained as to the exact position.  There was no doubt in the minds of the British representatives.</P>
      <P>There was still doubt on our side, and it was considered advisable, to avoid the possibility of confusion, and to avoid mistake, that certain legislation should be introduced here and in the British Parliament.  That was to validate what had been done in good faith, and it might have been argued to have been done legally.  It might also have been interpreted as an illegal act to continue to validate that, and continue in operation the General Medical Council, as established under the Medical Acts, with all its powers and its particular type of constitution, for a period which was defined, as far as the Bill in this House went, to be a year from the passing of the Bill.  The legislation was not to be similar or identical.  It was to be corresponding, co-relevant and complementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced the Bill into this House and it was treated as a matter of urgency at my request, and passed <Col N="2660" /> through all stages very speedily.  It was almost immediately brought to the Seanad, and while I was engaged, I think, on the Second Reading, and while actually speaking in the Seanad, I was informed that there were certain points, which I thought had been cleared up at our conference, still in dispute, and that it would seem desirable to have further consultations.  I had treated the thing as one of great urgency, and asked this House to treat it as such, and asked its indulgence in the matter.  I had brought the Bill to the farthest point in the Seanad that admitted of amendment.  If I had gone a step further any prospect of amendment was gone.  In the position in which I found myself I had not material to come to a decision as to whether amendment was or was not desirable.  Under these circumstances I did not proceed with the Committee Stage in the Seanad that day, as, I think, had been intended.  Between that and the next day I made inquiries as to whether or not it was intended to introduce the British Bill before the adjournment for Summer.  I also reread my notes of the conference, and came to the conclusion that they had no intention of introducing their Bill before the Summer Recess.  The critical point in the whole matter was the election, to be held some time in November.</P>
    <P>An election held under the old system would have been for representatives from all Ireland, not from the Six Counties, not from the twenty-six counties, but from all Ireland, and if the Bill had not been passed here, and the corresponding legislation in England, there would have to be a decision as to the area for which that election was to have been held.  That date seemed far enough away.  I had brought my Bill, as I said, to the furthest point possible, compatible with regular amendment, but there was no sign of the British Bill.  In the circumstances, not foreseeing the political upheaval that would occur in England, that actually would have prevented them being in a position to bring in their own legislation, I agreed, and asked for a postponement until October.  The history of things politically in Britain is known to everyone <Col N="2661" /> since, and when I saw that an election was foreshadowed, and that an election would take place, I concluded that the situation, which had been stereotyped by conference, and by definite assurance given in the form of a despatch letter, would continue, inasmuch as the situation had been changed by circumstances not exactly under our control. The Bill was accordingly not brought forward in the Seanad in October, and the election came on under the auspices of the General Medical Council.</P>
    <P>It will also be remembered that I had taken this Bill in hand simply because the Minister for Local Government, whose proper function or duty it was to look after the Bill, had broken down, just before the Summer recess, and had not been able to engage in this matter.  Before I left for Geneva I considered that, as he was back in his office, and as I was going to be away for some time, it should again return to him, and I handed the matter over to him.  However, as I had been in correspondence with some people, I one day received a letter stating that the General Medical Council felt uneasy about the situation, and that they had doubts about proceeding with the elections unless they had some assurance that the elections, when held, would be validated here.  I had very little hesitation in giving to the writer my personal assurance for what it was worth, because I knew I did it in good faith and with the will of the Dáil, because the Dáil had previously assented to a Bill which would have continued the General Medical Council in being for that critical period, and, indeed, had passed the Bill at that critical point. So, whether that assurance had any effect on the matter or not, I cannot say, but the election was proceeded with and the disputed point of difference again taken up.</P>
    <P>I resumed possession of this file, because, as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health pointed out to me, as he had not been in touch with the matter from the beginning, it seemed more desirable that I should take control of it again.  I resumed control of it, and these points which we had been discussing were taken up once more and discussed, and that discussion has <Col N="2662" /> continued until to-day.  The last date to which I can point was Saturday last, when a legal official of the Government was in London and discussed this matter with certain officials on the other side.  Now, up to this very date, as far as anything I have before me on the file dealing with the matter, and as far as an intimate connection with, I think the whole matter itself puts me in a position to say, that I have not the slightest indication that there is likely to be any sudden change in the arrangements which we made at the Conference held in London somewhere about last June, not the slightest indication, and I think I may say I have a closer and more intimate connection with the matter than anyone in this country.</P>
    <P>I have various sources of information, official sources, people with whom I am dealing and people whose correspondence I have before me and I am in close touch with the medical people, the members of the Medical Council, and the members of the medical profession in the University that I represent, and I have also close touch here with certain medical and other representatives of Trinity College, Dublin.  I have not been made aware of any serious situation such as recent Press utterance would lead one to believe had suddenly come about&mdash; nothing whatever to warrant any of these screams that recently emanated from the Press.  The position, so far as I can see it to-day is this, that I did get an absolute assurance that the General Medical Council would continue to operate as it did operate before the establishment of the Saorstát and that students will be registered, and would actually be put on the Register up to a particular date.  That was up to the end of November.  It may be said to me, therefore, that the assurance I have got has lapsed.  But I hold that the circumstances, when definitely looked into, show that the assurance must continue, and I have had no advice that that state of things is going to be brought to an end.  The circumstances I refer to are simply these.  As regards the assurance to continue the old time position up to the end of November, the point raised to me was that about <Col N="2663" /> November a critical situation, had again arisen because the election was about to be held, and it might be queried. An assurance, as far as I could give an assurance, was asked from me and that assurance I had no hesitation in giving, pointing to the Bill which had received the assent of the Dáil and which had passed its Second Reading in the Seanad, and there seemed no prospect of defeating it in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>On the assurance of that Bill, which had received the assent of the Dáil, I felt I was in a position to give an assurance to the people who questioned it that the General Medical Council, so far as that election was concerned, would be held to have acted in a legal fashion, and that obstacle was got over. The conversations, which had to a certain extent interrupted the passage of the Bill, were resumed, and these conversations have been going on&mdash;up to Saturday last.  I even approached, through the High Commissioner's office, certain people on the other side, and found that up to Monday they were not in a position to inform me as to what was being done in the matter. This was even as late as Monday.  So that nothing has happened that I am aware of to change the situation, nothing whatever.  One point that may be queried is that I have only a paper assurance up to a certain date.  An assurance of that type requires to come through certain channels.  I have approached the Medical Body, through certain channels, and it takes a long time to get letters.  But there has been no indication of any likely action to put an end to those things.  The position remains as it was after the conference in London.</P>
    <P>Now, there are one or two rumours which reached me which I think it well to dispose of here.  It has been said that I held up the Bill in the Seanad, that I gave a certain reason, but it was not the real reason, and that the real reason was that objection had been taken very strongly here to the continuance of the General Medical Council, because there was a certain nomination made by the Privy Council.  That point, of course, is absurd.  The point was raised here in the Dáil on the Committee stage of the Bill.  I answered it, <Col N="2664" /> and pointed out the position, and after I made the position clear this House assented to the continuance of it.  So why it should be supposed that a matter discussed here on the Bill, which was passed here, continuing that particular type of appointment, should now be held to be a serious objection to the Bill I cannot conceive.  Further, I have received certain resolutions from groups of students in the country&mdash;&ldquo;viewing&rdquo;&mdash;I think that is the term generally&mdash;&ldquo;with dismay the proposed change tending to the separation of the medical register here from the general medical register.&rdquo;  Even one letter went so far as &ldquo;to protest against the Bill at present before the Dáil to separate the registers.&rdquo;  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>There is no such prospect, so far as legislation here actually before us is concerned, of separation.  In fact, the Bill before us is one designed to give us an opportunity of going into the whole matter, so that the whole thing may be thrashed out before a final decision be come to, and, therefore, of course, there is no Bill before the House separating the registers.  What did happen was: the registers seemed to become separated, and we joined them together again for a year's period.  So I find myself much in the position that the people in England found themselves in as to what was said here.  I did make certain communications to the High Commissioner's Office, and with the text of the reply I received I also had this sentence put to me: &ldquo;The people over here want to know what all the excitement is about?&rdquo;  Now, if people in England, engaged with this matter, do not know what reason there is for all the excitement, and if I who have had charge of this, right through from the start, cannot see any reason for excitement, and if the people who are naturally expected to advise me if there is anything critical coming along, have not advised me of any such matter, I do not think there can be any very serious critical situation developing.</P>
    <P>We have assurances that pending legislation in both Parliaments the <Col N="2665" /> position of the General Medical Council was stereotyped up to November. That critical point, when it did arise, seemed to be got over.  I gave all the assurances I thought necessary, and I think the assurances were well grounded, that the Dáil was working in connection with the passing of the necessary legislation, and that that legislation will undoubtedly pass when next we meet.  Meanwhile, I am confident that the position with regard to the Irish medical practitioners of the Saorstát, and Great Britain, will remain absolutely unaffected by the delay that has arisen.  There is one other matter that I would mention, because a particular date is brought before the public.</P>
    <P>Speaking at a gathering in Dublin a few nights ago, certain remarks were made by a surgeon of this city which, I think, have been interpreted quite in a different manner from what was intended.  He said he received a wire from London that the position would remain unchanged until February, and he went on to say that as there was a medical final examination in January those January students would consequently be saved. Now, the implication that has been founded upon that, by certain people, who are rather nervous, at the moment, is that if you do not get qualified in January, your last chance is gone for the medical register.  There, again, of course there is unnecessarily read into a phrase what was never intended. Possibly, to some extent, I personally, am responsible for the idea because when I was endeavouring to get on paper all those assurances I had up to November, I took February or March because the Parliamentary procedure fixed that more or less for me and I was assured of the fact, that the Bill was going through the Seanad and of its being law in February.  If I mentioned February, it was because I thought the assurance guaranteed up to February covered all the necessary time until this Bill should be passed into law and that that was the necessary period.  So that to read into that casual phrase: &ldquo;This will last until February and after that the deluge,&rdquo; is quite wrong. <Col N="2666" /> What was intended was to give an assurance that the position which was unaffected up to November would remain unaffected up to February, that being the date on which it was presumed legislation here would be passed, and that the year's period would run thereafter.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for any feeling of uneasiness in this matter.  I believe, even if I had no definite assurances with a time limit on them, that any one cognisant with what is in the papers before me would realise that both in honour and in decency there would have to be some notice given to me of the proposed termination of the arrangements, even if that termination was supposed to be founded upon unnecessary delay, which the newspapers are kind enough to attribute to me in this matter.  I do not believe it is possible for any sudden stop to be put to the arrangements already come to, even though it was believed on the other side, even though the Medical Council felt, that I had been criminally negligent in this matter.  The whole course of the correspondence and of the conversations that have taken place, the whole course of action of the Medical Council, up to and including the election of new members, showed that some definite warning with a time limit would have to be given before they set about breaking the arrangements which at present exist.  Consequently, I believe that there is every reason for people to be reassured on this matter, and I hope that what I have said will succeed in reassuring them.  I hope that those people who are unfortunate enough not to be abreast of things, who believe that there is a Bill going through this House to separate the registers, will realise that is not the case.</P>

      <P>I think the interested public will read the Minister's statement with very marked feelings of relief.  On their behalf I have only one thing to suggest.  I think it is quite unnecessary, but if it were added to the Minister's statement it would accentuate the feelings to which I have referred; that is a simple statement on his part that he will do all in his power <Col N="2667" /> to hasten matters in order to arrive at a satisfactory termination of the conversations to which he has referred.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Thrift has said that the statement of the Minister will do something to allay the anxiety that has been, to a large extent I think, propagated through the Press for the last week or so.  There is no doubt about the effect it has had on the minds of medical students and upon parents whose children are in their last year of medicine.  It seems to them a terrible thing that at the last stage of the medical course students should be debarred from being placed upon the General Register.  I want to emphasise that word.  It is not a British Register, as some people call it.  It is a General Register, representing the graduates of England, Ireland, and Scotland.  The Council is not a British Council, but a Council composed of representatives of the three countries.  There are many points to which I might allude, but I think it quite unnecessary to discuss the matter further at present.  I only wish to say that I think the Minister has done a wise thing in allaying the fears created by the scare with regard to the closing of the General Register.</P>

In fact, if the point&mdash;there is really only one point under discussion&mdash;was completed by whatever day the Seanad meets next week, I could get the Bill through even then.  That does not depend upon me.  I have to hear what the people on the other side have to say, and to form my opinion as to their arguments.  When that is done, I can proceed immediately with the Bill, and I am quite certain that the Seanad will facilitate me in getting it through next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the invitation given him to state the position regarding Irish seamen, employed on British-owned or Northern Ireland boats, in respect of unemployment benefit.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should continue his conversations with the British and Northern Ireland Governments with a view to reciprocity between the three Governments.  I am told that there are not more than a couple of thousand seamen affected by those conversations and likely to be debarred <Col N="2671" /> from insurance benefit, if the conversations fail.  But I am aware that within the past couple of months a Dublin crew engaged at the North Wall, Dublin, on a Belfast-owned ship sailed to America and back, and were discharged in Dublin port&mdash;the port at which they were engaged.  Their unemployment cards were stamped with British stamps, and at present the men cannot claim benefit under the Unemployment Act.  If the Minister presses the matter with the Governments concerned, the representatives of the seamen believe that good results will follow. It was said on the last occasion that seamen were not insurable.  I have mentioned the case of this ship.  The men's cards were stamped, but they are now unable to draw any unemployment benefit in the City of Dublin.  I do not generally delay the Dáil more than five minutes when I stand up, and I will content myself with quoting this one case and asking the Minister what his intentions are with regard to Irish seamen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be convenient now for the Minister to make a statement touching on the wider question of reciprocal arrangements.  Perhaps it is taking the Minister too much at short notice.  But if it is possible for the Minister to do so, it would be well if the Dáil were made aware, and the public, through the reports, of what the position is between himself and the Ministers for Labour in the Northern Parliament and the British Parliament.</P>

      <P>I previously gave a promise that I would, at a suitable opportunity, make a statement with regard to the general question of reciprocal arrangements.  That would involve the question raised now&mdash;the question of the seamen.  The statement I have here is a somewhat lengthy one, and I do not know that it would come in suitably now.  If the matter could be raised this day week&mdash;which is the only other opportunity we have&mdash;I could arrange to have copies of the statement circulated to Deputies beforehand.  The statement is rather long, and I do not <Col N="2672" /> think that this is the proper time to make it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point put forward by Deputy Byrne, perhaps I may make a few remarks in advance of the general statement, to which I have referred.  It is not correct to say, as Deputy Byrne has said, that those involved would only number 2,000.  The number I got was about 12,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BYRNE Mr. BYRNE">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got the figure, 12,000, as the number who would normally be affected.  On the only basis suggested to us for agreement, that would involve this State in a payment of about £34,000 per annum. That is with regard to the seamen.</P>
      <P>There are labourers and others of the insured classes who go to work in England and have contributions paid for them into the English fund and who, when out of work, come back here and fall on our fund.  The only suggestion made to date is that payment should be made to the fund of the country in which the man is working, and that benefit should come out of the fund of the country in which the man finds himself out of work.  We have a considerable number of people who cross to England for employment, get employment, and have contributions paid for them on the English side.  They come home here when out of work, and agreement on this basis would mean that they would fall on our fund, to which no contributions would have been paid by them.  There is very little movement of labour the other way &mdash;English people coming across here getting employment, having their contributions paid to the fund of this country and then falling for benefit, when out of work, on their own fund in England.  The normal payment on account of that, it is estimated, would be about £18,000.  If we accepted the only suggestion made for agreement, this State would be involved in a payment likely to be as large as £50,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not a solution we could accept. We did make a suggestion on the <Col N="2673" /> basis of the only type of reciprocity which seems fair&mdash;that payments should be noted or an average taken over a certain number of years, or that actual payments made by people into a particular fund should be noted and that those payments should be credited to the fund of the country in which the insured person finds himself out of work.  We have not been able to secure that.  We made many attempts but could not secure reciprocity in that way.  I have now only dealt with a few questions raised.  The general question I hope to deal with, if facilitated, next Friday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill, 1924.  On the First Reading of this Bill I explained that its main purpose was to secure unity of control of the two police forces functioning in the Saorstát.  It will be appreciated that two artificially divided areas of police jurisdiction, each with a separate headquarters police staff, necessitate a considerable amount of wasteful routine and it is difficult to achieve the co-ordination of services which is essential to efficiency.  In framing the Bill, care was taken to effect the amalgamation of the two existing forces rather than have the abolition of either. Every member of both forces, when amalgamation takes effect, will become a member of the amalgamated force which will be called the Gárda Síochána.</P>
      <P>At present, the senior headquarters officers of the D.M.P. consist of a Commissioner and an Assistant Commissioner, and the senior officers of the Gárda Síochána include a Commissioner, a Deputy Commissioner, and two Assistant Commissioners.  The senior officers in the amalgamated force will be one Commissioner, two Deputy Commissioners, and two Assistant Commissioners.  The present Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána will become the Commissioner of the amalgamated force, the Commissioner of the D.M.P., and the Deputy Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána will become Deputy Commissioners of the amalgamated force, and the two Assistant Commissioners of the Gárda Síochána will become Assistant Commissioners of the amalgamated force. All others, members of the existing forces, will become, on the appointed day, members of corresponding rank in the amalgamated force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Future appointments of officers will be made by the Executive Council. Existing members of the D.M.P., and the Gárda Síochána, will continue to be entitled to pay and allowances at the rates now respectively applying to those forces, and no member of the <Col N="2676" /> D.M.P. will become liable to serve, without his own consent, outside the Dublin Metropolitan area.  The existing pension enactments applying to the D.M.P. will continue to apply to those members of that force who become members of the amalgamated force, and for the purpose of these enactments, the service of such members in the amalgamated force will be deemed to be service in the D.M.P.  Future pay and allowance orders for the amalgamated force may be made by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, and copies of such orders must be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Future pension orders may similarly be made, but will require to be approved by resolution of each House. The present D.M.P. regulations as to promotion, discipline and such matters will continue to apply to the members of the amalgamated force stationed in the D.M.P. area, while the Gárda Síochána regulations on these subjects will apply to members stationed outside that area.  The power to make future regulations on these matters is conferred on the Minister for Justice, subject to the approval of the Executive Council. With the exception of Section 16, the remaining provisions are merely minor consequential adaptations of existing enactments.  Section 16 deals with the future of the Dublin police rate, and proposes that this rate shall abate by one penny yearly from the end of the financial year following the commencement of the operation of the Act, and expiring at the end of the eighth year.</P>
    <P>There were certain erroneous statements made recently which I would like to correct.  The statements were made in the Press relative to retirements from the D.M.P.  It was stated that about 100 of the old force&mdash;meaning the force as it was transferred to the Irish Government&mdash;now remained.  The facts are that out of 1,124 members of the force serving at the date of transfer, over 400 are still serving; 558 retired in consequence of the change of Government. That was the reason given for their retirement.  Over 100 went in the ordinary way on retirement, or died, or were discharged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2677" /> About 40 have been refused retirement with compensation for various reasons, and their cases will be affected by proceedings at present before the High Courts.  It was stated in the Press that owing to the numerous retirements, promotion was now so rapid that a man could become a station sergeant after eighteen months.  Excluding the Detective Branch, none of the existing sergeants has less than sixteen years' service, and no sergeant has less than four years' service.  I thought it as well to correct the statements which have appeared recently.</P>
    <P>The exact figures as to retirement under Article 10 of the Treaty are, 11 Inspectors, 25 Station Sergeants, 95 Sergeants, and 427 Constables, giving a total of 558.  There are forty cases pending that will be affected by the decision of the case at present before the Court.  I mentioned to-day that one reason for my desire to obtain the Second Reading of this Bill before the Recess was that I would take certain action, administratively, if the principle of this Bill is approved by the Dáil which I would not otherwise take. Deputies are aware, from personal knowledge of their constituencies and from the daily Press, of the need for greater security of person and property in certain areas of the country. The particular relevancy of this Bill to that question is, that under the Bill the Detective Branch of the Metropolitan Police, with an increased membership, will be enabled to function through the country.  Strictly and legally, they could so function at the moment, but unless I had a reasonable certainty of this Bill becoming law I would not attempt to use that force in areas in which the Gárda Síochána at present serve. There are human difficulties in the way of that.  It would be, in general, undesirable that the members of one force would be actively operating in an area in which members of another force are serving.  If I felt that within a few months the two forces would be likely to be fused and amalgamated that particular difficulty would tend to disappear. It is probably generally recognised that the unarmed and uniform force which operates in the country requires some stiffening and falling back, vide, the performance of a criminal <Col N="2678" /> who resorts to arms in his crime.  It will also be recognised that it is not a proper state of affairs that the only stiffening and falling back should be the Army.  It is, I submit, bad for the Army and bad for the people that the Army should be called on to intervene frequently in what is substantially a peace situation, and it is wrong that the military machine would be called upon to move every time some thug holds up a bank or post office, or perpetrates some robbery with arms in a rural area.  The change of enabling the Detective Branch of the Metropolitan Police, or rather what has been the Detective Branch of the Metropolitan Police, to operate in the country in cases of the more serious forms of crime will tend to diminish the occasions on which the military would be called on to intervene in the ordinary life of the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Deputies that there is a very full appreciation of the fact that when you put arms into the possession of men who do not wear uniform, and when you put arms into the hands of men who have no particular badge or insignia to distinguish them from ordinary civilians, you take on a responsibility with regard to the personnel of such branch or organisation which is greater even than that which you must accept with regard to your uniformed forces.  I undertake that, in the case of this detective branch, there will be the closest scrutiny of the character of the men who are recruited.  I recognise fully the necessity for that, but I recognise also, and I ask the Deputies to recognise, that one cannot expect the Gárda Síochána to continue facing, with their bare hands, so to speak, the armed criminal, the man who uses arms in the performance of his crime.  I hope that the supplementing of the unarmed force with plain clothes detectives, who will carry and use arms when necessary, will have good reactions on the general peace of the country and on the security of person and property to which citizens are entitled, citizens of rural areas being as much entitled to it as citizens of any other area.  Deputy Gorey will appreciate a remark of that kind.  If the Dáil, in reasonable proportion, or <Col N="2679" /> by a reasonable majority, approves of the principle of this Bill, I will not wait for its final passing before I commence to take administrative action tending towards a complete fusion of the forces. I want to draw attention to the fact that for the ordinary member of the Metropolitan Police the change will be very slight.  His duties will remain the same and the scope of his duties will remain the same.  It is simply a fusion at the top, a fusion at headquarters. To every existing member of the Metropolitan Police there is guaranteed by the Bill, security of tenure in the metropolitan area.  He will not be asked to serve outside that area without his own consent.  Recruiting in future will be to a single and amalgamated force, and those who recruit in future may be sent to any part of the area in which the force serves.  I do not know that I have anything particular to add, but I will be glad to endeavour to meet any point that may be raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my recollection is right that the Minister adumbrated the Bill but did not actually promise it.  He suggested the possibility of bringing in the Bill.  What is the result?  We devoted a considerable amount of time to the Gárda Síochána Bill and the Dublin Police Bill, and we are now asked by this Bill to repeal 10 out of 24 Sections of the Gárda Síochána Act and to repeal 7 out of 14 Sections of the Dublin Police Act. That hardly looks like very good staff <Col N="2680" /> work, and it hardly indicated very much foresight, that after discussing, debating, and amending these Bills we have to repeal half of them within less than a year.  I think the time of the Dáil would have been saved and a more satisfactory solution would have been given if the whole problem was thought out, and if we had one comprehensive Bill dealing with the whole of the police force in the first instance.  I would pass from one or two points which seem to be Committee points, but as the Minister has indicated that he is going, if he gets the Second Reading, to carry out the policy of the Bill at once it is not unfair to raise them now. One point is, what is going to happen to the Assistant-Commissioner of the D.M.P.?  He appears in the Schedule but not in the Bill, and in the Gárda Síochána Act there are already two Assistant Commissioners with regard to that force, and under Section 7 of this Bill they will continue to be Assistant Commissioners.  Is the Assistant Commissioner of the D.M.P. going to be placed on the pension list?</P>

      <P>Then we are inflating the pension Vote, which is already over-inflated.  I am glad to have obtained that admission from the Minister.  I know that the officer who holds the post has certain rights under the Treaty.  I think it is common ground, even on the Ministerial Benches, that the country cannot afford to pay any more pensions.  This measure is, in some respects, going to add to the pension list and I think it will stand as a retrograde measure. Then again what is going to happen to the bands of the Metropolitan Police and of the Civic Guard?  There is nothing about them here.  They exist, I believe, as a matter of private arrangement. Are they both going to continue to exist?  Is the Minister going to send the man who plays the trombone in Phoenix Park to track down illicit alcohol in Connemara?  Is he going to send the man who plays the big drum in the D.M.P. band to control traffic in College Green?  The principal objection which I wish to raise is this. What will be the position of Dublin after this re-organisation?  Will there <Col N="2681" /> be any officer definitely responsible for the policing of the city of Dublin and the adjoining townships?</P>
      <P>If I may recall the past to the recollection of the Dáil, five years ago the City of Belfast was policed by the Royal Irish Constabulary.  There was in the City of Belfast an officer of the Royal Irish Constabulary of high rank who held the post of City Commissioner, and who was responsible for the policing of Belfast.  Will there be any such official in Dublin?  Will there be any one authority to whom the citizens of Dublin and the adjoining townships can turn and regard as a responsible authority?  Will there be anyone for suggesting legislation regarding Dublin which applies to Dublin, and Dublin alone?  I have heard, and I believe it to be the case, that there is a measure in draft regulating traffic, street trading and other matters in Dublin.  What will happen to that measure when there is no longer a Commissioner of Police for Dublin alone?  Will it be persevered in?  Will it have to be remodelled in order to meet the new conditions?  I think we are entitled to know all that before we approve of the principle of the Bill and give it a Second Reading. The population of Dublin Metropolitan district is 400,000, which is considerably more than one-tenth of the whole population of the Saorstát, and I suggest that there is a case for exceptional treatment, a case for creating one officer to whom the citizens of Dublin can go and apply on police questions, and that there should be someone, whether a Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner, or whatever he may be called, in high rank on whom the police charge of Dublin should definitely devolve.</P>

      <P>I did not think we would have this Bill before us for Second Reading until after the resumption. I know nothing about what is in the Bill except what I have picked up from the Minister.  Just looking through it, I think the object of this Second Reading is to get sanction to the proposal that the Minister may allow plain clothes policemen to exercise their talents in country areas, which he says he is at present legally entitled to do.  I think it is quite a <Col N="2682" /> good procedure for the Minister to acquaint the Dáil with his views as regards the utilisation of a central control&mdash;that is, a Dublin control of police for service in the country.  If he has the power to do it, and wishes to exercise the power, I think it is well that he has come to the Dáil and given it an opportunity to express its views on that proposal.</P>
      <P>I think it is a pity he should mix up that with the motion to give a Second Reading to the Bill, which embodies many more things than that.  I think he can make quite a good case for his proposal regarding the utilisation of plain clothes police in the country districts for special service.  It is very desirable that the bulk of the policemen in the country should remain unarmed, that that should be the normal, and that only special officers, specially trained, with special qualifications, with restraint, discrimination and self-control, should be allowed to carry arms, and then only under special circumstances. I think it is a pity that that proposal should be bound up with a proposal to carry the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some of us, of course, who look forward to a time when the police idea will be that of a Civic Guard, but a Civic Guard in the local sense&mdash;that is, a local police force, a locally controlled police force.  That, I admit, is an idea that is probably a long way from realisation, and it would be folly to attempt a reform of that kind at the moment.  I do not think that the proposal to combine in headquarters the D.M.P. and the Gárda Síochána will, to any extent, frustrate that idea being achieved.  I agree with Deputy Major Bryan Cooper that in a city like Dublin there ought to be a distinct element of local authority for that force.  If there is nothing in the Bill to create that local authority, or to ensure that there shall be a distinct authority applying to Dublin, or the Metropolitan area, then I think it ought to be introduced, but I would wish that the Dáil would not be asked to give a Second Reading to this Bill to-night.  I do not know whether there are any other Deputies besides Deputy Bryan Cooper who have had the opportunity <Col N="2683" /> of reading the Bill, or have taken such great interest in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But I quite seriously say that I do not believe that that Bill had consideration, even sufficient to warrant the Second Reading.  Might I suggest to the Minister that it is not tactically wise to announce to the Dáil, and to another House of this legislature, that if the Dáil gives a Second Reading to a measure he will take that as sufficient to justify him in taking special action.  I say it is not tactically wise, if he wants to get this measure through the other House.  He would be, I think, just as well armed if he would accept a general expression of opinion, without pressing for a Second Reading, that in the special circumstances he is warranted in using the legal powers that he has to send armed police officers on special service to the country districts, and if that general expression of opinion is available for him to-night I would urge that he would not press for a Second Reading of this Bill, which has not had and cannot have to-night the real consideration that such a very important measure should have.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly this Bill is one that will create a large amount of public interest, and I would agree with Deputy Johnson that having had the measure introduced, I would like to give the public an opportunity of expressing an opinion on the principles of the Bill, and give Deputies rather more time to consider a very important change of this nature.  At first blush the principles that underlie the Bill appeal to me as being in a direction which I can entirely approve.  The Dublin Metropolitan Police, of course, as an isolated force, is and has always been a very expensive luxury.  The Minister in this Bill, I think, also brings home to us in a rather direct way the position of our new State and, perhaps, <Col N="2684" /> will bring our minds down to examine the comparatively small resources that are at our disposal, that the Free State as a whole is not large enough to have numerous bodies, each self-contained, that the policing of the area of the Free State, including Dublin, would seem to be a matter that could be very well carried out by one force.  On the other hand, in Dublin it would also seem to be desirable that in replacing a body of men, picked men they always were, like the Dublin Metropolitan Police, some arrangement should be made so that the status of the force in the capital of the State should be maintained at a standard somewhat approximating to the traditions of the force in the past. I think the Minister for Justice, in connection with the statement as regards the armed body of men within the organisation of the police, brings home to us that a considerable amount of protection is still required to deal with the cases which are cropping up constantly, as reported in the Press, and the transforming of the organisation of the police into a partly armed force raises a very big question as to this matter of arming police.  But if it is desirable, and it would certainly seem to be necessary in the present state of affairs, I think the other side of the question, expenditure, would be something to be considered also.  I am sorry if it is out of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we have now got to recognise your attitude on some questions; we are under the necessity of having to ask your ruling on them. But I do think that this is a very much bigger measure than the mere measure within the walls of this Bill, because it raises so many thoughts in one's mind. Deputy Bryan Cooper has referred to the fact that there have been two or three Bills dealing with the police forces within a very short space of time. It seems to me that in considering and dealing with this Bill other questions arise which I, as an advocate of economy might like to raise, but which you, sir, would say were out of order at present.  I certainly would support the plea of Deputy Johnson that in so far <Col N="2685" /> as the subject can be ventilated to-night well and good, but I doubt the wisdom of putting the Bill through its Second Reading in a limited House.  I do think that the public have to be taken into account in these matters, and a number of these Bills that come before us are rather hurriedly put through without giving any indication to the public that they are coming on. That is not fair to the public.  I think the most valuable work this Dáil has to do to-day is to educate and broaden public opinion on all these points so that we as representatives may get the expression of opinion of people outside the Dáil, and we ought to emphasise to these people the absolute need of considering these matters in the state of affairs that exists, really creating and forming an intelligent opinion of all legislation going through.  Bills are constantly passed with a good deal of discussion, or sometimes with very little discussion, and I venture to say that a large number of people in the country never know anything about these Bills until they are put into operation.  That, I think, is a very decided drawback to legislation here, and until we get people to take an interest in our proceedings and to take intelligent views on these very big questions, we will be hampered in the expression of our opinions and the way that we would wish to represent the considered views of the public on the matter.  This is a simple Bill when you look at it at first, but when you come to examine the effects of it you will find it is not as simple as it looks.  I would ask the Minister merely to take a discussion on the Bill to-night, but not to ask for a formal Second Reading of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill gives an extension of power to the Minister in the matter of dealing with crime down the country, I certainly welcome it.  I am not sure as to the precise extent of the Minister's powers at present, but I know that the Civic Guard require a good deal of assistance to keep order and subdue disorder in certain parts of the country at the moment.  Very frequently one hears of lamentable outrages which occur, such as the holding up of people, the robbing <Col N="2686" /> of banks and one thing and another. These outrages are committed by armed criminals, but the unfortunate Civic Guards who go out to round up these ruffians have to face them with their bare hands.  Within the last few days a couple of bad outrages have been reported. In Athy the post office was robbed and the officials held up.  The Civic Guards chased the robbers, who were armed.  The robbers opened fire on the Guards, but despite that the latter pluckily captured these armed men.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to these unfortunate Civic Guards that they should have to stand up, with their naked hands, in front of lethal weapons.  Another very lamentable case occurred in my own district within the last few days.  A lady returning from an estate of which she has charge, was waylaid by three men.  They took her off her bicycle and made an attempt to murder her by poisoning.  The worst feature of this sort of crime is that frequently there is common knowledge in the country as to who committed and who were associated with these crimes, but it is very difficult, indeed, to get information in these cases.  I think if the Minister had power, as the necessity arose, to send down armed detectives in plain clothes to make inquiries in the districts in which these crimes were committed, it would have a very salutary effect.  At present the Civic Guard have to depend in a kind of a way on the military.  The military, of course, are armed, but the fact that they are in uniform makes it known to everybody that they are coming, and because of that they are not of any great advantage.  I could give an instance of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own district there are one or two dangerous individuals.  At the moment that the military come in sight these gentlemen, as they did on a few occasions, make themselves scarce.  Deputy Cooper referred to the cost of this new force, or rather, I think, to the cost of having to pension some new officer in connection with the Bill.  I consider that the additional cost of the pension will be relatively small in comparison with the added security which I believe the Minister's scheme will bring about in time.  It is about time <Col N="2687" /> that this horrible form of crime should be put down in the country, and that the people in general should waken up to a sense of their civic responsibilities so that they would co-operate with the law and with the forces of the law.  As long as they know that there are armed criminals going about, and that there is no one to look after them, it will be difficult for them to arrive at that state of mind.  I, for one, knowing the conditions in the rural areas, certainly welcome the principle of the Bill in so far as it gives the Minister extra power to deal with these classes of crimes.</P>

      <P>There is just one question I would like to ask the Minister. It is this: How is it that a force which, so far as I know, is not known to the law, has made its appearance in this Bill, a force called the &ldquo;Civic Guard&rdquo;?  This is the first time, so far as I know, that a body of that name has got official recognition.  You have in Section 2 the &ldquo;Gárda Síochana,&rdquo; including the &ldquo;Civic Guard.&rdquo;  There is a reference in another section to the &ldquo;Gárda Síochána,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Civic Guard.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister will tell us how that occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitated to speak on this matter, but there is a little point worrying me that I would wish to bring to the notice of the Minister. Some time ago I read in the newspapers that a plain clothes man, in trying to quell a disturbance, went into a house.  He was met with resistance by the parties in the house.  They were afterwards prosecuted, and explained that when the man showed no authority and had not a badge of any sort they mistook him for a robber, thinking it was some sort of a hold-up, and then attacked the plain clothes man. That story was practically accepted in the court as a likely thing to happen. What I would suggest to the Minister is that when a plain clothes man is called to quell a disturbance or to remove objectionable people from any place, instead of having to fight his way, he would, before he interferes, produce or display a badge of some sort.  That would stop resistance or an attack on him by people who might <Col N="2688" /> think he was a stranger attacking other people.  There was another incident I witnessed myself within the last six weeks.  It was the case of a man who was called to remove people.  I do not wish to mention the place from which he was called to remove people, but these people looked at him and, in their own minds, wondered who he was. They probably said some strong things and resisted.  Within a space of two minutes there was a squabble, and as a result of the squabble I am satisfied from what I saw that there were a number of black eyes the next morning.</P>
      <P>In a police force that should not happen. A plain clothes policeman should not be put in that position, that sympathetic strangers, believing he was an intruder, would go to the rescue of the prisoner and attack him, the policeman.  I should say that this is not altogether on the one side.  They might probably, when attacked, use more force than necessary when they meet with resistance.  I would suggest to the Minister that no plain clothes officer should be allowed to go into a private house or a public place to quell a disturbance without showing his authority.  When he did show his authority the people would instantly know that he was a plain clothes man and that he had the authority of the police force and of the country behind him.  We all know there are times in which people who are engaged in a quarrel are more afraid of the uniform than of the man.  If a badge or some authority were shown on the two occasions I have referred to, I am satisfied that the disturbances would be quelled more easily and much more quickly than they actually were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper speaks about this being the third Police Bill before the Dáil.  Now, the Dáil has been sitting late these days and I take it that Deputy Cooper had not really had time to consider the Bill, and that these thoughts which occurred to him, are really more or less spur-of-the-moment thoughts and that we should not expect too much profundity in them.  But if he considered a moment I think he would not have taken this line of criticism: &ldquo;This is the third <Col N="2689" /> Police Bill before the Dáil.  Are we to be always considering Police Bills; why was not a proper police policy put before us long ago instead of chopping at the cherry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sequence of the police Bills was a perfectly proper and reasonable sequence.  We had, first of all, to pass a hurried and temporary Civic Guard Act to give the new force that was being distributed throughout the country some statutory existence, and that was done.  It was Bill No. 1.  Then the term of that Act ran out, and after a date the Civic Guard, as they were called in the first Bill, when they went out first, would have just as much and as little power of arrest in the country as Deputy Cooper or myself.  Therefore, a permanent Act after some experience of the other Act, was brought forward.  Deputy Cooper would, up to that point, be justified in saying: &ldquo;Well at that stage why not put a considered police policy for the country before the Dáil?&rdquo;  It is not quite so easy and so simple as that.  It is not like draughts or chess.  There are human factors. Personally I do not believe it would have been possible to introduce a Bill for the amalgamation of these two forces much before the present date. Certainly, I would be inclined to think that six months ago would have been too early.  It was something we were moving towards.  As a matter of fact, on the last occasion that such a police Bill was before the Dáil I admitted in answer to a challenge from Deputy Johnson that it was not easy to make a case for the existence of two police forces in the country, and I expressed the opinion that I, or someone in my position, would bring forward a Bill for the amalgamation of the two forces, but there were human factors and they had to be watched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could easily effect a result that would not be to increase efficiency by bringing forward a Bill of this kind prematurely.  As it is, I am satisfied that the net result will be to have efficient police work in the country.  In the abstract, it is a bad thing, and it is rather a factor in favour of the criminal that you have two separate self-contained police jurisdictions.  In these days of Ford motor cars crime has very <Col N="2690" /> often its roots and its conception in the capital, and its results down the country, and the man who strikes down the country slips back from the area of jurisdiction of the Gárda Síochána into the capital.  Alternately, the rural criminal drifts up to Dublin to sink his identity there and generally, I think it is a matter that does not require very much arguing, that you need to face crime in the present day, with a unified system of police intelligence and administration. The Border will always be another factor in favour of the lawbreaker because of the separation of jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Therefore I moved the permanent Act for the Gárda Síochána, still watching the possibility of the fusion of the two forces.  There have been developments since, some developments which we neither expected nor desired.  As I say, somewhat over 1,100 men were transferred. Out of these 558 retired under an Article of the Treaty which was intended to cover the case of men to whom the new regime would be utterly obnoxious, or alternately those who would be so obnoxious to the new regime that it would not be desirable to retain their services.  Some 558 of the D.M.P. went out under that Article, professedly because they objected to serving after the change of Government. The lure of the pension was there and it was too great.  That creates a new situation.</P>
    <P>Seven-elevenths of the Dublin Metropolitan Police as it now exists, is new and has been recruited within the last years out of substantially the same material as the Gárda Síochána.  Four hundred odd of the old Dublin Metropolitan Police, the transferred force, remain.  I do not like to discuss here a matter which Deputy Cooper raised, and still, I have no doubt, it is of public importance and public interest.   do not like to discuss the case of an individual officer here.  Shortly after we took over the Dublin Metropolitan Police it was intimated to the Commissioner of the day, Col. Johnstone, that he scarcely fitted in, and I think he more or less appreciated that himself. He retired, getting his rights under the Treaty.  Mr. Barrett was at that time kept on.  The one factor in my mind at <Col N="2691" /> the time was that it might help to steady the force and to hold members of the force, if Mr. Barrett, who was Assistant Commissioner, were retained. Now, almost 558 men have left the force since that date.</P>
    <P>The disappearance of these 558 men is a new factor in the situation.  With the going of these men the raison d'etre for retaining Mr. Barrett's services disappeared. I have seen him on the matter. I have informed him that it is not proposed to take him over into the amalgamated force.  There would be difficulties in connection with that step which I do not want to stress or elaborate too much, but which none the less exist, and it is eminently a kind of case which that particular article of the Treaty was intended to cover.  It is not a question of personality or a question of not liking the colour of a man's hair, but factors do exist which render it difficult to bring over this particular officer into the amalgamated force.  If he were brought over it would prejudice the prospects of a successful fusion, and, after all, it is that that one aims at&mdash;efficient police administration, an efficient service for the people in return for the money which they pay.</P>
    <P>I deprecate the arguments of Deputy Cooper in connection with the matter of placing an additional burden on the pension list, but from my side I can only put it up that it is a sound case and that I could not feel the same confidence that the new departure would be a success and would work smoothly if I made the experiment of taking that particular officer into the amalgamated force.  I do not want to deal further with that particular point.  In a way, it is not the kind of point that one likes to discuss in public at all.  The point has been made that this Bill repeals sections of the Dublin Police Act and the Gárda Síochána Act.  This Bill repeals certain sections of those Acts.  The Deputies will appreciate that a particularly difficult task will have to be accomplished, the merging of two forces on equal terms and in such a way that it would not have the effect of abolition of either force but amalgamation in the fullest sense of the word.  That involves <Col N="2692" /> a certain amount of difficulty in draftsmanship. The sections repealed which were useful were re-enacted.</P>
    <P>I rather deprecate the superficial criticism of bad staff work.  It is not bad staff work that first of all gave us the temporary Act enabling the Gárda Síochána to function for a year, and then a permanent Act based on our observations and experience of the temporary one that brought the position of the Dublin Police Act, which became difficult of administration owing to the change of Government, up to date and finally gave us this Bill which amalgamates the two forces under one Act.  So far from being bad staff work, it is a feat of staff work of which I feel legitimately proud and of which the Department can be legitimately proud. The point I expected some opposition on, which did not come, was the matter of the continuance of the special police rates here in Dublin, and although it was not challenged, I would like, in a way, to make a case for its continuance for a period.  To abolish it now would mean throwing on the Exchequer a burden of upwards of £50,000 a year, and that is something we could not face at the moment.  The police service of Dublin will continue substantially the same, and this rate will disappear over a period of eight years.  It gives a little time to the Treasury to adjust themselves to the situation, and I think it is not too much to ask that this contribution which has been levied for a period of 50 years will continue in a diminishing proportion for 7 or 8 years.</P>

      <P>Yes, at the rate of a penny a year; it will be gone in eight years.  Deputy Cooper asked me to whom may the citizens of Dublin and the surrounding districts look for police administration.  There will be a senior officer, a chief superintendent of the amalgamated force, in charge of the metropolitan division.  In addition to that, one of the deputy commissioners under the Bill, most probably it will be the present Chief Commissioner of the D.M.P., will have a special interest in and a special responsibility for the <Col N="2693" /> metropolitan division.  The line of responsibility to me will be through the Chief Commissioner of the amalgamated force, but ordinary common sense and tact will suggest that the present Chief Commissioner of the D.M.P. will continue to take a particular interest in and responsibility for, the metropolitan division.  I do not believe that the citizens of Dublin and the surrounding districts will have any cause to complain. Once before some Senators and others came to me deprecating a particular police change, the abolition of Oriel House, and of a fusion of the best of Oriel House with the detective division of the Metropolitan Police.</P>
      <P>I think if I had an opportunity of discussing the matter now with those Senators who came to me at the time they would admit that the change did not result in any lesser security in the capital.  On the contrary, it gave a higher pitch of security and better discipline without at all impairing the efficiency.  I feel the same about this particular change, that it is a proper step to take.  I believe that six months ago would be too early, and six months ahead would be too late, in as much as the idea of the two forces would have become stereotyped.  You have now 700 out of 1,100 who came in new within the last two years, and the time to make the change is before the idea of two separate forces becomes stereotyped in this State.  We have all along been watching the situation with a view to trying to appreciate the right time to bring about the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, in spite of the objections that have been raised, and of representations from some Deputies, press for the Second Reading of this Bill to-night. It is not that I will do anything, having got the Second Reading, which I could not have legally done yesterday, but the human difficulties are there.  It would have been looking for trouble and friction&mdash;to have attempted to do what, as a matter of fact, I had legal power to do&mdash;to attempt to send detective members of the Metropolitan Police down the country.  They would not have got&mdash;and I say it making every allowance for the fact that an organised force tends to develop an <Col N="2694" /><i>esprit de corps</i> and a <i>morale</i> of its own &mdash;from the officers of the Gárda Síochána the good will and the cooperation necessary to secure results. After the principle of the Bill, purporting to effect amalgamation is approved by the Dáil, you have a different situation. Members of each force begin to realise that they are members of one force in future and those other difficulties disappear.  I would, therefore, if the principle of this Bill were approved, proceed to spread out a bit with the detective branch and certainly be looking for personnel for the increased membership of that branch.  I would proceed to take certain administrative steps with the kind of confidence that, perhaps, with a change here and there, substantially, the Bill was approved and likely to become law while not doing anything beyond my legal powers at the moment.  It is not exactly sprung on the Dáil or the public.  The knowledge of my intention to introduce a Bill of this kind has been public knowledge for some considerable time back.  Some enterprising Press man got a hold of it and it appeared even sooner for the public than I would have wished.  Thus it became accepted as a matter of course and has been constantly referred to in the Press for the last couple of weeks and even a couple of months.</P>
    <P>I rather deprecate the suggestion that the Bill should be simply left as it is, and that Deputies would be able to reflect on it over the Recess.  Deputy Johnson urged this step last June, and more or less invited me to show cause for having two distinct forces.  I said then that I did not really see the cause beyond the fact that the two forces existed and that I hoped for the speedy amalgamation of these forces.  This Bill represents the considered judgment of my Department, recognised from the start as desirable.  The principle of it has been for some time before the public. There have been protests and representations made to me that I ought to desist, and if Deputies think that it represents something that is desirable administratively and makes for greater efficiency, then they ought to trust me and my Department that we have sized up the right time for its introduction. <Col N="2695" /> I do hope the Bill will receive its Second Reading to-night.</P>
