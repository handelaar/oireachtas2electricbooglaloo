      <P>The case of the owners of the Martinstown Club has been ruled by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission to be outside the scope of their terms of reference.  The case may, however, be found proper for submission to the War Compensation Court in regard to which negotiations are at present in progress.</P>

      <P>The claim made by Mr. James Lally, of Moate, Westmeath, in respect to damage done to his premises during the <Col N="204" /> military occupation, was greatly exaggerated, being at the rate of £5,200 per annum for the use of accommodation in his premises as an officers' mess.  The award of £35 10s., which has been accepted by him in final settlement, is a fair one, and does not call for review.</P>

In the circumstances I regret that it is not practicable to make any grant to his dependents.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a cow, the property of Mr. McDonald, was killed by collision with a military motor-car on the 24th February, 1923. The matter was investigated by a Military Court of Inquiry, which found that the accident was caused by the cow running in front of the car, and that the driver of the car could not avoid striking the animal.

Wicklow, in respect of the service of her son, Patrick, in the National Army from February 8th, 1923, to March 25th, 1924; and whether, in view of the fact that this woman is destitute, and has a large family to support, payment of allowance due will be expedited.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Flood's claim for dependents allowance in respect of her son Patrick was disallowed after due investigation on the ground that the net amount which he contributed towards the maintenance of the home was less than the minimum required by the regulations, namely, 12s. per week, before an allowance might be issued.  Mrs. Flood was notified accordingly on the 5th November last.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the amount expended on the upkeep of roads in County Longford for the three years ending 31st March, 1924, and how much of the sum expended was raised locally, and how much contributed by grants; further, if he will state the report of the Chief Roads Engineer on the condition of the roads in that county, and what immediate steps he proposes to take to put the roads in proper repair and to ensure that for the future the ratepayers will get better results for money expended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount expended in the three years ended 31st March, 1924, on road upkeep by the Longford County Council was, approximately, £54,535, of which £50,811 was defrayed from rates and £3,724 from special grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Chief Roads Engineer cannot be treated adequately in answer to a question.  It shows that there is laxity of control over those employed on the roads, that more resolute attention is required to their duties by the Surveyors, and that the amount voted for the roads has not kept pace with the rise in wages or <Col N="213" /> with the necessities of the case in view of the large increase in motor traffic since 1913.  At the same time the Engineer reports that the Council appear to have done their best in difficult times, and it is expected that with cooperation all round the roads bearing the heaviest traffic will be made tolerably right within the current year. The report recommends that the minor roads should be set to contractors.</P>
    <P>A copy of the report is being sent to the Council, who, with their survey staff, are being given an opportunity to improve the road administration and secure a better return for the expenditure. A further inspection will be made at an early date.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that the adjournment be taken at 12 o'clock to-night.  I find that on the Order Paper to-day there is one measure which may take considerable time.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to oppose this motion.  The Minister has brought forward this motion to sit until twelve o'clock, following a good many warnings from different sides of the Dáil that the attempt to exhaust members who look after their business here is not conducive to proper legislative effort and is not satisfactory from any point of view.  Some of us have been sitting on Bills since eleven o'clock this morning, and now it is expected that we shall continue to attend to the business of the Dáil until twelve o'clock to-night.  We have conceded the desires of the Ministry for some time regarding sitting until ten o'clock or 10.30 p.m.  Now we are asked to go a little further and continue until twelve o'clock, which means for many of us either considerable expense to reach home or a considerable journey on foot.  The position of the business is entirely the fault of the Ministry.  It should not be laid to the charge of the <Col N="215" /> Dáil, and members of the Dáil should not be made to pay for the bad organisation, the lack of foresight and the unbusinesslike methods of the Ministry regarding the business of the House. We have said, since the list of thirty or forty Bills was placed before us, that it was asking too much that proper consideration be given to these Bills, in addition to consideration of the Estimates.  The Bills have not had proper consideration.  Several Bills have been passed which have not been examined; certainly they have not been discussed thoroughly.  But inasmuch as they were more or less formal they have been allowed to pass, shall I say, on the faith the Dáil had in the Ministry's ability to bring forward Bills of a satisfactory kind regarding what might be said to be non-controversial questions.  But we have before us quite a number of Bills of very considerable importance, requiring a great deal of examination.  I say it is impossible for the Deputies to do the business, which we were sent here to do, effectively and efficiently if we are asked to do the work in a manner which the President now desires.  If it is his wish that the Dáil should not take any notice of the Bills brought forward, I suggest he should tell us that.  If, on the other hand, when he produces a Bill to the Dáil he expects we shall examine it and give consideration to it and discuss it, then I say he is not giving the Dáil an opportunity to do that work efficiently and properly.  The Dáil has, I contend, been too generous to the Ministry in regard both to the Estimates and to the conduct of the business.  Now the Ministry is coming forward and going to try our strength and our patience in a way which I say is not fair to the Dáil, and it is practically telling the country that it has no consideration at all for the representatives of the people sitting here.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, that we have been sent to do the nation's work. <Col N="217" /> But we have been sent here to do the nation's work properly, and Deputies who have been sitting on committees since 10.30 this morning can hardly be expected to do good work up to midnight. A day of 13½ hours is too much for any man to keep his faculties at their best.  I would like to say to the President, while I do not object to sitting late if absolutely necessary&mdash;I do not think he has proved necessity in this case&mdash;that I do object to a motion of this kind being brought forward without any notice whatever.  If the President wishes me to sit late to-morrow I am prepared to do it, if he gives me notice now.  Then I shall be enabled to make arrangements for sleeping in the city, and will be able to take up some luggage.  But he gives me the option now of walking home eight miles or taking a taxi at a cost of 30s. I do not think that is a fair position in which to place Deputies.  If notice were given, we could make arrangements. In this case, notice has not been given, and I would suggest, with all respect to the President, that by meeting the wishes of the House and sitting until say 10.30, he will get more business through, with good will, than he would by forcing us to sit until midnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the members of the different parties in this House have shown their anxiety to try and do the work of the nation as well as they can.  I think Deputy Johnson's objection to this proposal does not arise at all from the strain that it puts upon him or upon other members&mdash;many of them equally strained by the work&mdash; but from the reflection that if he works that length of time he cannot give the same mental agility to the work at the end of day as at the beginning.  With a great deal of regret, I make a proposal which may have been made before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am willing to sit late and give as much attention to the work as possible, I still think that if we keep on having late sittings we shall not do the work as well as we would like.  My suggestion is that we should get the work better done if we were to decide, even with considerable regret, to postpone the consideration of the Estimates <Col N="218" /> until the Autumn, and go on with the legislation which the President thinks necessary.  Many of us would not like that.  We would like to have the Estimates taken at once, but when they do come up we want to give as much consideration to them as we possibly can.  I would suggest to the President that he should consider the matter, although I believe that he is really trying to please those who want the Estimates brought on at once.  I think he would get better results if he decided to postpone the Estimates until the autumn and let us get on with the necessary legislation and get the Recess, which every Deputy really wants.</P>

It is quite a different matter for Deputies sitting on the Government benches. Deputy O'Connor can sit quietly there without either mental or physical effort.  The Government and the Government's staff supply the effort.  All they ask of Deputies is to sit quiet and say &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that a Deputy is insulted when he thinks he is insulted.  That is one definition of insult.  You are insulted <Col N="219" /> when you think you are insulted. If Deputy Davin thinks he is insulted by Deputy O'Connor, he is insulted.  If Deputy Hughes thinks he is insulted by Deputy Gorey, he is insulted.  That is the fact.  It would be much better if, as I told Deputy O'Connor, we did not indulge in any reflections upon what other people in the Dáil think, or do, or what they are called upon to do.  We are called upon to do the business, and if Deputy Gorey would confine himself to that, rather than to explaining, in what Deputy Hughes thinks is not sufficiently subtle English, what the Government Party has to do, it would be much better.</P>

      <P>That the Government has a big machine behind them in the whole Civil Service.  We have not a Civil Service behind us.  If we want to do justice to the people we represent, we must give proper examination to the Bills and other matters that come before us.  We have not well-built machines to deal with them.  We must deal with them ourselves.  Anybody who does his work properly under the present conditions knows that the strain is too much, and we are not able to give anything like proper consideration to the Bills and other matters brought forward.  Last Thursday night we sat here until after 12 o'clock to deal with a very important matter. Now it is suggested that we should sit again until 12 o'clock to-night.  To continue that would be absolutely impossible. There is a limit to human endurance. We would not be able to do it. As Deputy Cooper has said, if we sit until 12 o'clock to-night, when we go out we find ourselves without trams or trains.  It will be necessary for us, if this goes on, either to come and live in Dublin altogether or to have some means of conveyance provided.  Although the President has a majority which can force us to do it, I appeal to him not to press this motion, and to have some consideration for Deputies who try to do their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the President to bear in mind that those of us who have tried to do our work conscientiously, and have sat throughout all the debates since we were sent here, except when prevented by illness, are entitled to some consideration.  Ministers and others on the Government Benches have at their disposal a huge machine.  They have officials who are paid for keeping constituents from seeing them.  We have to go out after our work to see people who come up here to see us.  Another matter that the President should realise is, that the ordinary Deputy, if he wants to do his work conscientiously towards the people who elected him, has to deal with his correspondence.  Those of us who sit on these Benches have not paid permanent officials and typists to answer communications for us.  We have to go to Government Buildings, Portobello Barracks, and other places, in order to interview officials so as to be able to answer our communications. Some allowance must be made for work of that kind, which does not fall to the Ministers.  I may have got up and called upon a Deputy to withdraw, but I bow to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle in that matter.  It is, however, very hard on a Deputy who has endeavoured to do his work conscientiously to have people lecturing him who do not, perhaps, put in the same amount of work.  I guarantee to Deputy O'Connor that I do as good work as he does, and that I have been in the Dáil oftener than he has.  I come in here at three o'clock every day.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister in charge of the Licensing Bill that he should postpone consideration of it until the autumn.  It is not a very important measure.  The people have carried on with the present licensing legislation for a number of years, and they could go on for another month or two with the existing legislation, or even for another twelve <Col N="221" /> months.  I would suggest that the Minister should lighten the burden of legislation by throwing that Bill overboard or postponing it until after the Recess.

      <P>I was going to make a suggestion which might get over the difficulty.  We have been in the habit of adjourning for three-quarters of an hour for tea.  Last night the adjournment extended to one-and-a-half hours because there was no quorum.  I suggest that instead of sitting until twelve o'clock we should sit until 10.30 without any adjournment, and let the Whips of the different Parties make arrangements so that Deputies can get their tea, while leaving a sufficient number present to form a quorum to carry on the business.  I think that would get over the difficulty and satisfy everybody.  Of course, I know that some Deputies like to get away and get their tea comfortably, but I suggest that this would get over the difficulty and prevent any loss of time.</P>

      <P>I think the President must realise that there is a pretty general feeling on all sides of the Dáil against his motion that we sit late to-night.  There is very little use in apportioning blame for what has occurred, although we might say that the real difficulty has arisen from the Government's anxiety to rush all their legislation into the first and second year of their life.  It would look that way, in any case.  I think it is not good for legislation, it is not good for the country, that Bills should pass through the Dáil without full consideration, or with very little <Col N="222" /> consideration.  It is not good for the Government themselves, although they are acting as if they appeared to wish that that should happen.  I think it is not good that that should happen.  I think the suggestion which has been made by Deputy Johnson, and which has been echoed by other Deputies is a very reasonable one in the circumstances. Surely, a person who is working the whole day up to 10.30 is not physically able to do useful work after that time, and I think that the President would be well advised if he took account of the views which have been just expressed, that we should sit until 10.30 p.m., and continue as we have been doing for some time past.</P>

I, for one, must say that I have sympathy with Deputy Johnson, for whoever may have taken charge of measures on the Government side of the Dáil, Deputy Johnson and some other Deputies have sat and discussed every measure that came up, no matter from what Government Department. The Government Benches may change, or swop horses, if you like to put it that way, but Deputies on the other side of the Dáil have to sit and examine every measure that comes from the Government side.  Deputy Johnson and other Deputies sat on a Committee which sat at 11 o'clock this morning, they will have to sit again at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning, and if they are to be expected to sit till 12 o'clock at night the work cannot be done as it ought to be.  It would be better to leave work undone than to have it badly done.  That would be the result of the effort that the President expects us to make, and I think the President would be very unwise to press it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that no Party in the Dáil may be found silent on this mater, I want to support the appeal which has been urged on the President not to press this motion.  We have been almost, so to speak, in a snowstorm of Bills; they have been falling like snowflakes on this assembly. Most of these, I should say 50 per cent., so far as the nation's work is concerned, amount to so much as painting <Col N="223" /> the pillar boxes green.  That kind of legislation can wait.  There are certain things that are essential and that should be got through before the end of the session.  I think there is ample time to get them through, but that other things that may be of some importance but are not of immediate urgency should be left over to the next session, or even later.  This Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which, I presume, we are to discuss to-day, will probably occupy us beyond twelve o'clock, if it is proceeded with, and we sit until that hour.  I say that it is a sheer waste of time, an absolute waste of time, and the infliction upon the country of a discussion of something which could very well wait until some future date when there is no such congestion of Bills before the assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin drew attention to one very important fact, that in addition to attending to the deliberations at this assembly, Deputies have to attend to the interests of their constituents, to acknowledge correspondence received and to interview Government Departments regarding these interests or questions which have been raised.  Deputies who meet at 11 o'clock in the morning sit on that Committee until 2 o'clock, sit in the Dáil from 3 until 12, and meet again the following morning at 11 at a Committee meeting have no physical opportunity of attending to their duties as representatives of their constituents. I say if this is not to degenerate into a machine merely to register the measures drafted by the Government's draftsman, there must be time, not merely for ample consideration, but there must also be time for Deputies to have an opportunity of hearing the views of their constituents upon measures which are before the Dáil and which affect their interests.  There cannot be that opportunity for mature discussion and consideration or consultation with those whose interests are affected by these measures if we are to sit rushing legislation through, tired and unable to devote the amount of attention that is essential to the serious consideration of the Bills that come before the Dáil.  I certainly think that <Col N="224" /> it is very evident that while the Dáil does not wish to embarrass or hold up essential legislation, it is clearly indicated as the serious opinion, the unbiassed opinion, of the majority of the Deputies here, that we should not have these late sittings, which are prejudicial to the serious consideration of Bills, and also make it almost impossible for Deputies to attend to the ordinary routine of their duties as representatives of their constituents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-head A, which deals with compensation in respect to injuries sustained during the pre-Truce period, I wish to know what is the procedure for dealing with these cases.  In some cases the relatives of the parties concerned appealed to the courts and awards were made.  In some cases they were not paid.  In other cases no appeal was made to the courts in the matter, and were afterwards, I take it, referred to the Personal Injuries Committee.  I think there is a good deal of confusion with regard to these pre-Truce cases both as to the procedure that should be adopted and that which is being adopted.  In this connection, and in view of what Deputy Byrne has stated, to the effect that he was going to draw attention to cases where the Personal Injuries Committee awarded £10 where life was lost, I wish to mention a very sad case which came under my notice. I bring it forward as a typical case in which a young man was killed by the Black and Tans.  I think most Deputies will remember the incident.  It was in connection with the deaths of Lord Mayor O'Callaghan and Mr. Clancy in Limerick.  On the same night upon which that incident occurred a young man named O'Donoghue was killed. He was a working man, a butcher's assistant, I think.  The Personal Injuries Committee refused to give any grant by way of compensation.  His mother applied for compensation to this Committee, but no grant has been given.  I think, in view of all the circumstances of the case, it was one in which compensation should have been given to the relatives of the deceased man.  The point has, I understand, been made that no dependency was proved, <Col N="228" /> but I think that that was not sufficient reason to refuse compensation in a case of this kind.  It is the most glaring of the cases brought to my notice in regard to pre-Truce claims which come under sub-head A.</P>

      <P>With regard to sub-head A, it is the usual practice when Bills are brought before the House that the Minister in charge of the Bill in question should bring it before the House and explain its salient features.  I think that that would be a good thing in regard to estimates of this kind, instead of letting them be introduced and allowing Deputies gather the general purpose of them.  Here is a case in sub-head A where there is an increase of £385,000.  We can formulate a guess, which may be accurate or not, as to the cause of the increase, but I think that this is a case in which a prefatory statement might save a lot of questions afterwards.  I would like to put a question as to what the causes are for this increase that appears in sub-head A.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the President replies, I would like a point cleared up in connection with the payment of these claims generally.  I understood, from a discussion that occurred during the last few days, that some of the payments were to be made by way of bonds and not entirely in cash.  Do I understand in connection with this particular estimate that the payments for injuries are to be entirely in cash and that provision is made accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand, any compensation award pre-Truce which has not since been re-heard or re-investigated, must be paid in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were no such things as reports or recommendations for pre-Truce compensations.  It is only during the period from the 11th July, 1921, until the 12th May, 1923, which was subsequent <Col N="229" /> to the Truce, that these reports came into existence.  From what I can gather the claims which were made before 11th July, 1921, the awards in which were made and which have not been re-opened or re-heard, must be paid, when they are paid, in cash.  But as regards the cases which have been made re-opened, I, in company with the last speaker, would like to know whether those awards are to be paid in cash, because these cases were tried under the then existing Criminal Injury Code. Of course they were not defended, and it is because they were not defended in those days that power has been given under the Damage to Property Act to have the whole cases re-opened and retried. But I do think that it would be well if we could understand in those cases that have been re-opened, and where awards have been made, whether those awards are to be paid in cash or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a question regarding the position of the tribunal in respect of damage done by British troops or police, which is alleged to have been without authority. I understand some question has been raised in connection with this tribunal regarding the purpose of the tribunal, the terms of reference, the intentions of the tribunal, and that a case had been made by one party represented in the tribunal that this did not affect damage done by British troops who were acting under authority, but only damage done when inflicted by troops or police without authority.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he can throw any light on the position in regard to this intention, where the contention has been upheld and is being acted upon, or whether it was a contrary intention, which I think was the general expectation on this side of the water, that all damage done by Crown forces, as they were called, whether under orders or not, was to be charged against the British authorities.</P>

      <P>In cases of decisions being arrived at, I should like the Minister to tell us, where those who made application are dissatisfied with the decisions, if there is an appeal from those decisions, and if so, to what tribunal.  I have in mind at least a <Col N="230" /> score of cases where the people are dissatisfied, and I think rightly dissatisfied, with the decisions that have been arrived at.  But there is some confusion, and a good deal of lack of knowledge as to what to do in these cases. Like Deputy O'Connell, I have one particular case in my mind where liability, if not denied, is at least questioned. For the guidance of the Minister I will give it to him as more or less typical. It is a case where a man resigned from the R.I.C. and went with an active service unit of the I.R.A.  The man was killed in action.  When in the R.I.C. the man was the sole support of his wife and two children.  The widow and her two children are trying to exist ever since, while the Government are questioning their liability in the case. These are cases in which we should like some definite ruling from the Minister, cases in which claimants are dissatisfied and have a genuine case for dissatisfaction.</P>

      <P>I think it would be better to reply to some extent.  I <Col N="231" /> think it is fairly well explained in the sub-heads what it is actually that we are dealing with.  In sub-head A, and on the following page, there is a note describing exactly the large increase. Increase is not a good word there, neither is it a good word as used by Deputy Figgis.  The fact is, we have not been able to deal with those cases earlier, and in consequence they appear in that particular form.  But it is not an item that will go up and up year after year.  We must deal with them at some time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The note ought to have explained the point that Deputy Figgis and Deputy Johnson were raising with me.  Payments under that sub-head are made in accordance with terms of agreement that were made between the Provisional Government and the British Government in respect of Personal Injury Claims, arising out of the Anglo-Irish conflict.  It was agreed that the awards that were obtained were such that they would stand.  The British Government discharged their obligations in respect of their supporters in connection with those awards.  In our case persons on our side had to be dealt with.  In the vast majority of cases they had not got those awards.  The claims in respect of supporters of the British side under the Acts which were then in force were claims for damages, and you will want to mark the difference between damages and compensation.  We have at no time undertaken to pay damages. We have undertaken to pay compensation, and in that connection there must necessarily be a very considerable difference between compensation which is paid by us and the damages that are paid by the British Government.  We cannot have it both ways.  We contested the legality and the morality of those Personal Injuries Acts when they were put into operation here, and we cannot now claim that, having contested them for some years, all the provisions of these particular instruments should be enforced. To that extent there is, and <Col N="232" /> must be, a remarkable difference between sums awarded in court, under these particular Acts, and sums awarded by the Personal Injuries Committee, under the terms of reference which were read out here, and which were within the knowledge of every member of the Dáil at the time that I announced that Committee was about to be set up, and that they would deal with those cases according to terms of reference which were published at the time.</P>
      <P>Now, apart from dealing with what are called supporters of either side, there is another class of person who was not actively engaged on either side, and in respect of that type of person it has been agreed that the charge for compensation would run in the nature of fifty-fifty.  In consequence, it will be observed that there is at the bottom of page 51 the following:&mdash;&ldquo;The receipts in connection with this service are estimated as follows: Extra receipts payable to the Exchequer (Repayment by British Government)&mdash;£130,000.&rdquo; These payments that are being made&mdash; it was mentioned last year, and I think there was nobody under any misapprehension about it&mdash;are purely ex-gratia payments.</P>
      <P>One particular clause in the Terms of Reference was to the effect: &ldquo;That the Committee would recommend to the Minister for Finance what sums should in reason and fairness be paid in the several cases above mentioned, regard being had to the actual earning capacity of the injured person prior to the injury, and the impairment of earning capacity attributable to the injury, and the actual extent of dependency on the deceased person prior to death or injury of that person, and to any effective provision made by the deceased person for his dependents by way of insurance or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In that particular case it is to be seen at once that we limited whatever compensation would be paid in the nature of an ex-gratia payment by all these circumstances, the impairment of earning capacity and the actual dependency, having taken into account any sums of which the deceased was in possession either by insurance or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I will refer briefly to the case of a friend of mine who was shot by Black and Tans in Thurles during the struggle.  He was newly married, and he was the only one in a position to earn anything.  As a result of his death the shop in which he carried on business was closed.  Five months after the man was shot a child was born.  As a result of appeals made to her by the local Commandant of the I.R.A. and by the Thurles Urban Council, the widow refused to bring a case into court.  It was only recently a decision was arrived at by the Personal Injuries Commission by which a certain amount of compensation was granted. <Col N="234" /> I hope that decision is not final. I contend that if all the considerations referred to by the President were taken into consideration by the Committee the compensation granted in this case should be much more than what was given.  This particular case I have in mind was mentioned to the President and at least three other Deputies, some of whom are acquainted with the facts.</P>

      <P>In a case of this kind, where there is apparent dissatisfaction on the part of the dependents, the wife and child, what is the form through which the aggrieved person must go in order to bring a case before a higher tribunal?  Is it the Minister for Finance who will look into it?  What is the method of appeal?  I think there is good ground for a complaint here. In addition to the small amount of compensation granted there was £1 a week given to the woman from the date of the birth of the child until the date the Personal Injuries Commission made its award.  The Personal Injuries Commission, or the Minister for Finance, has given instructions that the amount granted by the Irish White Cross Society must be deducted out of the award made.  For my own information, and that of the person involved, I want to know to what place an appeal can be made, as there appears to be a great grievance in this instance.  If that case were taken into court against the wishes of the local Commandant of the I.R.A., and the Urban Council, thousands instead of hundreds would be granted.</P>

      <P>No.  I explained in connection with those cases that responsibility for payment to supporters of each side was accepted by the side in question.  In other words, in the case of a British soldier who lost his life during the period of the conflict, his dependents would be compensated by the British Government.  One of our supporters who was injured would be compensated by us, or in the case of his death his dependants would be compensated by us.  In this case the committee which hears those cases is the final and only court.  If there are grounds for believing that certain facts were not taken into consideration, or that the decision was unfair, a representation to the Minister for Finance, with particulars of the case, would receive and has already received very sympathetic consideration from him; but only to that extent, and there is no appeal from him.  In some cases there have been such appeals, and I have heard him here in the Dáil state he would consider any representations put before him in connection with cases where persons think they did not get fair treatment by the committee.</P>

      <P>I desire to make reference to the case of an ex-British soldier who resided in North Great George's Street, and who was in receipt of a pension of £1 per week from the British Government.  He was living with his mother, and during the attack <Col N="236" /> on the Fowler Hall this man was shot dead in his own room.  His mother made a claim, and in that case the Personal Injuries Committee decided that as his pension was only sufficient to keep himself his mother had proved no dependency upon him.  They wrote her a letter&mdash;a very heartless letter, in my opinion&mdash;that in this case no award could be paid.  No award was paid in that case.  They never took into consideration that this man a few days before had an offer of employment. He was only three months home from the Army, in receipt of this pension. He was on Guinness's unemployment roll and was about to be sent for.  As reasonable wages are paid, as we all know, in Guinness's, the mother had happy prospects of being maintained by her son.  But the Personal Injuries Committee turned down her application and said that no dependency had been proved in that case.  I hold that evidence of that should have weighed with the Commission and that something should have been allowed that unfortunate woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case I wish to deal with is from Buckingham Place.  I have a letter from the mother of the victim in my attache case, which is full of similar letters, and if I could get the Ministry to deal with them I would be very grateful.  I just wish to mention the dissatisfaction that exists amongst parents and dependents of those who were seriously injured or lost their lives, through no fault of their own. This is a case in which the Personal Injuries Commission wrote to Mrs. McKeever, 10 Buckingham Place, Dublin, awarding her an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £10 in respect of the death of her son, Arthur McKeever, on the 28th June, 1920.  That woman paid £17 to bury her son.  In this case he was a soldier who had just returned a few months previously from the British Army and whose name was on Guinness's list for employment and who had prospects, also, of getting in.  In that case, as a result of the loss of what was hoped to be the breadwinner of the family, a woman was put to the expense of £7 for the burial of her son, following the burning of the Four Courts.  There is another case in which the rifle of a sentry at the City Hall went off about <Col N="237" /> 12 or 18 months ago.  A brass finisher was fixing a brass plate on a door in the street.  He was a married man with a large family.  That man was shot and disabled, as a result of the carelessness of this sentry.  The man is unfit to follow his occupation, and his claim has not been dealt with yet. Judging by what I see of the way they are treating similar cases, that man's prospects are very poor.  As a result of his losing his employment, through the carelessness of this soldier, one of his children&mdash;a little girl of 14½&mdash;was compelled to go out and work in a factory. This unfortunate man's daughter was burned to death in this factory. The report of the inquest was published in the newspapers about six or eight months ago.  I just mention that to show what the result of these accidental shootings sometimes is.  If it had not been that this man was shot, this little girl of 14½ would not have been compelled to go to work in this factory.  As it was, this man lost his employment and he lost his little girl.  There is another case in which, in the year 1922 or 1923, Free State troops occupied the Central Hotel.  Amongst them there were a couple of officers&mdash;majors or captains &mdash;and through some accident or some jollification that went on, the porter of the hotel was shot through the jaw. His tongue was split, his jaw bone smashed, and he was disabled and is now incapable of working.  His sister made a claim and, as far as I can gather, there has been no compensation paid in that case whatsoever.  She got a letter stating that the Government were not responsible for the actions of the officers in the hotel.  There were, I think, four cases in which the highest award was £10, and in three cases not even funeral expenses were paid to the people.  I have some particulars of cases in which a Government Department wrote and said they were not responsible and that no funds were provided for payment of those cases.  They said they were not responsible for the acts of their servants or that the military car in which some officer was driving was being used at the time for unofficial purposes.  Somebody who was joy riding killed, or seriously injured, some pedestrian, and the Government <Col N="238" /> denied liability in such a case.  I think there ought to be a Court of Appeal and that those who composed the Personal Injuries Committee ought to have had more consideration for the dependents of those concerned and less consideration for the Government.  It would appear by the decisions and awards I have seen, that the Personal Injuries Committee did their utmost to whittle down the claims of the people and did not show them fair play or give them any justice whatsoever.  I would ask the President to consider those cases and not leave these people discontented and dissatisfied citizens, because these awards have not been made.</P>

      <P>That being so, I presume I can follow.  I desire to raise this question of the Personal Injuries Committee, which comes under sub-head D.  This Committee was set up as a substitute for the law which existed, as enacted by the Criminal Injury Acts of 1919 and 1920.  These Acts were repealed by the Damage to Property Act, 1923, whereby there is now no legal claim whatsoever for personal injuries in this country.  But, at the same time, this Personal Injuries Committee was set up, and, I venture to say, that when this Committee was set up, which, admittedly, was not to deal with legal rights, because those had been abolished, but only with <i>ex gratia</i> claims, that still it was in the minds of the members of the Dáil at the time that this Committee would, by their investigations and subsequent decisions show that they had some regard, at any rate, for, if not the legal, certainly the equitable rights of people, especially non-combatants in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much, for personal as well as for other reasons, that the Minister for Finance is not in his place to-day. I hope we will see him here soon again.  This is a question with which he is intimately concerned.  On more than one occasion I have put down questions to the Minister, as have other <Col N="239" /> Deputies, complaining of the awards of this Personal Injuries Committee, and, after a considerable amount of pressure from various quarters of the Dáil, the Minister stated that if special individual cases were brought to his notice he would do everything to have them reconsidered and, if possible, give satisfaction.  Since that statement of the Minister I have put down no less than half a dozen questions in regard to what I consider to be exceedingly glaring cases, and the reply I got in almost every case was the inevitable Ministerial answer, that he saw no reason to depart from the award of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Take one case.  I asked whether it was not a fact that a young woman was accidentally shot in the streets of Enniscorthy.  It was upon the occasion when two National Army officers were coming out of the Cathedral, having heard Mass there.  Shots were fired, and one of them hit this young woman in the thigh.  Her thigh had to be amputated.  She had to go to hospital. She had to pay for the amputation. She had to pay the hospital.  She had to have no less than four operations.</P>
    <P>She was led to believe by the setting up of this Committee that there would be some chance of getting something in the nature of fair compensation. I say she was led to believe, because it was on the strength of this committee being set up that she went to her solicitor and employed counsel.  She employed medical and other witnesses and had to get a train of motors to proceed from Enniscorthy to Waterford, where the case was heard.  When the result was made known, she was told that the committee had thought fit to award her the sum of £300.  I say that this sum is nothing like adequate compensation to a young woman for the complete and total loss of her leg.  Apart altogether from that, it has actually cost her more than £300 in medical treatment and legal proceedings. I further say that she never would have gone to the expense of undertaking these proceedings if she had not been led to believe&mdash;as we all were&mdash;by the setting up of this committee&mdash;that something in the nature <Col N="240" /> of adequate compensation would be given.  I think the treatment in that particular case is scandalous to a degree. I brought that case again upon paper to the Minister for Finance, and I was told that he saw no reason to depart from the conclusions arrived at by the committee.  I followed it up by asking him whether he thought £300 was adequate compensation to a young woman for the loss of her leg, but he did not reply.</P>
    <P>However, I put another case to him, that of a young girl of eighteen years, who was shot dead while walking in the streets of Limerick, her parents being resident in the County Waterford. The result of the claim for compensation was that her father and mother were informed that because they were not dependent upon this young woman they were not to get one penny piece by way of compensation for the loss of that young life.  When I put a question as to that case to the Minister I got a similar reply.</P>
    <P>I could go on giving instances of these cases, but I do not intend to do so, because we have heard enough already.  Everyone in the country knows the method adopted by this committee so that the dissatisfaction that exists throughout the country is not at all to be wondered at.  There is grave dissatisfaction.  In the first place, people understood, and naturally so, that when the legal rights to compensation for personal injuries were abolished, as they were by the Act of 1923, and when the substitute was set up, they thought that it was to be a substitute of some sort or another and not a sham one.  Everyone knows now that that is not the case.  I do not believe that I am overstating the case when I say that if that was not in the minds of Deputies when the Act was passed last year if they did not think then that this committee was to be a genuine one, the Damage to Property Act would not have passed in its present form.</P>
    <P>There are other complaints, and just ones, in regard to this Committee.  Sittings were held in various districts in the country.  I do not know why more sittings are not held.  It may be said that the number of Commissioners is <Col N="241" /> limited.  I do not see why, for the sake of expedition, more Commissioners could not be sent out to other districts in the country to hear these cases.  The cases must be limited, and they will all have to be gone into at some time.  I suggest that the proper way to do it would be to send out more Commissioners to more districts, and not, as is at present done, to send out a certain number of Commissioners only to certain limited centres in the country.  Take, for instance, the Committee that sat in Waterford.  People had to go from the north of the County Wexford down to the City of Waterford to have their claims heard.  Is that right?  Why could not a Commissioner sit in some portion of the County Carlow, Wexford or Kilkenny?  Instead of that, people had to go long distances at considerable expense, at great inconvenience, and then we know what the result is. I do not know from this Estimate how much of these claims have been gone into.  I would like to know.  I would like to know how much the £150,000 last year represented&mdash;what proportion of the claims.  I would like to know how much that so-called increase of £122,000, which I quite agree is not an increase at all, in the proper sense of the term, represents of the amount of claims which have yet to be gone into. I would like to know, further, how many claims remain outstanding, and to suggest again that it would be a far better method to adopt to have more Commissioners at more places more frequently trying these cases than to be doing them in the dilatory manner in which they are being done at present. I do not know upon what principle these claims are being awarded.  We know that they have no legal basis, but what other basis have they?  There must be some basis.  Is it the circumstances of each case?  I doubt that very much because of the cases and such like which I have mentioned, and others which you have heard this afternoon.</P>

      <P>It is a very common commentary in the country that according to the law to-day that <Col N="242" /> if a person was attacked and if his hat was smashed that person was entitled to compensation for his hat; but if the same person was attacked and his head was smashed that he would not be entitled legally to a penny-piece compensation, or his dependants, because probably he would be gone.  That, it may be said, is the state of the law in England. It is, but then we have an Act last year, the Damage to Property Act, where we went a step further than the English law, and we say that if a man's hat is taken away by Irregulars he is entitled to come in and to get, at any rate a report, or a recommendation, that the Minister for Finance shall pay him the value of his hat, but that if his head is broken open he is not entitled by law to get anything.  But we have set up, as the Government said last year, this Personal Injuries Committee to deal with personal injuries.  Well, the Personal Injuries Committee has been set up; it has dealt with personal injuries, and we know the manner and the method of its dealing with them.  I say that this is all most unsatisfactory; that it would have been far better for the Government to have said candidly that they would do away with the claims for personal injuries; as they did by the Act of 1923&mdash;&ldquo;We will have no more claims of any sort or kind, legally or <i>ex-gratia</i>, for personal injuries.&rdquo; But they did not do that; they said: &ldquo;We will repeal the Acts of 1919 and 1920; we will do away with all legal claims for personal injuries,&rdquo; but&mdash;and I think it must have been in their minds when they added this &ldquo;but&rdquo; that if they had not made some such provision as this Personal Injuries Committee they probably would not have been allowed actually to do away with the legal rights.  I think it would have been better if the Government had been candid in this matter, and had done away completely with all claims, legal or <i>ex-gratia</i>, for personal injuries rather than to have done away with the legal ones and then to have set up this sham committee.  Anyone from the country will tell you that it is nothing else.  It has been masquerading through the country as a body which is supposed to have been genuinely investigating cases.  From the results <Col N="243" /> which I have seen, it cannot have genuinely investigated them or, if it did, it came to conclusions which the evidence before it did not warrant.</P>
      <P>I have seen a good deal of the results of this Personal Injuries Committee's findings, and I say without exaggeration that though there may have been grievances, as there are always, and always will be, in regard to various Government Departments in regard to various findings of various courts of law, those grievances are nothing compared with the acute feelings aroused through the country by the methods and by the findings of this Personal Injuries Committee. I hope that Deputies will give expression to-day to their feelings and let the Government know, if they do not know already, what has been said and thought through the country in regard to this Committee, and tell them that it would be advisable in the interests of the Government, and more especially in the interests of morality, that this Personal Injuries Committee should be conducted on proper, on moral, and on equitable lines in the same way in which people have been induced to go before it to make their claims.  I think that it is most unfair to hold out to people a prospect of a just consideration of their case and put them to expense, inconvenience and trouble which in so many instances has resulted in nothing.  Therefore, sir, I have ventured to give my opinion and my views in regard to the workings of this Committee, and I hope that other Deputies will do likewise, and that the result of it may be that the Committee may work in the future on somewhat different lines from what it has done in the past.</P>

      <P>I do not want to make any implications of unfairness or of partiality on the part of the Committee with which we are dealing under sub-head D.  I have no doubt that, like all other men, they are striving to do their best according to their lights. But I do want to impress on the President that their Terms of Reference appear to have been drawn up most unfortunately, and that the procedure is such as to convince applicants who <Col N="244" /> do not get what they wanted that they have been unfairly dealt with.  As to the Terms of Reference, they are altogether too narrow.  I will only quote one case.  A man was bicycling home from his work, and when he got to the corner of Parnell Street he met a motor car without a number, driving at far more than the legal speed in the opposite direction.  This motor car was believed to contain Irregulars who were wanted by the police.  In their speed they knocked him off his bicycle.  He was severely injured and had to have his arm amputated.  He made application to the Commission through a solicitor. I believe it is necessary that applications be made through a solicitor, and in this case the man, of course, was put to expense because of that. The reply he received from the Commission was that his case was outside their terms of reference.  Were it not for the generosity of his employer, who kept him on, even though he has only one arm, he would be reduced to a condition of pauperism.  I do not think the President will contest the proposition that, ethically, the man has a right to a remedy against somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He cannot bring an action against the people who knocked him down, because he has no means of tracing their identity.  The motor car had no number that would enable him to trace it, and, as he had no opportunity of tracing the people who knocked him down, for the purpose of seeking compensation from them, I think he has a claim against the State.  I venture to think he has a claim against the State for two reasons.  The first is, that the police are supposed to restrain the speed of motor cars in the city; and the second is that they are supposed to see that motor cars have identification marks on them when they are being driven.  In passing, I might say that it is a great inconvenience to the public that army motors do not show a number in front.  In this case I submit that, on two grounds, this man has a claim against the Government.  These two grounds are: (1) that the State was not fulfilling its duty; and (2) that it was not enforcing the law.  I submit, further, that the man's claim should not have been shut out by the Committee, who simply decided that it <Col N="245" /> was outside their terms of reference. I now turn to the methods of the Committee.  As a rule, certainly in all the cases that I have seen, the Committee simply announce their decision, but they do not give any reason as to why the decision was arrived at.  The applicants are left to find out that for themselves, which, in practice, means that they come along to Deputy Byrne, or to some other Deputy, to get questions put here in the Dáil about their cases.  I put a question to the Minister for Finance some days ago, and he said he thought that the applicants generally knew very well the reasons for the decisions given in their particular cases.  I do not think they do, and Deputies have no means of discovering what is at the back of the minds of the members of the Commission in arriving at a particular decision.  The second point is that the President has just now told us that applicants who are dissatisfied with decisions in their cases have the right of appeal.  I do not think that applicants are told that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If there has been any misapprehension of what I said, I would like to correct it.  I said, where there is a case in which there would be very great dissatisfaction, and possibly some grounds for that dissatisfaction, that the Minister for Finance would consider an appeal from such a person, but to say that he is a Court of Appeal, that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The President knows that in every case where the application is refused, there is dissatisfaction. I should say that there are very few genuinely bogus cases put up. There is no applicant, I think, who would put up an absolutely unfounded case.  In every case the applicant says that there are good grounds for making him a grant.  I do not know who is to be the judge as to whether a case is genuine or not.  Is it the Deputy to whose notice the case is brought?  If that is so, it will mean that an enormous burden of work will be thrown on the shoulders of Deputies, if they have to investigate these cases and decide whether they are genuine or not. I would urge that this commission should work with more publicity, and <Col N="246" /> that they should give reasons for their decisions.  I think, too, that they should be given power, where cases of genuine hardship arise&mdash;even though these cases are outside the terms of reference&mdash;to recommend <i>ex gratia</i> grants.  I may say that I am wiser now than I was some months ago, and I know with what joy a commission discovers that a statement is outside their terms of reference and that they need not go into it.  If the responsibility were imposed upon the commission of investigating cases that were outside their terms of reference, with a view to seeing whether or not they were cases of great hardship, I believe that more justice would be done.</P>
      <P>I turn from that to sub-head (F). The amount involved is very small.  It is a sum of £250 for incidental expenses. But, if the President will turn to Vote 9, on page 28, he will find on another Vote for this commission a sum of £350 for travelling and incidental expenses.  I very much dislike the practice of bringing in incidental expenses for one purpose on two different Votes.  That is calculated, in the case of Deputies who do not read the estimates carefully, to give them a false impression.  No doubt, they are for a different purpose&mdash;one for travelling, and possibly the incidental expenses are those incidental to travelling, such as tipping the porter.  I think they should be both shown on the same Vote. even if separate amounts are not shown.  It is a bad practice, and I shall always call attention to it whenever I get the chance.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to the position of railway men who received injuries and have been refused compensation by this commission.  A couple of cases, typical, I think, of a larger number, have been brought to my notice.  It will be generally recognised that, under a great deal of provocation and pressure, the railway men stood up to their duty and ran trains, notwithstanding opposition and threats during the period prior to the Truce.  In some cases they were attacked and beaten, and suffered by one means or another, and applied for compensation.  The position the commission seems to have <Col N="247" /> taken up is that the responsibility lay with the railway company, the men's employers, and that the only claim that they were entitled to make was a claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Now, the compensation that is allowed here by the law under that Act is considerably lower than what is allowed in Great Britain, and no account is being taken of the reduced value of money as compared with the time when the Compensation Acts were passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, the fact that a person received his injuries in the employment of a railway company is thrown back upon the applicant as a sufficient answer to his claim for compensation. He is told that his claim is against his employer&mdash;the railway company&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that the risk he ran was abnormal to his occupation.  It was a risk that he ran, as a matter of fact, in defence of the State, and the compensation that is allowed by the company in virtue of the Compensation Acts does not suffice to keep the applicant in anything like a decent condition, taking into account his previous earnings.  The Commission appears to have turned down many applications on the ground that the claim lay against the company, and that the company should pay.  I do not know how many cases of the kind have been so dealt with.  I know that a couple have been brought to my notice.  There was one some time ago which may or may not have been reconsidered, and I cannot speak of the recent facts.  There was another case of a watchman in Waterford who was attacked and beaten badly and utterly broken up.  He was a comparatively young man, with a considerable family, and he had taken service as a watchman on the railway.  Goods were taken out of the company's stores, and the man was very severely beaten and damaged.  He happened to be an ex-R.I.C. man who resigned during the conscription agitation, and he has, I understand, been awarded a pension on that score, but the combined pension and workmen's compensation allowance do not at all meet the requirements of the case.  The Commission says that <Col N="248" /> the man is not entitled to any compensation from them because of the fact that the compensation should be paid by the company.  It must be borne in mind that the compensation laws are revisable, and there may be claims at a later period for consolidation and commutation of the present allowances.  There is nothing at all permanent or certain in the present sum that is allowed under the old British Act which we are carrying through.  The principle involved is, perhaps, of more importance than the individual case I am quoting.  These men, under great stress and great risk, served the railway company undoubtedly, but served more the State's interest, and ran abnormal risks.  They suffered in consequence, and are being deprived of any compensation for injuries suffered in the State service, and because of their loyalty to the work which they undertook.  I think that that is a kind of case that should be borne in mind as being well worthy of further inquiry.  I do not know how many cases of that kind may have been involved, but I think, from the two cases which have been specially drawn to my notice, that the action of the Commission is not satisfactory, and should be reviewed and reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer further to the case that has been mentioned by Deputy Davin, because it is a case of a particular type which is rather disconcerting to Deputies who are called on to deal with it.  It is a case of an award to a widow with one child whose husband lost his life because his premises were made available for Volunteers in Tipperary town before the British left.  The amount awarded in compensation was £800. The woman was a young widow with, certainly, ten years prospects of life, and when you come to examine the amount you find that it was practically the amount of what a widow of a private in the National Army with one child might hope to receive over a period of ten years.  It is very hard, when the circumstances of a case like that are put up to you by way of complaint, with the object of taking it up with the Minister for Finance, to find that the Minister for Finance is more or <Col N="249" /> less obdurate in the matter, and that the amount paid to the widow is the amount which the widow of a private in the National Army would receive for ten years.  There is clear inadequacy there.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with a lot of the criticisms of the awards of the Personal Injuries Committee, but I think there are worse things even than those.  I know a number of cases which have not been brought before the Committee. There was the case of a man named Michael Riordan, 56 years of age, a shoemaker who was shot in Blarney in September, 1922, by the accidental discharge of a soldier's rifle.  On two or three occasions I visited Portobello Barracks to see if it was possible to have compensation paid, as his right hand had to be amputated.  I was referred to the Personal Injuries Committee and then to the Army Finance Officer, who, after I visited him three or four times, said that the State solicitor was considering the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About two months ago I put a question to the Minister for Defence to know if he gave any decision in the case, and I was informed that a decision would be given shortly and that payment, if any, would be given as soon as possible.  Since then nothing has happened.  This man has been unemployed for a year and ten months.  He has not a single relative in this country and he is trying to exist on the charity of his neighbours.  Owing to the loss of his right hand he is unable to follow his ordinary occupation or even to sell papers.  If he were in Dublin or Cork he might be able to earn his living by selling papers, but he could not do so in a place like Blarney.  That case has not been before the Personal Injuries Committee, but, if it had, a decision, at least, would have been given.  I may mention another case in which a friend of mine, named Maurice Condon, was arrested by the military in Dungarvan and placed in a cell in the barracks. About two hours later one of the military officers visited him, kicked him about the face, tied a pull-through round his head, tightened it, and inserted <Col N="250" /> between the pull-through and his head a bayonet, which he twisted two or three times hurting the man's head severely.  He was in the local infirmary for five or six weeks, and he applied to the Ministry of Defence to know if he was entitled to compensation, but the only answer he got was that disciplinary measures had been taken with the officer who was responsible.  He has got no satisfaction, and he was at the loss of his wages due to unemployment during the period in which he was in hospital, and he has had to pay the doctor's fees plus the trouble he was put to.  I would like to know whether this case comes within the terms of reference of the Personal Injuries Committee, and I would like also to know whether it is intended to give any compensation whatever, as in the case of Michael Riordan, of Blarney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">

      <P>I would like the President to give an explanation why no award has been made and no decision given to the dependents of people who were shot so far back as early in 1919.  Specific cases have been given by practically every Deputy who has spoken, and I could give a number of specific cases also, but I do not think that there is any necessity to do so.  I may, however, mention the case of a man who was shot by the Black and Tans in 1920, in Thurles.  His mother has received no intimation as to whether she is to get compensation or if any award is to be made to her for the loss of her son.  I would like to bear out what has been said by Deputy Davin and General Mulcahy in connection with the other case in Thurles with which I am familiar.</P>
      <P>I certainly think that the amount awarded in all the circumstances was a disgraceful amount.  It is certainly not at all what any reasonable person would consider fair.  There is no doubt, as has been stated by Deputy Mulcahy, that the reason why this man was brought out and murdered by the Black and Tans was because of the fact that his house had been made available for the soldiers of the State at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a kind of case that I do not think any reference has been made to by any Deputy up to <Col N="251" /> the present but which I have a little experience of, where compensation has been claimed for injuries received and where the claim has been turned down on the plea that the individual concerned was capable of bearing any loss sustained.  I know of a case where premises were commandeered without any notification whatever by the Free State Army.  On the night following, before the man or woman of the place could remove any of their belongings or get out of the place, it was attacked, with the result that the wife of the owner of the premises became seriously ill and had to be taken to hospital and treated there for several weeks. A claim was made before the Personal Injuries Committee and it was turned down.  I have gone into the case, and I have been given to understand that the claim was turned down on the plea that the individual making the claim was capable of bearing any loss sustained and of paying medical expenses or any other losses incurred through his wife's illness.  I think that is an absolutely ridiculous answer for any Committee to make.  Irrespective of what the conditions of life of the claimant may be, if a person's health has been injured because the Army has gone into occupation of a premises, without any notice, and loss is sustained, not only pecuniary loss, but loss of health, because of that action, it is a ridiculous argument to advance that because the individual is capable of bearing the pecuniary loss the State must not pay anything.  The least that ought to be expected is that the medical expenses incurred should be defrayed by the State.  I would like to know if the President, or the Minister for Finance, is prepared to re-open such cases. There are many such cases throughout the country.  I think it is not a fair attitude for the Committee, or the State, to take up.</P>

      <P>When I intervened in the earlier stages of the debate I was in doubt as to what heading certain matters I wanted to raise should be discussed under.  It was more or less to get a ruling on a certain point.  I want now to bring to the notice of the Minister a case in which compensation <Col N="252" /> has been denied to a postmaster who happened to be brought out by the Irregulars, badly beaten, and is permanently injured as a result.  It is the case of a postmaster in a very large town in the West of Ireland, who had 28 sub-offices under his supervision.  In April, 1922, when, in the words of the Minister for Justice, it was usual for unauthorised individuals to hold interviews with bank managers and railway men, especially those in charge of cash, this postmaster took all the precautions he thought necessary to protect the property of the State.  What is said to have led up to his being kidnapped and beaten is that he acquainted the local military authorities with the fact that he had reason to believe that a raid was to be made on one of the sub-post offices, and military forces were supplied for the protection of the office.  At any rate, he was kidnapped and brought away five miles from the town.  He was partially stripped, his boots and waist-coat being taken, and he was told to make his peace with God, as he was very soon to be sent to an unknown destination.</P>

      <P>Both body and soul.  At any rate he was very badly beaten.  He was kicked and bruised and fired at, but was not hit.  He found his way home through the courtesy of some friends in the early hours of the morning. He was examined by a doctor and had to be brought to Dublin, where he was under the treatment of a very prominent surgeon for three months.  This man submitted his case.  For some reason, which I cannot explain at the moment, the case was listed for hearing at the County Court.  A couple of days before the court was to be held he received a wire stating the case was not to be tried there and that it was referred to the Personal Injuries Compensation Committee.  He stated his case and received the reply some time ago that the Committee had given very careful consideration to his case&mdash;part of his case was that he had incurred considerable expenses by the employment of this surgeon and during the period he was in hospital; also by the fact that he had to keep practically two homes during this time&mdash;and that there <Col N="253" /> were no grounds put forward to show why compensation should be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw the Postmaster-General in connection with the matter.  I thought he would be the proper channel through which to deal with the Minister for Finance.  This man did all he possibly could to protect the property of the State.  It was because of his endeavours in that direction that he met with the treatment I have referred to.  If that man had not taken these precautions, if he had just gone along and taken it that everything would be all right he would not have received this treatment, and he would not be the physical wreck he is to-day.  This is a very serious case from my point of view.  I am aware of cases where banks were raided and where managers when confronted with people with revolvers, defended the bank property at the risk of their lives.  In a few cases, one in my own constituency, bank managers lost their lives in defending the property of the bank.  It is very serious if the State is going to deal with the case of a civil servant, acting in the same way, differently from that of the banks.  For reasons that are obvious, this man could not go back to his post office district in the West of Ireland. As a result of the attentions that were being paid to him he had to be transferred to a post office in County Dublin. His case was put up to the Minister for Finance.  Personally I do not believe that the Minister for Finance sees any of those cases.  I believe it is the paid officials of his Department who are the judges in most of these cases.  At any rate, an official of the Ministry of Finance replied to the appeal that was sent to the Postmaster-General, stating: &ldquo;The Minister regrets he cannot see his way to have the case re-heard.&rdquo;  I do not believe the Minister ever saw the case.  I think it is a very serious state of affairs, if one believes, as I believe in this case, that the Minister is the final court of appeal, to find an answer given in the way I have read it out.  I think, at the very least, there is a case for the expenses incurred in this man's case.  I am not making a case for big compensation, because he was paid his salary. The fact is, he had to keep two homes going for four or five months, and as <Col N="254" /> far as I can see he is a physical wreck for the remainder of his life, a nervous wreck at any rate.  I contend that the least the Government should do, in a case of that kind, is to clear the medical expenses of the man who defended the property of the State in these circumstances. It is a case like the one Deputy Baxter has in mind, and I would certainly like a ruling from the President, acting for the Minister for Finance, as to whether or not this is considered to be proper treatment for a man who has taken all the risks I have stated.  If it is, it is certainly not an encouragement or an inducement to civil servants, who in future may be placed under the same circumstances, to take any physical risk in defending the property of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Redmond, in dealing with this matter, stressed the fact that there were certain legal rights before the Criminal Injury Acts were repealed by the Damage to Property Act.  I stated here before Deputy Redmond entered the Dáil that there were legal rights, but they were legal rights that were not negotiable.  They were legal rights that could not be enforced, and as such they had very little value. Whatever may be said about the terms of reference of the Committee, or the manner in which they did their work, I think they interpreted their terms of reference as fairly as they possibly could in the circumstances, and whatever amounts they recommended&mdash;and they have recommended very considerable amounts&mdash;have been paid, and we have honoured the non-legal character of the awards that have been made in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear the Committee in question has had something like 1,200 cases before it; 2,500 cases still remain to be considered.  Sums amounting to about £180,000 have been awarded so far in something like 532 cases.  In 675 cases there have been no reports at all. That would include 65 pre-Truce cases and 610 post-Truce cases.  Last year we considered&mdash;and I am still of opinion&mdash; that one Board should deal with all those cases.  It was pointed out last year that the amounts which were awarded in certain county courts varied very considerably, and naturally <Col N="255" /> gave some dissatisfaction.  With one Board at least the same rulings and the same basis of awards would run from beginning to end.  There is no use in blaming this particular Board if they are bound by terms of reference which restrict, perhaps, the otherwise charitable inclinations which might animate them.</P>
    <P>We had the terms of reference before the Dáil last year, and there is an extraordinary difference between the terms of reference here and the provisions of the Personal Injuries Act. Reading into these terms of reference very carefully, I find some of the cases in which complaints have been made would have been open to a decision in the light of the recommendations made. In one case it was mentioned that a man had £1 a week.  That was his entire income at that time, but it was mentioned that he had other potential means of income.  I do not know whether an examination of the terms of reference would lead one to suppose the Committee was entitled to consider potential income or wealth that the man might possibly come into.  On the facts of the case&mdash;I do not know anything but what was mentioned here&mdash;I would say that a better case would have to be made before the Committee than was made here, if one were to indict the Committee for what it did.</P>
    <P>The members of the Committee were restricted by the terms of reference, and if they once opened the door to an extension in such cases as were mentioned by Deputy Johnson, I do not know to what extent they might not be called upon to extend their consideration. In some cases it would be asked: &ldquo;What did you do in such and such a case, and cannot you do the same here as well as there?&rdquo;  The incidental expenses mentioned in Vote 15 are those of the Ministry of Finance, and they have nothing to do with this Committee. The incidental expenses in the Vote for Temporary Commissions are those of the Committee, and I believe they are properly shown there.  That point was raised by Deputy Cooper.</P>
    <P>Some Army cases were mentioned, and on page 200 there is a sub-head dealing with compensation for damage <Col N="256" /> or injury by the Army.  That deals with payment by the Army in cases where people were accidentally shot or injured by soldiers.  In quite a number of cases applications have been made quite innocently, the applicants thinking they had a claim before the Personal Injuries Commission.  When it was ruled out by them it comes under that particular heading in the Army Vote.  The amounts which have been recommended for payment in pre-Truce cases in the first report which we received from this committee total 18, and the amount recommended for payment was £8,710.  In post-Truce cases in the first report the number of cases mentioned was 281, and the amount £112,217.  The total in all numbered 299 cases, and the amount was £120,927. That report was dated the 7th December of last year.  The second report was dated the 17th April of this year, and the pre-Truce awards numbered 75, the amount being £19,300.  The post-Truce cases numbered 158, and the amount, £30,797.  The total in that case was 233 cases, and the amount, £10,532.  The terms of reference were before the Dáil when we introduced and passed the Damage to Property Act last year.  I do not know that the Dáil had an opportunity of considering or making any recommendations on it.</P>
    <P>For many months it had been pointed out that the terms of the Personal Injuries Act were not terms we could entertain here in future.  Mention was made of one or two cases in which individuals had suffered loss.  One was a case where a motor car had knocked down a person, and it was alleged there were Irregulars in the motor car.  They might have been belonging to what, in the absence of a better term, we may call the Irregulars No. 2&mdash;bandits or persons like that.  In every country there are losses from the activities of such persons, and I do not know that even in England there are any means of compensating persons in such cases. Even where there are policemen on point duty and other duty through the country, we know that very eminent and respectable citizens occasionally speed-up, and that is against the law.</P>
    <P>In those cases where such incidents as that occur, it would not be fair to <Col N="257" /> say that the State, by reason of its responsibility for law and order and regular proceeding, should accept responsibility where accidents occur.</P>

I read the other day in the newspapers of a lady who presented a revolver at the back of a taxi-car driver.  If he had been shot, there would have been no compensation either.  The Minister for Finance has not constituted himself in this case a court of appeal, but if there are cases in which Deputies are satisfied that there are reasons why they should be reconsidered I would undertake to see that those cases would be reconsidered, but they must be reconsidered within the terms of reference of the committee.  In other words, the Minister for Finance has not got the right to take upon himself a greater degree of latitude than he has prescribed or than has been prescribed for this Personal Injuries Committee.</P>

      <P>The President said it was not the rule to allow costs.  A great deal of hardship has occurred in regard to the question of costs.

If that is going to be done in that way &mdash;and I know cases where pressure has been brought to have it done in that way&mdash;it is surely right that the Committee should take proper cognisance of it and that whatever expense in the way of costs is incurred it should be incurred with the cognisance of the Committee.</P>

I can quite understand a case being made that medical expenses and things of that sort should be allowed, but at this stage to bring in the question of solicitors' costs, when they have not been allowed up to this, cannot, I think, be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned during the course of this Session that it was intended to supplement other sums which were made available for the provision of employment by a special sum of £250,000.  I explained that it was anticipated that by the end of this financial year the sums already in the Road Fund prior to the 1st of April of this year, would come in in respect of the 6d. in the £ under the Damage to Property Act and the amounts that would normally flow into the fund this year, taken together would make a sum of about 1¾ millions. Then in order to complete the round sum of 2 millions for unemployment and for dealing with the improvement of roads and bridges, a sum of £250,000 was added, because in certain cases expenditure in respect of Road Fund moneys could not be justified.  It was hoped that in particular areas, where there might be distress during the year, having such a sum as this in the Estimates might relieve the situation, even at a considerable cost, give public satisfaction and ease the local circumstances. There is one particular area which contributes a very considerable sum towards the Road Fund, and also a pretty considerable sum in respect of the 6d. in the £.  I do not know that it would be reasonably possible to spend money out of the Road Fund satisfactorily in respect of that particular area while getting a very considerable sum from it for this particular service.  There were other means and other opportunities for the expenditure of public money which could be perfectly justified, and it is for that particular purpose that this £250,000 is put down here.</P>

      <P>I think the information which the President has given us is not sufficiently definite for the committee to come to a decision on the matter, so as to know exactly the purpose to which this £250,000 is to be devoted.  I would like to know whether any of this sum, and if so, how much, has been allocated and what are the particular schemes that are being undertaken.  There are districts, as <Col N="262" /> the President rightly says, where there is almost chronic distress, particularly in the congested areas in the West, North-west, and South-west of Ireland. In these areas the people are never far from starvation even in good years But for the past two years or so, especially during the past winter, they were in a very deplorable condition.  Certain avenues that were open to them in the past have been closed.  Many of them used to go to England and Scotland to work as labourers during the summer and harvest months, and in that way earned something that kept them going.  The land, if it could be called land, was never able to sustain them in anything like comfort.  It is, I hold, the first duty of the Government to make provision for the people in such areas as these who are living under exceptional conditions.  I thoroughly approve of the setting aside of a certain sum of this nature for such a purpose as the relief of people in distressed areas of that kind, but I would like to know whether anything has been done beyond putting the amount down in the Estimates.  It is a good thing to see it in the Estimates, but it would be a very much better thing to see it in the pockets of the people.  I understand that a certain very small proportion of it has been allocated, but I think there is reason to complain that, although this money has appeared in the Estimates and, I take it, a certain amount has been voted on account, up to the present practically nothing has been spent out of this sum, although there can be no doubt that the necessity for its allocation is very great.  I would like to mention especially the area of West Galway&mdash;Connemara and the Isles of Arran.  There is plenty of useful and productive work that could be done in these areas, such as making roads, planting, drainage, and work in connection with the division of lands and estates in the hands of the Land Commission.  I would appeal to the Minister, or whoever is responsible for these relief schemes, to see that the schemes undertaken are really useful and productive ones.  If anybody takes the trouble to visit the Arran Islands they will find that some time ago a grant was given to build a pier there.  The pier was built and <Col N="263" /> was of considerable use to the fishermen.</P>

The pier that was of some use to the fishermen before is now quite useless.  I cannot understand, and the islanders cannot understand, why it should be necessary to quarry stones at the top of the island, pile them up on the pier and leave them there.</P>

      <P>There is another district, that is the South Connemara district, which is specially in need of relief at present. There is very great distress there.  It is one of those districts that are periodically visited by fever, and it is a district where people are always on the verge of hunger.  It is urgently necessary to provide work for the people of that area, and I would urge strongly on the Minister responsible that as much as possible from this Vote should be set free, and set free immediately, to relieve the very great distress that exists in these areas of Connemara.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connell that the President's prefatory comment did not really give us a very great deal of information in regard to this Vote, and I think information is really required.  I assume that when a sum of £250,000 is set down in a Vote of this kind it is not arrived at merely as a matter of hazard; that it has been shaped by some definite conception of the need that is to be met, and that plans have been framed, at <Col N="264" /> least in outline, to meet that need. Therefore I think it is right that we should be given some information of what these proposals are.  I think that the majority of Deputies, when they see the words &ldquo;Relief Schemes&rdquo; at the top of a Vote, would at once come to the conclusion, from whatever part of the country they came, that the part of the country that is intended to be served is the extreme West, where, as has already been pointed out, there is such continual want and need.  I will not say that that need at present is exceptional; it would be a contradiction in terms to say that it is always exceptional; it very nearly always is exceptional, but we do know that all down the West they have been relying on harvesting in England and Scotland, but for some years, owing to the increase of unemployment in those countries, that is no longer available.</P>
      <P>We do know also that the winter has been one of very considerable need there because of the poor potato crop of last year.  I have not been in that part of the country for some time, but I receive constant correspondence from there, and I am told that potato blight has appeared, and that people are looking forward to the immediate future with some apprehension and anxiety, and schemes by which relief could be brought to them are very badly needed. I am perfectly sure that the Government is fully alive to this need, and that it is prepared to meet it directly this Vote has been passed.  I am not now questioning its information in regard to the need that does exist.  All I am asking for is this.  Here is a vote for £250,000: let the President state to us, on the supposition which I think is a reasonable supposition, that before many minutes have passed this Vote will be passed, what will be done with it to meet the very extreme need in the extreme west of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things that I am not satisfied with regarding this Vote.  In the first place I am not satisfied with the information we have got regarding how it is to be expended, where it is to be expended, and what the schemes are.  Secondly, I am not satisfied with the amount, <Col N="265" /> which is not at all adequate, to my mind, to relieve the distress that prevails all over the country.  I suppose I should speak more particularly for my own county.  There is an old saying, &ldquo;Is ar máithe leis féin a dhineann an cat cronán.&rdquo;  There are, I suppose, at least 80,000 or 100,000 people unemployed, and to suggest that the amount now being voted will be anything in the nature of relief, notwithstanding other means of relieving unemployment, is, I think, asking us to expect too much.  In some of the congested areas, I understand, other money is released for the relief of distress.  There are some congested districts to which these relief schemes will not apply, and they are rather unfortunate in that, because it simply amounts to this, that the old Congested Districts Board acquired land in these areas, and therefore the grants that are released are not applicable to these other districts. In the apportionment of this grant in relief schemes these districts where the old Congested Districts Board did not acquire land, and this other money is not applicable, should get prior treatment. I speak with some knowledge of the hardships and the sufferings in some parts of the west of Ireland.  I know that from Black Head to Loop Head, right on the whole west coast of Clare, and some ten miles inland, there is a good deal of distress, and I know also that this area&mdash;I might say practically the whole of Clare&mdash;would lend itself to a good deal of reconstruction and reproductive work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are such things as drainage schemes, such things as dredging harbours, such things as fisheries, and the promotion and the subsidising of these things.  I should like very much to hear the Minister tell us how much is to be used for these reproductive works, how it is to be applied, and to what districts.  With regard to the total amount, I want to make one point. We have got to consider that the life of the nation is dependent to some extent upon how far we can prevent distress from prevailing and unemployment from extending.  Last year, something like £11,300,000 was spent to preserve the nation.  It was spent on the Army Vote.  This year this Vote is <Col N="266" /> something like £4,000,000, and yet we are asked to do with £250,000 to save people from starvation in many districts. I think more should be given, and that more serious cognisance should be taken of the serious situation amongst the unemployed and amongst the poor in some of the seaboard districts, and I would put it very strongly to the Minister that he should give us more information, tell us what the schemes are, tell us how much is to be apportioned to each scheme, and tell us if there is any possibility of more money being given for this very essential and very pressing work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the President whether the moneys proposed to be voted in connection with these relief schemes will be available for keeping in repair many piers and small harbours that were erected around the coast, some of them in comparatively recent years, and in many cases erected to provide immediate employment in the particular areas.  It is the opinion of several Deputies that many of these piers and harbours are at the moment falling into a state of decay.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the President if the moneys voted under this relief scheme will be available for the purpose of doing the necessary repairs to those piers and harbours and, in that way, to provide employment for the many people who are unemployed in these particular districts.  Work of that kind is really necessary and useful. I think one of the objects that one has to keep in mind under schemes of this nature is to try and make the work on which the unemployed may be engaged serve as useful a purpose as possible. I think it would be very desirable that the moneys spent on these piers and harbours around the coast should serve a useful purpose.  In many cases these piers and harbours are in a state of decay, and if money were spent on them it would stop that decay.  If the President could see his way to accept that point of view I am sure it would help, not alone the local district, but it would also help towards the maintenance and the keeping in a good state of preservation of the piers and harbours.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the responsible Ministers to the acute distress that prevails at present in North Donegal, particularly in Inishowen.  In portions of the Inishowen Peninsula there is an outbreak of fever at the present time, and there is a great want of employment.  Money is very scarce, and the people are in a very bad way.  I know people living there, and they have to exist on stir-about Indian meal three times a day, and in many instances they are unable to have milk with it.  When this money is let loose, I trust that the claims of North Donegal for a share of it will not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>With Deputy Hogan I would like to impress on the Minister how totally inadequate this sum of £250,000 is.  When I saw the amount which the Government proposed to make available for relief works, I had to ask myself the question whether the Ministry had any real knowledge of the position in the country, or whether the Ministry really recognises the position in the country as it is to-day.  I wonder does the Ministry realise that there was never such misery and hunger in this country since black '47 as there is to-day.  I do not believe that the Ministry realises that.  I dare say one of the reasons is, that through pressure of business they have been more or less confined to their offices for the last twelve months or two years, and have to depend for their information on their officials going through the country. But Deputies of the Dáil who spend practically every week-end among their constituents see such scenes as processions of the unemployed and of children going practically half-naked and bootless, and, in a number of cases, half-hungry, to school.  Deputies, in that way, have borne in upon them what the real position is.  If I would be in order, I would like to move that this amount be increased to at least £1,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to do that on this Vote.  I think it is <Col N="268" /> the first duty of the Government to try and provide employment for the people of this country, and to give every man who wants work and is willing to work an opportunity to provide bread and butter for his family.  The position to-day, to my mind, is more serious than ever it has been.  Realising and knowing what it is in my own particular district, I can well realise what the misery and the privation must be in the West of Ireland.  In passing, I might say that it seems rather strange&mdash;and I wonder if there is anything behind it&mdash; that the campaign of publicity taken up by the newspapers some months ago on behalf of the people in the West of Ireland should cease so suddenly.  I take it, it did not cease because the misery that existed there had been relieved to any great extent.  I would like to know from the Minister what amount of the million and three-quarters, which he told us last year would be made available for the relief of unemployment, has been made available and what schemes it has been made available for.  As far as I know, the only thing that the Ministry have tried to set going in the way of employment is the reconstruction of roads. I would like to tell the Minister that the reconstruction of roads has been held up in a large number of places throughout the country, because the county councils&mdash;and the county surveyors in particular&mdash;have not made any effort to co-operate with the Government in trying to relieve unemployment. The Minister, the other day, in reply to a question I put to him, in connection with the provision of machinery, stated that instructions were sent out as far back as last January or February to the different county councils to make suitable provision for getting extra machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in a number of cases county councils had not even gone to the trouble of looking for estimates from firms for the machinery until within practically the last month. The result is that while, in a number of districts throughout the country, there are thousands of pounds made available by the Government, it is actually waiting there because the county councils have not worked in co-operation with the Government, and men are <Col N="269" /> still walking around unemployed.  I think the Government ought to do something in that matter, and that they should also take cognisance of the fact that unemployment is more rife in the country to-day than it has been since the year 1847.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in introducing his Unemployment Insurance Bill the other day, told us that he hoped that the Bill which he was introducing would relieve about 82,000 men.  I take it that at the present time there must be at least between 80,000 and 120,000 or 130,000 people unemployed in this country.  I suggest that that is an extraordinary state of affairs&mdash;a state of affairs that should not be allowed to exist, and I think the Dáil should insist on the Ministry making a determined effort to deal with the matter. I submit that the Ministry has not made any real effort to deal with this question of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Vote.  I agree with the last speaker that the amount is altogether inadequate. Anyone going through the country&mdash;particularly in the poorer portions of the West of Ireland&mdash;cannot fail to be struck with the great depression that prevails there at the present time.  The harvest last year&mdash; as most Deputies know&mdash;was a very bad one.  If it was bad on good land in the centre and south of Ireland, one can imagine how bad it was on the poor land of Mayo, Galway, Donegal and the Western counties.  The potato and oats crops were a failure.  Two months ago I was informed that the people in many parts of Mayo, if they sowed the seed, would not have enough potatoes to support them.  The oats supply was exhausted also.  They had to depend for their groceries on the credit of the local shopkeeper, and, if that was the state of things two months ago, it is worse to-day.  I am greatly disappointed that this work has not been in progress for the last month, but, even now, it should be pushed on and employment given to these people, who are in a very bad way.  They are actually on the verge of starvation in many portions of Mayo and Galway.  They are buying Indian meal by the half sack.  There are two things to be remembered in connection <Col N="270" /> with this.  First of all, they are following a bad harvest, and secondly, there is general depression all round. If ever there was a year in which they should get a little help it is this year. Under the Land Act it is proposed to increase the holdings of these small people in the West.  Therefore, in two or three years time we may look to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="ACTING-CHAIRMAN ACTING-CHAIRMAN">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">

      <P>I will not refer to the Land Act.  But these people will have larger farms in a few years time, and if they are not helped now they will get into a very bad state.  There is a further reason why the Government should not hesitate to deal generously with them.  Owing to the neglect of the British Government and the Land Commission, which had charge of a lot of these estates, and also owing to the Congested Districts Board which kept them on hands for several years, the old bogs in many districts have had to be cut away.  The people have had to look for new bogs, but they have no roads leading into them.  You cannot expect people to build these roads themselves.  These people cannot, of course, get coal, and they cannot get the turf which is within their reach, because of the lack of roads.  They are crying for help, but the help given so far is entirely inadequate.  I hope the Government will press on with the expenditure of the money they have, and I would like to see them introducing a supplementary estimate to deal with the situation adequately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This estimate under the heading of &ldquo;Relief Schemes&rdquo; has produced in this House a very melancholy debate.  We have heard of the great distress throughout the country, and we have heard it objected to that the amount is only a quarter of a million, although the President has indicated that the total amount to be spent is something like two millions.  I think it is very melancholy to see members <Col N="271" /> of this House get up and say that so far as the West of Ireland is concerned the condition of the people there is chronic and that they are on the verge of starvation.  No matter how much you talk about relief works, relief works are only temporary and can only give employment temporarily.  If the same state of affairs, after the expenditure of money on relief work is going to be what it has been described in this House, it is not relief work you want but something permanent.  The great trouble about relief work always is that unless the money that has been spent in connection with relief creates a permanent stability, so far as employment is concerned, it will not be of very much use.  We have heard demands made that a very much larger sum should be spent at the present time, but we have heard nothing as to where the money is to come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputies must realise that one of the causes of the trouble in Ireland at present is the tremendously heavy weight of taxation which the people are called upon to bear.  So far from the lashing about and expenditure of money in this way relieving the position permanently, I say that it is going to be a further drag on the country, and that the burden of the cost is going to make it very much more difficult to resuscitate the means of employment for the unemployed.  Let us be clear on that subject.  The real relief that is going to take place as regards unemployment is the extension of industry and in no other way, so far as I can see, is any permanent relief going to be given.  That would be enormously helped by the most economic management of the finances of the country, and much more relief would be given in that way than by the expenditure of promiscuous sums.  This question of the time being particularly severe, is not, I think, based on real grounds at all.  We are at the period in which employment on the land ought to be at its maximum.  We have heard that the harvesting operations at the other side of the water have ceased, and that the harvesters have ceased to go across.  From my own knowledge I see the harvesters going across to <Col N="272" /> Scotland and England.  That, of course, is only a help, but the real basis on which you can relieve people in the west of Ireland is to get on with land distribution, and get the people to be self-supporting as far as possible, and so far from increasing this amount that has been allocated, it ought to be spread as far as possible.  We have heard that this £250,000 has not been ear-marked to any particular purpose, and Deputy after Deputy has got up and said that it ought to be spent here, there, and elsewhere.  So far as I can see from the claims made here, this £250,000 will go a very short way to meet the demands that will be made upon it.  That is true, but what is the alternative?  The alternative on the Labour Benches is to increase the amount.  I say that so far from doing good it is going to hurt permanently the ability of the people to tackle this unemployment question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues who have spoken from these benches, I suggest that the Minister has not given sufficient information as to why, when, and where this money is going to be spent.  I have no hesitation in stating that the amount of money which it is suggested should be spent is altogether inadequate.  It is all very well for Deputy Hewat to complain about the initiation here of a melancholy debate. <Col N="273" /> I want to remind him that there are worse things than melancholy debates. There is a lot of melancholia prevalent to-day amongst the unemployed and their families.  I rather think that he has not taken the trouble to examine from a humane point of view the question of unemployment and the hardships that exist in this country, in consequence of the lack of employment for the last two or three years.  It is all very well for him to say that we want better security in the country, or that we want stability in the country.  That is recognised in these benches as well as in any other part of the House.  At the same time the present conditions have been brought about in this country by contributions which the unemployed had nothing whatever to do with.  I want to know are they to be victims because this country has had a little revolution of its own for the past two or three years.</P>
      <P>To come back again to the question of the £250,000, I do believe, like Deputy Morrissey, that the Government do not realise the gravity of the situation, that the Government have been led to this decision of granting £250,000 by the figures of unemployment that are supplied to them through their officials. Some time ago I drew the attention of the House to the fact that the numbers published in the newspapers of the unemployed in the Free State were not correct, or anything like correct. Week after week, the alleged number of unemployed in the Free State is published in the daily newspapers.  I have already told the Dáil, and I tell them again now, that that does not at all represent the number of unemployed in the Free State.  It represents the number who are in receipt of benefit through the Unemployment Exchanges, and it disregards altogether the people who are out of benefit and those who have never received benefit, and they are a large proportion of the population of the Free State to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, coming back to the question of grants, as regards the last grant that was made, and which is being administered at the present time through the county councils in the Free State, there was a stipulation that none but ex-National soldiers should be employed. <Col N="274" /> The Deputies on these benches objected to that.  They had no antipathy to ex-National soldiers, but there had been men idle for the previous two or three years who got no chance of doing any kind of work in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="ACTING-CHAIRMAN ACTING-CHAIRMAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will be able to convince you that I am in order.  I said at that time that we objected to that.  We were told that these people did useful work and all the rest of it. I think the Minister will understand that that grant in itself was not sufficient to absorb the number of ex-soldiers who were unemployed and that the ordinary citizens who had done very useful work in the interests of the State were not considered, and that there should at least have been another grant to give relief to those people.  I think the Minister ought to seriously consider now what is to be done for those people who did not serve in the National army but who did useful work in other ways in the interests of the State.  Deputy Morrissey suggested that he might be in order in moving an increase in the Vote, and you rightly ruled that he was not.  I am now going to move an amendment that I think is in order.  It is that this estimate be referred back for reconsideration with a view to an increase.  Is that amendment in order?</P>

      <P>I think it has been ruled in order before.  It is the only way in which a matter of this kind can be reconsidered.  It must be borne in mind that we are not allowed to refer back a motion on a plea for the reduction of the Minister's salary.  Therefore, this is the only way that it can be referred back for reconsideration with a view to an increase.  That has been the ruling hitherto.</P>

      <NameTxt>ACTING-CHAIRMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Johnson.  Our Constitution departs from the usual course of parliamentary practice.  Elsewhere the <Col N="275" /> normal way to get an increase would be to reduce the Minister's salary.  That being so, I reconsider my decision and accept Deputy Corish's motion, which will, however, have to be seconded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimates be referred back for consideration with a view to an increase.  I do think that the Government ought to really set about considering this matter from a humane point of view, and they ought to try and get in touch with people in the country who know the position.  On the occasion of the last debate we were told that an unemployment committee had been set up by the Government party with a view to examining the whole question of unemployment and to suggest schemes to the Government which they might finance. I think we have a right to know now what stage of the deliberations that committee have arrived at, whether there has been any finality in connection with the deliberations and if the schemes they set out to consider are to be financed by any portion of this money.  With one thing my colleague, Deputy Morrissey, referred to I do not altogether agree.  He says that the county councils in the Free State have not co-operated with the Government with a view&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second the amendment.  I think it is time that the Ministry should tackle this problem of unemployment instead of tinkering with it, because they have done nothing but tinker with it.  For the past twelve months we have put many schemes before them, and they have been turned down.  In referring this back for reconsideration I think the President when he considers carefully all that has been said here this evening will agree that £1,000,000 is not too much to meet the situation as it stands now.  In County Kildare we have prepared drainage and road improvement schemes, estimated at about £52,000.  Surely £1,000,000 would not be <Col N="276" /> too much to meet similar schemes in the other twenty-five counties.  If the President looks carefully into these schemes and the way they have been thought out to relieve unemployment in the most populous centres of the county he will see that we have done our best, and I expect that he would recommend us every penny of the money that we ask for.  By doing this he would give confidence to the workers of the country.  They would feel that there was at least one Minister in Dublin who was looking after their interests and not turning them down.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey says, the Ministry seem to think that the cases we put up are not so serious as we represent them to be.  Already I have been told that an inspector has sent in a report which differs from mine, and he says that there was not so much distress in my county as I stated.  We are in touch more with the workers than an inspector who will go down for two or three days and make a report on what he sees there.  I would like the Ministry to believe that we come up here to describe the true conditions as we see them in our own areas, and that we are not self-seeking. We want to relieve the unemployed, and we come to you to ask you to do it.  If you do not do it, the responsibility will lie upon the heads of the Ministry, and as far as our constituents are concerned, they will say that if any Government that is elected is not a better one than this, it is not worth much support.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is that this Estimate should be referred back for consideration with a view to increasing the amount.  In putting down this amount we had to bear in mind several things.  We had not got a free hand, and if Deputy Johnson were here on these benches he would not have a free hand in dealing with this matter.  We have to take into account how much money is being spent generally on this matter which provides employment, or circulates money with a view to giving employment.  In considering that, it is necessary to examine the Estimates and see to what extent monies are being provided which, in the ordinary natural course of events, should give considerable employment during the year or which would, in the alternative, provide some compensation for persons unemployed.</P>
      <P>Within the last couple of weeks we had a measure before the Dáil which continues covenanted or uncovenanted benefit&mdash;I do not know which, but it is one or the other.  We also had a measure within the last few days putting forward proposals under the Trade Facilities Bill, embracing a sum of about one and one-quarter millions. We have already passed an estimate involving a sum of £197,810 for new works under the Board of Works.  We will have an estimate for £7,333,000 in respect of damage to property, representing awards.  We will also have an estimate for £587,000 for housing and an estimate for £21,000 for forestry operations.  Then there will be the Army estimate for £243,997 for works and buildings.  If there be people in this country who can provide a larger amount for those services, then the sooner they take up the positions that we have here, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has turned down this amendment with what seems to be a certain amount of contumely.  He suggests it is one of those amendments that should not be brought forward because it cuts across Ministerial policy.  He has submitted <Col N="278" /> certain figures indicating that here and there through the estimates are considerable sums of money which, when spent, will give a sufficient amount of employment.  I hope the Minister's expectations will be warranted in the fulfilment. It was expected that some of these sums would be spent during the last year or two, but they have not yet been spent.  Take, for instance, the monies for reconstruction which represent the largest amount.  We have no assurance whatever that these sums are to be spent in the coming year.  But even if all those monies were spent in the way the Minister expects, we are still faced with a problem of unemployment, the kind of unemployment which is not going to be cured by expenditure in the trades which the Minister himself has put forward as trades which would be benefitted. There are other people unemployed than those who would be affected by rebuilding.</P>
      <P>This question is one which cuts very deep, and if might easily invite discussion. It is a big social problem; the whole social position is involved in this question of unemployment.  For eighteen months we have been impressing on the Dáil and the Ministry the necessity for looking ahead and for dealing seriously and earnestly with this matter.  When the Unemployment Insurance Act was brought forward last March twelve months, the question was discussed and urgings were forthcoming from those benches that unless the matter was tackled seriously, then the Unemployment Insurance Act, which was being brought forward at the time, was going to lead to greater distress, rather than to an improvement of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministry hoped then that the position would be eased and that there would be general prosperity by October last.  They gave us no reason for that expectation, but it was on that expectation they built their policy.  The expectation was not fulfilled.  They proceeded to demobilise large numbers of men from the Army and they threw them upon the already overcrowded labour market, as it is called.  They simply added that number, or a large proportion of that number, of demobilised <Col N="279" /> men, to the numbers already seeking employment in vain.  They have introduced certain schemes relating to road work with the object of absorbing large numbers of unemployed. No doubt considerable numbers have been absorbed.  The method of doing that has been very doubtfully satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what has been done, every Deputy knows that the stories of distress coming from every village and town in the country are very serious indeed.  People are suffering quietly.  They are seeing such reserves as they had, vanish.  They are seeing their children going half-hungry, half-nourished, and half-clothed. It is half-nourishment is the trouble, and it is worse, in a sense, than absolute hunger, because it is so long sustained.  Absolute hunger results in a more or less speedy death, but the half-hunger that is almost universal in many towns in the country is what is destroying the morale and the physical capacity of the people.  Ministers do not seem to realise how intense this suffering and distress is, and how widespread it is. The method of dealing with it does not seem to indicate that the Ministry have taken as serious notice of the problem as they ought to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat, of course, has taken the line which one might have expected him to take.  That is that what you have to concentrate upon is the re-establishment of the ordinary functions of trade, the re-establishment of confidence, and as a natural result you will have trade revived and unemployment will disappear.  But, unfortunately, that does not result in the disappearance of the unemployed.  The ordinary functions of trade, unfortunately, have never absorbed, except in time of war, the unemployed.  If the present unemployed are to wait until that confidence, which is desired by everyone, is restored to such an extent that every industry will be flourishing, the people who are at present unemployed and who are at present looking at their families going hungry, will have to wait too long.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Ministry that they ought not to consider the Government of this country as something set apart <Col N="280" /> from the national life, to receive taxation as they can gather it in, to spend it in such a way as they consider necessary and desirable, and to leave the whole of the problem of feeding, clothing and housing the people as something outside their responsibility.  If it is a fact that the ordinary course of industry and commerce has failed to supply the needs of the people, then something must be done to compel the people who are responsible for those ordinary functions of industry and commerce to so order their affairs as to ensure that the people will be supplied with the ordinary requirements of life.  If they fail in that, then it is the responsibility of the Government to call the people together and to do this necessary and first essential work of Government&mdash;to see that the people get food.  We have no right to say that because the merchant or manufacturer cannot find a market and cannot employ a child's father, that, therefore, the child must go hungry.  We cannot afford to take up that attitude, and I say it is the duty of the Dáil and the Government as the Executive Authority, to take that fact into consideration and to put that child's father in a position to earn money to feed the child.</P>
    <P>One does not want to speak here with a view to exciting emotions or passions.  But I say that we have obviously before us a duty in this matter, and that is to say that the man who is willing to work, the machine that is capable of turning out products, and the land that is capable of growing food&mdash;that these three must be brought together, and that the people must be fed and clothed. This method of voting £250,000 to do a little here and a little there to relieve distress, as it is called, and to relieve unemployment by healing a little wound here and a little wound there, is not tackling this problem in the way to solve it&mdash;at any rate to the extent which will save the country from trouble, as I am confident that as soon as the people realise the condition in which they are being placed trouble will ensue.</P>
    <P>It has been one of my hopes that the state of the country would be such, and <Col N="281" /> might continue to be such, as to allow the Government to tackle this problem of unemployment in a serious manner, without having to be prompted by social troubles.  But the delay in dealing with it and the inaction is practically inviting men to make themselves troublesome in the country.  Then they know, if the example of every other country is taken, that once trouble ensues, as a result of social unrest and excitement, the Government will respond to the necessities of the case. It is very much better to deal with the problem calmly and seriously, without having to wait until that trouble ensues, and then deal with it in a feverish way.  I would ask the Dáil to approve of this amendment and to express its will by referring the Vote back, so that the problem should be tackled in a manner which would go right to the roots and say that we are bound by our responsibilities to find a way by which a man willing to work can get the opportunity to work and be paid for that work.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to insert after the word &ldquo;premises,&rdquo; line 20, the words &ldquo;situate within the Dublin Metropolitan Police Area,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause (1) provides that all licensed premises in the Saorstát will in future open between the hours of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m.  I propose to limit this to the Metropolitan area of Dublin.  I understand that a demand for these hours has been made by people in Dublin&mdash; at least by the licensed traders in Dublin, but I submit that no demand for them has been made by the country, and not to allow houses in the country and in the country towns to open before nine in the morning would, in a great many cases, be a hardship.  Many houses in the country at the moment do not open until, perhaps, 8 o'clock, except on fair or market days or on some occasions of that sort, but I certainly think there is no reason in the world why they should not be allowed to open at seven if they want to.  If this clause were to go through as it stands some arrangement will have to be made so that they may open earlier on fair and market days, and days of that description.  At present in towns where the population is over 5,000 I think houses are allowed to remain open until 11 p.m., and I see no reason why a city like Limerick, or a big centre like Bray, should be asked to close an hour earlier, especially during the tourist season.  I do not think there is any more drinking in the country than there has been.  I believe there is not so much, and my whole case, to sum up, is this, that if Dublin wants these hours by all means let <Col N="287" /> it have them, but there is no demand in the country for them, and I do not see why the country should be asked to adopt them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. If the Minister for Justice would accept it he would be acting in accordance with the wishes of the people.  If the big traders in the city do not wish to open their houses until nine in the morning I do not see why that rule should apply to the whole Saorstát.  When people are going to fairs and markets early in the morning it is necessary to have these places open in order that they may get some refreshments.  I do not wish to delay the Dáil on this matter as it may be necessary to get this Bill through tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  It is not a question of what the traders affected want in this area or that area, it is what we ought to consider reasonable hours for the consumption of intoxicating liquor in the country.  The proposal is from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.&mdash;13 hours&mdash;and 9 a.m. is considered adequate as an uniform opening hour throughout the State.  Certainly if from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. is adequate in the Metropolitan area, with its dense population, it ought to be adequate elsewhere, and there is this, too, that if it is considered right to restrict the hours from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the city, where you have pretty good lighting and pretty good police supervision, there is certainly a case for a similar restriction throughout the rural areas where there is not the same police supervision and not the same lighting as you have in the capital. Generally, it might facilitate Deputies if they knew what the attitude was with regard to the hours set out in Section 1.  I do not propose to accept any of the amendments which purport to alter the hours.  The hours embodied in the Bill were arrived at after very careful consideration and very full investigation through various channels, and after the views of responsible officials throughout the country, district justices, State solicitors, Gárda Síochána officers, and so on, had been invited and considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> We are standing, therefore, on the hours set out.  We consider that they are reasonable and proper.  Deputies can make, or attempt to make, special cases for special areas, and so on.  But I think that the Dáil ought not to be so much affected by arguments of that kind, but should simply put to itself the commonsense question, whether thirteen long hours in the day are not adequate for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking thirteen hours a day during which licensed premises may remain open, would the Minister consider allowing public houses to open in country places on fair and market days at seven o'clock in the morning and close for two hours during the day when business would not be very brisk. I think that would be a fair concession to grant.  It would still be keeping the thirteen hours allowed for the sale of drink.  A concession of that kind would be a great convenience to people attending fairs.  The Minister, however, has told us that he does not intend to accept any amendments which deal with the question of hours.  If that is the case, it is only a waste of time for Deputies to be coming here and discussing the Bill.  We might as well have a vote on it at once and get finished with it.  Surely, the Minister will admit that the voice of the people in the country must be heard, and if Deputies here are incapable of convincing the Minister on matters which the people think call for attention, then it would be better for the people to send other Deputies here.  I am asking the Minister now to give people in the country the facilities they require.  I again appeal to him to grant this concession which I have put forward, that on fair days publicans in the country should be allowed to open at seven o'clock in the morning and to close for two hours during the middle of the day.</P>

      <P>Generally on the question of hours, I am standing over the hours set out in the Bill.  With regard to the three days on which complete closing is advocated in the Bill, there are two of these on which I think there would probably be almost general agreement, and, whatever controversy there is, is with regard to St. Patrick's Day.  Deputies know that year after year certain organisations in the country have pressed this matter of the closing of licensed premises on St. Patrick's Day, and it is unnecessary for me to go into the reasons periodically advanced.  If the Dáil, voting freely, is not in favour of that course, I will be prepared to drop it.  I myself would vote that there should be complete closing of licensed premises on <Col N="291" /> the National Festival to mark the fact that we hope we are turning our backs on a period in which drunkenness was the besetting sin in this country.  In regard to Christmas Day and Good Friday, I stand over the Bill and leave the question of whether the 17th March ought or ought not be a day for the consumption of liquor to a free vote of the Dáil.  On the question of hours, I am standing over the hours in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>On that would it be better to decide Section 1, Amendment 5, first&mdash;to delete the words &ldquo;or St. Patrick's Day&rdquo;?  When that has been decided we will know whether the words &ldquo;St. Patrick's Day&rdquo; stand in the section or not.  With regard to the other amendments&mdash;I want Deputies to follow this carefully, so that there will be no misunderstandings later on&mdash;Amendments 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 13 propose to delete certain words and to substitute other words.  I would propose, having disposed of Amendment 5, to take Amendment 2 in this form, &ldquo;To delete all words after the word `day' in line 21,&rdquo; and on that to take a discussion on the various amending proposals, and put from the Chair the question that the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Section.  If that is decided in the affirmative, then the words stand in the Bill, and the amendments I mentioned are all disposed of.  If the question is decided in the negative, the words are deleted, and the Committee has to decide what words will be put in instead of them.  That is the procedure in another place, and I think it would be convenient here.  Otherwise we could not avoid a duplicated discussion. As it has not been done before, I want Deputies to realise what I am doing.  Shall we take the proposal about St. Patrick's Day first on amendment 5?</P>

      <P>While I entirely agree with your statement as to precedent, may I suggest that there are two issues here and two decisions to be taken.  One is the question of the extension of hours on Saturday and the other arises on amendments 12 and 13, as to the question of altered hours on Sunday.  I do not think that we could well decide these questions on one amendment.  In any case, I suggest it would be fairer to take this decision on amendment 3 rather than on amendment 2, because amendment 3 is more moderate and we should have a chance of settling the question as to whether there should be any change in the section on the more moderate rather than on the more extreme amendment.</P>

      <P>In sub-sections (1), (2) and (4), lines 22, 33-34 and 53, to delete the words &ldquo;or St. Patrick's Day,&rdquo; where they occur, and to insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;Christmas Day,&rdquo; line 22, and also before the words &ldquo;Good Friday,&rdquo; lines 33 and 53.</P>
      <P>The amendment practically means that the hours of sale on St. Patrick's Day remain the same as they have hitherto been.  We all know that St. Patrick's Day is a national holiday, and it is celebrated, not only in Ireland, but all over the world where Irishmen meet.  I celebrated it myself in three different countries outside Ireland, and I do not think that at the end of the celebration we were in any way intoxicated.  We were only happy and pleased that we were celebrating a great national holiday.  I am probably older than most of you here, and I have seen more St. Patrick's Days, probably, than most Deputies have. When I look back I can only see that it was really a day of pleasure; it was a day of racing, of lawn tennis parties, and of hurling.  I may say that hurling is an excellent game, and one that ought to be encouraged, but it really encourages a very fair thirst that ought to be met reasonably.  It is a day on which every Irishman wants to feel happy.  We must ask the Minister, who is trying really to do his best, not to be too severe.  Like the rest of us, he is only human.  I am perfectly certain that when we come to St. Patrick's Day, as I hope we shall, with the hours for sale as they have been hitherto, we will find out that he can enjoy it as well as any of us.  I have, therefore, pleasure in proposing the amendment.</P>

I think, in view of the whole situation, in view of the national festival and the numbers of people who go to fetes, sports and outings of various kinds, that it would be a very great hardship that they should be deprived of reasonable refreshments after two o'clock.

      <P>When I handed in my amendment I meant to delete St. Patrick's Day altogether from the Bill. Of course, if the Minister for Justice accepts the amendment to have St. Patrick's Day the same as Sunday I will not care very much about the few hours extra.  To my mind St. Patrick's Day is a day when Irish people should enjoy themselves to the best of their ability.  It would be an awful pity to deprive people who go to a town on that day for amusement of reasonable refreshment.  Deputy Beamish has explained that he celebrated St. Patrick's Day in three or four different countries.  When he returned to this country, when the British were governing here, he found that he could get refreshments on St. Patrick's Day. Now we have an Irish Government who are not prepared to allow the citizens of the country they are governing refreshments on a day to which they look forward with pleasure.  I think that is a very foolish proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a very foolish proposition to include St. Patrick's Day in the Bill.  I would ask the Minister for Justice to accept the amendment and delete St. Patrick's Day from the section; <Col N="296" /> let it be the same as any other day in the week.  I hope, before the Bill is put through all its stages, that the opening hour will be 7 o'clock instead of 9 o'clock.  To my mind, the longer the public houses are kept open the less will be the abuse of drink.  The Minister for Justice may not agree with me there, and I am sure some Deputies on the Labour benches will not agree with me either, as they seem to hold that the longer public houses are kept open the greater the amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In many country districts that I know the market day is held on St. Patrick's Day, and sometimes marketing is done on Sunday morning after Mass.  I would suggest to the Minister that shops should be allowed to open from 1 o'clock until 5 o'clock or 7 o'clock on St. Patrick's Day.  I do not know if the same should hold on Good Friday.

    <P>I am opposed to this amendment because I think the befitting thing for this country is to keep the national holiday in a manner that will reflect credit to the country and to ourselves. It has been stated by our enemies that the Irish people had the habit of indulging in an orgy of drink on St. Patrick's Day.  That is altogether a mistaken idea.  I believe it is only in keeping with national self-respect and national dignity that the public houses should be closed on St. Patrick's Day. Most of you remember some years ago when a movement was started by the Gaelic League to close the licensed houses.  That request of the Gaelic League was responded to pretty generally throughout the country.  Statutes are unpopular to some people at times, but statutes are passed for the general good.  I think it would be for the general good in this case to have complete <Col N="298" /> closing on St. Patrick's Day.  I intend to vote against the amendment.</P>

It would be an awful thing if people travelled 7, 8 or 10 miles to a races or to a football match, or any kind of amusement, and found all the public houses in front of them closed.</P>

There is a noticeable wave of temperance all over the country, and there is no need for this licensing Bill.  Between waves of temperance, Gaelic League requests, unemployment and all the other things that serve to let the public houses severely alone, I think we should allow St. Patrick's Day at least to be kept as holiday seekers would like to keep it.  I think we should leave it, as the Minister for Justice patriotically put it, an open question for the public houses, because we know very well that the Irish people like what he knows is going to be the result.</P>

      <P>I want to oppose this amendment, and I do so because I do not agree with the principle which seems to be underlying most of the arguments of those in favour of it &mdash;namely, that it is necessary, if people want to enjoy themselves, that they should have recourse to intoxicating drink.  I do not agree with that.  It is something we should mark our disapproval of.  People can, and do, enjoy themselves without indulging in intoxicating liquor.  The whole argument for the amendment seems to be based on the contrary supposition.  We should all agree, I think, that the National Festival should be honoured. The difference is as to how the Festival should be honoured.  To a stranger coming into the country, it will mark <Col N="299" /> specially the National Festival from all other festivals, excepting Good Friday and Christmas Day, if the licensed houses are closed on that day.  That would be the best way to mark the observance of the National Holiday.</P>
      <P>At the present time, a stranger coming into our country on St. Patrick's Day has no means of distinguishing that day, from the observances and practices round about him, from an ordinary bank holiday.  Deputy MacBride mentioned the difficulties about fairs and markets which are held on St. Patrick's Day.  I do not think it is right that there should be fairs and markets held on St. Patrick's Day.  In any case, that would be my solution of the difficulty.  A few years ago I know that certain places in which fairs were held on St. Patrick's Day arranged that they should be changed to other days.  I think no great inconvenience would be caused to the public if that were done.  It has been argued here, in favour of the amendment, that people going to play football would want a drink on St. Patrick's Day.  It is my experience that it is not the people who go to play football who want the drink.  It is their followers, generally speaking, or the people who use football matches as an excuse to go and get a drink.  It is not people who indulge in athletic pastimes who are usually anxious to get a drink when the games are over.  I think much good service would be done to the country, and to the fair name of the country, if this provision in the Bill for the closing of licensed houses on St. Patrick's Day is carried.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell has said something approaching the truth in regard to this question, when he refers to Gaelic games and sports of that description.  I had a little to do with Gaelic matters and with sport, in my time, and our difficulty was not to get drink for the people engaged in the games.  Our difficulty was to keep them away from it.  I never knew many good men on the playing fields who were allowed to take drink on the day they would be engaged in matches. A Deputy referred here to holiday seekers on St. Patrick's Day.  There <Col N="300" /> are not any holiday seekers on St. Patrick's Day.  Everybody must remember that St. Patrick's Day is on the 17th of March, and holiday seekers do not go out on a March day.  There is no such thing as holiday seekers going to the seaside and all that on St. Patrick's Day, and it is ridiculous to talk like that.  People talk about the observance of St. Patrick's Day from &ldquo;time immemorial.&rdquo;  How far does &ldquo;time immemorial&rdquo; go back? In my opinion, &ldquo;time immemorial&rdquo; means forty or fifty or sixty years.  That is as much as anybody remembers, and I think we all know the faction fights and drunkenness on St. Patrick's Day in those times.  That is what we want to get away from.  That was not the national tradition.  That was not handed down to us from &ldquo;time immemorial.&rdquo; We want to get away from those views.  We want, when we have regained our nationhood, to have the national festival the first day of the year.  The Gaelic League has been out for this, and it achieved a lot of good.  Every national organisation in the country has been out for the provision obtained in this Bill, and now we have men, perhaps not altogether disinterested, wanting to get back to the &ldquo;time immemorial&rdquo; stunt.  I think we can have too much of this &ldquo;time immemorial.&rdquo;</P>

Some of the Deputies know that in their particular counties it was nothing new to have a funeral or two funerals after St. Patrick's Day.  I remember the time myself, and I am not very old.

      <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke about the feelings of a visitor to Ireland for the first time on St. Patrick's Day, after the operation of this Bill.  I wonder what the feeling of St. Patrick would be if he could come back to Ireland after the operation of this Bill, because I have never discovered that St. Patrick was a teetotaller. I stand to be corrected by the Minister for Education.  I will willingly accept correction, but I know nothing in St. Patrick's writings to indicate that he was a teetotaller.  I do not know what he would have thought of this proposal, but I do know what Wolfe Tone would have thought about it.  He would have condemned it in more unmeasured language than Deputy Daly.  But St. Patrick was a Roman gentleman of Latin civilisation, and, based on that fact, there is every reason to believe that he drank wine with his meals.  I am not going to submit to the doctrine put forward by Deputy Gorey and Deputy O'Connell that to drink a glass of wine or beer with a meal is an act of drunkenness. Every civilised country&mdash;France, Italy, Germany&mdash;all except the United States, whose claim to civilisation in some respects is doubtful&mdash;has adopted that practice.  The Minister's proposal prevents not only a person going into a public house, but it also prevents a person who goes into a hotel for a meal from having a glass of wine or beer with that meal.  I cannot think that that is a reasonable proposal.  I bow to Deputy Gorey's authority on matters of sport, but in spite of what he says, there are a very large number of people who go away from home on St. Patrick's Day, and they do go even to <Col N="302" /> the seaside.  I live there, and I have seen them there.  Under this Bill, if this amendment is not carried, any man can get in a dozen of porter, or a barrel of porter, or a dozen bottles of whiskey, and stay at home and drink himself sick.</P>

In addition, I support it for the same reason that I support the Minister's proposal as regards Good Friday.  Good Friday is a day of mortification. Is St. Patrick's Day to be a day of mortification, too?  I am giving the proposal of the Minister in regard to Good Friday my support.  I will give way to him on that, even on amendment 19, but I cannot see the justification for including St. Patrick's Day in the same category.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment.  I absolutely repudiate the idea that because people in Ireland take drink in a measured manner on St. Patrick's Day we should have the name of drunkenness.  It has been suggested by Deputy O'Connell that a stranger coming to Ireland on St. Patrick's Day for the first time would be shocked at the intemperance in this country.  I think that a stranger coming to Ireland on that day and seeing <Col N="303" /> the people deprived of the right to have a drink on the festival of their patron saint would naturally have a very bad opinion of the Irish people.  He could only conclude that they were a people with such little regard for temperance that they had to be bound down by law to keep them from making brutes of themselves on their patron saint's day.  I have not heard of any country in which the people are not allowed to take reasonable refreshment on St. Patrick's Day.  It would be better if temperance advocates would take active measures to promote temperance on Patrick's Day and every other day by example and otherwise.  I believe that the use of drink in reasonable quantities on any day would not injure a man, but the sooner the people of Ireland are made to recognise that drunkenness is a vice and a leprosy and a disgrace to the country, the better it will be for Ireland.  I do not suggest that the public-houses should be open all day on the national festival.  I absolutely disapprove of it.  There are religious services in all the churches of every denomination on that day, and public-houses should not be open anywhere until these services are over.  If public-houses were open between one and six p.m., or two and six p.m., it would be reasonable.  But I object to it being stated that the people of Ireland have so little manhood that they cannot be kept from intemperance on their patron saint's day without bringing in legislation to prove we are the slaves that other people have thought to make of us for generations.</P>

If that section were carried I would be against the amendment. If it is not carried, it will leave the grocers in a very awkward position. Unless some legislation is brought in to change fairs and markets from St. Patrick's Day to some other day, it will be a great hardship on the grocers to have to close their business houses completely on that day.  In addition to that, St. Patrick's Day is one of the days of which farmers as a rule, take <Col N="304" /> advantage for purchasing seeds.  Most seed shops in the country are also public-houses, and this is a day which the traders look to for selling seeds. For these reasons, I would be inclined to support the amendment.</P>

If we are always to be concerned in this country with the opinions of the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; or people who are always libelling us, we shall not get very far with the legislation that we are seeking to effect.

I assume that everything the Minister puts into this Bill is something which is good and which he can stand over.  I assume, for instance, that the opening hours of 2 to 5 p.m. on Sundays in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford are something that he can give good reasons for and attempt to justify.  My attitude is that the same concession should be extended to St. Patrick's Day.  I am looking at it from the point of view that the people attending to the public in the public houses are entitled to enjoy themselves on St. Patrick's Day.  If the public houses are open on that day from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., I say that is not fair to the people engaged in them whether they be owners or employees.  But from what I have heard I am inclined to think that Deputy Gorey and those who are so emphatic in protesting against <Col N="305" /> this amendment would like all the people to get on their knees at 9 a.m. and remain on their knees until 10 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day.

    <P>The arguments used by some Deputies would seem to imply that the purpose of the Minister in including St. Patrick's Day was not to do reverence to the National Saint or to signalise the National Festival in some marked manner, but that upon this one day of all days in the year we should take special precautions to prevent our people from becoming victims to the influence of intoxicating liquor, no matter what happened to them on the remaining 364 days of the year.  Is this the only way to signalise the solemnity of this day?  I believe that the Government Party had a banquet <Col N="306" /> on last St. Patrick's Day.  I presume that on the coming St. Patrick's Day they will have another banquet, but if the Minister's proposal becomes operative it will be a banquet unique in the annals of that organisation.  It will be a banquet to which, perhaps, Deputy Gorey might be invited to be the principal guest, to give one of his beautiful dissertations upon real enjoyment: &ldquo;How I discovered the way to happiness at a coursing meeting.&rdquo;  This is a great religious festival, undoubtedly, but it is not merely a religious festival, unlike Good Friday.  I have been at celebrations of St. Patrick's Day in other countries, and when the day fell upon a Friday the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church gave a dispensation for the eating of flesh meat on that day.  Why on all days of the year should that have been done on St. Patrick's Day if we wished to carry out those inspiring ideals of Deputy Gorey, and mark it as a day on which all Irishmen, and Irishwomen, I suppose, refrain from anything that will give the slightest indication of gaiety or happiness?</P>

      <P>The question is not one of trying to get away from the abuses of St. Patrick's Day.  I think that we as a people have attained a stage of respect and respectful conduct on that day that will compare favourably with the conduct of any other people on their national festival.  Deputy Gorey's arguments would apply just as well to any other day of the year.  One Deputy said that we should conduct ourselves as self-respecting Irishmen on St. Patrick's Day.  I hope we will, and I hope also that we will do so on the other 364 days of the year. It does not follow that if there are facilities for reasonable consumption of refreshments upon that day we are going to lower the standard of self-respect and reverence for our patron saint that I think even Deputy Gorey desires to attain.  That, I think is the view it should be approached from, not from the view of the faddist or intemperate temperance advocate.  There are more ways of becoming intoxicated than by the consumption of liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> Some men can become inebriated by the impetuosity of their own fads.  We are out to discuss this on commonsense lines and we should get rid of the idea that the aim is a moral reformation in the character of our people on that one particular day of the year.  It is nothing of the kind.  The arguments that apply in that respect to that day apply equally well to any other day in the year, and if the arguments in that respect regarding the closing of houses can be sustained for St. Patrick's Day, then equally well can they be sustained for the other days of the year.</P>
    <P>The question of fair days in the country somewhat complicates the matter and brings in an issue which should be considered.  But I certainly agree with the suggestion of Deputy Corish, supported by Deputy Davin, that if regulations were made in regard to St. Patrick's Day similar to those made as regards Sundays it would satisfy the needs of the situation and would enable employees in these shops to have an opportunity of enjoying themselves as well as people who are otherwise engaged. I think the amendment is a sensible one, and I think however adamant the Minister may be in regard to the question of hours of opening, there have been sufficiently commonsense views put forward in support of this amendment not merely to secure that there will be no interference with the free vote of the Dáil, but also to secure that the Minister will immediately rise and say that he now wishes to support the amendment, having heard the profound wisdom that is on its side.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of the proceedings the Minister for Justice corrected Deputy McGoldrick in his reading of the amendment.  The Minister stated that if this amendment is passed it will leave St. Patrick's Day the same as an ordinary week day.  I am not prepared to support an amendment that would do that.  Neither am I prepared to support a Bill that will close houses altogether on St. Patrick's Day.  I think that if the hours were from 2 to 5, as on Sundays, it would satisfy the public, and I am sure it would satisfy those engaged in <Col N="308" /> the licensed trade.  You must remember that those engaged in the licensed trade are just as anxious to have an evening out, to have a holiday, as the workman who is free on that day.  Grocers' assistants, who are a hard-working body of men, are just as anxious to get off at 5 o'clock on St. Patrick's Day as the ordinary workers are to have the day off, and I would ask those who are supporting the amendment in its entirety to think of those who are standing behind the counter.</P>
      <P>I was a former member of the licensed trade, and, personally, if I had a house to-morrow I would not open it before 2 o'clock on St. Patrick's Day or after 5 o'clock.  I would be as anxious to get out myself, to bring my family out, and to let my assistants off to enjoy the day, as any other man.  I would ask those who are debating the amendment to have St. Patrick's Day like an ordinary day to consider that aspect of the question.  If this amendment is defeated, I would like to know if there would be an opportunity afterwards to move an amendment to the effect that the accepted hours for opening on St. Patrick's Day would be two to five.  If such an opportunity is given, I would have pleasure in moving such an amendment, and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment I suggest, namely, to have the opening hours on St. Patrick's Day two to five.</P>

      <P>I have an awkward habit of trying to apply an argument in respect of one thing to see how it will effect another thing.  I have heard all the arguments in favour of the free opening on St. Patrick's Day and applying them to the question of free opening on Christmas Day.  I have come to the conclusion that what Deputies desire is to make it a pagan festival and not a Christian festival. We all seem to agree that on Christmas Day public houses shall be closed everywhere: It is a day of rejoicing, and yet nobody claims that the only way to celebrate that day is by opening public houses, but that St. Patrick's Day is a day which can only be celebrated by the free opening of public houses, or, as Deputy Byrne says, opening for three or four hours.</P>

      <P>I realise the distinction, but I do not think the Deputies do.  I imagine they have in their minds Patrick's day, and it is Patrick's day they want to celebrate, and not St. Patrick's Day.  The case made on behalf of the assistants in public houses by Deputy Byrne applies with equal force to the whole day as it does to the few hours he mentions.  If it is to be a day of holiday the people employed in public houses want the whole day, and if they have not been taking the whole day in this city they intend to take the whole day.  Then the question was raised as to whether these houses which do not employ any paid labour should be free to open.  That, as Deputy Byrne knows, caused a good deal of heartburning in the city, and I dare say it will apply to other cities besides Dublin.  It seems to me that the case made for the amendment, on the basis that it is St. Patrick's Day, falls to the ground.  If you are going to make it a Christian festival and not a pagan festival, then let us have it marked by abstinence from free trade in intoxicating liquor, just as you agree that Christmas Day shall be so marked.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson was carried a little too far by his very logical mind.  Of course, the arguments used in favour of opening for a few hours on St. Patrick's Day quite apply to Christmas Day, but people do not run their business so strictly according to logic.  I would like to see all public houses closed for the whole day on St. Patrick's Day if the people were that way inclined, but I know that in the county I was brought up in the people on St. Patrick's Day flocked into all the country towns to do business and to enjoy themselves, and you cannot make people sober and temperate by logic or by too strict a law.  I think if we took the medium course it would be better.  There is not the same desire <Col N="310" /> to go into the towns and to have amusements on Christmas Day as there is on St. Patrick's Day.  Therefore, Deputy Johnson's arguments will not apply because the days do not mean the same thing.  I think if we take the medium course with regard to St. Patrick's Day, we would be doing good to temperance and would not be putting the brake too severely on the customs that prevail at present.  I am prepared to vote against the opening of public houses all day on St. Patrick's Day because there are several reasons against it.  The first is that there are religious devotions in the early part of the day, and then the assistants have to be considered, but I would limit the number of hours during which public houses may open.  I would vote for an amendment which would allow them to open from two to five.</P>

      <P>I felt with regard to this matter that to secure the object aimed at the matter should be discussed freely and voted on freely by the Dáil.  It would take something away from the effect aimed at if there was anything in the nature of a Party line, or of making it a matter of confidence in the Government or anything of that kind.  The object is clear: It is the one enunciated year after year by the Gaelic League, that inasmuch as intemperance was certainly in the past the besetting sin here, whatever different views may be held as to the present condition, that it would be well and wise and proper for Irishmen to mark their sense of disapproval of that, and their sense that they hoped to turn away from that by a complete closing on the national festival.  Now, there has been much talk here that it is not merely a religious festival.  I am aware that year after year it was customary to refresh the tender plant of patriotism in the local taverns, and it is just a question of angles as to whether that particular brand of patriotism, which needed to be so refreshed, was good for the country or had any great possibilities for the country. Remember to get the proportions of the thing!  You are dealing with one day in the year, one stretch of ten or twelve hours, and if we are that kind of soft people that cannot do without a thing, that cannot deny <Col N="311" /> themselves for ten or twelve hours to mark their sense of disapproval of the vice of intemperance, then no party machinery ought to be brought into play to help the thing.  If the Dáil, thinking plainly about the thing and voting freely about it, sees no point in a complete closing of public-houses on that one day out of the three hundred and sixty-five to mark its sense of national disapproval of intemperance, then I would not feel justified in making the thing in any way a party issue.</P>
      <P>Deputies talk as if there could be no enjoyment without drink.  It is a question of angle.  There may be three angles in this matter.  One angle is that the way to honour St. Patrick is by getting drunk, another way by keeping sober, and a third way by getting half-drunk&mdash;a kind of paying your money and taking your chance. I think we would best show our national self-respect&mdash;quite apart from the purely religious aspect&mdash;by taking the course of asking the licensed trade to close down for that day.  I am not doing that from any sense of thinking what outsiders, whether friends or enemies, would think of us, but from the sense of what we ought to do ourselves.</P>

      <P>I have not been much affected by the picture of that distinguished New Zealander who arrives here in Dublin to find that the country has gone dry for a period of twenty-four hours.  With regard to closing on St. Patrick's Day, several towns with which I am acquainted have voluntarily closed their houses on that day at the instigation of the Gaelic League, and I never found that there was anything to complain of either by the people of the locality or by the members of the licensed trade themselves.  I think that when that is so, there cannot be very much objection to making what is done voluntarily a matter of compulsion under the law.  For that reason I support the clause in the Bill that there should be total closing on St. Patrick's Day.</P>

I think I voted with the Gaelic League on all these occasions, and the licensed trade generally fell in with the idea.  It was not compulsory.  A few of them, perhaps, in the town in which I live, did keep open and violated that agreement, but, generally speaking, the publicans kept to the agreement in that area.  This question came up as a hardy annual at our local bodies.  I am going to vote against the amendment.</P>

      <P>The peculiar aspect of this amendment&mdash;I was going to say it <Col N="315" /> covers a multitude of sins&mdash;is that it covers several things and other topics of not exactly an identical nature.  The question of closing, or of differential treatment for certain days, enters into this, as does also the question of hours. My intention, when I tabled my amendment to delete certain words, was not to place Good Friday or St. Patrick's Day on the same plane as the other days of the week, apart from Sunday. It was rather to eliminate the consideration of those days and to bring about uniformity of hours on those days of the week, other than Sunday, and also to change the hour of opening suggested in the sub-section as drafted.</P>
      <P>On the question of hours, I am thinking not of giving greater facilities for the consumption of intoxicating liquor than the Minister proposes in his sub-section; but I am thinking of the peculiar conditions of the country as distinct from those of the city.  It is entirely misleading, entirely unconvincing, to say, as the Minister said a little while ago, that if from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. is adequate for the metropolitan area, then it should be adequate for country places, or some words to that effect.  I say that is begging the question and leaving aside essential considerations. The conditions in the city are essentially different from the conditions and the requirements in the country.  When I suggest to substitute the hour of 7 in the morning for 9, I am not concerned with whether or not that applies to the Metropolitan area or whether 9 is to be retained as the hour for that area.  I am concerned with the fact that it does not meet the contingencies that arise in the country districts, where there are fairs and markets on week days.  Men travel many miles, leaving home, perhaps, at 5 or 6 in the morning, to be at a fair in a town at 7 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, I contend, a question of giving greater facilities for over-indulgence to allow those men when they arrive after their long, weary, journey to get some kind of refreshments at 7 o'clock.  It would be only fair that they should get refreshments, even if they were all teetotallers.  Even if they were so disposed as Deputy Gorey, they would not be able to get a cup of tea <Col N="316" /> until 9 o'clock.  It is a matter of practical arrangement as to what hours suit the country as distinct from the city.  It is no argument to say that 13 hours constitute a reasonable period in which to allow the consumption of drink.  Is the Minister under the delusion that the citizens of the Saorstát have nothing else to do during those 13 hours than to consume intoxicating liquor?  One would almost gather that that was the implication he intended to convey.  Most men have a good deal more to do during those hours.</P>
    <P>The question of opening at the hour I suggest in the country need not, in any way, mean and does not involve, so far as I understand the outlook of the people and those in the trade, an extension of the licensing hours.  What I believe they would be prepared to do would be to close earlier in the evening in proportion to an hour or so that would be allowed in the morning.  If there is a time when the interests of temperance would suggest the advisability of closing, it is not in the morning but in the evening.  If you are trying to guard against intemperance the hour in the morning would be more suitable than the hour in the evening. I do not think, if any person went around to every country fair with a microscope, that even Deputy Gorey could discover a man under the influence of liquor at 7 o'clock in the morning.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of temperance; it is not a question of trying to provide additional facilities to pander to the craving for intoxicating liquor.  It is simply a matter of arranging practical procedure to meet definite and established requirements arising from the nature of the livelihood that the people of the country have to pursue, as distinct from the occupations and the contingencies that arise in the city.  I beg to propose the amendment that is tabled in my name.</P>

      <P>Probably some Deputies will be surprised and will open their eyes when I say that I am supporting this amendment.  A lot of play has been made about my name, but Deputies can make a joke about that and they are welcome to it.  I ask the Minister to take this amendment into <Col N="317" /> consideration as it applies to fair days. The use of the words &ldquo;market day&rdquo; conveys no sense.  Anybody who knows the country as we know it must be aware that it is almost every man's experience that he has to get up in the morning at 1, 2, 3 or perhaps 12 o'clock to journey to another town.  People in the country often get wet and they go into a town with their wet clothes on. It is well known that lives have been saved by men being able to obtain stimulants at an early hour.  The lack of stimulants at such a time would probably lead to pneumonia and probably death.  Everybody in the country knows those things.  That might be news to Deputy Johnson and to other Deputies, but it true all the same.  I would ask the Minister to make arrangements where early fairs are held to give facilities for early opening so as to meet what is certainly a human necessity.</P>

      <P>In the police district of Dublin Metropolis, the Chief Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner of police, and in any petty sessions district two or more justices of the peace in petty sessions, upon it being proved to his or their satisfaction that it is necessary or desirable so to do for the accommodation of any considerable number of persons attending any public market or fair, or following any lawful trade or calling, may, on payment of a fee of two shillings and sixpence grant (if he or they think so fit) to any licensed person in respect of premises in the vicinity of such market or fair or of the place where the persons follow such lawful trade or calling, an order, in this Act termed an `Exemption Order,&rdquo; exempting such person from the provisions of this Act with respect to the closing of his said premises on such days and during such time (except between the hours of one and two of the clock in the morning) and upon such terms as may be specified in such order.</P>

      <P>Deputy Milroy, in moving this amendment, has adopted a very favourite method.  He has used an argument which is likely to be acceptable. It appealed to Deputy Gorey, but the amendment does much more than his argument would lead to. I want to appeal to the House to reject this amendment on the grounds of shop hours&mdash;that it is undesirable to move in this direction which means an extension of the hours during which shops would be doing business in towns. Our tendency for quite a considerable time has been to reduce, rather than to extend, the number of hours worked in retail shops.  If this amendment is carried, it simply means that we are going contrary to the general trend and increasing the number of hours spent behind the counters&mdash;lengthening the working day and generally imposing upon the people engaged in retail trade, business hours far beyond the reasonable hours which have hitherto been thought desirable to encourage.  Deputy Milroy probably will answer that <Col N="320" /> if you keep the houses open for this time you will oblige the trader to employ double shifts, and thereby relieve the market.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Milroy takes that stand, he may get good support&mdash;but that is provided that he could ensure that that would be the effect of his amendment. If that would be the effect of his amendment, there might be a good deal to be said in favour of it.  If you could keep the shops open from 7 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night, and guarantee that the day would be divided into two and that there would be a double number of assistants employed, there would be something in Deputy Milroy's argument, but unless Deputy Milroy can adduce some evidence that that would be the result, I am inclined to the opinion that the real effect of this amendment would be to extend by two hours at least the number of hours assistants would be obliged to work in shops which sell intoxicating liquor.  I am opposed to the amendment on that ground, and I ask the House and those Deputies in the House who are interested in the hours of labour of working men and women to oppose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to support this amendment because, as I read it, it in effect includes the amendment that stands in my name, which is number 4.  The effect of this amendment, I take it, would be that the present hours would be continued in regard to Saturdays as well as substituting 7 o'clock in the morning for the proposed hour in this Bill&mdash;9 o'clock.  I think there is a difference between the amendment proposed by Deputy Milroy and the amendment proposed by Deputy McGoldrick in regard to the hour of 7 o'clock in the morning, because in Deputy Milroy's amendment it is not proposed that it shall be necessary for a licensed holder to make application to a district justice for an exemption order.  That, I think, is an important distinction, because not only, as Deputy Milroy has said, would it avoid any undue preference to one trader over another, but also it would do away with the inconvenience to each individual trader of having to go before a district justice upon the occasion <Col N="321" /> of each fair being held in the particular town.  That is a distinct inconvenience. Though it may be a matter of form in many cases, still the licensee has to make his appearance before the district justice and has to pay his fee.  I think the proposal contained in Deputy Milroy's amendment is a simpler and fairer one.  There is a great case for this, as is instanced by the fact that we have such a strong advocate of temperance as Deputy Gorey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment refers to every day in the week. Fair days are held during the week; therefore, it refers to fair days.  There is a great deal to support this proposal instead of traders having to go before the district justice.  Owing to the fact of the hour mentioned referring to every day in the week, it shall also include the days upon which fairs are held.  In regard to the question of early closing on Saturday, this amendment, like my own amendment, effects the purpose that there shall be no distinction between Saturday and the other ordinary week days.  I do not think that any special case has been made for early closing upon Saturdays.  If it is merely because certain classes of people have more leisure upon Saturday or, perhaps, more means at their disposal, I hardly think that it is just to presuppose that they will abuse those privileges and those circumstances. The closing hour used to be, I think, <Col N="322" /> 10.30 on Saturday evenings.  Then it was restricted, and now, in relation to the other days of the week, it is to be further restricted.  I think it is a very modest proposal that Saturday should be left alone with the other days of the week in regard to the closing hours.  It would only mean a difference of half an hour, and a difference of half an hour, especially in more or less provincial towns, where people come in from the country, perhaps late on Saturday evenings, and have to remain for a certain time to do the necessary shopping, would not be the means of promoting any great increase in intemperance. Therefore, I think the proposal to allow Saturday to stand in the same relation to the opening hours as the other days of the week is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has made great play with the idea that it would mean an extension of working hours.  The present working hours in licensed houses are from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m.  This proposal would not extend them, but would merely leave things as they are. The best solution probably would be, both in regard to the country districts and the cities, if the houses were opened at 7 in the morning and closed for two, or perhaps for three hours in the middle of every day, and in that way curtail the hours and also give a respite to the assistants and other workers.  That is not in the amendment.</P>

      <P>As amendment No. 8 has got to fit inside Deputy Milroy's omnibus amendment, I think I had better just briefly express the reasons why I put it down.  One was <Col N="323" /> that on the Second Reading the Minister challenged us to put our views into the form of amendments.  I should be very slow not to accept that challenge. Another was that up to the time I put it down I had not heard, and I have still not heard, any valid reason for early closing on Saturday night.  The only reason I can even imagine is the reason which I am afraid the Minister will put forward, that a man cannot go into a public house without getting drunk or half-drunk.  That reason I do not accept.  Men go into public houses for many reasons: for society, or because it is more comfortable than their homes.  Sometimes they go there to get away from their wives.  Unless you are going to adopt complete prohibition&mdash;if you are going to recognise the existence of the public house at all &mdash;there is no reason why a man should not have a drink as late, or later, on Saturdays than he should have it any other day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

      <P>Why later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he is not going to get up so early on Sunday morning.  Sunday is a day of rest. Therefore men can afford to stay up talking, playing cards, amusing themselves in many ways, on Saturday nights later than they could on any other night, and certainly later than they could on Sunday, as they have to be at work early on Monday morning. This is a justification for later hours on Saturday, the fact that work has not to be done on Sunday, and there is this additional justification at this time of the year.  I agree with the Minister when he said on Second Reading that we cannot legislate entirely for summer time, but at this period of the year it is still bright daylight at 9.30, or even at 10.  I read a book in the open air last Saturday night at ten o'clock.  That means that you put before the worker the choice of two things: a man may go out and work on his allotment or take the air in the Park, and he will not be able to have a drink on his way home if he stays out until the sun has gone down and it is beginning to be fairly cold.  On the other hand, he might go into a public-house as soon as he gets away from his work, at 7 or 8 o'clock, and sit <Col N="324" /> there until 9.30, under this Bill, and I am afraid that if you confront a man with the choice of taking reasonable exercise and reasonable fresh air and having one drink on his way home, or, on the other hand, having to forfeit any drink, I am afraid he will take the line of least resistance and go straight into the public-house.  I want to see that as little as the Minister does, and therefore I put this amendment on the paper.  I admit I put it on the paper feeling that it was an extreme proposal, and that I was quite prepared to meet the Minister half way on the lines suggested in Deputy Redmond's amendment.  But I can see no justification whatever for closing earlier on Saturday than on any other day, unless the doctrine is that the average man is a hopeless drunkard, and cannot be trusted to go into a public-house at all.  If that is so, the Minister ought to put forward prohibition.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Dáil to agree with the hours set out in the Bill.  I want to go briefly through them, and to measure the exact effect of an acceptance of those hours by the Dáil.  Every week day, except Saturday, the present hours are from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. in towns with a population of over 5,000, and from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. elsewhere.  The proposal is a uniform set of hours from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.  That will mean that the else-wheres will not close any earlier than at present on these five days, and that the towns with a population of over 5,000 will close one hour earlier.  In point of fact, Deputies are aware that the majority of licensed houses in towns with a population over 5,000 do close before 11 p.m.  Many of them close even half-an-hour earlier than the proposed closing hour in the Bill.  On Saturday what happens?  The Saturday hours at present are from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. in towns with a population of over 5,000, and from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. elsewhere.  Now, remember that the elsewheres are by far the bigger proportion of the trade, and they do not close any earlier on the five week days <Col N="325" /> other than Saturday.  They will not close any earlier under the Bill than they do at present, and on Saturday they have half-an-hour longer than they have at present.  Therefore, the net effect, so far as the closing hour goes, of the proposals in the Bill is that towns with a population of over 5,000 will close one hour earlier than at present on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and will close half an hour earlier on Saturday.  The remainder will close at the same hour on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and get an extension of half-an-hour over the existing hours on Saturday.  It is as well for Deputies to refresh their minds constantly by a glance at the Memorandum affixed to the Bill, because people are inclined to wax rhetorical and run away with false impressions about the Bill and its exact effects.  I have heard nothing in the discussion to convince me that there is anything unreasonable or anything unwise in these proposals. I am challenged to say why there should be any earlier closing hour on Saturdays than on any other day.  Evidently the legislators of the past saw some reason, and we ought to ask ourselves what it was.  Deputies who are from country towns know well that Saturday night is almost traditionally a more rowdy and a more disorderly night than the other nights of the week, and I submit that the explanation is obvious.  It is an unfortunate explanation. It is that the bulk of those who draw a weekly wage are paid on Saturdays, and a somewhat earlier closing on Saturday, if only for that reason, is advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that if the Deputy's suggestion were accepted, if that extra half hour which he seeks were conceded, that that particular half hour on Saturday night would be worth more to the licensed traders than perhaps two hours on any other night. That is an unfortunate fact.  Now, some people say it is very much a question for the individual.  Let the Government mind its own business. They might even prefix an adjective to &ldquo;business.&rdquo;  Really, if you develop that, it means that there ought to be no restrictions at all on the sale of <Col N="326" /> drink.  There should be a twenty-four hours' day.  That, of course, is a matter of angles again.  It might be one solution of the Irish question, but it is not a desirable solution, and the whole underlying thesis of this Bill, and of previous legislation on this matter is that this is a trade which needs to be hedged round with restrictions and with regulations; that it is not a trade like any other trade, like the butcher or the baker or the candlestick maker; that people have to be protected from themselves and from their appetites&mdash;their intemperate appetites. Otherwise we should leave the public houses open all night and let people drink themselves into St. John of God's or anywhere else they wanted to go.  If Deputies think that that should be the position then they ought to come out and say so.  If they admit that there is any case at all for regulations, then those regulations must be such as seem necessary from time to time in the changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have satisfied myself very fully that these hours are not unreasonable, that in fact they meet with general acceptance, no matter what the trade, which is well organised, very vocal and highly articulate, may say to the contrary. They are all well aware that there is nothing harsh or unreasonable in the proposals set out here in this memorandum.  The morning hour of 9 is, I think, quite all right.  I have pointed out that there is no change in the position with regard to exemption orders, but Deputy McGoldrick does not think that that meets the case in the towns.  There you have either muddled thinking or dishonest thinking. I will give Deputy McGoldrick the benefit of the doubt and say that it is muddled thinking, because he starts by saying: &ldquo;Look at the poor man who has had to walk 20 miles with his cattle to a fair; he has got drenched with the rain and is in danger of getting pneumonia and he is unable to get a drink.&rdquo;</P>

Either we are thinking in terms of the unfortunate people who may get wet coming to a fair or market and along the lines of their interest and the saving of their lives, or we are thinking in terms of the interest of the licensed traders of the towns.  Deputies ought not to try to have it both ways.  If we are thinking only in terms of the unfortunate people who have to come in early to sell their stock, then that position is met by Section 11 of the Act of 1874.  If we are thinking along other lines, then we ought to be quite honest about it and not try to put it on the question of the sad plight of farmers who come in early to a fair. We are either consulting the proper interests of people coming in early to a fair and in sad need of stimulants, or we are thinking in terms of the interests of the licensed traders of a town generally, and Deputies really ought to be quite frank and say which they mean.</P>

I seriously ask the Dáil to be a little impatient of special pleading on this matter, to be intellectually impatient of it, and to realise that arguments are trotted out here simply to say that there may be more minutes and more hours in the day for the sale and consumption of drink, but I submit that those extra hours and extra minutes which are sought are not reasonably necessary.  I ask the Dáil to say, too, that it recognises that the trend of public opinion in the country is not in favour of increased facilities, but, rather, in favour of decreased facilities for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  I know myself, I have said it on the Second Reading of the Bill and will deal with it again on Section 12, that the root of the trouble is that in the past honorary magistrates with no backbone and no moral fibre, cut a rod to beat the back of the community by catering in their shortsighted way for individuals.  Honorary magistrates trooped into the licensing sessions, magistrates who never turned up at the ordinary petty sessions trooped into the licensing sessions to carry, perhaps by a majority of one, a licence for their friends, with the result that you have in this State to-day 15,000 publicans' licences, meaning that there is scarcely enough trade to go around, scarcely enough legitimate trade to go round, and consequently you have this miserable little scramble for a half hour here and a quarter of an hour there, and the contention is seriously advanced that 13 hours are not long enough in the day for people to sell and to consume intoxicating liquor. Every Deputy knows that it is a long enough day, and every Deputy knows that it is a very open question whether it is not far too long a day, but before we make it any shorter we will have to deal with this question of the ridiculous <Col N="330" /> excess of licensed shops to the real needs of the country, and when we have dealt with that, I hope that this Dáil, or some future Dáil, will move on to further legislation in connection with this trade.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeated complaints have been made in this House on several occasions and questions have been asked about the depredations committed by foreign trawlers along the coast of Saorstát Eireann.  Promises have been made by the Minister that the number of patrol boats would be increased and the answers to questions, when the Minister was reminded of an odd trawler caught illegally fishing, were in neatly rounded phraseology to the effect that the evidence would be laid before the Chief State Solicitor with a view to the prosecution of the trawler masters.  I now ask him whether there has been any prosecution against any of these pirates, since the Ministry was formed, in Donegal.  Several have been caught, and sufficient evidence is available to sustain a conviction.  We in Donegal are of the opinion that the Minister and his Department are sort of Rip Van Winkles, who only wake up to the realities of the situation about once in every seven years.  These thieves are <Col N="331" /> closely watching where the local fishermen operate and, having carefully noted the spot, swoop down and clear the area of fish, and in addition ruin the fishing ground with their trawls. The unfortunate local men have to watch these pirates plundering the fish which they are entitled to, while they themselves are in absolute starvation, because they are unable to catch the fish owing to the operations of the marauding boats.  No effective control is being exercised, to prevent this piracy, by the responsible authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that at the present time there is only one patrol boat for the whole Saorstát coast-line.  How can it be held or established that one patrol boat is sufficient to control the operations of those thieving marauders?  The purse strings of the National Exchequer must, indeed, be held with a relentless grip when we cannot afford to provide a fleet of patrol boats to protect an industry which means millions of pounds to the country, in labour, transit, and in the provision of cheap, wholesome food for the people.  Inadequate fines when people were caught have been inflicted.  At Clifden, Co. Galway, on the 5th June, the owners of two French lobster boats were fined £10 each by the District Justice, but if some local person was caught making poteen he would have been fined £25 or £50. When these thieving pirates, who are taking the bread out of the mouths of the local fishermen, are brought up they are let off with a fine of £10. What do they care about a fine of £10 or £100?  They would make it in one haul in one night, and they simply laugh at the administration of the Free State.  The latest depredation of these boats has occurred off the Donegal coast line, in the vicnity of Burtonport where several boats were caught fishing the other night with their identity numbers and names carefully concealed by tarpaulins and with their lights out. About a month ago I brought under the notice of the Minister for Fisheries by a question the fact that two trawlers were caught off Malin Head.  There are a dozen men who are willing to give evidence about the incident, but nothing has been done.  Several trawlers have been caught off Donegal within <Col N="332" /> the last two years illegally trawling but no prosecution has been taken.  We want to know what the Minister and his department are doing for the amount of money which they are getting from the State.  As the hour is late I do not wish to delay the Dáil after a wearying day, but I deemed it my duty to bring up this matter, which requires, and should get, more careful attention from the Minister and his Department than it is getting.</P>

      <P>I do not regard Deputy White as bringing forward this matter by way of censure on the Department, but rather as a motion of censure on the marauding pirates. Wherever you go around the coast you find that the fishermen are incensed at the illegal methods of the steam trawlers.  Even in County Dublin I find fishermen in Skerries and Lough Shinny complaining that when they went out line-fishing for the night&mdash; fishing with long lines attached to a buoy&mdash;and laid their lines, they often discovered when they came back next day that they had been swept away by steam trawlers, and so they lost buoys, lines, hooks, fish and everything.  I believe that on one occasion the Ministry was informed, and through the operations of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; a prosecution followed, but that was not a sufficient deterrent.  Is it not possible to supplement the service of the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; in some way?  So long as there is only one fishery protection cruiser it will be impossible to stop illegal fishing, as people will watch her, know her movements, and will fish in areas where they know she is not likely to be.  Every additional boat which you put on fishery protection service lessens that possibility, and makes protection more efficient.  We cannot have an unlimited number of boats like the &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; and I suggest to the Minister, though I am a man who has no special knowledge of the sea, in fact I am very much at sea when at sea, that coastal motor boats might be used in such cases. There were, I believe, a number of such boats in the service of the State at Dun Laoghaire about a year ago.  I do not know if they are still there, or what <Col N="333" /> has happened to them, but I think it would be worth while buying a fleet of half a dozen of such motor boats. These might not be available for high seas, but as a rule these trawlers do not fish in high seas.  It might give greater sense of security to the fishermen if they knew that they could call on help directly instead of telegraphing to Dublin for the services of the &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; which might be hundreds of miles away.  I hope that the Minister will not lie down under the Ministry of Finance and that he will continue to fight this issue, as he will find that there is a large and very earnest body of public opinion behind him.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. F. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should rather welcome this discussion, because it raises a matter about which I feel very keenly myself&mdash;the fact that we have not a sufficient number of patrol boats around our coast.  I hope this discussion will strengthen my hands in my arguments with the Ministry of Finance.  We have only one boat to patrol the whole coastline of the Saorstát. It is, of course, a joke to think that that would be sufficient.  It is not sufficient, and could not possibly be, and even though the captain and crew of that boat work very hard and do what they can, it is absolutely impossible to deal with the amount of illegal trawling which is going on all round the coast.  Scotland for its fisheries has five fishery cruisers, as well as&mdash; under statutory obligation, I think&mdash; a British Admiralty boat specially detailed for conserving Scottish fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here the latest Report of the Scottish Departmental Committee on Scottish Sea Fisheries.  In addition to the five they have already, this report recommends that there should be five more auxiliary vessels and that a faster and more efficient Admiralty vessel should be put on the service. That means that they want to have eleven effective vessels.  We have only one.  I asked last year for at least one more.  I thought I was going to get three or four of those patrol boats that were under the Ministry of Fisheries. That did not materialise.  In my first Estimate this year I did not ask for one <Col N="334" /> because the legal position was not sufficiently clear.  I have not got sufficient satisfaction from the law department that even if they were caught a prosecution would materialise.  I have since gone to the Ministry of Finance and estimated for a boat, and it is being favourably considered.  During the year ending on the 31st May the Ministry received thirty-seven reports of what might be called too general a nature as to the presence of steam trawlers inside limits.  No action could be taken as essential particulars were not available in order to enable us to prosecute.  In the same period there were forty-two cases where trawlers were detected illegally fishing.  That means they were detected illegally fishing, with sufficient proof that they were.  Of these forty-two actual detections, five were convicted.  In most of the other cases proceedings were allowed to lapse owing to legal questions or Constitutional issues being involved. That was a thing I mentioned before when the Supplementary Estimate came up here.  Cases upon cases were being sent to the Law Department and no decision could be got from them, in spite of all our protests in the matter.  Deputy White mentioned a recent case where a couple of French or Belgian lobster boats were fined only £10 by the District Justice at Clifden. I could not order the District Justice to inflict a greater fine.  It has been very hotly contested in this House that the District Judge is a judge the same as any other judge, and is not responsible to the Executive or any Department for his actions in any particular case.  He forms his decisions according to the evidence that is put before him.  If he says £10, £10 has to stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister in the event of the Treasury or the Minister for Finance not providing sufficient patrol boats, that he provide the local fishermen with rifles and ammunition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that might cut in a different way.  I have on certain occasions asked for rifles and ammunition, but not exactly for that particular purpose.  That might bring us into serious trouble.  It is a matter, of <Col N="335" /> course, for the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence.  I agree that no effective patrol of the coast can be done unless we get at least one more boat.  The old &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; now the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; is very well known to the poachers.  When it is seen on the horizon they clear outside the territorial waters and the by-law limits. When it passes in any given direction they feel themselves safe because they know that there is no other boat that might also come along and catch them. For that reason I welcome the motion. I am absolutely in agreement that the coast cannot be patrolled and that fishing beds will be marauded as long as we have not at least one other fishing cruiser.  For that reason I rather welcome the discussion, and I welcome it because I hope it will strengthen my hand in the case I have put up as strongly as I could to the Minister for Finance to at least give me one more boat, if it cost £30,000 to build and <Col N="336" /> about eight or nine thousand pounds per annum to keep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister to bear in mind that we are living in the year 1924.  In connection with trawling within the limits, there are probably comparatively few grounds where this will apply.  I suggest to the Minister that he consider with the Ministry of Defence the use of seaplanes or aeroplanes, as distinct from motor boats and additional patrol boats.  I think it will be found that they will be much more effective, very much quicker, and they could not be evaded if they were running in conjunction with the &ldquo;Helga&rdquo; and coast watchers.</P>
