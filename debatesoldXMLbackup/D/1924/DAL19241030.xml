      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what is the principle followed in allocating revenue received from the Motor Vehicles Tax, and to ask, further, for a return showing (a) receipts by the Department of Finance under this heading from each county for the years 1923 and 1924; (b) payments made to each county for the years 1923 and 1924.</P>

      <P>The sums collected in respect of Motor Vehicle Duties are payable into the Exchequer under the Roads Act, 1920.  The payments into the Exchequer, which amounted during the years ended 31st March, 1923, and 31st March, 1924, to £126,000 and £395,500, respectively, are made in bulk from the Central Motor Tax Account from time to time, without regard to allocation between counties.  Sums equivalent to the Exchequer receipts in respect of motor vehicle duties are issued out of the Exchequer from time to time in bulk to the Road Fund.  The administration of the Road Fund and the distribution of grants therefrom are within the province of the Minister for Local Government, to whom the Deputy should apply for any information he may require as to the apportionment between counties of the receipts of the Motor Tax Account or the grants issued out of the Road Fund.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the National Bank, Limited, pays income tax to the Saorstát Authorities for business done in Saorstát Eireann, and, if so, if he will state why Saorstát investors have to apply to the British Treasury for refund, which necessitates great delay.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. As regards the second part, the National Bank, Limited, being registered and controlled in Great Britain, all its shareholders (including Saorstát shareholders) suffer British income tax in respect of their dividends, and it is obvious that claims for repayment in respect of such tax must be made to the British authorities.</P>

It was made in good faith and on grounds which appeared to be sufficient.  I regret that it was unsatisfactory, and that I am not in a position to reply to-day.

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to him on the subject of the 17th July last.  On that date the matter was also under consideration by the Loughrea Rural District Council, and the following order was then made:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ask local Labour Organisation to again consider the question of the wages for which they are prepared to carry out the sewerage scheme, and inform them that unless they agree to a reduction in wages to a figure to be approved of by the Council and the Ministry, the carrying out of the proposed works must be indefinitely postponed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The opening of an Exchange at Athenry has been sanctioned, and the work will be carried out on an early date.  It is proposed to erect trunk line circuits to Tuam, Roscommon and Castlerea, and to establish Exchanges at these towns during the current financial year if sufficient subscribers are forthcoming to justify the expense which would be involved.</P>
      <P>Owing to the amount of skilled work necessary in connection with the extension of the telephones and to the limited engineering staff available, the development of the system throughout the country in any one year must necessarily be restricted.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Mrs. Brigid McElligott, Serial No. 99, Droichead Nua Labour Exchange Office, who has over one hundred stamps to her credit for the years 1920, 1921, and 1922, after signing the Unemployment Register for ten weeks, was informed that her claim could not be traced; that she then got notice to attend a Court of Referees in Dublin on October 16th, 1924, at her own expense; and whether he will have inquiries made with a view to payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that Mrs McElligott, of Droichead Nua, lodged a claim to unemployment benefit at the Department's local office on the 30th July last.  The claim, which was forwarded to Dublin for adjudication in accordance with the usual procedure, was lost in transit.  A duplicate claim was constructed in due course, and submitted to the Court of Referees for a recommendation as to whether the <Col N="466" /> applicant was available for work. Having considered the circumstances of the case, the Court came to the conclusion that Mrs. McElligott was not available for work, and accordingly recommended that her claim should be disallowed, a recommendation which has been accepted by the Insurance Officer.  The claim accordingly remains disallowed, but it will be open to Mrs. McElligott to make a fresh claim as soon as she can show that her circumstances have changed and that she is available for work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy means what are the circumstances that have led to the decision that she was not available for work, on which the claim was disallowed.  That refers to a particular section of the 1920 Act, a portion of which was held in suspense by the 1924 Act, and in connection with which suspension many claims were put in.  A number came from married women who had been at one time in the category of industrial units, and an inquiry was ordered into the circumstances of these women.  A number of test cases were arranged; Mrs. McElligott's case was one of these test cases, and it was found that she had not been in the category of an industrial unit for many years, and was not likely to come into that category again.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil views with apprehension the state of the country owing to the long continued unemployment of many thousands of men and women, and the failure of the Government to adopt effective means of finding useful work at a living wage for willing workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies may think that this motion is a hardy annual.  It is, and it will be a hardy annual until such time as there is no necessity for such a motion. Every Deputy agrees that the unemployment that exists in the country at present is a very serious thing.  I recognise that the Ministry look upon it as being very serious.  The President said about 12 months ago that it was one of the things that had taken up most of the time of his Ministry.  At that time, he said that anyone who gave any thought to the question of unemployment knew that it was due to the conditions that existed in Ireland during the last eight or ten years.  He also said that it was due directly to the European War and to the civil war that took place here subsequently.  The <Col N="468" /> President also added that the conditions for trade and commerce, generally, prior to the European War were fairly stable, and that people had an incentive to invest money that they have not at the present time.  We admit that a good deal of unemployment is due to the European War and to the civil war that took place here when there was a curtailment of transport following interference with the railways, and that as a result industry was tied up.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I would like to say that there has been unemployment periodically in all so-called civilised countries during the last hundred years. Most people did not understand or did not appear to pay any heed to what caused it.  The people, who were the victims, appeared to accept unemployment as a matter of course.  Prior to 1914, as records prove, for 60 or 70 years in all European countries, including Ireland, and also in the United States, there were periodic bursts of unemployment. They were not looked upon seriously, because the results were not so bad as they are now.  Unemployment was taken as a matter of course, and the people never thought that it was the duty of Governments to try to relieve this condition.  Because the people were content to accept that view, Governments and politicians were quite willing to acquiesce.  For the last dozen years or so, however, wage earners particularly, as well as small farmers, are commencing to think, and are beginning to realise that they have a right to a decent living in the country in which they were born.  I do not blame them for that.  Most people in this country who have any civic or social spirit encourage them in that outlook.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, at the Catholic Truth Society's Conference last week&mdash; I say this with all respect to the President, who stated yesterday, when referring to the housing question, that a gentleman who spoke at the Conference did not know much about the matter&mdash; there was a lot of talk about the rights of the people.  One of the gentlemen who spoke there, Dr. Byrne, said, when referring to the sacrament of matrimony, that God made the world for man and made man for Heaven.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> In regard to the latter, we are not going to go into it, but a lot of unemployed people in this country are quite in agreement with the former statement that God made the world for men and women, and that he made Ireland for the people of Ireland.  The present generation who are in the ranks of the unemployed have come to realise that God made Ireland and the resources of Ireland for them as much as for any other section, and they want a Government, representative of all the people, to take whatever steps are necessary to give them an opportunity of indulging in some of the good things that can be got in this country.  We agree beforehand that the Government has done something to relieve unemployment.  It brought in an Unemployment Act recently, and that Act was certainly better than no Act at all, but it does not go nearly far enough to meet the needs of the people.  Some of the Deputies on my right may laugh.  It may be a thing to laugh at, and, I daresay, it is a thing to laugh at, from the point of view of people who have not to line up outside the labour exchanges to get what is commonly called the dole.  People line up, day after day, at the labour exchanges, but at the end of a week or two find that they have drawn what they are legally due, and they have to look ahead to months and months during which they can draw nothing.  When they realise that they have little children at home hungry, it is no laughing matter for them.</P>

      <P>There is a great opportunity of doing something to do away, for a while at least, with unemployment, and that especially applies to <Col N="470" /> the roads.  The Government certainly have given something towards the improvement of the roads of this country, but we claim that they have not done much either for the interests of the people needing work or for the interests of people who require to use the roads.  The Postmaster-General stated, in the early part of the year, that he was expecting, owing to the Tailteann Games and other events, something like 100,000 visitors to this country.  Many people think that the best thing Ireland could do in order to exist would be to turn itself into a country that would cater for foreign visitors.  There is such a body as the Irish Tourist Association, and we read every day about the great future that is before the country, provided we can induce a lot of tourists to come here.  These people say that you would never get them to come unless you have good roads to enable them to travel in something like decent comfort. The roads in the South and elsewhere are not in as good a condition as they could be.  In spite of the money granted by the Ministry of Finance, these roads are not such as would induce any foreign visitor, going over them, to make up his mind to return in other years.  In asking that money should be expended on the roads, we believe that not alone would it help to relieve unemployment, but it would also help to enrich the country in a way that many people think desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say one or two things about the policy of the Local Government Department regarding the roads and unemployment.  At the time that this money was made available, the Minister for Local Government instructed the County Councils that the Finance Department was willing to give money, but, in return, it wanted to get good value for the money expended.  The Minister for Local Government instructed the different County Councils as to how they could get the best results from that money. I would like to refer to Cork, and the reason I refer to it is that I am more concerned with it than any other county.  Recently a visit was paid to that county by the chief Roads Inspector for the purpose of looking at <Col N="471" /> the roads, and he made a report, which has been laid on the Table of the House regarding the condition of the roads, stating the reasons why they are bad, and he suggests how better value could be got from the money expended upon them in the future.  I claim that the report made by that inspector is not a fair one, and it does not tend to improve the conditions of the wage earners in that county. Neither does it tend to make for greater employment in the future.  He goes on to state that there is not as good value given in return for the money expended through the direct labour system in County Cork, as there might be, and he winds up by stating that in future they should give the roads out to contractors rather than allow them to continue on present lines.  I know that when Mr. Quigley was in Cork he got invitations from people to inspect roads in the county. I wrote to him from Millstreet, asking him to look over certain roads in that area, but he did not attend to either of my invitations.  He saw individual farmers, members of the Cork Chamber of Commerce, and members of the Motormen's Association, and he got their views.  He had a run over a few roads, in conjunction with the three County Surveyors, and his report is based on the little information that he got there from a very hasty run over. In connection with one road, which he was invited to inspect, but did not, £135 was given last year to a contractor. Some people in the district say that the contractor did not work six weeks in the year, while some more generous people put it down at most as thirteen weeks.  That would make out that for himself, a jennet and a cart, an average of £10 a week was spent.  The condition of that road is so bad that children going to school at one point have to take off their boots and walk barefooted over it, because if they kept their boots on they would have to remove them later as they would be soaked through.  This particular road is not mentioned in the report.  If it had been looked over, as it should have been by the inspector, <Col N="472" /> it would have been condemned, and he would have come to a decision other than that which he did come to.  I admit that in some cases the direct labour system is not the best from the point of view of improving the roads, and in some cases also from the point of view of giving employment.</P>
    <P>A few months ago I approached the chief Roads Engineer, and asked him to give personal attention to the condition of the roads in one Rural District in County Cork.  These roads were not inspected to my knowledge when he was down there, and no attempt was made to inquire into the allegations concerning them, and how the £5,000 for this district was allocated or spent on these roads for the last year.  There are thirteen sections.  Some sections have a ganger and one or two men; in some cases there is a ganger and one man employed for about six months in the year.  The ganger, or section foreman, as he is called, simply walks about with a shovel across his shoulder, and he does very little work.  In one case £147 was expended on a section of a road, and the foreman or ganger carrying a shovel on his shoulder, got £107: one man employed as a day labourer and the other as a carter, received £40: that is, £40 was spent on the making of the road, and £107 on the supervision of the making of it.  Under these conditions good value could not have been given.  I think the chief Road Inspector, seeing that I approached him four months ago, and he said that he was paying a visit to the County Cork in the near future, should have looked into some of these cases.  The instance I have given is typical of the roads in Millstreet Rural District, and if he had investigated these particular roads even in a superficial manner, the report he made would have been different.  We do not want, in asking the Government to give money grants to relieve unemployment, to get this money for nothing.  I, and every member of this Party, would be very pleased to see good value given in return, and we would like that the Local Government Department, when they make a grant for roads, would see that the money is spent properly, and that there is a good return given for it.  At the <Col N="473" /> same time, we think that they should not be too quick to condemn one system and to bolster up another.</P>
    <P>The direct labour system, in County Cork at any rate&mdash;except in that area I have spoken of&mdash;is far better than the indirect system.  In proof of that, I would like to say that last year the farmers in Macroom area, to the number of about 200, signed a requisition, and sent it to the Rural District Council, asking them to put all the roads in that rural district under the direct system, for the good reason, as they said, that there was a certain amount of money allotted to these roads, the most of which they would have to subscribe, and they wanted to get decent value for that money.  About a fortnight ago the Council met again, and they were so satisfied with the value they got for the money expended in the past 12 months, that they have scheduled all the roads in that district for direct labour.  That is to come before the County Council in January next.</P>
    <P>With reference to unemployment, it is very hard to determine the number of unemployed.  At present no official figures are published&mdash;at least they have not been published lately.  And the figures when published do not let us know the exact position.  Last October there were 43,000 men and women registered as unemployed in the Saorstát; in November the number was 35,000, and in December 34,000.  At the beginning of a new year, for unemployment purposes, there is always an influx of men and women to register at the exchanges in the hope of getting something, and when they find they are not entitled to benefit, then the number who register is very much decreased. This year, in the third week of June, there were 26,000 registered, and in the fourth week 48,000&mdash;a jump of 22,000, simply because in the last week in June another year started for the purpose of administering unemployment benefit.  Since then the number signing on has been reduced by 22,000. That does not mean that this number has found employment; it simply means they have ceased to draw benefit from the Exchanges, that they find no reason for signing on at these Exchanges when they get no benefit, and when <Col N="474" /> there is no possibility of the Exchanges getting them employment.</P>
    <P>We know that this is a poor country, and that the Government is always saying they have no money to expend over and above what they have already expended. President Cosgrave on the 14th December last&mdash;and I would like it to be taken into consideration&mdash;said that we have not the right to consider the methods that were used in other countries to relieve unemployment and improve trade, such as inflation.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have not got a right to consider that.  We have made no great sacrifices, and we have got nothing to show why we should disturb a very serious credit situation.  In other countries on the Continent what we take as a pound standard is worth only 6s. 8d.  We cannot do that.  We have, in the first place, no National Debt.  The ten millions we have borrowed is a National Debt, and in good faith it must be returned in the form in which it was borrowed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have there President Cosgrave's statement, that we have no National Debt.  I would like that fact taken into consideration by the Deputies and by the Government when they are considering the advisability of getting money for constructive purposes, and giving to the unemployed in this country the opportunity to work and to live. In moving this motion I would like to say that I am quite willing to accept Deputy Cooper's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second the motion, and, in doing so, I would like to say that we quite candidly admit that unemployment in a more or less acute form exists in every country in the world, due to some extent to the great war.  But, after all, the population of this country is very small, and I submit that this Government and the Dáil should be able to provide work for all the people.  We are faced with a very serious position. One of the most serious points in connection with unemployment is not alone the great hardship which is caused by unemployment to people and <Col N="475" /> their dependents, but that there is, as I suggest, as great a loss to this country on account of the people who are fleeing out of it&mdash;young, fit, and enterprising people&mdash;because they cannot get employment or live in the country. They are going to America and other countries, and, as my friend, Deputy Nagle, suggested, notwithstanding the thousands of people who even this year have left, there does not seem to be any reduction in the numbers of unemployed. Notwithstanding the grants given by the Government, there seems to be a steady increase in unemployment. As the Deputy has pointed out, the figures published by the unemployment insurance people give no real indication as to the amount of unemployment. The bulk of the workers are engaged in agriculture, and are not insurable; therefore, we have no indication of the amount of unemployment that exists in that industry.  We know that it must be very great, running into thousands, especially this year, because it has been an exceptionally bad year for agriculture.  The result is that the farmers are not in a position to pay men to work.  Consequently there is a disappointed hope which is leading to despair on the part of the workers. They have been expecting day after day, especially for the last three years since they got their own Government, that something would be done to try and give them a chance of earning a livelihood in their own country.  These hopes have been disappointed, and that has led to a certain amount of despair. I submit that despair is a very dangerous element in any section of the community, and must eventually lead to trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of every section of the community and the duty of Deputies here to do what they can in order to solve this big problem of unemployment. This matter, as Deputy Nagle has said, has been brought before the Dáil so often that it has come to be looked upon as a sort of hardy annual. We, and the people whom we speak for, do not look upon it as a hardy annual. We, who are daily in touch with the want, the misery and the wretchedness <Col N="476" /> that is in the country, know the conditions that prevail.  Apparently, very few Deputies here have any real knowledge of, or regard for, those conditions We who have that knowledge come here, and we think it is our duty to ask the Government to endeavour to deal with this question in a big way&mdash; to grapple with it in a big way.</P>
    <P>The remedy for unemployment here or elsewhere is not unemployment insurance. The remedy for unemployment is not the granting of £2,000, £10,000 or even £1,000,000 for road reconstruction. That is merely a sop, and it gives employment for one or two months; but there is no lasting effect either for the country or the worker.  To my mind, the only one way to solve the difficulty is to start proper works of reconstruction, and the Government should make an effort to develop industries in the country.  If they do that I have no doubt whatsoever that they will have the co-operation and the support of every section of the community.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cooper's amendment is being accepted by the mover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add after the word &ldquo;workers&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and especially regrets the unemployment caused by unnecessary strikes due to lack of unity among Irish Trades Unions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the mover of the amendment, I should like to ask leave of the Dáil to amend it in one minor particular, and that is to omit the second word &ldquo;especially.&rdquo; I think, perhaps, that word &ldquo;especially&rdquo; tends to give a wrong focus to the problem.  It is a very large and a very serious problem.  I know undoubtedly that the unnecessary strikes that have taken place within the last six months or so have-been but one factor; yet they have been the chief and predominant factor.  I would ask leave to amend my amendment by omitting the word &ldquo;especially.&rdquo;  It would then read: &ldquo;and regrets the unemployment caused by unnecessary strikes, due to lack of unity among Irish Trades Unions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment down not in any partisan spirit, because in confronting <Col N="477" /> a tragedy such as this unemployment is, to approach it from a partisan angle, would be out of place and wrong.  I can assure Deputy Morrissey that there are very few Deputies here who have not some idea of the extent of this tragedy and the hardship caused by it.  If they will only read their letters they will have.  Day after day you have the appeal: &ldquo;Get me a job of any kind.&rdquo;  You have also letters from men who are working on short time and who ask: &ldquo;How can I live on what I am being paid?&rdquo;  To my mind, there are many men who would be glad to have even a short time job.  I think that every Deputy is fully impressed by the extent of the evil and its consequences, because the consequences are very serious.  When a man is unemployed for a long time he loses all hope, and he becomes a bad citizen.</P>
    <P>I put down my amendment because it seems to me that it is altogether wrong to place the responsibility for dealing with this question on the shoulders of the Government alone. Not only in labour circles, but in many other circles in the country, the impression is prevalent that the Government ought to do everything.  We are told that the Government ought to attend to this, that, and the other.  I think that when we begin to think for ourselves, and not leave everything to the Government, we shall make much better progress.  Until we do so we shall not make very great progress. Some blame, no doubt, rests on the Government; but some blame also rests on the employer, though I do not propose to follow the President into the &ldquo;Old Curiosity Shop&rdquo; in search of metaphors.  I think there are some employers who have failed to realise the seriousness of this problem.  Some blame also rests on the workers themselves. You cannot place the responsibility on any one set of men.  Everybody concerned in industry, and everybody concerned in the country at all, must share the blame.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Dáil to consider the state of Dublin within the last six months.  In the year 1759 Horace Walpole wrote to a friend of his and said: &ldquo;You have to see the <Col N="478" /> papers every day for fear of missing some victory.&rdquo;  In the year 1924 the Dublin citizen has to see the paper every day, or otherwise he would not know what particular strike was on. Deputy Nagle talked about his motion being a hardy annual.  There was a time when the Dublin strike was becoming a hardy weekly.  Let me recall some of the strikes.  First, there was the gas strike of six months ago.  That differed from some of the other strikes in that its origin was what may be called a legitimate strike.  That is to say, the company requested the man on being promoted to a certain grade to resign from his Trade Union.  It may have been held that it was a strike for the recognition of the Trade Union, but it very soon got out of the hands of the Union altogether.  The Union advised the men to return to work, and a settlement that was moderately satisfactory was suggested.  It was that the man should not get the new grade, but that he should get the increase of salary.  That was accepted by the Union, but the men would not accept it.  Heaven knows what the men went on strike for.  I do not know. The strike went on, causing unemployment and great public inconvenience mainly to the wage-earner.  That included the black-coated wage-earner, clerks and others.  Nobody could get gas.  The strike dragged on purposelessly, pointlessly and uselessly.  What followed?</P>
    <P>There followed a strike at Marino, a strike which had no connection with any matter of principle whatever and it was not a dispute between employer and employed.  It was a strike simply because the men of one Union said they would not work with the men of another Union.  It was a strike directed against public utility and directed against the housing of the working classes.  It was a strike which had collateral consequences in causing considerable unemployment amongst skilled workers who were members of Unions that were not concerned.  I know the Labour Party in the Dáil will not try to justify that strike; they have too much wisdom.  While a spirit exists to enable a strike like that to <Col N="479" /> spring up and prevent it from being settled&mdash;because it dragged on for weeks and months&mdash;there is bound to be unemployment.  You cannot avoid unemployment under such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Then there was the strike at Inchicore. There, again, there was no question of employers or employed, no question of wages and no question of the recognition of Unions.  It was simply because men belonging to one Union could not agree with men belonging to another as to who were to do a particular class of work.  If ever there was a case in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce might have been asked to arbitrate&mdash;a case in which some outsider not directly concerned could very easily have intervened in order to settle&mdash;that was one. Instead of that there was useless rhodomontade.  Men were picketing, and they were threatening ex-National Army men who went to work.  In the end the strike was another complete and hopeless failure.</P>
    <P>There followed the present strike, the one we still have in the Fish Market. Again there was no question of wages involved; it was simply a question of whether one man was to continue in one Union or join another.  For that the Dublin fish-trade has been held up for about a month now.  The fishermen at Howth do not go to sea, and a certain amount of inconvenience has been caused to city hospitals and public institutions. There is no end to the strike yet, and there is no hope of an end. Those are the four principal strikes on which I make my case.  I do not include the municipal workers' strike, because though it was highly blameworthy under the circumstances, and though it was an attempt to hold the community to ransom at a time important for the welfare of the country, still it was a strike for what may be regarded as a legitimate object&mdash;it was a strike against an attempt to lower wages.  I do not include that in the indictment.  The other strikes I refer to were pointless and fruitless.  Nobody is the better for them; thousands are worse.  If that kind of thing is to go <Col N="480" /> on, as it appears it will indefinitely, what hope can there be of a revival that will lead to employment?</P>
    <P>Deputy Nagle talks of roads.  Roads are a stopgap, and they are the means of employing unskilled workers in times of great difficulty.  But they are not productive works.  They are works that will give long employment, but presently the work will be done and will come to an end, and the men will be discharged.  You cannot give employment in the country on the principle that you are to go on repairing roads and repairing more roads.  In order to give employment you must get the industries working.  At present no industrialists will come into the country because there is no will for peace amongst the workers, and, to a certain extent, the will for peace does not exist amongst the employers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather off the point of my argument.  I am dealing with the actual causes of industrial conflict.  They may not have done all that Deputy Davin says they should do, but they have not concerned themselves with fomenting strikes.  There is this prospect in the country&mdash;that you can never tell when a strike is going to start.  There was one the day before yesterday in the Tivoli Theatre.  You never can tell what trivial incident will create a strike, and when a strike begins it would appear as if no one wants to settle it.  In other countries half those strikes would be settled the day they began.  Here they drag on because of the want of will to face the fact and to recognise the fact.  I am not a believer in compulsory arbitration.  I do not see how you can work it, but I do think there is something to be said for an Act such as is in force in Canada, which was really passed by the present <Col N="481" /> Premier, Mr. MacKenzie King, which forbids a strike for a month, during which time it is investigated by an impartial Government authority.  This authority issues a report.  Neither side is bound to accept the report.  The report sets forth all the facts in the case impartially, and this is published in the Press, and the public is enabled to form an opinion on the merits of the strike before it comes off.  I hope that the Government will consider that legislation with a view to seeing whether it would be advisable to do something of the kind.</P>
      <P>As I say, this is not really an issue for the Government.  A Government's main duty is the preservation of peace and security; we have a right to call on the Government to do that, and that, on the whole is done.  But can we not get this fighting bacillus out of our system somehow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Our only hope really of getting permanent peace in employment in this country is for the employers and employees to come together and stop this really senseless strife which is ruining the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The motion of Deputy Nagle is, I think, a very important one to every Deputy in the Dáil.  The amendment by Deputy Cooper is, perhaps, of lesser importance, because time will arrange any difficulties that may exist in the labour ranks.  The lack of employment in Ireland is a matter that every one of us, who has the interests of the country at heart, deeply deplores.  The Deputy has suggested failure on the part of the Government to provide the employment that would be necessary. Perhaps if the Deputy had used another word it would be more appropriate.  If he had said &ldquo;the inability of the Government&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;failure of the Government&rdquo; it would be a <Col N="482" /> better phrase.  Because no matter how the Government tries to do a certain work in this country, unless the people of the country help the Government to achieve that, no Government can do it, because it would be trying to do the impossible.</P>
      <P>One of the great causes of unemployment in Ireland is the fact that we have no industries here.  The unfortunate disputes that have taken place in Ireland between Capital and Labour are one of the causes why capital is not being invested in industrial projects in Ireland.  I was speaking a very short time ago to one who is connected with a very large industry in America.  I asked him would he not see his friends when he returned and ask the men who had developed these industries in America whether they would not start a branch of the industry in Ireland.  It was not a question of treading on the ground which had been taken up by other Irish industries, because this was practically a new industry in Ireland. Well, when he got to America he saw his friends, and he wrote to me last week.  His letter was to this effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Well, I would be very pleased to invest money and to give my experience in connection with this industry in Ireland, but I would not invest my life's earnings, and give my life's experience to start an industry, until I was fairly certain that that industry would not be interfered with in any undue manner by strikes promoted without due consideration or without cause.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that there is a good deal of that trouble here in Ireland.  I fear that this lack of regard for the development of the country, on the part of both employers and employees, is to a great extent the cause of our trouble. They refuse to see it and to recognise that the interests of both are absolutely combined.  That often occurs.  The blame is, certainly, to be attached on many occasions to both sides.  There are employers who not alone want a good satisfactory dividend for the money they have invested in the concern, but they want to get a profit out of it which is far in excess of what they should get.  At the same time they want to lower the workmen's <Col N="483" /> wages below the minimum wage.  Such a thing should not be possible.  The workman has got as good a right to live in this country as the employer. I quite agree with Deputy Nagle that he has a right to be paid for his labour as well as the employer has a right to get his dividend, whether the employment is on a farm or in a factory.  But no one man or set of individuals has a right to trade on the advantages the other possesses, either in capital or labour.</P>
    <P>There is no right by which any man should make a profit out of his business in excess of his competitors in other countries because he forces an enlarged labour market down below a living wage.  That is not just to the worker.  Unfortunately, these strikes exist and these struggles have been going on in this country.  In the past the strike might have been necessary for the workers, because their conditions were not anything like what they are latterly.  It was necessary when men were amassing large amounts out of industry and when the workers were compelled to live on wages which were not sufficient to support the men and their families.  The working classes are now in a position to safeguard their own interests.  The employer has his money and his industry, but if there is a strike those who have their money invested in the industry affected suffer.  The workers' money which has been accumulated is expended on strikes, and no value whatever is given to the country.  The manufacturer loses his trade connection which he had been making for years past.  If he locks his workers out he is certain to be at the loss; if they strike they are certain to be at a loss, and whether it is a strike or a lock-out the country has to suffer; industry has to suffer, whether it be that of the manufacturer or of the farmer.</P>
    <P>A year ago I suggested in this House tentatively, for the consideration of Deputies, a certain course, and I put it now again before them in the hope that it will be received and considered.  I believe there should be arbitration in <Col N="484" /> all these cases.  But I believe there is no necessity for compulsory arbitration. I do not see why what was done in New South Wales in 1899, when the Government there was empowered to set up Arbitration and Conciliation Courts, should not be done here.  I do not like the word &ldquo;compulsory.&rdquo;  In that I agree with Deputy Cooper, and I would much prefer that the people would see that in the interests of the country all disturbances, whether by strike or lock-out, are bad for the future of the country.  I wish every member of the Dáil would look at the matter from that point of view.  We are sent here by our constituents to look after their interests, and it is up to us to take any steps to promote that end.  Every Deputy in the Dáil, quite irrespective of the party to which he belongs or on what side he sits, has a duty to labour for that end.  These strikes are an evil.  The very points put forward by my American-Irish friend as a reason for not investing his capital here are a solid reason.  He wanted to be certain there would be no immediate strikes.  It is necessary, on the other hand, to safeguard against lock-outs which have driven numbers of employees to England and other places, instead of being engaged in the development of this country and looking after its interests.  Perhaps we are not in a position, at the moment, to develop new industry.  There may be difference of opinion about subsidising certain industries as instituting a form of protection.  That is a question outside that before us now, but one point is clear: there is a great amount of unemployment in the country at the present moment, and it is up not only to the Government, but to every member of the Dáil to make that unemployment less.  I say if capital and labour will come together and recognise the fact that they are the component parts of a great machine, and that if they do not work in harmony the country cannot be in any sense prosperous, a great step in advance will be made.  These two must recognise that this is their country, that they both have the right to live in it, and that the only way they can safeguard the interests of their own <Col N="485" /> section is by each having due regard to the interests of the other section.  There should be no opposition between these two sections in the country.  Our interests are all in common, and we must see things from that viewpoint if we are to look at them in the interests of the nation as a whole.  I believe that is the spirit of the members of this Dáil, and I hope any remarks that I have made will be received in that spirit.  I hope that the Government will authorise, or that they will ask the Dáil&mdash;I prefer they should ask the Dáil and get the views of the Dáil&mdash;to set up Conciliation Boards and Arbitration Courts.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to labourers and farmers in the country, and I know that they are very keen upon these Arbitration Courts.  I know the case of a creamery in our district in Tipperary, where for the past five years there has been an Arbitration Board in existence. The representatives of the Transport Union, Mr. O'Doherty, on behalf of the men, met the representatives of the farmers, when there was a dispute, with the result that for the last five years there has been no serious dispute in connection with that enterprise.  When the dispute first arose it was left to arbitration.  It was settled by an Arbitration Board, and ever since then that Arbitration Board has been in existence, and has dealt satisfactorily with any disputes that have arisen.  That is a case in point.  I could give other cases, but there is no need to dwell upon them.  Every effort should be made to put an end to those trade disputes that arise in Ireland, and the way to do that would be to have them gone carefully into by a board representative of workers and employers.  I believe if the Government were asked by the Dáil to set up such courts that the whole feeling of the country&mdash;employers and employed, merchants, farmers, labourers and all&mdash;would be behind them.  I have never heard any opposition to it.  I have heard no objection to it from people on the Farmers' benches or people on the Labour benches to whom I have spoken.  I never heard any objection raised to the views propounded by Deputy Bryan Cooper in favour of the action of Mr. <Col N="486" /> McKenzie King in Canada, and of the Parliament of Australia many years ago.  If these courts were set up, it would lead to the successful working of industry in the country, it would cause those who left the country to return with their capital, and it would induce people who have capital to invest it, because they would feel that they had security for the money they invested.  In that direction success lies before us.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to consider carefully my views on this matter, and the suggestions I made twelve months ago.  I have, for perhaps ten years, been acting on these lines with a good deal of success. If these boards are set up, a good deal of the cause of unemployment will be ended, capital will be attracted to the country, and industries will be set up in the country.  I ask Deputies who may speak on this subject to regard my views as non-party views.  I have not been in consultation with the Government. My views are the views of a lifetime.  I ask Deputies to consider them in an unbiased, and as favourable a manner as possible, because I believe if the real economic development of Ireland is to take place, it is absolutely necessary that both employers and employees should make every effort to prevent the possibility of the recurrence of disturbances that have taken place in the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>The question now before the Dáil is: &ldquo;That the Dáil views with apprehension the state of the country owing to the long-continued unemployment of many thousands of men and women, and the failure of the Government to adopt effective means of finding useful <Col N="487" /> work at a living wage for willing workers, and especially regrets the unemployment caused by unnecessary strikes due to lack of unity among Irish Trade Unions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Motion moved by Deputy Nagle.  He has pointed out, and rightly so, that road-making is the only immediate way to relieve the unemployment we have in the country to-day.  He has pointed out, too, that if we have good roads in the country, they will help to attract tourists to it.  The tourists who came to the country this year complained bitterly of the roads, while an inspector who was in the County Cork lately complained that there was no adequate return given for the amount of money that had been expended.  I do not agree with him, because this was a very abnormal year as far as the roads were concerned.  The roads would, say, be put into perfect order to-day, and perhaps in a week's time a flood would come and destroy all the work that had been done.  I would just like to add a word to what Deputy Nagle said&mdash;that when the roads of this country were designed you had no motor traffic.  You had not the vehicles and conveyances that tourists were able to provide themselves with this year, and that we expect they will have next year, except they get aeroplanes. At the time the roads were designed we had nothing but donkey-vehicles in the country.  The designers of the roads did not care how many dangerous corners they left on them. It would be an advantage&mdash;in fact, it is almost a necessity for life-saving from the point of view of tourists and others&mdash;if these dangerous corners which we find on roads throughout the country were immediately removed. Their removal would create much employment.  We know that such employment is urgently needed this winter, after what I might describe as the failure of the potato crop in the present season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that adds to unemployment: that is the cost of living. If we are to have employment, and if, as some people suggest, that the labourer <Col N="488" /> is to meet the employer, I hope that the obstacle of the cost of living will not be put before the labourer as a fence that he must jump over before he can meet the employer.  I suggest that the cost of living should be reduced.  There are many things under the control of the Government the cost of which could be reduced. My experience of the Government during the past year has been that wherever it was possible for them they always gave employment.  I am sure that during the coming winter they will do their best to give a helping hand to create more employment. Their eyes must have been opened to the necessity of providing more employment in the country.  As Deputy Nagle pointed out, there is, unfortunately, only one way to give more employment, and that is in road-making. We cannot build up mills; in fact, we do not want to build them up because we have them falling down all over the country.  Therefore, we must adopt other means of giving employment to the people, and at present the only way to do that is to have road-making works undertaken.  It is a pitiful state of affairs to think that we in Ireland have no better hope of providing a living for the people than by making roads over which the foreigners will spend their superfluous money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I desire to say&mdash;in this I think every other Deputy in the Dáil will agree with me &mdash;that it is generally a pleasure to listen to any discussion in the Dáil in which Deputy Cooper takes part, because on nearly all occasions he says something that is helpful.  This is, perhaps, the only one occasion that I have ever listened to him speaking on an important motion, such as this is, on which he has not made anything that appears to me to be in the nature of a suggestion out of the difficulty. His contribution to the solution of this great problem appears to be, on the one hand, to relieve the Government of their responsibility in the matter and to try to magnify the position by referring to things that have, as a matter of fact, been looked upon as past history.  The very wording of the <Col N="489" /> amendment which the Deputy has put down is not correct, and I hope that, as it appears on the Paper, Deputy Cooper did not put it there in a deliberate way.  The Deputy, in his amendment, states that he regrets the unemployment caused by unnecessary strikes due to lack of unity among Irish Trade Unions.  That is not so, and it should not be stated by Deputy Cooper unless he supports it by some facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, it is necessary to explain to Deputy Cooper what a Trade Union is.  The Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party is a body that is composed of a number of constituent organisations, and the Union that has been the main cause of the trouble in this case is only one of the many Unions, but perhaps the largest Union, that is affiliated to the Congress.  A dispute has arisen in one Union because an individual who is well known to Deputies of this House and to the country has made himself promiment by his many foolish actions and by the many foolish things he has said. Disunion has been caused within that Union because that particular individual would not be allowed to dictate to the general body of the members. The Union itself, of course, is an organisation of a number of men controlled by an Executive or by some governing body.  A Deputy on my right tells me that I will be in <i>The Irish Worker</i> next week.  I believe I have appeared in the columns of that journal before, so that I am not very much concerned whether I appear in it again or not.  When an individual, who assumes to be the leader, or presumes to be the leader, of a Trade Union organisation, refuses to accept the instructions of those who pay him and goes out into revolt against that particular organisation, I think he cannot claim to be any longer the leader of that Union, and cannot be treated otherwise than as a dictator to the mob.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it has been necessary for a section of the members of a particular union to get involved in disputes which lead to the disorganisation of industry, I <Col N="490" /> say quite frankly that it is very regrettable, but I say Deputy Cooper should, in all fairness in this matter, recognise the fact that that dispute has been confined to one particular union, and not to the huge number of unions that are affiliated to and are part and parcel of the Irish Labour Party and Trades' Union Congress.  Therefore, to that extent Deputy Cooper's amendment misrepresents the actual facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us go away from that aspect of the case.  I hope it is the last we have heard of misrepresentation of that kind, both here and outside.  Deputy Cooper starts off by laying down his main argument on the unfortunate dispute that took place with the gas workers.  Deputy Cooper was cute enough not to express an opinion upon the attitude of the employers in that particular case.  I wonder would Deputy Cooper tell the members of this Dáil and his constituents of County Dublin, many of whom are workers, that he regards it as the right of employers to dictate to their workers as to whether or not they should join a Trade Union.  If Deputy Cooper would enlighten his constituents upon that matter he would give both myself and his constituents very useful and valuable information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I refuse to recognise the right of any employer to dictate to an individual as to <Col N="491" /> whether or not he should belong to a Trade Union, or to refuse him the right to belong to a Trade Union. The employers themselves are members of employers' organisations, and of many other organisations, and they would, I am sure, and as Deputy Cooper knows quite well, resent the interference of their workers in their right to join any organisation they may choose to join.  That is so far as Deputy Cooper is concerned.  I have only again to express regret that this is the one occasion in which he has intervened in which he has not made some useful contribution to the solution of this very important and dangerous problem.  The seconder of the resolution and Deputy D'Alton considered that the Government should take some steps to develop the industries of the country in order to create more employment.  It is quite true, and I am sure we will hear it from the Minister who is responsible for the Department of Industry and Commerce, that the Trades Loans Act is now in operation and that the Government has made arrangements through that Act whereby business firms, individuals, corporations and co-operative societies can procure money in order to develop industries.</P>
    <P>What have we to face on the other hand?  In this matter I am speaking from personal experience, from what I know of many cases that have come to my notice in the last three or four months.  I know for a positive fact that there has been a deliberate attempt on the part of the five principal banking institutions in this country, most of which have their headquarters in England, to undermine the credit of this State, and in the most dangerous way to prevent the development of industry. That is, I presume, the answer of the banks and of the capitalists of this country to the Protectionist policy of the present Government.  One particular case has come under my notice quite recently where a firm has been working on an overdraft from the bank.  The bank in this particular case, as other banks have done in other cases, endeavoured to force the firm into liquidation, while they knew quite <Col N="492" /> well that if the firm realised, and realised even at a bad time, they would pay more than £10 in the £.  What is the explanation? I ask Deputy Good and Deputy Hewat, as speaking for the banks, what is the explanation of that attitude of the banks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer, Sir, is that I do not believe a word of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to solve the question of unemployment, and if industry is to develop, there is more than the human factor in it, so long as the capitalist system prevails in this country. Deputy Hewat may say he knows nothing about it.  He says he knows nothing about it.  I can say that he knows enough about the people whose interests he represents in this House&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood him.  However, I put it to the Minister that a serious situation is developing at the present time owing to the anti-State attitude of the Irish Banking institutions and something will have to be done if industry is to be developed in this country.  The Government, either officially or unofficially, must stay the hand of these very dangerous people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of unemployment and the justification or otherwise of wages disputes.  When people who can claim to represent the capitalist interests or the employers' interests in this Dáil come into this House as they have done, and as I am sure they are prepared to do in the future, and endeavour to justify their attitude towards strikes where labour disputes arise out of questions of reductions of wages, I ask them to look at the question from the point of view of the position at the present moment with regard to the cost of living.  Employers and business people must admit that the cost of living is going up.  What are they doing on their part to keep it down?  They are asking trade unions in this country to agree to reductions in wages.  What have they done to <Col N="493" /> control the cost of living or what method have they to suggest to the Government to deal with that particular situation?  I suggest that the cost of living, whether it goes up or down, has a good deal to do with the living conditions of the people and a good deal to do with the wages of the workers in the different employments, and also disputes that are continually taking place.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Alton has referred to the question of arbitration, or conciliation machinery for the settlement of disputes. Personally,&mdash;and I am only speaking personally in this matter&mdash;I would not agree to the setting up of any kind of machinery that would surrender the right of the workers to strike, if they thought fit in the end, and I must be quite honest in this matter.  I believe that conciliation boards and arbitration boards&mdash;but not of a compulsory nature&mdash;render very useful service and prevent strikes from taking place in numerous industries and in innumerable cases, but it is only where you have a spirit of give-and-take on both sides that machinery of that kind is any use.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of Conciliation Boards&mdash;I am not going to say Arbitration Boards&mdash;but I have sat on Boards on the other side of the Channel, and I must candidly confess that the spirit of the employers on the other side of the Channel is quite different from what it is on this side.  You have a selfish spirit ruling every section of the community here, and nowhere is it more than amongst the capitalists and the profiteering classes.  Where you have that selfish spirit, especially amongst employers, there is very little use for the machinery of either Conciliation or Arbitration Boards as a means of settling disputes between employers and employees in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, I am afraid the Deputy has either misinterpreted me intentionally or he did not understand what I said. I did not refer to the question of compulsory arbitration.  I objected to it. I said that it should be the last thing. <Col N="494" /> I said that the feeling of the country, of both the worker and the employer, was that these Courts should be established. The strike should be the last thing but I never suggested depriving the workers of the right to strike when necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not misinterpret the Deputy because I recognised he was generous enough to express himself in that way, but I am speaking from experience, and I am sure every Deputy on this side of the House can speak with the same experience.  I speak as one who sat for weeks and months on Conciliation Boards where endeavours were being made to bring about agreement between one side and the other. You may talk for weeks and months, but it is only when the weapon of the strike is introduced&mdash;and I agree with Deputy D'Alton that it should be only used as a last resort&mdash;it is only when that weapon comes to be used that the people on the other side of the table listen to you with any kind of consideration or with any disposition to give the workers proper treatment.  Therefore, I would not surrender the right to strike on behalf of the workers, while at the same time I would welcome the setting up of Conciliation Boards to settle the problem, but not in a compulsory way.  I believe there are many industries where it is working as a success, and wherever it can be used in that direction it will be welcomed by both the workers and the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the statements made by Deputy Bryan Cooper.  As one who does not belong to the Union that is largely involved in the regrettable disputes that have taken place, I have felt that there has been too much silence on the part of the people in other unions in regard to the misrepresentations on the whole question for some time.  The Press has lent itself to this matter in the same way as Deputy Cooper has misrepresented the facts here to-day.  So far as I am aware, and I am sure my colleagues who are in the Transport Union here, will agree, I have yet to learn as a member of a constituent body of the <Col N="495" /> Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress, that the Transport Union either controls or dominates the labour movement.  At any rate, if that claim were put up I would be one of the first persons to dispute its right to do one or the other.  Many commissions have been set up by the Government, and reports and recommendations sent forward which, if put into operation, would go a long way to deal with the question of unemployment in this country.  We are face to face&mdash;and I am not speaking as a pessimist, because I am not a pessimist&mdash;this winter and next spring with the hardest time the people have ever had to face, and I say it would be good policy on the part of the Government to borrow, if necessary internally, whatever money is necessary to employ the largest number of men on work of a useful nature&mdash;work that will give some return for the money expended.  The men or women who are driven into the ranks of the unemployed, whether in Ireland or in any other country, are by reason of the fact that they are on the unemployment list, driven into the ranks of the revolutionary movement, and while we may have Army trouble, and internal trouble in the Government, there is no trouble greater than the trouble created by the growth of unemployment in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather afraid, listening to the tenor of the last three or four statements that have been made, that this House might accept the position that the prevalence of strikes in Dublin for some time past is responsible for the unemployment that prevails all over the State.  Certainly I do not accept that position and I am sure the majority of my colleagues do not accept it.  We regret very much the incidents that have happened in Dublin for some time and for that reason we have accepted Deputy Bryan Cooper's amendment.  As far as I can see, it is not a matter in which one party ought to score off the other; it is a question that should be approached by every party in the common interests of the workers of the country.  To my mind what should be done is that a Committee should be appointed, representative <Col N="496" /> of every party in the Dáil, with a view to going into the matter exhaustively to find out what will be the solution of the terrible question of unemployment confronting this country at the moment.  I agree a great many people and many sections of the community, might be blamed because of the position we are confronted with, but I think that is really the only solution we can get at the moment.  I would like to know from the Minister of Industry and Commerce does his Department take notice, time after time, of the fluctuations that take place in the different trades and is he content with receiving reports as to the bad state of certain industries?  Does he send his Inspectors out to the different localities to find out what is the reason for this and to find out if the employers are really treating their workers in the way they should be treated?  I know of one particular industry in my own locality where agricultural implements are manufactured and I know that one of the factories engaged in that particular industry has had a very good season.  This last year they had the best season since 1918 and immediately after the season was over they threw the majority of their workers out on the streets.  I think this is a question that should be investigated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  From time to time I raised the question here of the Drinagh Cement Works.  Perhaps many of the Deputies have grown sick of the matter, but at the present moment that cement works is closed down again.  I do think the Government should make a serious effort to bring the Irish people to use Irish cement in preference to the foreign manufactures.  There are only two cement factories in this country&mdash;one in the Six Counties, and the other in my own constituency&mdash;and I think it is a disgrace to the country that the latter is closed down again.  That is responsible for the unemployment of sixty men, a small number in the huge number of unemployed.  If things like that are going to go by the board&mdash;and the Minister does not seem to take a serious interest in it&mdash;larger things will follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear, or we read, from time to time in the public Press that the <Col N="497" /> Government Party have a committee sitting to deal with the unemployment question.  I said at the beginning that this matter is so serious that it should not be a question that one party would play off against another, and I think that the Dáil is entitled to know if that committee has been appointed by the Government, and what its deliberations are; if it has gone into the matter seriously, if it is making interim reports to the Government, and if so, what is the nature of these reports. It is not a Party matter; it is a matter for the whole State; it is a matter for the representatives of every Party in the Dáil, and I put it forward seriously that it should engage the serious attention of the Dáil, that a committee should be appointed representative of every Party in the Dáil with a view to solving it.  Dealing with the question of strikes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that we read from time to time, and it has been stated in the Dáil&mdash;it was stated on the last unemployment debate&mdash;that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party had a committee appointed with a view to going into the matter of unemployment, and that can be found in the Reports. What I asked was, is this an official committee of the Government Party, and are they seriously dealing with the unemployment question; have they reported to the Government, and what is the nature of that report?  I do not think that is an unreasonable request.  On the question of strikes, Deputy D'Alton mentioned that he had been speaking to an American friend who stated that he could not see his <Col N="498" /> way to put any money into industry in this country in view of the unsettlement in labour circles.  Anybody would think that strikes are peculiar to this country, that there was no such thing as a strike in any other country.  I think that anybody who has the interests of his country at heart would not make such a statement as that in this House.  It is not in the interest of the country that such statements should be made.  As I said, only for the tenor of the statements made by the last few speakers, a person would think that it had been accepted by the House that unemployment was due to unnecessary strikes.  These strikes have only happened in one county out of twenty-six; we have unemployment in every county in the State, and it is not fair to say that they are responsible for unemployment.  I will again appeal to the Government to set up a committee representative of every Party to go into the whole matter in an absolutely impartial manner with a view to trying to solve this very difficult question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>While supporting the Motion I have been wondering whether any good purpose would be served by bringing it on.  We have brought this question before the Ministry on many occasions, and no later than last July we asked them to provide £1,000,000 to relieve unemployment. They gave us £250,000; that is now nearly all gone, and what are we to do during the coming winter?  Perhaps the Government does not realise the state of feeling that there is in the country, the feeling that the Government is not capable of governing as they should govern.  Are you going to leave the people starving right through the three or four hard months of the year, without making any attempt to provide for them?  We have no means locally; therefore we call upon you to provide at least £1,000,000 for unemployment, and something like a quarter of a million pounds to meet Unemployment Benefit for those who, from the nature of their callings, cannot work on any unemployment schemes, such as roads.  It is not a fortnight ago since I signed an order committing <Col N="499" /> a woman to a mental hospital, and her husband informed me that she lost her reason through brooding over the unemployment from which he was suffering. That is a startling fact, and it is only one of many that I could bring before the Minister.  I think it is the duty of the Government to get to work at once and bring in a Supplementary Estimate so that work could be started early in December.  By doing this they would in some measure restore the confidence of the people in them.  With reference to the want of unity amongst Irish Trades Unions, I think that it is not in the power of any section in this House to reflect on the unity of the Labour movement.  We are living in glass houses, and I think our unity can compare favourably with that of any other body in the country, and perhaps you will know more about the strength of it in the future.</P>

We also have a committee looking into the interests of farmers, a farmers' committee.  We have various committees.  As he knows, and as every Deputy knows, we have always declared when we faced the people that we were not a Party standing for any section of the community; we are a Party looking after the interests of every section, and protecting their interests.</P>

      <P>The question of unemployment is one that has confronted us since we came into the Dáil in 1922.  Unemployment is far worse now than at any time in the history of the labour movement.  The very slight attempt made by the Government a few months ago has not to any great extent helped. The Road Grant was a partial relief. It is now exhausted, and there is nothing for the unemployed workers to fall back upon.  In practically every county the men employed on the roads are now idle, and the alternative before them is starvation during the coming winter.  We heard nothing from the Government as to what is their intention in regard to grappling with the situation.  The Government may ask what we on the Labour benches would do.  I do not know if that is a commonsense question, but probably if we were in the position of the Ministry, and if we had the resources of the State at our disposal, as they have, we would be able to deal with the question without putting a burden on any section of the community.  The Government has not endeavoured to deal with it.  If some of the time wasted by the Departments and by the Government formulating Bills was used in bringing forward Bills dealing with the economic and industrial problems that confront the country to-day, we would be in a far better position and much more prosperous. I believe from my experience that the Government can legislate politically in a fine way, but in industrial matters they are a hopeless failure. That is the position as I look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the President was bringing in the Housing (Building Facilities) Act he said that it was one of the means of relieving unemployment.  The Minister for Local Government stated yesterday that something like 1,300 houses had been erected under that Act in the Saorstát.  I do not know where any of the houses are.  Probably applications for grants or loans have been <Col N="501" /> received, but the erection of houses has not started, nor have foundations been laid, as far as I know.  There is no use making false statements here.  I do not know in my travels where the houses are.</P>

I am not familiar with the Deputy's constituency, but from reports of my inspectors I am in a position to say that work has started on practically 1,300 houses in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume I may accept that statement, as probably the Minister is aware of what Deputies are not aware of.  I was going to ask the Minister for Local Government what powers he had under the Housing Act to compel county councils to fulfil the conditions with which they have to comply so far as it applies to loans under that Act.  I was in Deputy Lyons' constituency last week, and having consulted with a great many people, small farmers and others, I discovered that Westmeath County Council had refused to give loans or grants to subsidise any building schemes.  I would like to know if the Minister has power under the Act to deal with such a situation.  I am sorry Deputy Lyons is not here, as he is a prominent member of the County Council, and might be able to enlighten me.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the importation of building material.  I am in possession of correspondence that I had with the Minister for Finance about the importation of Portland stone for the reconstruction of the General Post Office.  That was going on, unknown apparently to the Ministry of Finance, until they received a communication from me.  At first I received a very strong reply denying that any such thing was taking place, but three or four days later another letter reached me admitting that such was the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the question with the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that we have many quarries in Ireland. <Col N="502" /> One limestone quarry that I quoted to the Ministry has been working for the past twelve or thirteen years at Ard-bracken, County Meath.  It is only something like eighteen miles from Dublin, and it is known throughout Ireland for the class of material that is produced there.  The people who control that quarry made representations to the Ministry of Finance with a view to getting orders to supply material for the reconstruction of the General Post Office and other buildings, but they were not recognised.  There was not even a reply to their communication. At the same time, while they were making representations to the Department, material was being imported, and a large number of workers here were going about starving.  I do not think that is a sound policy for the Department, and I think it should be stopped immediately. Deputy Good, no doubt, will deal with that when he speaks about building materials.</P>
    <P>The agricultural workers are in as bad a position as the road workers, and those engaged in the building trade. I have not seen any attempt made to deal with the situation so far as these workers are concerned.  It is not strikes, as one would be led to believe here, that have caused unemployment. In the county I come from, there has not been a strike for two years, and yet the conditions are as I have described.  The last strike we had was one of only eight or nine days' duration. Although the men have been loyal to them, the farmers in that county considered it advisable, at the approach of winter, to dismiss them and let them walk about hungry. Probably the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would suggest some means of dealing with that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not know that what I suggest would appeal to the Minister, as it is very hard for a suggestion from this side of the Dáil to have any weight. I would suggest a revival of the flax and linen industries, so that our mills might be put into working order again, and that large numbers of our people who are emigrating might be kept at home.  Some attempt should be made <Col N="503" /> to grapple with the unemployment that exists in agricultural districts.</P>
    <P>A Second Reading was given this week to a Bill for the improvement of the quality of cattle.  That is not a remedy in County Meath.  I am tired looking at cattle in that county and tired looking at the unfortunate workers walking about idle.  That Bill will not be a benefit there.  No cattle are reared in Meath.  They are brought from the south and west of Ireland and consequently no employment is given in the rearing of stock for beef or milk purposes.  If we are to deal with the situation that confronts us, I think a committee should be formed by the Dáil to go into it and try and find some solution of the present deplorable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Apparently the country could not exist if that system was not there.  I wish to say further that the Government need not think that they are going to have a happy or a smooth road if they are going to allow this state of affairs to continue during the winter months.  You have been dealing during the past few years with revolutions and trouble of all kinds which have cost the country something, and I for my part&mdash; and I can speak for every man who holds any position in the labour movement&mdash;assert that we cannot control the workers of Ireland, if by hunger they are forced to take any drastic action to remedy the state of affairs under which they are forced to live by our present system.  In 1918 when we had an election under the heading &ldquo;Sinn Fein&rdquo; we had practically every one of the men who are now on the Government benches going round and getting up on platforms and saying.  &ldquo;Vote for Sinn Fein and develop your industries; keep your young men and women at home and prevent them from emigrating.  Do the right thing at the polling booths. Every vote you cast means keeping the young men and women at home to earn their own livelihood.&rdquo;  Where is that policy to-day?  Was it merely a catchcry to get votes?  We were better off then than we have been during the last two years.  I would like the Government to give up these catch-calls, get down to business, and find some solution of this problem.  We here on the <Col N="504" /> Labour benches cannot get down to that because we have not the resources of the State at our command, but if we had command of these resources we could deal with the situation in a way that would hurt no particular section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>One has listened with a great deal of interest to the different speeches that have been made on this subject, and I would like to congratulate Deputy Nagle, who proposed the resolution in very moderate language and who put forward his views in a very sensible way.  I cannot, however, say as much for the other speakers on the Labour benches who followed him. Some of them, like Deputy Davin, were inclined to be very abusive of employers and everybody because this problem existed.  He attacked, I think, first of all the banks, which in his view were responsible for a great deal of the unemployment to-day.  Not so long ago in this Dáil we came to the conclusion that the banks were too liberal in granting capital to small shopkeepers, with the result that we had a large number of small shopkeepers, whereas we would be much better off if we had that particular trade concentrated among a smaller number doing a larger trade. He complained to-day that the banks were not liberal, and I think the argument one used in another connection about this race of ours being an illogical race finds a further example in Deputy Davin's statement.  He did not, as I said, satisfy himself with attacking the banks, but he proceeded to attack employers.  As one who has had some experience as an employer I can say that that is nothing new in this country; in fact I may almost say that we have become accustomed to it.  I would not refer to that fact at all but for the comparison which he made between employers on this side and those on the other side, and how different we were to the reasonable men with whom he had come in contact on the other side.  It has been my good fortune to have had the privilege of meeting and sitting amongst, for a number of years, a great many of the leading employers on the other side.  It has also been my privilege to sit amongst employers on this side, and I cannot say that I can <Col N="505" /> see the difference which the Deputy attributes to them.  I found there, as I found here, in these matters a desire to deal reasonably and fairly, but while I do not wish to make any attacks at all on Labour Deputies, I will only say that we were not always met in the same spirit.  If we had been met in a different spirit this country would not have the unenviable distinction to-day of having more strikes, in proportion to its population, than any country in the world.  Deputy Corish, who is always reasonable in putting forward his views, complained about what Deputy D'Alton had said with regard to what an American had written to him about employing capital in this country. If we had less strikes in this country I am quite satisfied that we would not have complaints about the absence of capital invested in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish complains of Deputy D'Alton giving voice to that statement, as in his opinion there was a possibility of it doing a serious injury to this country.  I am sure it is not the first time that Deputy Corish heard that statement in connection with this country.  On many occasions, when speaking to capitalists about investing capital in this country, I have been met with exactly the same answer, and I do not agree with Deputy Corish that it is better to keep these things quiet. I think the more ventilation that is given to that particular aspect of the question the sooner that particular grievance will be remedied.  There are many points in the different speeches to which one would like to refer, but no advantage would be gained in taking up the time of the Dáil in dealing with them.  I was, however, struck with the entire absence of any constructive proposal from anybody from the Labour benches whereby this problem might be dealt with.  They blame the Government.  Everything that happens in this country is put down to the unfortunate Government.  This is in common with everything else, and the last Deputy who spoke, possibly, was a little bit more outspoken than the rest when he said that if they were in power and had the powers of Government he was quite satisfied that they could deal with this problem.  We have <Col N="506" /> had a Labour ministry in power on the other side&mdash;I do not know whether it is in power to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>They have had this unemployment problem before them in a fairly acute form.  In one of the very last speeches by a leading member of that Government he made a statement to the effect that they were powerless to deal with this problem.  I think that will be the view of most people who have given any thought to this subject. We have too many people in this country who think that there is nothing beyond the power of a Government.  I have come to the conclusion, in my short experience in the Dáil, that there is not much a Government can do, and very little they can do thoroughly.  I am quite satisfied that this is one of the problems which this Government, like every other Government, will feel itself powerless to deal with.  This problem of unemployment is much bigger than many Deputies who have spoken on the subject would appear to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with only one particular aspect of it as it appears to me, to show that behind it there is a great deal more than appears on the surface. If you analyse the returns of the male unemployed you will find that they consist almost entirely of those who are called unskilled, and that amongst the ranks of the unemployed there are not many skilled, particularly in the building industry.  In that industry a very large number&mdash;in fact, almost the entire number of the unemployed&mdash;consist of unskilled labourers, and when you come to probe a little more deeply it will be found that, even while the industry is in a depressed state, there is practically no unemployment amongst the skilled workers.  At the moment in the Free State there is a considerable shortage in several branches of that industry.  That is the problem.  The number of unskilled are being added to every day, every week, and every year.  On the other side, you have an increasing demand for skilled hands, by reason of the reduction in hours, and other causes that I will not go into.  While you have this reduction in the demand for unskilled workers, <Col N="507" /> and this larger demand for skilled employees, that is a state of affairs that shows there is something more behind this problem of unemployment than attention has been drawn to.</P>
    <P>Other countries are better educated than ours, and one hopes in that connection that we will not be always as we are.  As I see the Minister for Education here, I would like to say that improvement in that direction is very slow.  I hope it will be quicker in the future, and with that I pass from that subject.</P>
    <P>Other countries have looked into the problem from the point of view I have just mentioned, with the result that they have watched these different departments where there is an increasing demand year by year, and they have in that way afforded opportunities to boys leaving school, instead of allowing them to drift, filling the ranks of the unemployed, and thereby becoming useless citizens and a charge on the country for all time.  They have put them into the different trades where work is afforded, and where they can lead useful lives, and earn good money. Has anything been done in that direction in the Free State?  This problem is getting worse year by year.  The shortage of skilled hands in the particular industry I am connected with, by reason of the fact that young men are not coming in to these particular trades, is, as figures will show, getting more and more year by year, while the number of unskilled which the trade is enabled to absorb is increasing, and the demands on the State are increasing year by year.  That is only one aspect of the question that ought to be inquired into.  To set up a committee to probe into this larger question is, I am afraid, asking them to do something that we ourselves cannot be expected to do, but the other, as I said, is an aspect of the question where they might do useful work.</P>
    <P>That is one of the causes of unemployment, and I hope to see something done with regard to it, I will not say in the near future, because Ministers object to the phrase &ldquo;near future,&rdquo; but at all events in the future, because <Col N="508" /> it is an aspect that ought to have our attention, and because I am satisfied, as one who has some experience of boys leaving our schools, that they are not getting the opportunity they ought to get.  Amongst the rising generation are some who possess talents that ought to be, and would be, most useful to the Free State if diverted into proper channels.  These talents are going adrift.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the question is that unemployment arises from certain factors in connection with industry. Let me give you an example.  I do not want to refer to the question of strikes; they are past history, but we have had a strike in connection with the shipbuilding industry in Dublin. Some of us thought, a couple of years ago, that there was a future before that industry.  There has been a strike in connection with it, recently settled, which lasted for more than twelve months, with the result that that industry, before which we saw a hopeful future, has been practically closed down.  The cause of the trouble there was that the workmen refused to accept the rate of wages prevalent in that industry on the Clyde and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>They refused to accept it.  It was obvious that if they would not accept it, the industry could not be carried on.  Those engaged in that particular industry, call them employers or capitalists or whatever you like, get their work by competition.  Those vessels move about to Liverpool or to the Clyde or elsewhere.  When they want repairs done they want them done in the cheapest market, and if they cannot get them done in Dublin as cheaply as in Liverpool or on the Clyde, the vessels go to where the work is done more cheaply.  Quite an immense amount of work and employment leaves this country because of that.  That is another reason for unemployment.  One might develop that point a little further by saying that only yesterday afternoon we were considering why we cannot get houses, with such a demand for houses all over the Free State.  Why can we not get them?  We cannot because it is not an economic proposition. You may put the question as you like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that, and I will be glad to hear the Deputy when I am done.  Building is not an economic proposition.  Building to-day, as it has been pointed out over and over again, costs so much that those who hope to occupy those houses cannot pay what is called an economic rent.  Say what we like in connection with the houses, that is what it boils down to.  Any man who has thought of the subject must, in his heart of hearts, own up to the fact that it is an uneconomic proposition and that is the reason we cannot get houses.  In that industry, if things were different, and if the economic situation were different, we might have employment for a large number of the unemployed.  What is the economic position of the building industry in the City?  We are paying at the moment in this country the highest wages paid in Europe.  The wages paid in the building industry are highest in Dublin.  Take London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and go wherever you like, you will find that Dublin tops the whole lot in the matter of wages.  That should not be so.</P>

      <P>I would like to see the men now walking around in receipt of the dole&mdash;twenty shillings or whatever it may be each week&mdash;engaged in this industry at £2, or £2 10/- per week and having a better life of it.  Let those who are responsible for that industry say that it would be much better that the few should get a higher wage, and that the large number should live on the dole.  I do not agree with that policy.  I do not rise to aggravate the situation.  No good will be done in getting up an acrimonious discussion with Labour on those points.  I would rather try and take some line whereby we might hope some good would follow. There is no use on the one side in saying that we are entitled to a certain <Col N="510" /> standard, and on the other side saying that the trade cannot afford to give that standard.  Then there is an end to it from one point of view.</P>
      <P>The question of emigration has been referred to and it has some bearing on this subject.  When you come to talk of the question of wages causing unemployment we are told that men are leaving this country for America because the wages here are so small. Why is that?  Mostly the men who leave are young and are the best men. Why do they leave?  They leave because of the regulations here laid down.  No matter how hard they work, and many are prepared to work provided you pay for it, they do not get any more money when it comes to Saturday than the fellow who has done not one-quarter of what their output has been.  In other words there is no incentive to work.  Those men, by reason of the absence of incentive, go to the country where they can get some reward for their labour.  They go to America and they are paid on output there.  They earn large wages there; they are paid large wages, but they earn it.</P>
      <P>Now if those responsible for this state of affairs would consider that question, I think something might be done that would stop that emigration and keep these young men, with their talents, at home.  The line I would suggest is that instead of having what we call a maximum wage&mdash;a standard wage or call it whatever you like&mdash;we should have in these industries a minimum wage, below which no man should be paid, and then beyond that in proportion to what a man earns.  If we had that established as it exists to-day in some countries we would have quite a different state of affairs to complain of in connection with the housing problem and also other problems.  I have nothing further to add only to say that we have discussed this question on many occasions in the Dáil and I hope on this occasion that it will not end with mere discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down asked us to realise that there was more behind this problem <Col N="511" /> than had appeared in the course of the discussion, and that it was a very much bigger problem, cutting very much more deeply into the life of the nation with deeper causes than appeared to have been dealt with by the previous speaker.  With that I agree. I think even more deeply than the Deputy himself acknowledged, whether he realised that or not.  I sympathise with his view when he speaks of the failure of the education system, and his plea for steps to be taken to remedy the faults in that connection. But if the whole Ministry were to begin to-night to remedy that fault, it is not going to have any practical effect upon the unemployment problem this Winter.  We are really concerned with the problem of to-day, and I am going to ask the Dáil to try to realise why we should be apprehensive of the conditions of the country, owing to the extent of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures are not available.  We do not know with accuracy how many unemployed persons there are; but I think that I shall be making a very moderate statement if I say that of the insurable occupations (which exclude agricultural workers, and exclude domestic servants of every kind, male or female) not less than 50,000 people&mdash;many more than that, but I am asking you to take a very conservative figure&mdash;are unemployed. That is 50,000 people out of 250,000 persons insurable in these occupations, or one out of five.  That is the situation that has prevailed for quite a time, and it has been relieved, more or less, by various unemployment insurance schemes.  We are now at the beginning of a new insurance period, and the benefit that will be available for unemployed persons under the Insurance scheme will be of very short duration. A very great proportion of the unemployed persons will be entirely outside benefit within two, three, four, or five weeks, and, every further week that passes, the number will be added to gradually.  We shall have in the country, unless something is done more than has been done, either to meet in the way of unemployment insurance <Col N="512" /> or the creation of schemes of employment, a very large number of people who, for a year, and two years in many cases, have been living on a margin, who will have nothing at all to rely upon except what they can beg, borrow, or steal.</P>
    <P>We do not know the numbers.  I think I shall not be exaggerating if I say we shall have 20,000 men before Christmas absolutely dependent upon what they can beg, borrow, or steal. Now that is a very lamentable state of affairs.  We have been able to frustrate trouble by the fact that there have been relief schemes of one kind or another, insurance schemes that have given relief, tiding over difficulties and staving off in Ireland, as in England, revolution.  You may talk about the dole and decry it, but it is admitted by most observers or thinkers on this matter, that what is called &ldquo;the dole,&rdquo; unemployment insurance either covenanted or uncovenanted, saved England and possibly Ireland from very much more serious troubles than these we have had.  But we have got to realise &mdash;and I ask the Dáil to realise it&mdash;that you are going to have a very large number of people&mdash;many thousands of people; men, many of them fathers of families&mdash;absolutely helpless and resourceless for a great part of the Winter.  That is the problem that I think must be taken into account very seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good spoke of the failure of the Labour Government in England to solve the problem.  Well, no responsible labour man in England or elsewhere ever thought the problem of unemployment is going to be solved in eight months, more particularly in highly industrialised, complex, industrial organisations such as exist in England, depending in great part upon the export trade in a world whose markets have been destroyed by four or five years of devastation.  But we are not living in that highly complex, industrial country.  We are living in a country where life is simple and may be made even simpler.  We are living in a country which produces its own food, and which even to-day may be said to produce immensely more food than the community consumes.  It is <Col N="513" /> exactly the contrary situation to that which exists in England.  Whatever may have been the wishes or the will of English statesmen, their position is a different one from ours; their problem is a different one from ours. Although it is called unemployment, it is a problem of how to provide food for the men, women and children of the country.  They cannot do it without finding markets for manufactured commodities. We can do it without finding any market for manufactured commodities, because we can grow the food here.  Not only can we grow food here, but in a great part we do grow food here, and the food is in Ireland now to a very great extent.</P>
    <P>I say the essence, the kernel of this problem, if we want to get down to fundamentals, is to find out the best means of distributing that food which exists in Ireland to feed the men, women and children in Ireland.  You cannot allow 20,000 people with their families&mdash;twenty, thirty, or forty thousand people&mdash;to go through the winter hungry.  You cannot allow it and be content.  I say we have got to face this problem with that thought uppermost in our minds.  It is undoubtedly a problem that goes to the roots of civilisation as we know it, the permanent solution of the problem of unemployment.  I do venture to say that we have a right now, in this country, to try to solve that problem permanently, and if we cannot attempt to do it permanently at this stage, at least we ought to make a very vigorous attempt to solve the problem of feeding the people who are willing to be employed.</P>
    <P>After all, it is a problem to provide a livelihood.  The unemployed are willing and anxious and earnest in their desire to contribute that which will give them their food and clothing&mdash; that is to say, to contribute their labour.  It is our business, and the business of the trustees of the nation's welfare, whether in political authority or in industrial authority, whether Go vernments or employers, to recognise that our trust and their trust is to adjust the resources of the nation to the needs of the people.  It is an awful <Col N="514" /> thing, I think, for Deputy Good to throw up his hands and say that statesmen are powerless to deal with this problem in a country where one-third of the population have no resources and cannot live unless they get employment. To say to those people that statesmanship is powerless when industrialism fails to provide employment, and therefore to provide a livelihood for them, is to suggest to those people that they have to take the law into their own hands and do what they can for themselves&mdash;every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost: in other words, to advocate pure unadulterated anarchy.  That is the ultimate end of this confession of powerlessness in the face of this problem.  I refuse to admit that it is beyond the capacity of statesmen or of Governments to do what those who have possession of property in the country have proved incapable of doing.  If neither one nor the other is capable of solving this problem, then we are faced with the necessity of advising the strong man to find the means of feeding his children.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to take the propositions of the Deputy in detail.  He spoke of house-building and explained that there were no skilled men to be obtained; he complained in the next breath that wages were too high and then went on to say that house-building was not an economic proposition but that building wages should be brought down to make it still less an economic proposition.  I do not want to follow that line, but I will say in response to his complaint that employers are not allowed to pay workmen more than the standard rate, that it is not true in general.  It may be, but I cannot recall any trade in this city, which lays it down that no man shall be paid more than the standard rate.  There may be a trade here and there, but I assert without any fear of contradiction that the great majority of trades would welcome an employer who is prepared to pay an extra 1d., 2d. or 3d. per hour to the better workman.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Deputy to give an instance where any trade union prevents an employer from paying 1d. or 2d. or 3d. an hour more to the better workman.  It is all nonsense to suggest that there is an obstacle to employers paying higher wages to the more efficient workman. Although he did not say it, I think the Deputy had in mind that there should be a greater output when good wages are paid.  He argued differently in the past from his argument to-day.  His argument in the past was that he did not object to high wages provided that a high output followed the high wages. There again we are faced with the problem that has its roots deeply in the social and industrial system.  I repeat, what I have said many times, that the way to solve that problem, not in a month or two months or even six months, is to give security to the workman in employment, to ensure him permanence of employment, and then you can find a way out of these difficulties which are alleged to impede production. I say that we ought to endeavour to solve this problem by way of security of employment for the landless men.  You have allegations about rates of wages in Dublin, but we are apt&mdash;too many of us, I fear, and Deputy Good amongst the number&mdash;to think only in terms of Dublin city.  Let us take a town some miles away, the town of Tipperary, where the rate of wages is much less than in Dublin, where the rate of wages for labourers is only 11d. per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were requests for tenders for four-roomed houses.  The lowest tender was £570, and there was a difference of £100 per house in the tenders.  Was that the fault of the rate of wages paid to the labourers?  Are the labourers responsible for the difference between £570 and £670?  Similarly, when you talk about strikes, as Deputy Corish pointed out, Dublin is only one part of this country, and the unemployment problem prevails all over.  It is not merely a Dublin problem.  Before the strikes that have been quoted here appeared, unemployment prevailed in Dublin.  In those other parts of the country where there has been no strikes, no fear of strikes, no risk of <Col N="516" /> strikes, unemployment is prevalent.</P>
    <P>I regret that there have been strikes in Dublin city, and that strikes have impeded production, and therefore, impeded employment.  I wonder whether those who have spoken on these matters, and, by bringing in this question, have tried to shield the Government from any responsibility for a solution of the problem, or even from tackling the problem with a view to its solution, would rather that there should have been a free hand in these strikes and that every demand should have been acceded to.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who have spoken think production would have been accelerated or that there would have been less industrial trouble.  I suggest that the very fact that that free hand was not given has saved the country, perhaps, from a great deal more trouble than it has suffered.  If some Deputies here had their way, or if the solution for the prevention of those stoppages of work, had been in the way they seemed to indicate, the situation would not be quite as easy as it is to-day and the danger to the country would have been multiplied many times.</P>
    <P>We have been challenged to make constructive proposals.  It is quite true that we are justified in refusing to accept any challenge of that kind until we are in a position to avail ourselves of all the material information, to know whether, for instance, the Government have in their archives any schedules of the productive capacity of the mills and the factories of the country.  We do not know, for instance, how many firms are capable of producing cloth, or their capacity for turning out cloth or any other requirements.  We do not know whether, for instance, the Government is in a position to say what the capacity for turning out material for house building is.  I assume that in the course of their inquiries they have obtained complete detailed knowledge of the productive capacity of the mills and the factories and the workshops of this country.  If they have not, then they have failed to begin the consideration of this problem.</P>
    <P>But I take the view, academic as it will be charged against me, that we <Col N="517" /> have a duty imposed upon us as a Parliament, which has given authority to an Executive Council, to say to willing workmen: &ldquo;We will not allow you to go hungry where there is food to be obtained; we will demand that you will give services for every pound of food you eat, and we will utilise the resources of the country, agricultural and industrial, to provide the needs of the country; having accepted that as a theoretical proposition we will immediately set out and work to adjust means to requirements.&rdquo;  I speak of 50,000 men and women unemployed&mdash; the population of a county&mdash;and I ask the House to think of the problem in these terms.  You have 50,000 people in danger of want, of moral deterioration, of physical deterioration, and possibly hunger.  If you thought of that population, huddled together in one county, brought into that state of want by the action of a foreign enemy, you would say that all the resources of the country must be made available to save them.  Simply because they are dispersed over twenty-six counties, our duty to save them is not lessened.  I again say, what I said two or three times in this House, that if you had the problem of a foreign enemy or an internal enemy driving the population of a county into that state you would, at the risk of the credit of the country, commander, you would mobilise all your resources, and you would save those people.  I say we have got to do the same thing now, bearing in mind that instead of leaving that 50,000 people helpless and idle, you can use them for production and the repayment of the things they consume in the time of their need, when you were succouring them.</P>
    <P>The practical application of this argument will prove difficult, just as the practical application of the case for national defence has proved difficult in countries that have been attacked by internal or external enemies, to those whose minds have been devoted to the solution of the problem.  I say we have got to tackle this problem just as if we felt it was as serious as the problem of national defence.</P>
    <P>One Deputy said&mdash;he made a slip, I <Col N="518" /> think&mdash;that the problem of unemployment was serious in every country. Whatever may have been the reasons for the last two or three years, two countries in Europe have been very free from this problem.  I refer to Belgium and France.  They have had their devastated areas, as we have had. They received, undoubtedly, a certain quantity of reparations in the form of materials, but that has not been sufficient to solve their problem of unemployment, at least to save them from the problem of unemployment, and I suggest that it is very well worth the while of the Ministry to make a very serious inquiry into how it has come about that France and Belgium have been able to avoid unemployment during these last two or three years, when other countries have been suffering from it.  France is predominantly an agricultural country, as Ireland is predominantly a country of small proprietors.  But I do not think that that is the fact that differentiates it from others.  I suggest that it is very well worth while considering how far the utilisation of credit resources have been able to solve the problem there. It is alleged, of course, that they are only staving it off.  That may be true, but I would prefer, at any rate, to save the people for one year, even if I felt that there was a grave risk of making them hungry the year after.  I think unemployment has been staved off in France because of the way they have issued national credit.</P>
    <P>While I do not know anything of the evidence Deputy Davin may have had for his statement regarding the banks, I believe that if the banking institutions have failed to ensure the easy exchange of commodities in Ireland, have failed to ensure that the produce of the community shall reach the consumers by easy means, then the banking institutions have proved their inefficiency as an instrument of exchange, and that we ought not to think of the banking system or the industrial system as something absolutely fixed and irrevocable, whether it fails or succeeds. But we should think of these as systems which have proved their worth and their suitability for survival by their success.  And when they have failed <Col N="519" /> to fulfil the functions for which they are purporting to exist, they should be changed.  I am not dogmatic on that question.  I admit that I do not know sufficient of the workings of banking systems and credit to be able to be very certain of my ground when speaking on that subject.  It may be that I know as much as many people who speak on that subject, but that is not a great deal.  I believe, nevertheless, that when we realise that the problem is how to get food grown from the land of Ireland into the hands and the mouths of the consumers in this country, that if we cannot get an existing instrument to facilitate that process, we have to make one.  I believe that it is not outside the functions of the State to facilitate that process by whatever means it may find desirable, but the process must be facilitated and we must find the means of keeping people alive and of giving them employment, so that they may repay that which they are bound to consume if they are to be kept alive.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to believe and to feel that this is an insistent problem that brooks no delay in dealing with it; that there is not evidence before us that the Government has taken the matter up with the amount of earnestness that it should have taken it up, and that it has failed to realise the enormity of the danger that we are running.  I think that the Government should be prepared to take the problem into account, as it would take a problem of national defence, and not be bound by custom, not be bound by the ordinary processes of trade when the ordinary processes of trade have failed, but go directly to the solution and say that when men are willing to work they shall be provided with the opportunities. In any case, if we fail to provide them with the opportunity to work and earn their livelihood, they shall be fed.</P>
    <P>I do not shrink from the proposition that, just as you would enroll an army to take up arms in defence, it may be that we ought to enroll an army to undertake national works and, instead of having an army for destruction, we would have an army for construction. <Col N="520" /> I think that if there is no other way of dealing with this problem; if you cannot stimulate the ordinary private employer or property owner to fulfil his trust by the undertaking of industrial operations, then we have to go beyond the private employer and property owner and say we must tackle this problem from the point of view of the community and by means of the institutions which the community has set up.  But, however we do it, we ought not to run the risk of allowing ten, fifteen, or twenty thousand men to go hungry.</P>

      <P>I agree that the situation at the moment with regard to unemployment must be met by the State in some way.  It is not fair, however, to expect that the State must always be called upon to solve the problem of unemployment, and that no assistance has to be tendered by the sections within the State that will benefit in one way or another from the solution of this problem.  I think it would be a mistake if it were accepted that this problem of unemployment exists only in the city of Dublin and in the towns throughout the country.  I do want to say that I fear greatly that the standard set up in Dublin and the surroundings contributes in no small way to unemployment within the State and throughout the country generally. We all know the dangerous reactions a strike in the city has throughout the country.  I sometimes think that if we could get away from Dublin altogether, if we could go down the country and get the workers to look at things in a different spirit and in different surroundings from the point of view they have here, it might be a much more easy matter to solve this problem.  I do not suggest that the representatives who sit in this House play as big a part as is sometimes accepted they do play in this organisation of trade generally. The question is, are they able to wield the influence, or do they wield the restraining influence amongst their supporters that is expected of them?  We concede, no doubt, that when one of the five rulers of the earth comes amongst us, things are bound to be upset.</P>

      <P>Amongst the farmers, too, as Deputy Davin says, and I want to remind Deputy Davin that the result of this industrial turmoil amongst farmers has been a very considerable reduction of the numbers employed wherever this disturbance was experienced, and so it must always be.  We cannot have industrial reconstruction; we cannot expect men to put money into industries if there is a feeling in the minds of these people that the channels of trade are going to be closed against them and against their industry; and I do fear that that is prevalent in the minds of many in this country who would be very anxious for industrial reconstruction.  We are asked what is the solution of this problem. Perhaps the solution may come through education, and the people have to be taught.  I do suggest to the representatives of the labour movement to-day that they should go amongst their followers and teach them that the road to employment in this country must be travelled by men who are prepared to work when they get work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hall says &ldquo;work for nothing.&rdquo;  I want to say that down the country, in very many rural areas at the moment, we have considerable unemployment.  We have misery; we have want, and we are fearing the winter in many of the poorer rural districts.  I might suggest Connemara, Donegal, or parts of Cork and Kerry, and parts of my own county, where I know people are looking on the coming winter with feelings of as deep despair as any of the workers in the city.  And I do want to say, too, that if the people are given work they are prepared to work, and work hard, and I want to suggest to the members of the Ministry opposite that in considering this problem of unemployment, it should not be considered from the point of view of <Col N="522" /> the cities and the towns but from the point of view of the country generally; that it should be investigated in the rural districts throughout the country and in conjunction with the problem in the cities and towns.  I have said there are men down the country who are anxious and willing to work if they get work, and anxious to work hard.  They are not going to measure what they do by what the neighbour will do.  I regret to say, however, that it is not customary among all the people down the country, and I do want to suggest that the Ministry should consider the abolition of the dole as soon as possible. From our experience down the country it has a very demoralising effect.  Deputy Johnson may have a different view.</P>
      <P>I recognise that something, even the dole, was necessary, but that should be altered at once, if at all possible.  Work should be given, and work should be thrown open to those people, and let them go to work if they are not too lazy to work.  We have experience of men working for a week, a fortnight, or three weeks, and although the work is still there they go off work and draw the dole.  That is taking place among men who are making roads and on other work down the country, and while that spirit exists how can you expect progress? They do not like work. Deputy Johnson suggests that the food is in Ireland to feed the people.  I do not know what he means by that; I do not know if he suggests that it should be all kept in the country to feed the people.  If he suggests that, I would ask him by what means are we going to obtain the other necessaries of life that we have not got, and that we cannot grow in the country?  He knows we must sell to buy, and what we have to sell to-day is largely the produce of the farmers&mdash;not as much this season as we would like, perhaps, but that is the situation; if the farmers are not able to sell there are very many who will not be able to buy, themselves included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that the situation is as urgent and as serious in many districts throughout the country as it is in the towns and cities.  I am not in a position to suggest what might be <Col N="523" /> done, or what should be done, but I do consider that the Ministers of the State have the obligation on their shoulders at present, and that they cannot pass it on to any others.  It is their responsibility&mdash;the preservation of peace, order, and the lives of the citizens&mdash;and these must be saved by whatever means, I agree with Deputy Johnson, that they can control or demand at the moment.  I do want to urge on them that this problem should be solved fairly and in justice to all, and that, as I say, the many people in the poorer parts of the country, who are as much in need of attention and looking after as those in the towns and cities, should get the same consideration that has been urged on behalf of the people in the industrial centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise so far as it lies in my power to impress on the House the seriousness of the situation as it is in Dublin to-day.  Very few Deputies realise that there is practically starvation in the city of Dublin. I have had cases within the last week of men who have come to me to see if I could recommend them to some of the charitable institutions so that they could get ordinary dry bread for their children.  The charitable institutions that in the past had a little money to help them have now closed their doors through no fault of their own but owing to the demands made on them. Something must be done, and done quickly.  Of these poor people some have in the past been in very good employment, and unfortunately now have nothing to do; they are willing to work at any reasonable wage that will keep their families.  I have known cases of men with as many as six, eight or ten children, in this position, and I can give the Minister a case of a man with ten children who is dependent on his next-door neighbour, a casual worker, earning very small wages, to help him.  It is the workers and these tenement dwellers who get a casual day's work that help the men or the women in the slums in the same houses. I have had an instance of that in Gloucester Street; I have had an instance of it in Gardiner Street, and <Col N="524" /> that is what is going on to-day.  Some of these people have exhausted their claims to what has been called the dole.  Some of them with no beds in their rooms, no pictures on the walls, the pawn offices closed against them, are dependent for dry bread on the people living in the same tenements. I want to impress that on the Government, and I will not make any statement that I cannot prove.</P>
      <P>I had a case&mdash;I referred to it once before&mdash;in which a coroner's jury in the city of Dublin brought in a verdict that a child in one of these streets died of starvation.  That case happened a few months ago.  It is the second time I have mentioned it, but I want to try to prevent the recurrence of such a calamity.  Some Deputies speak about unemployment and gloss over this motion as if to say: &ldquo;Oh, leave us alone; this thing will settle itself some time or other.  It will work out all right, and we will be hearing you again in another twelve months.&rdquo;  I say that is not the way to face this serious problem.</P>
      <P>Something must be done, and done quickly.  Deputy Good made reference to the great scarcity of skilled men in his business.  There may be that temporary scarcity, but what about the iron trades, what about the mechanical engineering trades?  There is not a day's work in Dublin for any of these men to-day, and they are glad to draw anything.  During the war there was no work for the builders and there was a great demand for the engineering trades.  To-day it is reversed, and a man engaged in the iron trade in Dublin has very poor prospects of getting any class of employment in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government stand up here and point out what they have done to relieve the pressure in the past, and say that they gave so many thousand pounds for grants for road-making in some country districts.  I do not think that has anything whatsoever to do with the unfortunate slum-dwellers in the city of Dublin.  They are anxious for work.  There are men in many skilled trades to-day who cannot get any class of work, and I hold seriously <Col N="525" /> that it is the duty of the Government to provide some means, at any rate, to prevent these people from dying of starvation, and that is what I say they will be faced with this coming winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to take any part in this debate, but listening to it one is struck by the atmosphere of unreality that there is about the whole situation; the want of any attempt to face the issue, to face the real facts, to face the cause; rather to side-step, and cast blame here and blame there, without offering a definite solution.  In introducing his motion Deputy Nagle took exception and made some reference to Deputies on his right laughing at the unfortunate position of the unemployed. Deputy Nagle has been in the habit, both inside and outside this House, of making insinuations of that description.  I want to tell Deputy Nagle that if any of the Deputies on these benches laughed while he was speaking it was not at the problem he was dealing with, but at the expense of the Deputy.  If the Deputy makes extravagant and inaccurate statements naturally he must expect somebody to laugh, somebody to dissent, and in this case if a laugh was indulged in by any part of the House it was at the extravagant or inaccurate statements he made.  I pass from that.</P>
      <P>I admit that the Creator made this country, and every other country, for the people of the country.  That is true.  If we are to believe inspired writings, this country was created for the people who worked, for the people who tilled the soil, for the people who earned their bread by the sweat of their brow.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not know that it applies to the Deputy, but I think the general rule in Wicklow, both for the agricultural labourer and the farmer, is that they earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.  I am very glad if the Deputy has escaped that necessity.  I believe that he has. It has been the custom in every country that has progressed that the vast majority of the inhabitants have tried to earn their bread by the sweat of <Col N="526" /> their brow, have tried to put their backs into their work, and the great cause of the position in which we find ourselves to-day is that only a section of this community have put their backs into their work.  You will find more non-productive people in this country, more idle, or semi-idle people, than in any other country in the world to-day, and the reason that they can exist idle and semi-idle is because a certain section of the community is working and carrying the other section on its back, as I have often said here before.</P>

Everybody engaged in agriculture is working, and for very little, while you have a big industrial population in this city, and in some of the lesser cities, standing by the walls unemployable and unemployed. A certain doctrine was inculcated about thirteen years ago, in 1913.  It has taken root.  Some Deputies wish that the man who introduced it had done so recently.  You see the result of it to-day.  Any little trade you had is lost, and this country would seem to be absolutely out of bounds. Any man who desires to start a business, who is desirous of making an investment, either Irishman, European, American, or Irish-born American, who comes here, takes a look at it, stays here a fortnight, having come with certain intentions, leaves the country and abandons his intentions.  I believe that Deputy D'Alton has met one such gentleman.  I have met half-a-dozen who came here with that intention and they have all gone back to America.</P>

      <P>A Deputy talked about children going barefooted over bad roads. Children are going barefooted over the best steamrolled roads in the country this year in order to escape the wet. Comparison was made between the position of the small farmers and the labourers, and the Deputy who made it wished, I think, to take the small farmers under his wing.  I notice that there is a good deal of angling for the small farmers.  I also noticed that it was the custom in the Rural District Councils and County Councils for the labourers to go in a body to the courthouses and prevent the small farmers getting contracts.  In many cases they prevented the small farmers getting a living.  Men with 6 or 10 acres were told to go back to their farms.  In a good many cases small farmers were hunted out of the Rural District Council chambers and the work was done by direct labour.  I wish Deputies who interrupt would do so loudly enough for me to hear.  I like interruptions.  I fatten on them.

      <P>I think we have enough of fly boys at home.  As far as fly boys are concerned, I think we could compare with any country.  While the present atmosphere prevails&mdash;and we had a sample of it during the last six months in Dublin&mdash;is it not too much to expect that any bank, any business <Col N="528" /> man, any investor, except people bereft of human intelligence, would invest money here, or is it to be wondered at that those who are here should shut their purses and lie quiet?  With the atmosphere that we have this country will never develop.  Until there is a different outlook the country will not develop.  It will not develop on doles. It is not the duty of the Government to develop the country.  How can the Government develop it unless the people are inclined to help themselves? What is the use of trying to carry on in a hive where there are more drones than workers?  There is a law in the hive, and it would be well if this nation followed it, that they kill the drones. We may not arrive at that stage in our time, but in a few hundred years that stage will be reached, when the workers will be kept and the drones killed.</P>

      <P>Deputy D'Alton referred to arbitration and conciliation. We know that they are pets of Deputy D'Alton, and we wish him luck with them.  I think they are pets without tails.  They have no existence in fact. I do not think they have any use in the present atmosphere.  Deputy Corish objected to certain statements that were made by, I think, Deputy D'Alton. I altogether differ with Deputy Corish, but I think the sooner we face facts and call things by their names the sooner we will find a remedy.</P>

      <P>What I inferred from the remarks of Deputy D'Alton was that he put up the case of some friend or acquaintance of his who came here from America with the intention of investing his money.  The statement made by the Deputy was that if that man <Col N="529" /> could see any stability, any freedom from strikes, he would have invested money in this country.  I understood Deputy Corish to say that that was a most unfortunate statement.  That is the way I took it and if I am wrong I apologise.  There is something in the gap of progress in this country, but I say positively the obstacle is not the Government.  I say that deliberately. If men made up their minds to face the situation, and find out where the obstacle is and try to remove it, it would be much better instead of blaming the Government.  Deputies come here and talk about a million for this, half a million for that, and a quarter of a million for something else.  &ldquo;We only got a million last year for the roads,&rdquo; they say.  Is that not babyish and lunatic talk in a country with resources like ours?  Deputies talk about millions as if they were pennies.  This country can and ought to pull its weight if the different units in it are prepared to pull their weight.  This country cannot find millions for all sorts of things.  A remedy must be found besides doles and giving away millions.  A remedy must be found by an honest effort, and if it cannot be found by that means we might as well abandon the whole idea and say that this country and its people are hopeless.</P>
      <P>The sooner we are honest about that the better.  Any man in this country who cannot pull his weight and who cannot earn his bread by his labour is a drone and a drag on the country.  I will not offer any suggestions as to the methods to be adopted to deal with him.  These will automatically come in time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good instanced what I believe is a fact, and that is that the skilled worker in this country is the highest paid of any worker in the world.  That statement was not contradicted. He also said that if a wage was fixed below which no man should be paid, and that if good men were graded on from that, a better state of affairs would be brought about.  I quite agree with that.  Deputy Johnson says that he never knew an official of the trade union movement who objected <Col N="530" /> to an employer paying in addition to that.  That means, in regard to the highest wage paid in the world, that there would be no objection to an employer going beyond that as far as he likes.  I quite understand that there would be no objection.  I can also understand that there is not likely to be any further payment after that.  If we are not going to admit the cause of this unfortunate position we will never find a remedy.  If we are prepared to admit the cause, and are prepared to remedy it, I see some hope. But otherwise I see none.  An atmosphere has been created, and men have dropped into a certain groove and rut, out of which it will be hard to get them.  I admit the hardness of the task, but until they are prepared to get out of that groove and rut, pull their weight, and put their backs into their work, no Government, no section of Government, or no section of the people will be able to mend the position. Men talk about rebellions and worse.  That will not settle it.  The people who are carrying the load have a greater right to rebel&mdash;and probably they will rebel a good deal more quickly &mdash;than those who will not work.  There is a method of putting too many straws on the camel's back, and I say that the ratepayers are already carrying almost the last straw.  I will not be surprised if rebellion comes at the other end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; is a bad word to use in this country, and we should use it as little as possible, for we are playing with fire when we are talking about it.  We know that a cart-horse can kick.  The people engaged in agriculture are the cart-horses and are the people who are bearing the load.  I have been going around the country a good deal and I think that we are much more likely to have rebellion from that quarter than from any other. One Deputy interrupted Deputy Baxter with the remark, &ldquo;work for nothing.&rdquo;  This country can afford a certain wage for all its people, but that wage cannot be a big one.  Do we want to face this honestly?  Do we want a wage for all, a wage which the country can afford, or do we want a big wage for a few people, and is it to be a case of &ldquo;To hell with the rest&rdquo;?  Do we <Col N="531" /> want a big wage for the aristocrats of labour, for the people about whom Deputy Hall interrupts.  This country can afford a small wage, a fair wage, for all but it cannot afford a great and unreasonable wage for all.  It is a choice between a reasonable wage for all and a great wage for a few, and starvation for the rest.  Let them make their choice&mdash;those who are responsible for the Labour movement.  I do not want to introduce any bitterness and I have tried to avoid doing so.  I believe that there are very few people in this country who are prepared to pull their weight but I appeal to them to do so.</P>

      <P>May I explain? The Minister has mistaken my suggestion. I said that the resources of the country should be mobilised&mdash;I said it time and time again&mdash;and in mobilising the resources of the country you are mobilising not only the unemployed but the material resources as well, and you are inviting the unemployed to return in labour what they are getting in sustenance.</P>

In addition, he spent a considerable time, and he devoted a considerable portion of his speech, to the suggestion that the unemployed should be mobilised, to put it shortly, for work on the devastated areas.  There were other Deputies listening. At least one-quarter of the speech was taken up with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deal further with that point.  The point I was on was this, that the Deputy suggested, or at least I think he suggested, and this is the point we were dealing with, that our unemployed should be mobilised, mobilised if you like freely&mdash;I do not want to suggest conscription; he has explained his position on that clearly as far as I am concerned&mdash;that our unemployed should be mobilised, and that work should be found for them in the devasted areas.  That was a suggestion I thought the Deputy made, and I am not yet clear whether he made it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear, if I can, that I did not refer to mobilising the unemployed in the devastated areas only.  I did not refer to the devastated areas in Ireland except to show that there were devastated areas here as in France.  I do not believe it is possible to utilise unemployed labour in Ireland simply for the purpose of reconstruction of the devastated areas.  Unemployed labour in Ireland, in my view, has to be mobilised. The door is open for voluntary recruitment, if you like, for productive work of various kinds, including rebuilding of the destroyed areas, and <Col N="534" /> the production of food to supply their needs next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be very stupid, but the Deputy has not made himself clear to me.  I would be glad if I am allowed to continue.  Two suggestions were made, one that the national resources should be mobilised, not as a temporary expedient but as a national policy, to continue for a considerable period as the future national policy.  Another suggestion was made, namely, that to meet the temporary needs of unemployment that exists the unemployed should be mobilised&mdash; if he objects to the words &ldquo;devastated areas&rdquo; I do not wish to repeat them&mdash;for the purpose of temporary relief works, I will put it that way.  I suggest that is the statement he made in this matter.  There was a suggestion here that the unemployed should be mobilised, should be employed if he prefers the word, by the Government on temporary relief works to tide over the temporary necessity.  That is the statement I wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another and totally different point, namely, that the national resources should be mobilised as a matter of national policy, now and for the future.  These are two distinct points, and I found myself unable to deal with two points at the same time, and I was endeavouring to deal with one at the time.  I can well understand the suggestion that the unemployed should be employed on temporary relief works as a temporary expedient.  That is quite understandable, and I sympathise with that point of view, but I do not understand what the Deputy means when he said that the real problem, as a matter of national policy now and for the future is, how to distribute the food that we produce in abundance in this country amongst the people of Ireland. That statement is either a platitude or it means something very much more. Deputy Baxter asked the same question, and I take it there are many Deputies who do not quite see the significance of that statement.  To make confusion more confounded, Deputy Johnson went on to say that Deputy Good's comparison with England did not hold good in this country.  He pointed out <Col N="535" /> that England was a manufacturing country, a country with a very big population, a country that was unable to produce sufficient food for its people, and he said that England was in the position that it had to export its manufactured articles in order to buy its food.  He assumed that there was some radical difference thereby in the economy of this country and the economy of England.  He made the assumption, for the purpose of his point, that the real problem in this country was how to distribute the food we produce in abundance among the people of the country.  In this I am speaking from information.</P>
    <P>Platitudes will not carry us very far, or pious hopes, or truisms.  England, of course, exports its manufactured articles in order to buy its food and other necessities.  We are in exactly the same position <i>mutatis mutandis.</i> We export our food in order to buy our clothes, tea, sugar, and everything we do not produce in this country.  The Deputy must have known, I would be very much surprised if he did not realise, that the distinction he drew between England and this country in that regard is hardly a sound distinction. It may be.  He certainly can hardly have meant that it was the duty of the Government as a matter of national policy to control all the food in the country, to purchase it if you like from the producers and distribute it amongst everybody else.  He could not have meant that.  He must have meant that it is a sound national policy in this country to be self-supporting, and have an industrial population that will absorb the food produced in the country.  That is probably sound.  It will be necessary for this country to consider that problem, and to consider it seriously, but it must be obvious to Deputy Johnson and every other Deputy that the solution of that problem is a long process.  It is hardly a contribution to Deputy Nagle's motion.  It is, as I have said, an extremely long process, which will take a long time and careful working out.  It does not in any way affect the particular point we were at, that there happens to be unemployment at the moment, and the <Col N="536" /> problem is how to deal with it.  Suppose that it was decided as a matter of national policy that this country should be self-supporting, and that we were even in a fair way of effecting that, in other words, that we were in a fair way to bring about the economic system that at present exists in France, where you have a fairly big industrial population and a fairly big agricultural population. The country may be self-supporting. Supposing that were so, surely the Deputy knows that there would be unemployment even still.  These truisms are all right; they are all fine, but they require examination and definition; they require, if we are to get anywhere, if we have any other object in view than merely to stand up in the Dáil and utter a certain amount of sound, and unsound, political and economic philosophy, that we must apply those truisms to the point at issue.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy, and I am sure Deputy Johnson, knows that if that happy state of affairs were brought about, if this country were self-supporting, and if we had on one side an industrial population, and on the other side an agricultural population, fairly well dovetailing into each other, that would not solve the particular problem that we are dealing with to-night.  Quite possibly there would still be a margin of unemployment and that is the particular problem that we are on.  I want to say that in that particular context Deputy Good was quite entitled to point out the particular considerations that have a bearing on that point. Deputy Good pointed out that no matter how you regulate the State, no matter whether you depend on foreign or home markets, there are certain, sound, fundamental, economic principles which you cannot afford to ignore.  I am not entering into the issue between Deputy Johnson and Deputy Good in this matter, but Deputy Good was perfectly relevant to the argument when he pointed out that in the shipbuilding industry in Dublin you have higher wages than are paid in any part of the world, and that has a bearing on unemployment.</P>

      <P>The fact itself may be verified but the point of view is perfectly relevant.  Deputy Good was quite entitled to point out that the same occurred in the building trade.  Again, the facts can be verified, but the point of view was perfectly relevant, and it is not quite enough for Deputy Johnson to answer Deputy Good or any other Deputy in the Dáil by saying: &ldquo;Very well, then, if the industrialists of this country are unable to find employment for the people of the country, we have an alternative: let the strong man find food for himself.&rdquo;  That is all very fine, but it is not business and it does not meet the issues that are here.</P>
      <P>Just one word <i>apropos</i> of a particular aspect of Deputy Nagle's motion. We realise here that a situation somewhat different and somewhat more acute than the situation last June is in existence now.</P>
      <P>We realise here on these Benches that there has been a bad harvest, that there is less food in the country than there might be.  We realise that the first sufferer from that is the farmer, and we realise that the poor everywhere will suffer from it.  We must deal with that.  We must measure that problem and deal with it, and I make no excuse in the month of October for inserting the clause.  We must measure the problem.  The harvest is not yet fully in.  The harvest is barely over in some cases, and not quite over yet in other cases.  We certainly can hardly be accused of any delay in that matter.  We must measure that problem fully.  It will take us a little time to do so, and so far as there is a shortage of food as a result of this harvest, we will deal with it in the most suitable way, and in a way that, so far as we can see to it, will return the best possible results, not only to the farmers but to the poor and unemployed everywhere who are bound to suffer from that particular mischance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the Dáil very long.  There is undoubtedly unemployment in the country. The causes of this unemployment have been mentioned by several Deputies.  I <Col N="538" /> think the unemployment that we have to-day in Ireland is due to the action of the people who stood up and ruined this country over the difference between Document No. 2 and the Treaty.  I think these people are certainly to blame to a very great extent for the unemployment in the country to-day.  In order to induce capital to invest in the country we must have settled conditions.  The crying need to-day in Ireland is for peaceful conditions. In addition to that I would say that if this country is to prosper we must have willing workers.  The workers must be inclined to do a reasonable day's work.  Capital wants a return for its money, and those who invest will require a certain percentage for their money.  Labour must be protected from itself, and Labour must be advised to do what is right.  I am a worker myself.  I was for years in America, where we worked very hard. Irishmen are the best workers in that country.  It is strange to find that Irishmen will work so well in America, while here at home we will not work as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After six years of very hard work in America it dawned upon me to return to Ireland and do in Ireland what I was doing in America.  I believed there was a living to be made in Ireland. Imbued with those ideas, I came back to Ireland, and when I landed in Cobh I looked round for work and found work in Cobh in the building trade.  What happened to me then? I was full of the idea that I should give as good a return to my Irish employer as I had been giving to my American employer, and I set to work in Cobh and I carried out these ideas.  What happened me in Cobh for doing an honest day's work?  The bricklayers in the building employment in which I was working struck against me because I was doing an honest day's work and they drove me out of the town.  I met them; I reasoned with them in the street, and I asked them what they had against me.  They said: &ldquo;You have spoiled the job; you have done as much as two or three men.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I did the same work in America under very hard conditions.  The <Col N="539" /> climate in America is very severe.  It is very warm in the Summer, and very cold in the Winter, and the climate here is very mild, and no man suffers because of the climate.&rdquo;  They would not listen to me.  They drove me out of the town for doing an honest day's work.</P>
    <P>The more quickly the men in this country make up their minds to do a reasonable day's work the better it will be for them and for the country. I say there is no other road to prosperity but through work.  Let us not be hostile towards each other.  Every party in this assembly is in support of the Government.  The Government is not to blame.  The Government is composed of plain people like ourselves, and they are trying to do the best they can and they must get the support of the people.  Support must come from individuals.  Everybody in the State must take off his coat and help to bring back prosperity to the country.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that there would be great prosperity to-day in Ireland, but for the terrible things that have happened here.  There was set up a terrible row as between the Treaty and Document No. 2, and the result of that has been so far-reaching that to-day it is responsible for so many of our people walking the streets looking for work.  There is no need on my part to labour the point.  These are the facts as they appear to me. We have had our bridges blown up, our railways ruined, our banks robbed and raided, and all this has left such a feeling of instability in the country that capital is not being attracted.  It is like the story of the American capitalists who wanted to be guaranteed security from strikes before investing their capital in Ireland.  There are hundreds of such cases, all showing the prime need for absolute peace in our own ranks and in the ranks of those who have differed with us over the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to stress the point made by Deputy Johnson in one particular regard.  It seems to me we have to-day really been discussing two entirely different questions. <Col N="540" /> One is as to why unemployment should have come to exist as it is, and the other is, seeing unemployment does exist in its present magnitude and has raised such formidable problems for the coming winter, what is going to be done to deal with the question as we now find it?  I think, in regard to the first question, the controversy could range over a much wider field than has been covered to-day, and many points could have been gone into that necessarily have been touched upon only very slightly, wrongs of Labour and wrongs of both sides.  I do not agree with, and dissent very strongly from, some of the things that Deputy Johnson has stated in regard to his efforts to absolve Labour from the responsibility that it has incurred in this connection; but I am with him entirely when he points to the state of affairs that exists to-day, and says if something be not definitely done, in a matter of a very few weeks a very grave situation will be created in this country, the making of which exists to-day. I agree with him too when he says that the action now called for is an action that must, in the necessity of the circumstances, be taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>Those who urge that this is not a matter for the Government, that this is a matter that should be left to the ordinary processes, may be able to make good their case on the wider subject; although even there I think they would have a very stiff task in order that their case should be made good.  I remember reading in the paper this morning that the Minister for Finance attended at an assembly yesterday where Deputy Good was present.  There it was pointed out that Irish industry was suffering very considerably because of a certain scale of taxation, and that other methods should be adopted in order that the revenues of the country might be made good.  I do not know what that may be considered, if it were not appealing for Government assistance.  I think it is clear that whatever is to be done is to be done in one way, directly or indirectly, by the Government of the country, in order to deal with the situation that actually occurs.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> I am bound to say I feel a little regret that those additional words should have been added, although they have been accepted and now form part of the resolution immediately before the Dáil.  I agree that they are true; I think they are true.  Their substantial truth has been admitted by the Labour Party by the acceptance of this addition to the original substantive motion.  I think strikes have created an amount of insecurity that in its turn is leading, and had led, to unemployment. I also think the reverse is equally true, and that when there is an amount of unemployment there is an amount of unrest and apprehension in the country that naturally leads to conditions that lead to strife.</P>

      <P>It has proved itself in the experience of every country that when there is very little unemployment there is very little tendency for strikes, and when a large number of strikes occur, and when strikes occur with increasing frequency, those times are always bound to be times when there is a large amount of unemployment in that particular country.  It is impossible to say strikes lead to unemployment without also considering the reverse of that truth&mdash;that unemployment leads also to strikes.  In any case, those are the general aspects of the larger question. I am now thinking more particularly of the immediate issues, and that is the situation that this country is faced with in the coming winter.  Much has been said here in regard to the dole.  I had it told to me to-day that a very eminent statesman in England, who certainly had dissociated himself from the Labour point of view with a great deal of emphasis, nevertheless did say that, except for the dole, there might probably have been revolution in England in the last two or three years.  He himself, although one of the leaders of the Conservative Party in England, believed the dole was justified, because it had safeguarded that danger.  That is an aspect of it that is worth very careful consideration, not <Col N="542" /> only as a matter of history in regard to the past, but in regard to the future.</P>
      <P>I stated in the Dáil, two years ago this month, that I believed the Irregular campaign of that time was very largely due to unemployment.  That view, I think, is one that has been fairly widely accepted.  I think that if, at the present moment, some evilly disposed persons were to do as they did before, and were to raise the standard of revolt, rebellion and revolution, those who would flock to that standard would be largely recruited from among the people who have not got work and who are faced with hunger. I believe it is as true to-day as it was then.  I believed it then, and I am convinced that I was correct at the time that the Irregular campaign was largely created by unemployment.</P>

      <P>I have not got the references by me, and I will leave that matter now.  I am convinced, however, that I could show the Minister that he did express that view. However, I do not press the matter now.  At the present moment, when we have got so much unemployment, we have got a state of affairs that is going to create a great deal of difficulty and danger for secure Government in this country, and something will have to be done in regard to it.  While I do not agree with Deputy Johnson on the lines of the remedy he advocated, I, nevertheless, do suggest to the Government that there is something in the idea he has put forward that is worth consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us turn now to the immediate case of the city of Dublin.  What is happening in Dublin has been told quite clearly by Deputy Byrne. There is want, there is hunger.  On the other hand there is a certain amount of devastation.  There are public buildings that need to be rebuilt. <Col N="543" /> That is the second factor in the general conjunction that I want to indicate. The third factor is that money is being given, and will be given, in the form of doles.  There you have three factors, and I ask that they might be thought of together instead of thinking of them separately and distinctively. These factors are&mdash;unemployed persons faced by hunger, buildings that need to be reconstructed, and the money that is being paid for doles.  Why cannot the three be brought together?  Let the buildings that require to be rebuilt be rebuilt, by the persons who are hungry, for the payment of the money that is now being given to those persons who do not want it.  They might after a time get the habit of idleness, but they do not want idleness.  It has been protested frequently on their behalf that they would take work if it were given in preference to this dole.  Then, I say, let that statement be taken for what it is worth, and let them be asked if they will make good the statement that has been made on their behalf, and let this reconstruction work proceed.  Let the Government allocate the money that is now being allocated in doles as payment for reconstruction work on the lines I have indicated.  No Government and no country, no matter what is said here, and no matter what energetic protestations are made, if people are faced with hunger, and in danger of death by hunger&mdash;and that is not altogether an improbable event in certain parts of this country before this winter is out&mdash;can stand by and let that proceed.  That goes without saying. What I suggest is that instead of meeting the situation by doles, let it be met by laying out schemes of reconstruction work, call on these people to engage in these schemes, and for the money they receive ensure that an equivalent day's work is done.  That is the course that I suggest, because we will have to face that situation.</P>
    <P>There is no question that before the winter is out we will have to face the want that exists, and no discussion as to the larger issues will help us to evade that immediate question that is before us.  It has got to be handled <Col N="544" /> and to be met, and something has got to be done and the Government will ultimately have to do it.  There is no question about that.  Before many months, perhaps before many weeks have passed, the Government will be faced with it in a form that will require and demand action.  I suggest that the form in which that should be met is by the laying out of schemes, not in which persons shall receive money in relief for no equivalent return in work, but that persons shall receive money in relief and that solid work shall be required in return, so that on the one hand the actual want that exists will be relieved and on the other hand that some of the reconstruction work that is required in the country will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat a blot on our procedure here that, when a Vote of Censure is put down against the Government, no spokesman from the Government benches will make any reply or intervene until very late in the debate.  That is more specially true of this debate.  Deputy Nagle put down a motion censuring the Government for its failure &ldquo;to adopt effective means of finding useful work at a living wage for willing workers.&rdquo; Deputy Cooper put down an amendment, which was accepted by the mover of the original Motion, regretting &ldquo;the unemployment caused by unnecessary strikes due to lack of unity among Irish Trade Unions.&rdquo;  Even when a responsible member of the Government intervened in the debate he left us rather in the dark as to what attitude the Government proposes to take on the amended motion.  I would have imagined that some Deputy on the Government side would have put down an amendment to strike out the words in the original Motion: &ldquo;the failure of the Government to adopt effective means of finding useful work at a living wage for willing workers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of that I presume that the intention of the Government is to resist the amended Motion.  I do not think that is a very wise policy. If the Dáil were to reject the Motion, as it stands, it might, I am afraid, with some superficial show of truth, be held <Col N="545" /> that the Dáil was indifferent to the sufferings and the anxieties of the unemployed. That is not the case. When you come to examine the means for solving unemployment, the first thing that must strike you is how inadequate a Government must be, even in the best circumstances, of achieving good results and of ending unemployment. The primary function of the political Party in power is to govern, and not so much to engage in trade operations.  I am tired of repeating that in the Dáil.  Of course the circumstances are exceptional.  Deputy Johnson said so, and I agree that the circumstances are exceptional, but even under these exceptional circumstances it cannot be the policy of the Government to go seriously into business and start trading operations on their own. All they can do is to provide the money for constructive work, and to supervise the expenditure of it.  Deputy Johnson was not altogether content with that.  He asked, in effect, that they should mobilise the material resources of the nation.  I acquit him altogether of the suggestion that was flung out of conscripting the man power of the nation, even the unemployed man power.  There was one aspect of this question which struck me as being somewhat curious, the idea that they should seize upon the food resources of the country and distribute them.  Deputy Johnson's words were &ldquo;to readjust the resources of the nation to the needs of the people.&rdquo;  It is from the farmers' point of view that I am speaking, and I want to repel, as far as lies within my power, the idea that the farmers of the country should be conscripted to provide work, or food rather, for those in other walks of life.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. C. HOGAN Mr. C. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any man has land who has not got to work it.  If he is not prepared to work it he will not be able to hold it very long.  There are certain definite charges on the land which have to be met regularly.  The payment of annuities and of rates are admittedly first charges on the land.  In addition, the farmer's family has to be supported out <Col N="546" /> of the land.  On that point, I just wish to say that the Irish Free State is a country of very small holders, of peasant proprietors, and that it is in a curious position.</P>
      <P>I should say that 60 or 70 per cent. of the land is held by small working farmers.  As a matter of fact, these people live on the lowest standard of comfort, and are paid no wages for the proceeds of their labour.  I ask is it a fair proposition that they should be compelled to produce greater quantities of food at a cheaper rate without wages.  Is it a fair proposition to hand that food over to the urban dwellers for whatever they choose to pay for it?  I say it is not, and I protest in the strongest manner against it.  I repeat, there are no wages paid on the land and I have yet to learn that work in any industry, without wages, does not constitute the very essence of slavery.  But that is the position of small farmers.  There are no wages paid to any members of the farmer's family.  They merely subsist. At the present time, what with low prices and other causes operating, they are very hard pushed to live. Therefore, it is not a fair proposition to put to us.  Deputy Johnson's idea was that the farmers should grow more food.  He did not, in any definite sense, advocate compulsory tillage, but the implication was there.  I am not opposed to tillage, but my contention is that the land must be worked to the best possible advantage, and not so much in terms of quantities as in terms of what it will realise in actual cash.</P>

      <P>I know it is the fundamental policy of the Farmers' Party that the farmers of this country will not become the tributaries of the proletariat.  But it seems to me that this lack of employment in the country is really symptomatic of the perversity of the people, and of the unrest and the unsettled conditions and want <Col N="547" /> of credit that prevails.  Well, it is proverbial that you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs, and it is equally true that you cannot carry on a revolution and anarchy and war without depleting the resources of the nation almost to vanishing point.</P>

      <P>Unemployment naturally follows in its train.  I am not surprised that there is unemployment, but then, again, he who can consistently regard prosperity and anarchy as going hand in hand is an extraordinary man.  He is a super man of a type.  The idea was thrown out that Belgium and France were free from unemployment and that they are agricultural countries.  France is largely agricultural; Belgium not quite so much.  But I wonder although they are free from unemployment have they any other ills?  They have a depreciated currency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This, again, is a question of work, and as Deputy Good pointed out the wages are higher for a few here than in any other country in Europe.  Now what are the conditions amongst the agricultural population in France?  They have to work harder than the farmers in Ireland, in order to eke out a livelihood. It is a well known fact that in the vine-growing districts they have to be up at work at 4 o'clock in the morning in the Summer time.  Does Deputy Johnson desire a depreciated currency here?  We are bad enough, Heaven knows, but does he realise that with a depreciated currency our conditions would be very much worsened?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he is looking for something that the House and the country never will give him. Does he understand the hardships inflicted by a depreciated currency upon people with more or less fixed incomes, <Col N="548" /> and standard wages and which will ensue owing to the fluctuations a depreciated currency entails?  I hope, whatever else we do, we will never adopt the idea of a depreciated currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been flung out that the resources of the land are illimitable and inexhaustible.  I altogether deny that.  The resources of the land are easily exhausted and they are not illimitable.  What do we find in the rural areas at the present time?  Men living on the land are rushing to the towns because their conditions are so hard and such little remuneration on the land for the most arduous work. The temptations in the towns, and the prospects of wages there, with shorter and easier hours of work, are such that there is a continual exodus from the land.  As a matter of fact every young fellow, living on the land, is trying to join the Civic Guard, for instance, or is endeavouring to get into the Civil Service or some other form of non-productive employment.  It has been suggested that we should attract capital to the country to relieve unemployment.  I agree, but unfortunately in this country, the conditions are not such as to make anyone very willing to invest capital.  The want of security is largely to blame for one thing; high taxation is another thing, and in addition, I am afraid&mdash;and it is well perhaps to blurt out the truth&mdash;that there is a perverse kink in too many of us, and that we cannot organise for living intelligently. I believe myself that that is an implication in the amendment which the Labour Party have accepted.  After all strikes, continual strikes, and strikes for trifles do not show the right mentality.  The fact of it is that with the present resources of the country almost reduced to vanishing point, the same free and easy conditions that prevailed in pre-war days in hours of work and good pay, etc., can no longer be maintained.  Men must agree to take less in wages and do more work. We must have longer and more arduous work and we must give better service for wages.  It is true that we want to get rid of the dole, but we do not believe in starving the unemployed. We want the money that is <Col N="549" /> given and spent on the dole diverted to useful reconstruction work.  A year ago I put down a question to the President on that subject and though I frankly admit that Ministerial replies to questions are, as a rule, the essence of evasion and prevarication, this one was specially so. I cannot at the moment recall its precise terms.  It was only in fact a remark of Deputy Figgis that brought it to my mind.  In any case though we were promised very sympathetic consideration of the problem of unemployment we have not heard much since except about spending some money on the roads.  Now while it is very desirable to maintain the roads still, if all the money of the country is to be spent on the roads we will soon have no country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points of detail on certain matters relative to my own Department that I would like to touch on rather hurriedly before getting to the main portion of this motion.  Deputy Nagle, who was the mover of this motion, expressed himself in a very mild way considering what I had expected to hear from him on the subject.  He referred to two matters.  He spoke of the discontinuance of the unemployment figures. These have failed to appear for some time.  It has been deliberately done, because it has been found that the figures were not being properly understood. There was no distinction made in those figures published as between those unemployed and in insurable occupations and the unemployed generally, and as the figures represented no true index of the unemployed problem in the country, and as they were being miscontrued, it was thought better to discontinue them.  Deputy Nagle made one constructive suggestion and I think he founded his whole case, as far as the betterment of the <Col N="550" /> present conditions were concerned, on that one point.  He said that a great opportunity now offered itself and that great opportunity turned out to be the providing of money for roads.  That was the one constructive suggestion the Deputy made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, who followed, was responsible for one good suggestion. He held that this was a problem to be tackled, not by one party or by any combination of parties.  He held out the offer that if this was approached in a decent and wide way it would meet with co-operation from all sections of the House.  There was a definite proposal put afterwards by Deputy Bryan Cooper, and I waited to see what reception that would have from a particular section of the House.  He referred to the passing here of an Act corresponding to the Lemieux Act in Canada&mdash;an Act which more or less enforces an armistice for a month before any strike breaks out&mdash;and it was received in a very cold and chilled fashion by the Labour Party.  That is a point on which there might be co-operation with Labour&mdash;that there should be something corresponding to what has recently happened with regard to the Treaty of Versailles, corresponding to the Lemieux Act, which introduced compulsory arbitration with regard to war, and the enforcement of a month's armistice before any aggressive action be taken.  The nation taking aggressive action within a month is automatically declared the aggressor.  We have the Lemieux Act, which, industrially, was an anticipation of what was recently done with regard to the Treaty of Versailles.  There was no response to that.  An Act of the sort could very easily be passed here.  It may have a certain effect in preventing the outbreak of strikes, which Deputy Davin described rightly as the last weapon in the armoury of the employed. After Deputy Morrissey's statement that there would be co-operation on lines not defined, of course, but rather vague&mdash;a general hint&mdash;there was a constructive suggestion put forward by Deputy Cooper, and no response came to it.  Deputy Morrissey was responsible for the statement that the population of this <Col N="551" /> country was small, and that this Dáil ought to be able to provide work.  It is not any function of this Dáil to provide work, and the sooner that is realised the better.  I do not refer to the point referred to by later speakers; that in critical moments, where there is an abnormally large unemployment problem, there should be immediate approach made to it by the Government. That is actually occurring at the moment.  That is actually taking place, and there will be some approach to it, but the Government or this Dáil should not be held responsible for the provision of work in the country.  It is not its business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a totally different thing.  The Government has, in so far as the Unemployment Insurance Act is concerned, seen that hunger will be stopped.  I do not say it goes far enough.  They have started certain relief schemes to keep off hunger from other people in the country.  To state broadly and definitely that this Dáil ought to be able to provide work for the country is giving this Dáil functions which it has no right to take upon itself.  The Deputy also referred to the old complaint.  Hopes are disappointed, he said, that our own Government has not done something to give employment beyond what the English Government might have done. He further stated that Deputies have no knowledge of and no regard for the unemployment prevailing.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;No knowledge of and no regard for the unemployment problem&rdquo;&mdash;I will put the two things together.  The Government has not done its duty because it has no knowledge of and no regard for the unemployment problem.  That I can definitely contradict.  I know that the question of unemployment has been before the Executive Council many and many a time and that the question of the proper provision of relief and the proper way to attempt to stimulate industry in this country, so that work would automatically come, has often been considered.  If there has been a failure, and I do say there has been failure, it has been on account of the limited resources that there were to play with.  Deputy Davin, I think, was the next speaker on the Labour side. Deputy Davin seems to have developed a peculiar trouble of his own.  I do not know what particular type of mental affliction it may be, but whatever it may be he projects his own trouble on anything or anybody who comes within his purview.  The banks for instance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish followed him, and made an appeal that this was not a Party question, that it was a matter upon which all parties should combine; and having expressed himself in that way, he turned rather to matters that I thought would have developed in the course of the debate.  He has come to speak of certain matters affecting my own Department, and asked if I had any note of any fluctuations in certain trades, and if inspectors went about collecting information as to how work was proceeding, and whether industries were being scrapped.  He gave me an instance that, if it is a fact, is certainly news to me.  If it has occurred only within the last two or three days the news may be on its way to me, but generally I am well informed and get quite reliable information with regard to the progress and fluctuation of trade in the country.  Whatever I may have thought of the case he made with regard to the agricultural implements was weakened when he came to speak of the Drinagh Cement Works.  I wonder would he be frank enough to tell us how long it has been kept going owing to the efforts of my own Department?</P>

      <P>That was the phrase.  The Drinagh Cement Works have been referred to on unemployment and the closing of the Drinagh Cement Works caused unemployment.  If it is introduced for any purpose it is to show the Government failed on that specific point with regard to unemployment. That is a fair interpretation of the Deputy's remarks irrespective of what he said.  Let the Deputy say to the House when putting that, that for almost six months the Drinagh Cement Works have been kept going by the action of the Department of Industry and Commerce and were kept going on a promise given by the cement works that they would make certain re-adjustments in their working to do certain other things.</P>

The continuance of the benefit depended on the answer of the Drinagh Cement Works.  The question whether dumping <Col N="555" /> was continuing was different.  The continuance of benefit depended on certain things within the control of the cement works.  I shall leave the Drinagh Cement Works as they are&mdash;closed &mdash;but I say that they were kept open for six months owing to the efforts of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hall had the caustic comment that if the Departments' time and the time of the officials of the Departments were not wasted on legislation purely for political purposes and were devoted more to economic matters, there would be less unemployment.  I take myself as an example.  I had three main legislative measures before the Dáil in six months&mdash;the Railway Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act, and the Trades Loan Guarantee Act.  They are scarcely to be described as Acts for political purposes purely.  As far as that is concerned, there was an attempt to keep the unemployment figure low, and if I might retort to the Deputy, I would say that the time of my officials is more wasted in making inquiries as a result of Parliamentary questions dealing with unemployment insurance where the difficulty mainly was the applicants' ignorance of how to make claims or where they were not able to recognise their own application books when returned to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson pleased me, at any rate, by turning down the suggestion of his colleague.  Deputy Hall, that if a Labour Government came into power to-day, here, as elsewhere, it could rectify the whole unemployment problem at the moment.  He sees there are greater difficulties ahead than Deputy Hall saw.  He went on to make this comment, in answer, I think, to Deputy Good, that unemployment prevailed before strikes.  Well, if we were to follow that into the recesses of time we would have a problem of a certain complexity.  If we apply it to Ireland, and limit it to a certain recent period, I do not know that the strike period was not anterior to the great unemployment period.  There is the other <Col N="556" /> question&mdash;has unemployment prevailed in districts where there are no strikes? That is, of course, seeking to localise unemployment and strikes in a way that simply avoids the basis of the whole conflict.  Does Deputy Johnson imagine that capital has no ears? Does he not realise in a country where strikes are prevalent, even though a certain local area may be free from them, that capitalists are not going to invest in that locality?</P>
    <P>They will have to have a wider sweep than this very localised idea which Deputy Johnson would allow.  He asked had the Government any schedule of the productive capacity of factories, and went on to imagine that if they had, they must have such schedules as would show that the factories could produce more and could produce at a sufficient rate to do away with unemployment.  I cannot say, I do not believe, that the Department has the most accurate and the most complete details with regard to productive capacity in this country.  It is endeavouring to get them, and if a certain measure is pushed forward in this Dáil it will be in a better position to get these details soon.  The fact that we have not got them and the fact that people have not had time to get them, is one of the minor results of the civil war, when people's minds were so preoccupied with more dangerous and serious matters that these matters of production could not be taken into account.  We have certain figures with regard to capacity, but that is not the end of the matter.  If you have factories capable of producing a certain amount of goods, it does not do simply to say, &ldquo;put more men into these factories and let them produce more,&rdquo; because there is no good in production unless there is some sale for the product, and you cannot operate factories simply by putting men into them. There is something else necessary to bring the two together, and if the Deputy answers me as he did at one time before, to scrap finance and just let the thing operate, that at once upsets your whole banking and financial system.  If that is his proposition, the times are too dangerous to start scrapping any of the institutions still left <Col N="557" /> in the country.  The comparison with France and Belgium made by the Deputy, I submit, is a very superficial comparison.  It is easy to say that there are certain similarities between this country and France, or between this country and Belgium.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that France is at present bearing the burden of so many armed men, and bearing the burden of a tremendous National Debt, and, that it has no employment&mdash;which I question&mdash;and that consequently Ireland should be able to do all these things.  There is surely one point at least of difference in this comparison; both France and Belgium are old established countries with well founded reputations for credit, and their finance is easy, not as here.  The conditions even in that respect being different upset and vitiate the whole comparison set up by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that I did not put it quite in the light in which the Minister has suggested; not so much for comparison but rather to suggest that there is a fruitful field of inquiry as to how the end has been arrived at, whether through finance or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can pass that on to the responsible Minister, who will undertake the inquiries if he thinks fit.  Deputy Byrne indulged himself in the luxury of grief, which he often does in this House, and spoke of the people whom he knows in the various tenement houses and of their sorrows.  There is no necessity to harrow anybody's feelings here with tales as to suffering, either in this city or throughout the country.  These things are very well known.  It is only another way of putting what Deputy Morrissey said, that there was no regard for, and no proper valuation of the problem that is before us.  These things are quite well known, but simply to state that they are there, and to tell a tale of a child dying of starvation and the coroner's verdict that the child did die of starvation, as if that is <Col N="558" /> a verdict against the Government, is the sheerest nonsense.  I might, if I liked, retort to Deputy Byrne that I know of a case where the head of a family earning £3 10s. a week left his employment because other men who were employed with him were not in a particular union, and his family of eight are reduced to semi-starvation. In saying that I do not mean it as an indictment of the Labour Party, or an indictment of anybody here.  These things have to be faced; they are there, and I hope that we will come to a state when we will be able to say that these things do not occur, or occur very seldom. But simply to tell us that there is distress in the country at the moment is stating a thing that we all know, and it serves no useful purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Figgis came to sum up what others had said before him, what he said two years ago, and two months ago, I think, and what others might have said if they thought what the Deputy thought at the moment.  I do not intend to reply to the Deputy.  I presume that if he thinks there is anything valuable in what he said, the matter will appear elsewhere in a way which will meet with the respect that things that do appear in that way do meet with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Motion talks of the &ldquo;failure of the Government to adopt effective means of finding useful work at a living wage for willing workers.&rdquo;  Now, there should be a proper view of the conditions under which this problem of unemployment came about.  It is not necessary to review the events of certain mournful years that have just passed, and to make deductions as to what might have happened if these years had been spent otherwise.  But there are one or two factors that have to be taken account of.  The Government came into control of power at a time when an agricultural slump was developing, at a time when prices were falling, at a time when the main industry of the country was not finding good prices for its products.  That was due to a variety of causes.  It was due, for one thing, to the fact that the chief customer for these goods, not being able to find markets for its own products, <Col N="559" /> had not the purchasing power to pay for our exports.  There is the further fact that whatever little savings had been accumulated by the farming community in the good years prior to 1918, had been somewhat dissipated in the years from 1918 to 1922, dissipated in the supply of the sinews of war, in whatever form the sinews of war were supplied, dissipated owing to the fact that there was waste when war was proceeding in the country.  The national income has been lowered, and the margin of wealth with which further productivity might be encouraged was disappearing, and, according to some people, had disappeared. Unto these circumstances the Government came, having control of the resources of the country, and they found a problem of unemployment that was not new to the country.  Unemployment has been perennial here. It has been artificially cloaked owing to the two great drains of army recruiting and emigration, and those sources of draining up the otherwise unemployed were stopped.  That was the position which faced those who came into the control of the resources of the country in 1922, and the events after 1922 had a certain further effect on the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into these here, as they are matters of dispute.  Unemployment was the problem, and the only cure for it, as I said previously in this House, is employment.  The question is how to increase production, how to increase the activity of industry, and how to increase it particularly in such a way that labour would be employed, not wastefully on roads and relief schemes, but in its normal occupations. That problem faced us last Easter, and certain lines of attack were developed to meet that problem.  We have followed along these lines since. The situation has, however, recently been complicated by one other event, that there has been, partially we believe, a failure of the harvest and an almost complete failure of the fuel supply in the poorer districts.  That is a problem which demands immediate attention, and immediate attention is being given to it.  That has had to be <Col N="560" /> segregated from what I might call the normal unemployment problem, although it is an abnormal one, as we found it last Easter.  That requires a new approach, and that is being faced. Inquiries are proceeding to see how far the harvest has failed, to see how far the fuel supply has failed, and provision will be made to meet whatever be the necessities of the country owing to the bad summer.</P>
    <P>But with regard to the other problem, that is a special thing by itself that aggravates the problem I was dealing with last Easter.  The other problem, the main problem, the unemployment problem, it was decided to meet in three ways.  There is the question of the immediate advance to it, the Unemployment Insurance Act&mdash;an Act which has been criticised by those who spoke of demoralisation, and while speaking of demoralisation worry my Department with letters to know why the dole is not being paid.  They despair of the demoralisation caused to their constituents, but when their constituents call upon them they write me letters complaining of the money not being paid, which shows the sincerity of the talk which I believe goes on about demoralisation.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, and in no way hindered by the Unemployment Insurance grant, was the question of the provision of money through relief schemes; and, thirdly, the question of getting remedial measures for industry and commerce in this country.  Along these three lines we have travelled.  The Unemployment Insurance Act came first, and the question of relief schemes was gone into.  Money was provided for roads, houses, and certain drainage schemes.  A quarter of a million of money was earmarked for unemployment relief.  That has been, to the extent of £178,000, allocated, mainly, I would say&mdash;and I would draw Deputy Baxter's attention to it&mdash;to the country districts and not to the towns. The Unemployment Insurance Act would have its effect mainly in the towns.  The provision of the £178,000 would have its effect mainly in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that the money is allocated for main <Col N="561" /> roads and trunk roads very far away indeed from the poorer districts in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Trunk and main roads, possibly, with regard to road grants.  I am speaking of the £250,000 of a special grant for unemployment, out of which £178,000 has been allocated. The biggest item, I should say, has been to the Land Commission, and Land Commission work is not done on main roads or trunk roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>However, relief schemes are hindered by a variety of circumstances.  One point has been urged here rather frequently&mdash;that it is possible to take the money now being expended in unemployment insurance and put it to constructive work.  That can be done, but let the Dáil realise how it can be done.  It can be done, with the result that you employ one-fifth in constructive work of those whom unemployment insurance will at least give support to.  You can support at a 15s. a week rate five people for the same money expended on relief schemes.  The question of material, supervision, and everything else being taken into account, that is about the ratio, one to five.  There is the question with regard to relief schemes generally, that there is not an abundance of public funds to expend on them, and that a big amount of it goes, not to the unemployed, but by way of supervision and by way of material.  Even taking these deficiencies the money was expended as well as it could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third item, the remedial measures for rousing the activity of industry and commerce takes time to develop, but it was thought the only possible thing to do that, while facing the immediate problem, we should not lose sight of the future.  I am glad that Deputy Johnson came one point nearer reality than previously.  Previously he used to skip finance.  To-day he says <Col N="562" /> feed the people this year even though they may go hungry next year.  I suggest that that is not what could be called statesmanship.  You have to look over a period of years, and you cannot take measures this year which may lead to more people going hungry next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That would solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It might solve the problem but not in the way that I desire or that the Deputy desires.  To say that would solve the problem is no answer, is not facing the fact that there are limited resources in this country. It is better to husband these than to spend any money you have and see that people are fed this year, even though they go hungry next year.  That is not good policy.  These remedial measures take a certain amount of time to develop, and, although that was realised, it was thought not merely wise, but the ordinary thing to do, that they should be gone ahead with.  Such things as railway reorganisation and the power schemes now being considered will take years to develop.  They will give some immediate employment.  If the Shannon scheme is approved of, there will be immediate employment for 3,000 men for a period of about three years.  While the Shannon scheme is developing there will be so many openings foreseen that there ought to be great activity in the way of industry, preparing for benefits that will come when the scheme fully develops.</P>
      <P>There are other things such as the question of supervision of Government contracts, seeing that the work goes in the proper way.  The adjustment of the Fiscal system, which is at present being tried, and which too many people, I may say, at this time lightly assume has been proved a success&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It has brought certain employment undoubtedly, at a price.  We have to assess and evaluate it to see whether the price is worth the employment that it has brought or whether a similar amount of employment could not be brought by other means.</P>
      <P>These are the main heads of the attack on the problem of unemployment, as seen by the Government, and along these lines we have proceeded since. If it is said that the Government has failed to adopt effective means to find useful work for willing workers, I can only answer that it is no function of Government to provide work for anybody. They can try and develop tendencies, and can try and set the pace a bit, but it is not the function of the Government to provide work.  The Government has certainly put at the disposal of the country a certain amount of money for circulation through certain grants, and if that money was circulated then there should not have been so much unemployment. I referred in a previous debate in the Dáil to the figures, and at the risk of wearying the Deputies I will give them again.  For roads, bridge building, and drainage, £1,100,000; property losses, estimate, £7,333,000; housing, £587,000; public works, that is to say new buildings, £200,000; Army Vote, new buildings, £244,000; relief schemes, £250,000; and in addition to that there is the provision of £250,000 by way of unemployment insurance, and the setting aside of the sum of £1,000,000 for distribution through the medium of the Trades Loan Guarantee Act.  That is a sum, all told, almost of £11,000,000.  That, at any rate, shows some attempt on the Government's part to provide as far as it can useful work for those who are willing to take work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to say, in reply to the Minister, that I will not refer to the dole as demoralising, for I consider that the money spent through the Labour Exchanges was subscribed by the workers themselves.  I think it is far more demoralising to have men without money, than to accept the dole to keep themselves from starvation.  Deputy Good spoke about the high wages in the building trade, and also Deputy Gorey. Each of them spoke about the emigration of skilled tradesmen.  Deputy Good actually said, on the one hand, that the wages in the building trade were the highest wages paid in Europe, and he wanted something done by the organised workers to have them reduced to what he would call the minimum wage.  On the other hand, whilst it is the highest wage, as we are told, <Col N="565" /> paid in Europe, the workers emigrate from Dublin because they can get higher wages in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the highest wages in Europe are paid here, strange they can get a higher rate in other countries, so I think that the high rate here is not much to boast of.  We recognise quite well what has been done by the Ministry to try and tackle this problem of unemployment. I admit that money was spent on roads, and a certain amount of money was got for housing under the last Housing Act.  I may say that I helped, to the best of my ability, to get part of that for North Cork.  The Minister for Local Government was contradicted by one of our Deputies who said that there was no building done at all.  So far as I am concerned, I was instrumental in having grants of from £30,000 to <Col N="566" /> £40,000 for the construction of houses in my constituency.  The Minister said that the function of Government was not to give work to the people.  Their function, in our opinion, is to see that the people whom they represent have at least the opportunity of living, and if necessary, to get work for them to enable them to live.  In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not think the Government has succeeded in doing what the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested, because I believe they have failed to adopt effective means of finding useful work and providing a living wage for workers, and the fact that there are nearly 50,000 unemployed is proof of my statement.</P>
