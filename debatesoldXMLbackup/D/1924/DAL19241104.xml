      <P>Cases of the kind referred to by the Deputy were considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee in accordance with the terms of reference and on the evidence, medical and otherwise, submitted by the applicants on the forms of application which were drawn up specially by the Committee in order to give applicants every opportunity of fully presenting their cases on paper.  Attention was directed in the form of application to the fact that only in those cases where it was considered necessary would the applicants be called upon to attend before the Committee in person to supplement the details already given or to be examined with regard to the evidence put in on the forms.</P>

      <P>Generally, in serious cases, but in cases that on the form appear to be trivial they did not call on the applicants to attend.

      <P>This deposit contributor enlisted on the 15th November, 1922, and as he did not enter an Approved Society within the prescribed time he ceased to be an insured person as from the date of enlistment.

On his discharge he was again treated as a deposit contributor, and the balance to his credit was replaced to the credit of his account in the State Fund.</P>

      <P>The best way in which future schemes of drainage may be initiated, executed, maintained and managed is under discussion between the Departments concerned, and it is hoped to have the preparation of a Bill completed at an early date.

It is hoped that arrangements for disposing of the claims still to be dealt with can be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission cannot identify any Ridley Estate pending for sale under the provisions of the Irish Land Act, 1903.

The Land Commission named a figure and then the owners withdrew from the sale.  The estate has never been heard of since and no agreement for purchase, or anything like that, has been sent in by the tenants, if that is the estate that the Deputy is referring to.</P>

      <P>No &ldquo;flotation&rdquo; of stock is contemplated by the Land Act of 1923, which enacts that 4½ per cent. Land Bonds are to be created by the Minister for Finance and issued by the Land Commission for the purposes of the Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has already created £400,000 of these bonds, and the Land Commission have already issued bonds against this credit in the case of eleven estates.</P>

      <P>I would find it necessary to go through the eleven estates to answer that question.  They are estates in any case, which are vested in the Land Commission and probably estates <Col N="647" /> in the main which contain tenanted and untenanted land.  I do know as a fact that the untenanted land purchased by the Land Commission in 1923 has already been divided, so that bonds must have been created and issued in respect of that land.</P>

Donegal, was approved of in July, 1923; whether it was further agreed that the Department would make monthly payments to the van-driver for his services; whether he has received a communication from the manager to the effect that no payment has been made for the past seven months; and whether he will see that the matter receives immediate attention.</P>

      <P>This van service was established in 1909 for the purpose of conveying school children from Cranchoe district to Shalvey National School, Co. Donegal.</P>
      <P>It was arranged that payment would be made on receipt of periodical certificates from the Manager of Shalvey National School that the service was regularly and efficiently performed.  Since the 31st of March last the manager of Shalvey National School has declined to sign the certificates on the ground that a pupil from his parish has been excluded from the van, and in the absence of these certificates payment for the period since the 31st March last has not been made.</P>
      <P>The relative papers have been sent to the Divisional Inspector for a report on the facts of the case as soon as possible.</P>

Does he think that it will be desirable, when the Estimates are being debated next year, to have the decisions of these Commissioners and the manner in which they have done their work, discussed?  I suppose I would not be in order in moving an amendment to substitute &ldquo;payment out of the Central Fund&rdquo; for &ldquo;payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas,&rdquo; but I would ask the Minister whether he would not withdraw this motion now and consider whether the principle that all judges should be paid out of the Central Fund and be immune from Parliamentary criticism, is not a sound one.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, at the moment, I am not in a position to give the Deputy the information he seeks. On the occasion of the Second Reading I think I explained the reason for this sub-section (a).  The policy of the Bill, of course, was to provide houses for the working-classes.  It was not intended to provide houses for people who could afford to build big houses, but at the same time we did not want to build houses that would be really so very small as to be unsuitable for proper human habitation.  Accordingly, we laid down restrictions that the houses should not exceed the number of five rooms, and should not be less than three rooms.  This sub-section does not interfere with the general provisions of the Act; it only applies to those cases where houses were built by individuals within six months before the Act was passed.  Several people <Col N="660" /> knew that we were going to facilitate building in the country, and they started to build houses, and the Act, not having been passed at the time, they did not know what restrictions we were going to impose with regard to floor area.  The result was that a great number of those people built houses that were a little over the margin, some of them of 1,100 feet, and some up to 1,400 feet.  We thought it was only equitable to include those people who had started building their houses on the assumption that they were coming in under the Bill, so long as the only point on which they went outside the Bill was in the matter of floor space, but it does not apply to houses since the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On this section of the Bill I would like some more information. It appears that the Ministry desires to make gifts of money to private builders whether they started to build under the terms of the principal Act or not.  That is to say, persons who entered upon the work of building houses on their own account, without regard to any Government subsidy, are invited to come along and say they began to build their houses within six months of the passing of the principal Act&mdash;that irrespective of the purpose and motives of such building they are entitled to draw a certain amount of this £300,000.  And the Government proposes to hand it over to them.  I <Col N="661" /> would like a little explanation of that. Why confine it to six months?  To say that those people commenced to build in expectation of the subsidy not knowing what the nature of the subsidy would be, or how much it would be, or what the Dáil thought about it, but banking on the promises they got from Ministers&mdash;that does not seem to be satisfactory procedure at all.  These houses were begun as part of a private venture by the persons concerned, and they would have been built whether this Bill was passed or not, whether a subsidy was to be granted or not.  If there was no complaint regarding the difficulty of raising money there might be something to be said for this Section.  But while we are told, as we are so often, that there is difficulty in raising money for the purpose of these subsidies we are asked to go out of our way and to say to men building houses without any prospect of a subsidy: &ldquo;We are prepared to bring you in with the rest and make you this free grant or bonus.&rdquo;  That does not seem to me very satisfactory or very easily explained.  Then I would like to know what is meant by the term &ldquo;begun within six months before the passing of the principal Act.&rdquo;  When does a house &ldquo;begin&rdquo; to be built? Is it when the plans are drawn up? Is it when sanction is given?  Is it when the first sod is cut?  When is a house begun?  I would like to have some satisfactory explanation of these two points before we pass this Section.</P>

It was not in the Bill originally, and I think Deputies on the Labour benches were amongst those anxious to have it included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it is hardly fair to ask the Minister to give information about the 1,300 houses already built under the Act, but if he could have that information for us on the Report Stage it would be very useful.</P>
      <P>The main point I have in mind is this: that it should not be forgotten that the grant was originally made for the purpose of encouraging the building of houses some eight or nine months ago.  We were anxious then to get as many houses built as was possible under that grant in order that it might go as far as possible in alleviating the grievance.  If that money&mdash;the Minister will see the point I am at&mdash; is to be absorbed in providing larger houses rather than smaller houses, it will not alleviate, at least it will not help in the direction in which we are anxious it will help, and I think in this connection we should keep in mind what the President mentioned here last week when the Bill was under discussion. He pointed out what is happening in connection with a number of new houses and, most unfortunately, that there is an amount of sub-letting. It is not, I am afraid, altogether unconnected with this question of compelling tenants to occupy houses larger than they can afford to pay for. Naturally, if a tenant wants to get a three-roomed house and that is not possible, and a five-roomed house offers, he will jump at the five-roomed house in order to get accommodation for himself and his family.  He finds after he is a few weeks in occupation of that house that the drain on his financial resources is greater than he can bear, with the result that he is forced to sub-let to pay the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sub-letting, I am afraid, is a growing evil that will have to be met. I have come across cases in which two of the rooms were sub-let in a four-roomed house&mdash;two of the rooms sub-let and the family living in two rooms &mdash;but there are even worse cases than that and my attention was drawn within the last few days to the case of <Col N="663" /> a man who is actually living out of a house.  He found this sub-letting so remunerative that he has given up his ordinary occupation.  That is a form of abuse that is not desirable and that should be counteracted.  Therefore I say the important point to consider at this stage is: what is the policy of the Ministry with regard to housing?  I have advocated, as the Minister is aware, that the proper line to adopt is the building of the smallest house, that is the three-roomed house and get as many as you possibly can with the amount of money you have at your disposal, but I am not altogether of opinion that it is the view of the Minister's department. I do not know what his own view is but I think I am justified in saying that it is not the view of his department from some experience I have had.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to give this information on the Report Stage, as to the number of three-roomed houses, four-roomed houses and five-roomed houses that are at present in progress under the scheme so that we can discuss the question of policy on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson's remarks in connection with this matter are most pertinent because it would appear to the ordinary observer that what is happening now is this: that a number of men who were building houses irrespective of this assistance that we are giving under this scheme have brought pressure to bear so that they might participate in the benefits of this Act.  I do think that when we were discussing the principles of the Act would have been the time to have decided whether any houses that had been started were going to be subsidised or not.  At this eleventh hour it seems to me that certainly what the Deputy has said on the matter seems very weighty indeed&mdash; that unless there is some very good reason why the provisions of the Act should be extended at this stage, it should not be done.  Certainly the Minister has made out no case for doing it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware what the position is in the cities and urban districts, but in reference to the application of this Act to the country, we want to say that we are not receiving the benefits that the cities or towns are getting, because in the country we can build but we cannot reconstruct.  We should like to hear from the Minister whether he has come to any decision. He told us the other day he was considering the application to the rural districts of the same rights to reconstruct as the people in the towns and cities are enjoying.  The point Deputy Hewat has made reference to is one that affects rural districts perhaps to a much greater extent than the towns or cities.  We have perhaps more liberty than the towns or cities when we are going to build houses, and we were anticipating a measure like this for a considerable time.  In anticipation of that, a considerable number of our people set about building houses.  They did not know when they started the houses what the area was to be or if there was to be any marking out or confining them to a certain floor space. They went on and made considerable progress with the houses.  They came along then and discovered when they made application that they had really a greater floor-space than the Act permitted them to have.  Their neighbours, who were perhaps a little more fortunate and had made their floor space a little smaller, were entitled to the grant. It is to remedy that state of affairs the Minister has introduced this section, and very rightly so.  Down the country there are very many cases which will be entitled to come under this Bill when it passes and becomes law.  If it is proved that they were started within the six months' period I cannot see why Deputy Hewat, or any other Deputy for that matter, should wish to object to a man building a bigger house than he would be permitted under the terms of the Act, if he is fortunate <Col N="665" /> enough to have the ground space and to be courageous enough to spend a little more than his neighbour would spend.  That is really the position we are faced with, and Deputy Hewat like every other Deputy has to make up his mind on which side the greater amount of justice is.  We want to say that we in the rural districts will be very considerably affected if this amending Bill is not permitted to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter appears to me in a different light, perhaps, from others.  It is a question of whether the money can be afforded.  We cannot pass this provision which practically says that a man who began to think about building a house twelve months ago&mdash;more than twelve months ago, because the house which was begun in October last, that is to say, when the specifications were approved &mdash;could be brought into the provisions of the principal Act and receive the subsidy if he complied with these provisions. People who began to think about building under these circumstances were thinking about building irrespective of any subsidy at all; they were going to build on their own account. If the Ministry has money to give away, all right; I am not going to object.  But if there will be any complaint about the amount of money available for subsidising house-building you cannot receive that complaint and answer it after passing this section. We are now proposing to make a grant to people who had no expectation of such a grant when they started to build houses, or started to consider about building houses and put in their specifications.  If the Ministry can afford it well and good; if they cannot afford it, it seems to me that we are simply going to meet the case of people who, as an afterthought, put in an application for public funds to assist them, and I do not feel justified in supporting it.  I made this same complaint when the matter was brought forward in the original Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I agree with Deputy Baxter regarding this section.  I know a number of <Col N="666" /> cases where men actually started building houses three months before the passing of this Act.  We all know quite well that for considerably more than three months before this Act was introduced we were promised a Building Act on these lines, and many of these men were actually compelled to start to build houses in order to get some kind of shelter.  They took their courage in both hands and they said: &ldquo;Well, this Building Act is promised us.  When it comes along we will be recouped to a small extent for the money we are going to spend.&rdquo;  They did so, and in some cases they exceeded the 1,000 feet set out in the Act, not knowing, as they could not, what the area was going to be.</P>
      <P>I have in mind the case of a particular friend of mine, who is also a constituent, which is, I suppose, even more important, and he was under notice of eviction.  He lived in a small three-roomed cottage on the side of a road, sandwiched in between a group, and the owner served him with notice of eviction.  He said he wanted to turn the house into a stable for some horses and cars.  This man came to me long before he started building the new house and asked was it possible to prevent the notice of eviction being put into operation.  I told him immediately that I thought he had a very good case, as he could prove that it was more important for him to live in the house than for the landlord to have it for his horses.  He got a bit cowardly and said: &ldquo;I will not chance bringing it into court.  I will build a house.&rdquo;  He had a site and he made the best use of it that he could, the result being that the house was something over 1,000 in floor space.  I do not agree with Deputy Johnson that there are a great many such cases.  I think they are comparatively few, but I think that the comparatively few people who built houses shortly before the Act was passed are as much entitled as anybody else to get something from the Government in the way of help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the things I was going to ask, as to what is the number of houses involved in this matter, because it seems to me a most extraordinary thing for this House if, having passed an Act, it is going to be called upon to amend it.  Why?  Is it because the Minister sees the necessity for amending it? The Minister comes to the House and says nothing in justification of amending the Act at all.  He does not even stand by it.  I do not know whether he would even vote for it, as far as this clause is concerned.  The Minister says that certain Deputies have brought pressure to bear upon him to bring in this Bill which will include, amongst others, Deputy Nagle's constituents. Is that right?  As a matter of fact, the discussion has illuminated the position for me very considerably, because on the face of the Act I really would not have read into it what appears on the surface now.  What it amounts to is that we are bringing in a Bill to allow people to participate in the benefits of an Act when no case was brought forward.  All the arguments that have been used here to-day in connection with the advocacy of this might have been brought forward at the time of the passing of the principal Act.  All those houses that were started before the passing of the Act were known, and any case could have been brought up where a man was damnified because he had already started building his house. But it was only after the Act was passed that we heard anything about these houses participating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the spirit of the Act was entirely to give employment and to give people homes in which to live.  Now we are cavilling at the very small point as to whether a man who commenced to build his house four or six months ago is to get the benefit.  I think it makes very little difference, because that man foresaw what was going to happen, and he took advantage of it and wanted to be in time.  I know cases in my own constituency where building <Col N="668" /> was started before the rules were laid down, and there was a certain amount of difficulty.  The Department found that there was no difficulty in the matter at all; they came to the rescue of these people and made what I consider a very workable arrangement by allowing ten per cent. for any mistake there might have been in putting forward their original plans.  It does not matter if a house is built to-day or tomorrow if the purpose for which that house is built is carried out, that is to give the accommodation that is necessary, both in urban and rural districts, and secondly to give employment. I think that is what the Dáil should consider, and there should be no little points as to whether a man started to build his house a month or six months before the Act was passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>This clause, I think, deals with houses of 1,400 square feet.  That is the maximum, and the minimum is not set out.  If he does not exceed the limit a person will be entitled to build and I think that he should be.  If a man says that the house is sufficient at 1,000 or 1,200 feet, so long as the plans are sanctioned by the Department I think it is quite sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I would prefer that this clause were more clearly understood than it appears to be.  The original Act limits the subsidy to five-roomed houses.  I think a five-roomed is the largest house. The original Act provided, like the Act in Great Britain, that that five-roomed house should not exceed 1,000 feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some circumstances in which it might exceed, but in ordinary circumstances that house was not to exceed 1,000 feet.  We are adding practically 50 per cent. to the size of that house.  That means that we are subsidising a house for a class of person quite different to the person for whom houses were intended under the Act. I do not want to drag the Deputy or the Dáil into technical details, but it is <Col N="669" /> possible to build a five-roomed house under this amended Bill in which each of the rooms will be 16 by 17 feet and still come within the Bill.  Any Deputy who is at all accustomed to the measurement of rooms will understand that 16 by 17 feet is quite a large room in modern construction.  We are to have five such rooms in a house subsidised by the State.  That means a great big house, and to my mind the Act was never intended to apply to such a house or to the class of people who would occupy it.  The Act was intended to help those who are without houses and to help any of the unfortunate people who are at present housed in tenements to get houses for their families. As I understood it, that was the intention of the Act.  This section would prevent that.  Speaking from memory, such houses under the Act are to get a subsidy of something like £100.  If we could get the Bill to work in the other direction, rather in the construction of small houses which the President was in favour of when the original Act was introduced, we could practically get two houses for the same subsidy.  By admitting this extension of size we defeat the object we had in view.  Deputy Hughes takes an intelligent view of this matter, and I think he will agree with me that in extending the superficial measurements under this section we are defeating not only the original object of the Act, but the object we had in view in giving the subsidy.  I urge the Dáil from that point of view not to adopt the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is rather an involved one, and I was not altogether clear about it myself when I read it for the first time.  It applies to houses which will fulfil three conditions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The total area of all floors of the house measured inside the external walls does not exceed 1,400 square feet; (b) the erection or reconstruction of the house was begun within six months before the passing of the principal Act; (c) the house complies with Section 3 of the principal Act...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it the Minister is to some extent considering the need of houses in <Col N="670" /> this clause.  It is a generous clause, and deals with a particular class.  It might be necessary for certain Deputies in order to appreciate the necessity for a clause of this kind, to be in the position of Ministers administering Departments where, notwithstanding what regulations may be laid down, or what conditions may be attached to any particular document, or what attempts are made to make it perfectly clear to persons what entitles them to certain benefits, in a large number of cases no attention whatever is paid to these details. In a very large number of instances the persons whom it was intended to benefit put themselves out of court by reason of inattention to these three conditions.  Some thirty or forty cases occurred where persons built houses far in excess of the measurements laid down in the Act.  If we give way on this it will cost something like £3,000.  The question the Dáil has to consider is whether or not there is sufficient justification for such a large sum of money.  More than once we have stressed the fact that houses were useful, and that any attempt whatever, large or small, would to some extent help to relieve the terrible congestion that there is, which is not confined at all to the urban districts, but exists also in certain rural districts.  I had a letter the other day from a person urging a claim for some allowance for a house which was 1,700 square feet. That would be a pretty large house, but it was mentioned that the parties had started in good faith, understanding that it would come within the provisions of the Act.  They were not in a position to finish that house.  I have known cases of the same sort where persons started in good faith expecting the cost would not be as heavy as it ultimately turned out, and as a result other people occupied the houses.  It might happen that in the thirty or forty cases mentioned much the same thing occurred.  I have known cases where the houses cost 50 or 60 per cent. more than the persons who were building them thought they would cost.  Whether there is a real case for including these thirty or forty people who built anticipating that any house would get the subsidy is the <Col N="671" /> question the Minister has got to consider. I was in doubt for a long time as to whether I could support this clause.  Deputy Good at once points out the weakness of having five rooms, 16 by 17.  On the face of it there is no case there for a subsidy, but when one recollects that the persons who built such houses cannot sell them at the price which they cost there is justification <Col N="672" /> for considering if they are not cases in which we would be justified in paying the subsidy.  Personally I believe it would be justice.  I think more care will be taken in future. With regard to persons building, the parties will confine themselves to the smaller houses.  On the whole I should say that there is a case for considering these thirty or forty persons.</P>

      <P>The following portions of this Act, that is to say, the whole of Part I, Sections 8 to 14, and Section 19 in Part II, Sections 21, 22, 23 and 25 in Part III, and Section 50, 55, 57, 61, 64 and 65 in Part V shall not apply to the County or the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that Section 2 stand part of the Bill.  This section is necessary owing to the fact that a Commission has been set up to enquire into the system of Local Government in Dublin County and in the County Borough.  It was considered desirable that nothing in this Bill should conflict with any of the findings of the Commission.  We have accordingly excluded, by this section, parts of the Bill from operating in that area.</P>
      <P>The other sections, which will not in any way affect the decisions of the Commission, are still applicable as in the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>Before we pass this section, I would like to know from the Minister whether its passing will entail a further postponement of the local elections in County Dublin.  The city does not matter so much as the Minister has intervened already, and the principle of popular election is suspended for the time being.  In regard to the country, these local bodies have already been in office a great deal longer than the period for which they were elected, and a certain amount of dissatisfaction is being felt with regard to the manner in which some of them are functioning.  I raised the matter about a year ago as far as the county councils are concerned.  I am glad that the Minister has been able to influence the county councils in the direction of a reduction of rates and more reasonable administration, and the discontent is not so keen perhaps as it was a year ago.  There is, however, some discontent with regard to the administration of some of the councils in the county and some of the townships.  A further postponement of <Col N="674" /> elections which have already been postponed two or three times, will not be looked upon with favour.  Will the Minister tell us whether the section involves a further postponement&mdash;I imagine it does&mdash;and will the Minister also say whether he will have to bring in another Postponement Bill, for if so I shall have to vote against the section as a protest?</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of this question.  The application of the operations of the Act to the City and County of Dublin is to be postponed pending a report of a Commission which is being set up to inquire into local government in this area.  We are to pass an Act, including public health matters, in respect of the rest of the country.  Then we are to have a commission to inquire into the administration and the best procedure regarding public health after setting up by this Act these public health authorities.  It is a curious inconsistency.  We have a Commission to inquire into local government administration and also into public health.  That, at least, was the understanding. In one case we are to have a Commission set up first, and legislation postponed pending the results of that inquiry.  In the other case we are to have legislation introduced and passed, and then we are to appoint a committee to inquire into what sort of legislation is required.  It is a curious procedure and I would hope that the Minister would be able to explain the inconsistency, or is he satisfied that there should be no further inquiry by any committee or commission respecting public health or the best methods of conducting local affairs?  Are we to assume that the projected commission is now abandoned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind Deputy Johnson that the situation in Dublin is undoubtedly different to any other part of Ireland.  Dublin is the capital of the Saorstát, and is by far the most important city in the country, and it has innumerable complex problems that do not apply to any other part of the country.  The special difficulties affecting that area have never been considered by a Commission before, and for <Col N="675" /> that reason it is very desirable that a Commission should consider the peculiar circumstances relating to Dublin. On that account I consented to allow a Commission to inquire into the whole matter before applying to Dublin the provisions of this Bill.  With regard to the rest of the country, we have had Commissions inquiring into local government before this.  In particular, I would call Deputy Johnson's attention to the Public Health Council which sat in 1920 and went very fully into the question of public health administration all through the country, and it is mainly on the findings of that Commission that the present Bill is based.  I am afraid that I cannot give complete satisfaction to Deputy Cooper on this point.  We cannot have everything in this world which we desire. If we are to have the best possible system of local government in Dublin, county and city, we have to take time and trouble in finding out what kind of government and what kind of measures are more suitable for that area.  Accordingly we have to set up a Commission to inquire into that matter. At the same time it is desirable that we should have elections, but we are in this position, we have to choose between the two evils&mdash;the evil of allowing the existing conditions, which most people agree are not satisfactory, to continue without any attempt to remedy them, as against the evil of postponing the elections.  On the whole, balancing the two, I think it is better to allow the elections to be postponed until the Commission brings out its report than not to go ahead with the Commission.  It is quite possible that the Commission will have brought in its report before the next elections.</P>

    <P>(2)  Any debt or liability of a rural district council which is transferred to the council of a county by this section shall be paid or defrayed by means of the same rate by means of which such debt or liability would have been discharged before the passing of this Act, and the area of charge for the expenses of discharging such debt or liability shall be determined in accordance with the rules set out in the First Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  If any debt or liability (whether existing on or arising after the appointed day) transferred by this section to the council of a county relates to or is connected with any property transferred by this section to that council, such debt or liability shall so far as possible be paid or defrayed out of any profit or revenue received by such council out of such property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;To delete the section.&rdquo;  My reason in bringing forward this amendment is that the step which the Minister is about to make is, I believe, retrogressive, and no matter what the Minister has said to the various deputations that have waited on him in this connection, as reported in the Press, I do not think he has succeeded in convincing anybody in the State that there is any necessity for his action.  I am wondering if his decision to abolish the rural district councils is based upon any data which <Col N="679" /> have come within his knowledge from the functioning of these councils during the last three or four years, because I do not think it is a desirable thing for him to use such data, or the experience of his Department in dealing with these councils during that period.  It is within the knowledge of everybody that the councils, as at present constituted, are composed of politicians pure and simple, that the names of nominees belonging to a certain political party had, I think, to be submitted to the headquarters of that party in Dublin in the year 1920, and it is only on the political record of the particular nominee or candidate that the candidature was accepted,, and not because of his business capacity to serve on a public board.  I do not think it is fair that the Minister should use anything that has come to his knowledge, or the knowledge of his Department, in connection with the functioning of the present councils, and use it as an argument in favour of their abolition.</P>
      <P>The proposal is to abolish rural district councils and to transfer their duties, functions, liabilities, and every other thing pertaining to their office to the county councils.  Everybody in the Dáil who is conversant with the duties and functions of county councils knows, I think, quite well that th present county councils find it absolutely impossible to carry out the duties that are imposed on them.  The average agenda of a county council is made up of about thirty items per month.  My experience is, and I had it no later than yesterday, that about ten per cent. of the agenda is gone into , month after month, and the remainder is left to the officials.  I think everybody will agree in those days of supposed democracy that that is not a desirable state of affairs, and it is not fair for the Minister to come forward now in a new State and ask the county councils to take on more work than they can do, and which it can be proved to the satisfaction of everybody they would be unable to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural Districk Councils have many functions to fulfil, and in spite of what the Minister has said to the various <Col N="680" /> deputations that have waited on him, I hold that it is absolutely necessary these rural district councils should be allowed to function as at present.  That is absolutely necessary if public health and sanitary matters are to be given the attention that their importance warrants.  Because of the comparatively large representation of the various districts it is a fact that the representatives are in direct touch with the needs of the people, and it is necessary now, more than ever, that they should be, because during the Black-and-Tan regime we had the position that the various councils did not recognise the British Government, having been told not to do so, and I am very glad they obeyed the request. I think the most obvious example of what the scrapping of rural district councils will do is before us, when we remember that under the amalgamation of Unions Act the Boards of Guardinas were scrapped, and it is apparent to anybody who has any connection with public health boards, or any connection with boards of guardians, that the poor are not receiving the attention now that they got under the old Board of Guardians system.  I am not one of those who advocated the old poor law system.  I rather agree with amalgamation of workhouses.  I agree with the scrapping of the workhouse system, as we have known it, but I do not agree, and I never did agree, that the Boards of Guardians as such, should have been abolished.  As I said, the poor are not receiving the attention that they should receive.  The public health board in each county meets once a month, and the representation of each area is not sufficienct to warrant that each individual application would get the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>That is not dealt with in this section.  I merely point that out in order to try and convince the Minister that he is going to have the same state of affairs when the district councils are abolished.</P>
    <P>I think it was in the year 1898 that <Col N="681" /> the district councils were created.  They were created in response to the people's call for better representation.  I think at the time it was the popular feeling that the country should have district councils.  As I said at the beginning, I do not think it is fair, at this stage, for a young Government to come along and abolish district councils.  I think, at least, that the Minister for Local Government should postpone this proposed action until the councils have an opportunity of functioning under normal conditions.  I say that because we have not had normal conditions in this country for the past 6 or 7 years. I think the Minister will find, after some time, if this proposal passes, that there will be such a state of chaos in the different counties that he will have to do many things that will not be palatable either to himself or to the country.  To my mind, the Minister is making a countribution that will ensure that the county councils will get into such a mess as will justify him in the appointment of Commissioners in every county in the Free State.  One whether this is not what the Minister is aiming at.  I would ask the Dáil to consider carefully the proposal that is outlined in this section and to vote against what I consider to be a very retrogressive step by the government so far as the working of local bodies is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment, and in doing so I believe I am voicing the opinion of the vast majority of the people whom I represent. The Minister is alleged to have stated that the district councils are costing the Saorstát £85,000 a year.  This £85,000 is paid in salaries. The Minister is supposed to be out for economy, and the suggestion is that all this <Col N="682" /> money will be saved to the people of the Saorstát if he succeeds in abolishing the district councils.  I venture, however, to doubt whether this amount will in reality be saved.  What is to happen a district when the district councils are abolished?  Surely the Minister does not expect that the county councils will be able to do all the work that is now done by the district councils. I do not see how it can be done unless the intention is to make the position of county councillor a permanent whole-time job.  It will take the county councils their whole time if they are to transact the business that the Minister expects them to do under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Corish that at the present moment the work of the county councils is too much for them, and in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the county councils are not able to get through their agenda at the monthly meeting.  If you throw on them all the work that is at present done by the district councils what will happen?  This work has to deal with the repair and maintenance of roads, the care of pumps, and sanitary work of dispensary districts.  I wonder how many members of the county council are going to attend to all this work unless it is the intention of the Minister to see that each councillor is paid a decent salary, for he will have to neglect all his own business and devote his whole time to the administration of the affairs of the county if this Bill goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that district councils are necessary, and if the people of the district are to have a proper say in the administration the district councils must remain.  One of the few rights the people have secured is the selection of their own representatives.  They can utilise their vote by voting for the men in whom they have confidence, and the men whom they consider fit to discharge local affairs.  Does the Minister want to deprive the local people of the right of selecting their own representatives? These representatives are in the majority of cases good business men.  I quite admit that since the 1920 election the business of the district councils has not <Col N="683" /> been conducted in a manner that might be ragarded as satisfactory to the district itself or to the Saorstát as a whole. That, however, is because we have been too much wrapt up in politics.  When the district councils commenced to function in 1920 after the local elections, their first act was to swear allegiance to the Dáil.  That was the order sent down from Dáil Eireann.  the district council did not recognise the foreign power.  The idea has been bred into the very bones of the members of these district councils that they were not to recognise the British Government. They did everything they could in the way of passing resolutions against the recognition of the British Government.  Naturally they got acclimatised to the passing of these resolutions for political purposes, and they continued passing these resolutions.  I am sure if in this year an election for the district councils was held, you would find the personnel of the councils immensely improved.  I say that the Minister for Local Government is not acting justly or fairly by the people who elect these district councils. The Minister claims that the county councils will be quite capable of transacting all the business that will now fall to them.  That is to say, the county board of health, the mental homes, the agricultural and technical committees, and the work of the county council itself will all have to be done by the members of the county councils. If that is to be the case it would take at least five days in every month of the time of each member of the county council, and they would require the remainder of the month to think out the best way in which the work at these meetings should be carried through.  No man who is not paid for it could be expected to devote so much time to public matters.</P>
    <P>I quite admit that under the Bill the County Councillor will be allowed travelling expenses.  I would remind the Dáil of the resolutions against this Bill that are being passed by the various Councils in the Saorstát.  I know that every District Council in Westmeath has passed such a resolution and they are rebelling against <Col N="684" /> this Bill.  It is my conviction that the Minister for Local Government and the Government themselves will be making themselves unpopular if they insist on the abolition of the District Councils.  Up to this, every Bill passed by the Government has resulted in setting a fresh section of the public and the electorate against them.  This Bill is going to clinch the nail.</P>

      <P>I do not say that it will be clinching the nail in the coffin, but it is going to clinch the nail as far as the Government is concerned if ever there is an election again.  If you are going to abolish the District Councils you will get citizens in every district all over the Saorstát, who demand the right to elect their own representatives, up against you.  I would ask the Minister and every Deputy here to agree with the terms of the amendment. The District Councils have functioned well.  They have carried out their duties to the best of their abilities.  In some places I quite admit that there was too much of the political ideal apparent, but I may tell you that is not so in Longford and in Westmeath.  I only speak for those counties.  I can speak with authority for the District Councils in Westmeath and whatever I suggest should be done in regard to them should also be done in regard to every other district council in the Saorstát.  All the District Councils in my constituency have a great sense of their responsibility in regard to the people who elected them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they make good roads.  I repeat that the district councils there have a great sense of their responsibility.  They fully understand the necessities of the people.  They understand the requirements of the district in a proper manner, and since 1920 they have, to the best of their ability, represented the people who elected them.  I quite admit one district council resigned some time ago as a protest against a certain action on the part of the Government.  If I was a member of the council I, too, would <Col N="685" /> have resigned.  It is but right for any district council, or a county council or county board of health, to protest against any government action they resent, and to refuse to function because of some Government action of which they disapprove.</P>
      <P>This Local Government Bill is going to do great injustice, not alone to the district councils, but to the people in general.  It would merely be an injustice to those who desire to have the honour of putting D.C. after their name; it would be also an injustice to the people generally.  I am quite convinced that if the Minister succeeds in his efforts to abolish district councils, that is the rock he is going to perish on.  I am absolutely convinced, because of the resolutions that have been passed in the country and of the representations that have been made to the Minister, that if the District Councils are abolished the Government party will find it hard to secure at the next election one-quarter the amount of support they got at the last.  It might happen that the very people whom you are seeking to prevent being elected on district councils could be elected to this assembly, and they might become Ministers of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Corish's amendment.  I would like to point out that the district councils that were functioning during the last four years were not there altogether to carry out business as it used to be carried out, but they were there as a war necessity.  They were called upon to assist the army of the day, and both that army and the old councillors responded to the call.  For that reason the way in which they functioned during the last four years should not be taken as a criterion or as a reason why we are going to abolish rural councils altogether.  The people of the country in general are in favour of retaining the councils, and I think that is is but democratic that any Government should govern according to the wishes of the majority of the people.  As Deputy Corish suggested, I would be inclined to think that the Minister should postpone this Bill and give those <Col N="686" /> bodies a further trial during the next three years, now that we are going to have a fair election.  The people should be allowed to choose their administrators for the coming three years.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Lyons pointed out, it would be very hard for the people of a district to be looking after county councillors.  The county councillor would much rather go to district councillors of their own choice who would know the needs of the district and who would be conversant with the need for, say, a water supply or other sanitary arrangements in the district. The people with local knowledge would be able to avoid the type of person who might otherwise be able to use his purse in a certain direction, and whom the local representative would not tolerate or allow to be tolerated. Any claim for trespass that would be committed over a cottage plot, or any claim in connection with a water supply, would be better known to the local representative than to the man who would be 10, 12 or 15 miles away. The Minister should seriously consider postponing this Bill in order to give a further trial to the present members of those councils who are carrying out local administration.  Under the 1898 Act an opportunity was given to the Irish people to show that they were fit to govern themselves.  Now, they are told that they are not fit to govern themselves and that the councils are to be abolished.  In turn the county councils will be abolished, and by some Divine act you will find this place will have to be abolished.  I think it would be much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I appeal to the Minister to postpone this Bill.  Six months ago here one evening the Bill was adjourned; it was rather a sudden adjournment and we are not a bit the worse for it since.  I would suggest that instead of abolishing the councils we should amalgamate them and get the clerks of one council to do the work of two or three others.  In County Cork, the largest county in Ireland, and the place where they have the best people, we have three or four rural councils with £100,000 of a valuation. <Col N="687" /> Two or three of them would make a nice county, and two of the clerks would be able to do the work.  If you bring them all in under the county council you will have a clerk or two for every rural district that will be coming in, and you will have to enlarge the different courthouses because there will be no room for the clerks and the books otherwise.  Every move we are now supposed to make is for the purpose of economy.  I do not believe this move tends towards economy.  I think the Minister and his staff, together with the Cabinet, should consult and draft a scheme of amalgamation or otherwise adjourn this Bill and give a further trial for three years to the existing councils.  They should do that rather than bring the guillotine down on the first instalment of self-government that we have got from the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment moved by Deputy Corish.  I wonder what case the Ministry proposes to put up for the step now proposed?  I think it is a revolutionary measure, this Local Government Bill, in so far as it affects Rural District Councils.  As far as I know, the Government has got no mandate from the people to go ahead and take such a far-reaching step as it now proposes to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does he hoep to achieve by abolishing them?  What is the real reason for this project to abolish Rural District Councils?  What is the real reason for centralising Local Government and putting all the work on the County Council?  If the Minister had any experience of County Councils and of the work they have been doing for a number of years, he would realise that at the present time they are not able to cope with the business they have to discharge, without the addition of the work of the Rural District Councils.  What actually happens at most County Council meetings is that there are from 16 to 20 or 30 items on the Agenda.  Three, four or five hours are taken up by discussing the first three or four items and the rest of the business is rushed through <Col N="688" /> in half-an-hour, in order to give County Councillors an opportunity to catch their trains for home.  I submit that is not a satisfactory way of doing business, and it will lead to a lot of confusion if the Minister insists on putting through this section which proposes the abolition of Rural District Councils.  Further, there is the point that Deputy Daly alluded to to be considered. You want to have on the Councils men who are in touch with the people.  If Rural District Councils are abolished, as Boards of Guardians have been abolished, the whole work of the county will fall on a few members of the County Council.  Of course, the Minister will get up and tell us that there are thirty or forty members of a County Council.  But we all know that it is very difficult at most County Council meetings to get even a quorum. What will actually happen is that very large districts in each county will have no representative at all.  I think the time of the Government and of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would be much better occupied in trying to provide work for the people of the country, and trying to bring about some kind of stability and security, than in going ahead with this proposal to abolish Rural District Councils. That proposal could be very well left over until there is time to go into the matters calmly and in detail.</P>

      <P>I would like to break the continuity of voices that are raised against this section.  If one can judge by what we have heard this evening, the Minister must feel rather uneasy. Looking at the Bill in general, I think it aims at a satisfactory reform.  When one comes to analyse this contentious subject of the rural district councils, one is struck by the absence of any claim on behalf of those Councils that they have done good work.  No Deputy who has spoken so far has put forward that claim.  One would imagine that Deputy Daly, in his advocacy of the cause of the Rural Councils, would have pointed to the great work done by these councils in the past.</P>

      <P>In that case, I am afraid Deputy Daly was too apologetic when he got up to speak in favour of the amendment.  He might have indicated, in a slight way, some of the merits of the rural councils.  As I understand it, the essence of the Bill in connection with the reform of Local Government is the forming of the ocunties as separate units.  That is an explainable policy.  Under the various measures passed in the Dáil, such as the Courts of Justice Act, there is regard to this idea of constituting the counties separate units.  To me that appears to be a reasonable reform in administration.  One of the arguments used here is that rural councils are more in touch with their particular district than the county councils.  It does not seem to be impossible that the work not alone of the rural district councils but the other public work could be so organised on a county basis as to be generally economical and perhaps more efficient.  As far as I can see, in the Bill there is nothing to prevent a county which is over-weighted with work, forming committees to deal with any particular localities or any particular subjects.  I do think that the time has arrive when the functions of the rural district council would be better merged in those of the central body, formed to discharge the business of the county as a whole. There does not seem to me to be any reasonable justification for continuing these councils.  But I say that with great respect to the Deputies who have far more experience regarding this matter than I have.  On the other hand, timate knowledge of and their association with these bodies they have become prejudiced.  I think they have become conservative in their ideas&mdash; notwithstanding that some of them sit on the Labour Benches.</P>

      <P>I am going to support the Minister in his motion that the section stands.  I have no feeling against the rural district councils. They may have done good work in the past.  I really do not know very much about the work they have done.  I do know, however, that many sanitary matters were left under their control that would be very much better under the control of the county unit.  I feel very strongly that the sanitary laws should be co-ordinated under the central unit.  there is provision in this Bill whereby county councils can pass on sanitary work to boards of health, and the Minister has made a further wise provision whereby he has given power to the boards of health to appoint local committees to work <i>ad rem.</i> These local committees can be constituted not alone of members of the board of health but of people who are interested insanitation, and who may be co-opted.  They will be able to appoint these committees in the various districts, and to include amongst the members men who will be familiar with the particular work which the Minister will require to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Health Council appointed in 1920 were strongly infavour of getting this principle carried out, that the county council should be the unit in which the medical services, <Col N="691" /> and particularly the sanitary services, should be co-ordinated, and it is in connection with that co-ordination that I feel strongly and, therefore, I will vote against the amendment I have been told on previous occasions that these district councils were very expensive ornaments throughout the country, and that they have done very little work; if that were true it would lead me to oppose the amendment as it stands.  Deputy Corish tole us that they are capable of doing good work.  He does not claim that they did very excellent work for some time past and I do not think that any of the speakers have made out a very good case for the District Councils, but at all events I am extremely anxious that this work should be carried on by the country councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the rural district councils became an anomaly as soon as poor law union amalgamation schemes were carried through.  For three or four years I attended meetings of rural district councils and boards of guardians, and my experience was that the board of guardians met every week for something like three or four hours, and carried through their work of the poor law.  Once a fortnight the rural district councils met for about half-an-hour. I think that nearly everybody <Col N="692" /> who has had experience of the rural district councils would say that their work occupied a very small amount of time, and was of relatively very minor importance.  So long as you had a board of guardians the guardians had to have offices, and a clerk, who was clerk also to the rural district council, so that there was no great reason for abolishing whatever little jurisdiction the rural district council had.  But now that the guardians have been abolished, and that a special clerk must be maintained for the rural district council, and that elections have to be carried through for that body at considerable expense, I certainly think it should go.  I think it is desireable from the whole point of view of local government to extend the jurisdiction of the county councils.  It is difficult in the case of the rural district councils to get your personnel of as good quality as the county councils.  In the average county you find difficulty enough in getting a really good county council, and in getting the requisite number of councillors of the proper quality to come forward.  Many men who would be desireable county councillors cannot afford time, or for various reasons are of rural district councils the diffiulties are increasing.  It is much more difficult to get men of the right stamp to come forward.  Even if you cannot get men of the better stamp, it does not tend to business like efficiency to have these men coming together with very little to occupy them.</P>

You have these bodies meeting with very <Col N="693" /> little work to do and in public life it is an undesirable thing to have a body passing resolution about everything from the action of the French Government to that of the British Government and to the Saorstát Government instead of attending to the things that they are elected for.</P>

      <P>Times have altered. There is no case at all for the maintenance of the rural district councils now except that they can create a great deal of clamour.  Every person on them is liable to be roped in for the passing of resolutions against this Bill and this particular clause.  I have known boards which have been disbanded in another way, and even those who criticised most in advance and wished to Heaven that they were abolished, when the actual abolition came were a little sore about them.  Members of district councils who believed that the bodies served very little purpose could be roped in to pass resolutions against this particular section.  I think no attention need necessarily be paid to those expressions of opinion.  From people not connected with these bodies, I have heard no opposition to their abolition. Any opposition I heard came from members of the rural district council or perhaps from officials of the rural district councils, who did not represent any real body of opinion in the country so far as I could gather.  To talk about this being a retrograde step and undemocratic has no foundation at all. The county councils are a democratic as the rural councils; the franchise is the same.  There is nothing undemocratic in removing a minor body whose functions can be well transferred elsewhere. The matter of the congestion of the business of the county councils is <Col N="694" /> another question.  That is a matter of procedure and system, and the addition of the little bit of work done by the rural district councils will add nothing appreciable to the congestion of the county council business.  I say that in dealing with the local bodies the whole question of procedure will have to be very seriously considered.</P>
      <P>It was problem here in theDublin Corporation.  It is bound to be a problem in any big Corporation, and probably will be in the county councils.  It may be desirable that there should be some division of executive and legislative functions so far as these bodies are concerned.  I do not propose to suggest at the moment how it can be done, but I do believe that the work could be more efficiently managed if a smaller number of persons were delegated to consider matters and make definite proposals in advance.  I am positive, from what I have seen of the working of all sorts of locally elected bodies&mdash;and it was my misfortune to attend a great number of them at one time&mdash;that it would be very easy to economise time and get the work of the councils much better done by really giving more attention to devising a proper system of transacting business.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance argues a good deal from the experience he has gained in the work of the administration of rural district councils.  The amendment of Deputy Corish would cover the amendments that I have on the same section, and I want to say that I would to put Deputy Sir James Craig's mind at ease so far as my point of view is concerned, by telling him that I would centralise in one body the work of sanitation and public health within the county.  I would not be prepared to support Deputy Corish's motion on the understanding that district councils were to continue to exist and to function just as they are at present.  With that I would not be in agreement, but Ido believe that the work of district councils might be and could be very easily arranged in such a way as to suit the needs of the district and make administration <Col N="695" /> by rural district councils a success.  The abolition of district councils&mdash;what will that mean to a county?  I cannot agree that Deputy Heawat would be in a good position to judge the effects on a county.  Deputy Daly mentioned the County Cork.  In a county, whether it be large or small, where all local administration is to be centralised&mdash;the public health services, the county home, sanitation, county roads, district roads and many other works, that the county councils will, under the new system, be called upon to perform&mdash;it will really mean that very many people will lose all interest in local government, and very naturally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will mean that from one district, perhaps forty or fifty miles from the centre, as is the case in some counties, you may have one or two men coming away from that district, representing hundreds and thousands perhaps, of ratepayers, to spend thousands and thousands of pounds.  If these men are to do the work of that district and represent the people properly, they will first need to be men certainly of more than average ability and they will have certainly to give more than half their time to the work of local half their time to the work of local administration. I cannot see any counties where you can find such public-spirited men as those, nor can I see any countries where you can have the county councils composed of men of the calibre you will require to do this work.  There is no use in arguing that the new County Councils will be composed of men better educated, more intelligent, and with better public sprit than our District Councillors. They will not.  You will have but a few of this type on every County Council.  You have them to-day, you will have them to-morrow and they will composed of the same type you have got on District Councils&mdash; nothing better and nothing worse.  If failure in the past because of the type charged with their administration, the County Councils of the future cannot be, by any stretch of imagination, a success, because the same people will have to do the same work.  There is no <Col N="696" /> use in saying from that point of view things will be better done.  There is the question of economy and it is argued that the abolition of Rural District Councils, the saving on elections, and the saving of the salaries of officials will mean economy.  I can see no reason if district councils are to continue in existence why the District Council and County Council elections could not be held on the one day. That would not mean any additional expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the argument falls to the ground.  As regards the question of the saving of the salaries of officials, I do not think even the Minister for Local Government can say that the work which the District Councils have been doing, and even the little they are doing to-day, will not have to be paid.  We may, it is true, dispense with the present officials; we may give them pensions. But are we to give them large pensions and create new positions for other men and after a time give them pensions?  And mind you, we have done that already by legislation in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has told us that from his experience, outside the members of the district councils and some interested officials, there is no great volume of opinion against it. When the sixpenny delivery charge was introduced there was no great volume of public opinion against it, but Deputy Cooper and others, and even the Minister himself, recognise now that there is a volume of opinion against it.  Perhaps after a little bit when district councils cease to exist and some of the work they have done in the past, however badly, is no longer done, then we will have public opinion very strongly the other way.  Let us take one or two of the services that might be administered, and very well administered, by rural district councils. First, let us take our county councils. They are charged with the administration <Col N="697" /> of the roads.  I do not know except what we hear generally, what some county councils do in this respect. My experience of road administration in one or two counties is that our county councils are doing the work rather badly and not at all in a satisfactory manner, and I am afraid that complaint is becoming very general. What is more, they are only making an effort to keep the county roads in repair. The main roads are very badly maintained.  The bye-roads and the district roads are receiving absolutely no attention, largely because all the money that could be grabbed is expended on the main roads, and the poorer rural districts get no attention at all.  What will we find later on? We have the district councils ar present, it is true, having some control over the administration of district roads, and because of the district rating, they are able to get roads now and again made in the backward rural districts, but which go to the homes of men who are often very large rate-payers and who have not got the advantage of living perhaps near highways and have to go across all sorts of inconveniences, and these men very often never travel on main roads in the county, towards the upkeep of which they are paying.  Under the present administration we have the county roads a county charge, and we have a man who is 60 miles away on the top of a mountain paying for the upkeep of roads he has never seen and probably will never see.  That is the position to-day, whereas the district roads&mdash;which might be of service to them and are really&mdash;they get for the rates they pay, are getting no attention at all.  Under the new arrangement with the abolition of district councils, can we expect that things will improve? Certainly not.  From my point of view, as I see things, there will be no consideration at all as everything will be centralised.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there may be some improvement with regard to our main roads. Perhaps, I say.  I hope there will. What about the district roads?  Special works will be entirely forgotten.  Taken the administration of County Home <Col N="698" /> Help, Outdoor Relief, as it was formerly known.  Unfortunately it has become a very serious charge on rate-payers in every county, and I am inclined to the view that it has become a serious and heavy charge because there is not that local supervision that there used to be.  I think that the time of a rural district council and the salaries that its officials are to be paid would be very well spent in meeting once a fortnight, or even once a month, if only for an hour or two, to supervise that service.  In fact, I believe it is absolutely essential, to administer this service properly, that there must be a local committee for every district.  There are cases of injustice, and I have known them myself.  Some people have not beengiven assistance, though they ought to have got it, and in other cases people have been given county assistance who have no need of it.  That is all because there is not that local knowledge and that local wupervision that there should be.  Remove your rural district council and you have nobody in existence to do the work.  Perhaps it may be suggested that committees are to be established.  I do not know. If you are going to establish a committee in a district, you must have an official to that committee who will bring them together to a meeting.  You certainly cannot put that on the registrar of a County Home Committee.  If you did, it would be necessary that he should take himself away to the district and incur expense.  If you have not an official these people cannot meet.</P>
    <P>I do agree that there is need for reconsidering the position as regards rural district councils.  They should not be permitted to continue as they are at present.  I believe their duties ought to be reconsidered, and they ought to be allocated work that will be suitable for them, that they are capabl;e of doing, and that will be better administered by them by any county council, however capable and however representative it may be.</P>

      <P>I am wondering, as I was wondering last Thursday night, on the motion of Deputy Nagle, whether there is any use in making representations from these benches. <Col N="699" /> The Minister for Finance asked what good work had the councils done.  If he reads the files of the old newspapers from 1898 onwards, he will see that the district councils have been praised for the work they have done since they were set up by the British Government. That is a well-known fact.  He twits us also on the way that they have carried out their duties since 1920.  It comes very well from the Government Benches to twit councils that have done the work that has set up this Parliament here.  Further, the Minister, in speaking about those who are in opposition to the abolition of the councils, said that they were mostly district councillors themselves, and perhaps officials of the district councils.  I would like to ask the Minister what body of opinion is behind him, or where was his plot hatched to do away with the representation of the plain people. Where was it hatched, or what mandate has he for it?  He has no mandate from the people.  This was given to us by the British Government, and I say that it is a retrograde step for any Irish Government to bring in such a proposal without consultation with the people.</P>
      <P>If the work of the county councils is to be carried out like the work of the boards of health throughout the country I think it is time to cry halt.  Yesterday I was in Naas.  There were forty or fifty people, men willing to work, who could not get a penny of home help, or any money from the Unemployment Exchange in Newbridge.  It is time for the Minister of Industry and Commerce and for the Minister for Local Government to look to it and see that the people do not turn against everything that stands for civilisation in this country, for that is what it means, and this, I suppose, will be the final step in turning the people against the Government.</P>

      <P>They would know something of the nature of a Parliament, an assembly of the wisest in the land.  They might not entirely recognise it in its present form, but they would know that it was something of that kind.  I did not make the point merely as a party point; I made it because the Rural District Council was based on a condition of affairs that existed in the country districts in England fifty or sixty years ago, where you had a comparatively large number of persons of private means who were able and willing to render public service and to give a certain amount of time to it.  That condition hardly ever existed in Ireland.  It existed to a limited extent in the case of Grand Juries.  That was a class from which the members of our Rural District Councils were largely drawn in England at the time the Act of 1898 was passed.  These members existed to a limited extent in Ireland.  They have now, to all intents and purposes, ceased to exist.  That is why the Rural District Councils have not functioned successfully, because the men who could afford to give their time, who could afford to study matters, have not been forthcoming.  It is no discredit to the small farmer to say that he could not give the time to read what was being done in other countries, even in other counties, in regard to public works, and that he could not follow the theories of local government in the same way as Deputy Johnson has done.  It is no discredit to them that they were not in a position to do <Col N="701" /> it.  Deputy Baxter propounds the theory that because you cannot get enough suitable men, the best thing is to get a large number of unsuitable men; that because you have no really first-class men, therefore you should have a large number of second-class men sitting on Rural District Councils. I do not quite follow that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly a possibility.  I am coming to that in a minute.  I just wanted to deal, inadequately perhaps, with Deputy Baxter's point.  Deputy Baxter said that there are certain vested interests.  Whatever problem you deal with you always have vested interests.  They should be dealt with justly, and even generously, but if you are going to allow the fact that certain people have vested interests, that certain people are employed in certain jobs, you will never get anything done if you lay down the theory that these people must enjoy their jobs to the end of their days.  The Minister for Finance has spoken about Article X of the Treaty and how he is hampered by it.  If you are going to admit vested interests as a reason for doing nothing, then there is no progress of any kind. Deputy Baxter interested me very much when he laid down the suitable services which a rural district council might perform, because I thought we were then getting to the kernel of the matter.  But, in the long run, he only mentioned two.  He mentioned roads. I think the general trend of opinion is that roads should be a centralised service, possibly even more centralised than they will be under this Bill.  Once <Col N="702" /> you begin, it is frightfully hard to differentiate.  You can begin to quarrel as to what is a main road and what is a county road.  You will at once create an enormous amount of new problems. The other that he mentioned was a thing I call by the name that is familiar to me, out-door relief.  Out-door relief is a thing which, I am afraid, sometimes goes by canvassing, and whether it will be advantageous to give an applicant for out-door relief eighty people or twenty-five people to canvass, instead of two or three county councillors who live in the neighbourhood, I do not think it desirable.  I do not think that Deputy Baxter quite made his case there, though perhaps he will amplify it, because I came to this discussion with my mind more or less open; I did not give any pledges in either direction, and I was prepared to listen to the arguments and weigh between them.  I think that all the functions that Deputy Baxter intended the rural district councils to perform could be equally well performed by sub-committees of the county councils, but the mistake that is being made by a great many county councils at the present day of putting all their members on every sub-committee, or almost all, and making their sub-committees far too large and far too unwieldy must be avoided.  The only result in that case is that the sub-committee meets and debates a thing, and the county council then meets and debates it all over again.  That is a mistake that I think exists in many county councils, and if the Minister could discourage them in that I think there would be more efficient administration.</P>
      <P>Finally, Deputy Baxter said there would be a lack of interest in local government, as there would be only one body like the county councils to deal with those things.  If in County Cavan there are only two men who can come here to attend to the business, and if Deputy Baxter does not get many letters from his constituents, I am bound to say that I find that my constituents take an interest in what could be done here, or what might be done.</P>

If people are interested in the state of the roads and in sanitary matters they will take an interest in the county councils.  When a man is getting anything done he is interested.  I do not believe there will be any real falling off of interest in local government.</P>

      <P>Good drafting is, I understand, responsible for placing this very contentious section amongst the first in the Bill.  It would be much easier for us, in this debate, if the section came towards the end of the Bill, because the abolition&mdash;I prefer to refer to it as amalgamation&mdash;of rural district councils is not the cause but rather the effect of the various provisions in the Bill.  The result would be, or we hope the result will be, a centralising of the various functions under the county authority, which anyone who gives deep consideration to the matter must realise would be better performed by one central authority than by several who cannot give them the same specialised attention.  This Bill is, to a great extent, consequential upon the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1923.  That Bill did away with boards of guardians, and centralised their duties in boards of health.  To some extent the duties performed by boards of guardians, were centralised in and performed by rural district councils. They had the same personnel as the rural district councils, except that probably the work performed by the guardians was a good deal more important. It certainly took a good deal more time.  At present you have this position&mdash;that men elected to perform various duties, and officers appointed and paid to carry out these duties, are now only doing about one-fifth of what they were originally appointed to do. The bulk of their duties is concentrated in the central authority, and the result is you have overlapping at every point.  That is uneconomic and unsound.</P>

      <P>The principal duties of the Boards of Guardians were in relation to what was called the curative side of public health.  These duties have now been transferred to the County Board of Health.  The Rural District Councils are carrying on the duties in regard to the preventative side of public health, mainly sanitation, to a great extent initiating policy with regard to roads, carrying out duties with regard to the collection of rent and repairs to labourers' cottages.  This Bill will abolish the office of Superintendent Medical Officer of Health in a rural sanitary district and will concentrate the duty in a county medical officer.  This officer will be a whole-time medical officer with very high qualifications and with experience in public health matters.  He will be in a position to carry out all the public health duties of the county very efficiently and very economically.  Once this officer is appointed it will be extremely difficult to differentiate public health duties from those of a curative and preventative kind.  The duties of a curative character include such items as dispensary medical treatment, medical attendance, nursing and medical attendance, hospital treatment in county infirmaries or cottage hospitals, sanatoria, fever and mental hospitals. On the preventative side public health includes such matters as sanitation, water supplies, housing, control of infectious diseases, medical inspection of school children, dental <Col N="705" /> inspection, care of expectant and nursing mothers, administration of Dairies and Cowsheds' Order, inspection of food, etc.  It will be seen that in practice it would be very difficult to differentiate between these two categories, and it would be ridiculous to expect that a county medical officer could perform or look after one of these sets of functions and various nondescript local authorities looking after the remainder.</P>
      <P>Unification of these services is also necessary, because, even if it were a practicable proposition, it would mean greatly increasing expenses.  You would have establishment charges both for the central body and for the various local or minor authorities.  It is also necessary to enable this and other full-time officers to be appointed throughout the country, thereby increasing efficiency and having the duties performed with much greater economy.  If you leave the present system in being you can only carry on the duties of the various public health services by the appointment of numerous half-time officers who will, of course, perform them much less efficiently than men who can give their whole time to the work.  That is the reason why at the present time the public health services in this country are maintained at anything but a high standard.  We have really no method of co-ordination and no officers who are devoting their whole time to the work.  If the health of the people is to be properly looked after, and if food is to be produced in a condition that will enable this country to continue in competition with the food products of other countries it will be necessary to have control of sanitation and health services so that food production will be on a much higher level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for public health.  With regard to roads, when he had a Second Reading of this Bill most of the Deputies seemed to be in favour of even going further with regard to centralisation than this Bill goes, and I found the same view seemed to prevail with regard to the General Council of County Councils.  So far as popular opinion is concerned, it seems to be unanimous in agreeing that the functions <Col N="706" /> of those bodies can be better performed by a higher authority than the rural district council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what they had to do with it seeing that they are municipal authorities.  There are about 200 local authorities at the present time concerned with road administration in the country.  The bodies charged with the administration of the roads approached the question from the wrong angle, and I might say that Deputy Baxter's statement seemed, to me, to savour of the same weakness. They approached the standard from the petty and local point of view.  It was not a question of providing the best kind of road for the community in general.  It was a question of providing the best kind of road to the house of the rural district councillor or to some small area of very little national importance.  The point has been raised about not having any sanction for introducing this measure.  With regard to the Public Health Council of 1920, I might say before they met, a body primarily concerned with the administration of poor relief in the country, recommended the centralisation of those services and also the appointment of a county medical officer. This policy of centralisation has been in the minds of those intimately in touch with local government matters at least since 1909.  The question of public health did not come before any Commission especially as such until 1920.  The Report of that Commission was altogether in favour of such centralisation.</P>
      <P>The following are extracts from the Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section XXX. &mdash; Attention has already been drawn to the absence <Col N="707" /> of co-ordination in the local administration of the Public Health and Medical services of the country, due to the fact that in each county there are several more or less independent authorities charged with public health and medical functions.</P>
    <P>Section XXXI.&mdash;We accordingly strongly recommend that the local unit of administration for all matters pertaining to health and medical services should be the County or County Borough, as the case may be, and that in each County and County Borough there should be established a board of health which should be the administrative health authority for the area concerned.</P>
    <P>Section XXXII.&mdash;We also consider it desirable that in each County and County Borough there should be a County Medical Officer of Health.</P>
    <P>Section XXXIV.&mdash;(a) So far as public health administration in rural areas is concerned, it appears to us that there would be little difficulty involved in, and considerable advantage to be derived from the transfer to County Health Boards of the powers and duties of Rural Sanitary Authorities.</P>
    <P>I might say while the struggle against the British Crown Forces was going on, this question of local government came up before the Dáil Commission, and the second memorandum of that Report came out strongly in favour of centralising those services.  On the Commission appointed to go into that question you had people of such views as Terence McSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, M. O'Callaghan, Rory O'Connor, Dr. Dick Hayes, the present Postmaster-General, the present Minister for Justice, and various other prominent men of that time.</P>

      <P>Representing popular opinion.  So it is by no means a new matter or a Party matter.  With regard to the charge that this is undemocratic. I cannot see any foundation for that. The county councils are elected on the same principle as rural district councils. <Col N="708" /> As a matter of fact, from our point of view, if we were merely trying to centralise our power it would be much better to have local authorities distributed through a lot of small bodies than have them centralised in strong influential bodies like the county council, because in a strong body they would be better able to resist us if we wanted to enforce our will on them.</P>
      <P>The present rural district area as it is constituted now is not by any means an ideal area for representing the views of the people of a locality. It is purely a haphazard area, constituted by chance.  Rural district councils have developed out of the original unions.  They came into being in 1898. When rural district councils were established, if they happened to fall within the same county, they coincided with the union areas, but if they happened to fall between two or three counties then each portion of the union area became a rural district.  The result was that you had most extraordinary differences between size, valuation, and area of these various districts.  They were never popular with the Irish people.  You never found clubs, bands, teams or any associations of that kind belonging to rural districts.  They have no historical or social origin.  They are purely haphazard, geographical expressions. There has been another point raised about county councils not being able to do all the work given to them. Under this Bill they will really have no extra work.  At present the county councils have to deal with the roads, and the rural district councils also have functions with regard to the roads. The rural councils initiate proposals and the county councils have to pay. In a great many cases the county council has to re-submit the proposals of the rural councils for revision.  In 1921 a certain rural district council unanimously passed proposals for thirty-nine roads.  Thirty-one were rejected by the county council and, I understand, that at least two were nothing more than avenues leading to the houses of rural councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any charges against the Roscommon County Council, but if you have corruption it is better to have one corrupt body rather than twenty.  As a matter of fact the abolition of these councils will take a great deal of work off the county councils with regard to roads, and will also take a great deal of work off the shoulders of the county surveyor, who has to attend all meetings of the rural district council where these proposals are brought forward. I understand that in some cases out of three hundred working days the county surveyor has to spend one hundred in listening to proposals at these rural councils.  The only result of these two hundred authorities dealing with roads is that Ireland is the most &ldquo;over-roaded&rdquo; country in Europe and maintained in the worst manner.  The area at present under roads amounts to the size of an average county.  There may be some sense in the argument that the county boards of health will have a good deal of work under this Bill.  They will have more work than the county councils, because all the public health duties will be concentrated in them, but they have power to appoint committees which will relieve them of much work.  We have power under the Bill to create as many boards of health in the county as are <Col N="710" /> considered necessary.  The fact that we are appointing a county medical officer in each board of health area will also considerably relieve the elected personnel from work.  He should be able to give advice to elected representatives on all matters pertaining to public health and to keep them in touch with several matters about which at present they are not in a position to get information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking the language of Deputy Hewat and using his identical words, I may say that I feel it necessary to renew continuity and restore communications with my friends.  I favour the amendment to delete the section.  When you come to such a great question as local government you have to view every principle in the clear light of reason, to sum up the equities, to balance them and to submit everything to very deep criticism.  What strikes me in all this thing and what I gave expression to last week was that liberty is not an incorporeal abstraction, and while I admit that democracy does not perhaps represent absolute liberty it is in this country, at least, if not the equivalent, the substitute.  What is democracy? Does it not mean the delegation of responsibility?  That is the essence of democracy.  That, too, is the underlying principle of all local administration.</P>
      <P>When you have a district council with its members elected from a small area and responsible to a small electorate you will find, and I believe it cannot be denied, that such councils are far more efficient and the councillors take greater pains to represent the people who elected them than you could have in a large body where the representatives are elected over a more extended area and with a diminished and divided responsibility to the people.  I think it was Solomon who said that in a multiplicity of counsellors there is wisdom and safety.  I submit that in these instances there is safety for the councillors but not for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's idea has been more or less to go on with a policy of centralisation. He has taken the county as the unit.  Why did he not take the <Col N="711" /> nation?  Why did he not take the principle to its logical conclusion?  After all, the county is only an arbitrary line drawn.  If he were to take the nation he would have carried not alone his logic to its fullest extent, but he would, in addition, perhaps, have shown the more substantial advantages of a centralising policy than by taking this arbitrary line of demarcation, or this piece of territory which it encloses, and which we call a county.  He says we must abolish district councils.  I am afraid in this matter he gives a somewhat pedantic adhesion to the formula of centralisation.  In my opinion, district councils have done very good and useful work, and no case has been made out in the Dáil why they should be extinguished.  I am sure every Deputy will agree with me when I say that district councils have been rather a training ground for local administrators, and that deprived of that ground many men without experience in public life would be handicapped if they were sent to a larger body with far more onerous and exacting duties to discharge than in the district councils.</P>
    <P>Another point which seems to have been overlooked is that these county councils elected for very large areas can hardly be regarded as representative. I admit the Minister says he is giving twice the number of representatives to them.  But, after all, twice the number will really make the county council machine more ineffective, because you will have a greater volume of talk&mdash;in fact you will have a body constituting itself as a wee Dáil, and, like the Dáil, with bushels of words but giving a poor return.</P>
    <P>The case for the abolition of rural district councils has been based largely on the doings of the last three or four years, but, as Deputy Daly, I think it was, pointed out, that is an abnormal period, and it is not a fair criterion, and it is not right to draw the conclusion that because they were a failure for the past four years they are no longer needed, or that they can fulfil no useful role.  I say that they have been a failure for the last four years, and I make no hesitation in saying <Col N="712" /> that if I were to epitomise, to summarise, the careers and write perhaps epitaphs of these councils during the past four years, I would say: &ldquo;They were born, they lived, they were wretched, and they died; they were more damned in the world they went to than in the world they left.&rdquo;  It is because the present bodies are not representative that the demand has been put up for their abolition, but we should separate the general from the particular.  The theory of local administration is sound, but the men and the methods are wrong.  That is what is at fault, and it is no justification, and represents an obvious confusion of thought on the part of the Minister or his party, to contend that because the system under its present administrators has failed it needs to be extinguished.</P>

I have a hazy impression that he said they were more or less a failure. So strongly do I feel on this matter, I would say that instead of abolishing the rural councils their jurisdiction should be enlarged.  You will have that large body, the county council of the future, really responsible to nobody, or at least whose members will only to an extent share in a large and undefined responsibility to an enlarged electorate.  If the proposed county councils are to function with any degree of success, it really represents a whole-time job.  It is true that it is no longer an honorary profession. The principle of payment is involved, and it is admitted in the Schedule to the Bill.  To allow county councillors travelling expenses and subsistence allowances is desirable, theoretically.</P>

Very few, and the result of this manipulation will be that the most undesirable men in any county will set themselves up for election, and they will gravitate towards any place where money can be had.  Even the little sum allowed for travelling expenses will to many, I am afraid, become a lure.  That is perhaps taking a very cynical view of human nature, but I defy anyone to deny its correctness.  In addition, although the careers of the rural district councils are to be terminated, their duties continue, as the Minister can see by Section 4: &ldquo;If at any time when any powers, duties, property, or liabilities are transferred to a county council by this Act.&rdquo;  That, presumably means that certain powers and duties would be transferred, and that they must still be exercised.  The idea has been expressed that it will mean more economical administration.  I deny it.  The Bill provides for a superannuation scheme.  Every clerk of a rural district council can come out under very favourable terms, but the county or the district will be saddled with his pension, though according to Section 4 the powers, duties, etc., must still be carried on.  That will mean that you must appoint a new man; in other words, the county or district will be paying two men while getting one man's service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Cooper wanted to make out that people in the country were taking a very large share of interest in the work of the Dáil, I doubt if such a thing can, with any fairness, be applied to a county council.  The work there will be largely done in the dark. I do not suppose the Provincial Press can give their columns week after week to reports of proceedings, and lots of things will be done, and perhaps expenditure will be incurred, which the people would not publicly justify and which they would resent.  They might be things, perhaps, which they would make the strongest representations <Col N="714" /> against.  Again, too, all that would go on in the dark, whereas in the district council the news of the proceedings trickles through faster.  It is open to people to make very strong representations and objections to proposed expenditure. In those county councils there is at all times a general idea that the expenditure can be thrown over a very large area of charge, and they have not such a direct responsibility and they need not be so watchful.  That is a well-known fact that cannot be disputed.  Some Deputy raised the point, and I quite agree, that the county councils will not be able to afford the necessary time to debate all the problems that come before them.  What then?  The work will be largely delegated to their officials.  What does that mean?  It means the ascendancy of bureaucracy in this country, a thing which we must be out to prevent.  It will certainly mean the ascendancy of bureaucracy.  I know that what is said on those Benches will fall on deaf ears. The Minister has a dense phalanx&mdash;and I leave him to interpret the word &ldquo;dense&rdquo;&mdash;behind him, against which reasoned argument and eloquence plead in vain. I feel obliged to say of this proposal to abolish the district councils that it is not a popular demand.  No Deputy seeking election to the Dáil last year demanded it, and I challenge the Minister to take a plebiscite at the present time on it.  I even ask him to withdraw the party machine and give a free vote to the Dáil on this thing.  I deny that this proposal is put forward in the interests of advantages that would result from a change.  Rather is it the idea of a prurient mind, seeking innovation and seeking to remodel every form and every department of our public life.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the sins of the old district councils.  I am going to read an extract to show what these changes are leading to.  If any board of guardians, 5, 10 or 20 years ago, had such a report as I am about to read to you, it would create considerable comment. I am only giving this report as an illustration of what the new departure means and what exactly will result from change.  I ask the Minister <Col N="715" /> to weigh this well.  It is the report of a sworn inquiry into the working of the county hospital at Ennis, one of the hospitals set up under the amalgamation of Unions in 1922:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Following the Inquiry, I visited this hospital and was much displeased with the general conditions prevailing.  The floors and windows were dirty; the beds were not properly made; the bed linen in many cases was no longer fit to receive patients, and milk was laid in large quantities here and there, and in a manner sufficient to neutralise its purpose.  The floors and basins in the operating theatre were dirty. Temperatures and pulses were not in all cases registered, and empty bottles, jars, boxes, etc., were to be found in all directions, adding to the general neglect and confusion.  There are seven nurses engaged here, too many, in my opinion, but from this number you would expect much better results.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The section we are dealing with does not merely say that on and after a certain day the Rural Council shall cease to exist.  It goes beyond that, because it says that the <Col N="716" /> powers and duties of those Rural District Councils shall be conferred on the County Councils.  To oppose the section does not mean to imply that we are defending or supporting a continuance, without change of any kind, of the Rural District Councils.  We are sensible enough to know that fifteen or twenty years' experience of the working of the Rural District Councils may well lead to the conclusion that some changes in the powers and functions and of the administrative area of these councils might require alteration. But there is a far cry between modification and alteration of the functions and powers of the Rural Councils and saying that they shall cease to exist and and powers shall henceforward be transferred to the County Councils. We have to defend the proposition that the County Council is the body which should administer the affairs of the Rural District Council.  Everything that has been said in criticism of the working of the Rural District Councils within the last few years has been said by the Minister and by other Deputies in the Dáil regarding the working of the County Councils, and for the same reason, to a very great degree, that they were elected in great part not for the purpose for which they were originally designed, but elected for one purpose and one purpose only&mdash;to smash the Local Government machine as administered by the British authority.  They did that efficiently. That does not mean to say that you have a right to denounce the machine which was elected for an entirely different purpose because the new people have not worked it to your entire satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the argument in favour of this section has not been sustained, and the onus of abolishing the rural district councils and transferring their powers to the county councils is upon the people who are proposing that change.  We cannot avoid noticing that this particular section is in harmony with the other sections of the Bill and tending to what we have already denounced, the centralisation of local authority nominally in the county councils, but actually in the officials of the county councils.  The Minister has <Col N="717" /> based his case upon the desirability of centralising the administration of roads and public health.  If that were all to be said, that to centralise the administration of roads and public health services it was essential to transfer all the powers of the rural district councils to the county councils in the way that was proposed here, then the Minister would make a case.  But there is no necessity whatsoever for that.  What is happening here is that you are removing from the people in the rural area any control over matters affecting their local government.  The Minister says that the county council is no less democratic than the rural district council, because it is elected on the same franchise.  The Minister has a very narrow and shallow conception of democracy if that is what he puts forward as a defence of the democratic character of this Bill.  It was a Frenchman who took a plebiscite, I think, to have himself elected as Emperor.  He might call it democracy, but I doubt the applicability of the term.  Simply because you have people elected to do certain things, you hand over to them all power, and deprive the people of any continuous interest in their local government.  That is the antithesis of democracy, in my opinion.  That is the tendency of this Bill, in many of its sections, to remove from the people in their locality a continuing interest in their local services.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill for the appointment of local committees of the county councils.  There is a provision in the Bill for the appointment of local committees of public health.  But even that provision leaves it optional to the Board of health to appoint local committees.  Even then they need not be local committees.  They may be sub-committees, local or otherwise.  There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that there shall be a local interest in the administration of affairs of any particular territory.  I do not know whether Deputy Hewat is interested in the proposition that representation and taxation should go together&mdash;that there should be no taxation without representation?</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the continuance of taxation upon an area for local <Col N="718" /> purposes, without any representation of that area, or any control of that expenditure by the locality.  You have in Section 13 the possibility that new charges may be imposed upon a district, but you have removed from the local authority any right of control. In some public communication which the Minister supplied to the Press a little while ago, in justification of his proposal, he quoted the case of County Cavan, pointing out that there was wide differentiation in the size and valuation of the Rural District Councils. He quoted the district of Mullaghoran and compared that with the rural district of Cavan.  It might be some satisfaction to certain Deputies who are very keen on economy to note that the small area with a valuation of only £10,300 had a rate of 2/7 in the £, while the other district of Cavan, with a valuation of £127,000, had a rate of 5/- in the £.  Whatever might be the value of that argument it is that a small area is more economically administered.  If the Minister puts that proposition forward on the score of economy&mdash;I do not know whether that is his point&mdash;the argument is for the small rather than for the large areas.  I would very much rather that the case should be made not for economy but for efficiency of administration, which is not the same as economy.  I do not think that any case is being made&mdash;and certainly very few people have been convinced&mdash; that the method of administration and amalgamation of unions, and the like, within recent times, has really led to efficiency.  All I can hear is that the contrary is the fact.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance said the only people who were interested in this matter and stood for the defence of the Rural District Councils were the Rural District Councillors and officials of the Rural District Councils.  It is something in the recent life of this country to find out that there are any people interested in the measures that are going through the Dáil.  We had a certain <Col N="719" /> amount of interest created in one or two measures, but only in one or two, before they were passed.  The facts are that the most responsible authorities that have had to do with local government in any way have declared against the proposal in the Bill for the abolition of the Rural District Councils. It is a sound instinct that leads to that opposition, because it is realised that the tendency to bureaucracy exhibited right through this Bill is a tendency which is going to be destructive of interest in local government.</P>
      <P>It is not only the rural district councils that are threatened.  The urban district councils are also threatened. In Section 61 the Minister takes power to abolish urban district councils, to reduce urban district councils to the category of town commissioners, and to abolish town commissioners and merge towns governed by such commissioners in the county areas.  Right through the Bill there is this tendency to remove from the local area power and responsibility for the administration of its local affairs and to centralise such responsibility in the county council.  The county council is to have authority which it cannot undertake, unless it sets up officials to administer the work in the area.  You are going to have the minor locality getting its back up against the central authority, which is to administer its affairs through an official.  You are going to have a conflict right through the country between the area to be administered and the county authority.  The veterinary officer, the medical officer, and the county surveyor cannot be in every part of the county at the same time.  He will have to trust to somebody in the locality in which he is serving.  The tendency will be to create antagonism where there ought to be co-ordination and the proposition in this section to abolish the rural district council is going to intensify any antagonism that at present exists.</P>

      <P>How are you going to get the county council, even through its members or through its officials, to <Col N="720" /> take an interest, say, in the establishment of a rural library?  You are transferring all authority on every matter of local concern from the rural council to the county council.  You are not setting up a local committee of the county council.  You are going to work your local administration through officials.  How are you going to have anything like an economy of officials or a reduction in the number of officials?  How are you going to get the smaller affairs of any rural area or village considered?  I say that you are going to reduce to a point that means utter retrogression the interests that people have in the affairs of their own locality.  Instead of devolving responsibility on a locality, you are removing from the people the responsibility for good administration.  You are centralising it in the county council and inviting that council to do all its work through an official.  I say that is an entirely reactionary proposition.</P>
      <P>Instead of abolishing the rural councils the Minister would be well advised, in my view, to revise the areas of jurisdiction, increase the powers within those areas over purely local matters and also to throw greater responsibility on those smaller councils. I believe that there will be, of necessity, some kind of guiding-hand required for many years but to remove powers and responsibility from the local people is retrogressive and, in my opinion, is entirely against the trend of progress which not only deals with things but with people and the responsibility that the people have for administering their affairs.  I hope that the House will stand in favour of government by the people in their own locality and that they will accept the amendment to delete the section and impose upon the Minister, by doing that, not the retention of rural district councils in their present form but the obligation to bring in an amendment for the revision of the powers and authority and the areas controlled by the rural district councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative is not the maintenance of the rural district councils in their present form; it is to alter the Bill in such a way that it will create a <Col N="721" /> new local authority but that it will be an authority dealing with purely local matters.</P>

      <P>I rise on account of Deputy Johnson's reference to my opinion on the question of &ldquo;No taxation without representation&rdquo; and its application to this particular subject. It seems to me that the weakness of Deputy Johnson's argument is that rural district councils hardly come within that category.  The county council, if my knowledge of the procedure is right, levies the rate which maintains the rural district council in office.  I think one of the greatest absurdities and greatest weaknesses in connection with recent and present administration is that you have got bodies authorised to demand rates, which they themselves do not collect. If Deputy Johnson's argument was quite sound, you would have to make those local authorities&mdash;the rural district councils&mdash;justify their charges, by putting them on the locality that they are administering.  What do they do? They make a general charge on an irresponsible basis.  In other words, they have not to collect from the people the money they spend.  I venture to suggest to Deputy Johnson that that is a very weak spot in the present administration.</P>

That is no fault of the rural councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to contradict it in this way, that the administration proposed in this Bill will be delegated to committees.  We will have the Asylum Committee, which Deputy Hewat has probably heard of, the Board of Health, which Deputy Hewat may have heard of, and several other committees and sub-committees of the county council.  They will send up estimates in the same way as the district councils do.  It will be merely a demand in the name of another authority, so that Deputy Hewat's arguments do not amount in weight to so much chaff.  I quite agree that there is no room whatsoever for district councils in their present form: I agree with Deputy Johnson in that.  I admitted that here on the occasion of the Second Reading.  They are an anomaly at the moment.  But you provide for committees, in this Bill, under the Central Authority.  Certain services are to be attended to by committees&mdash;and that by nominated committees. The members may be wholly or partially members of the county council.  Deputy Cooper urges that greater efficiency would be secured if county councils could go outside their own body and nominate committees. Is it democratic to replace election by nomination?  Is that the policy of the Government?  If you are going to have those committees, let them be committees elected by the people.  Let them be elected and not nominated or semi-nominated.  That is a retrograde step.  I do not see what virtue Deputy Cooper discovers in nominated committees that elected committees do not possess.  If the general body of the electors is not able to elect the right men on its committees, then it is not able to elect the county council itself. The same voters are responsible in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the argument is good in one case it is good in another, and if it is wrong in one case it is wrong in the other. On the Second Reading of this Bill, and every time that it was brought up since, I made the appeal that Deputy <Col N="723" /> Johnson has made&mdash;to try to fit in those councils and elected bodies into the scheme of home help, and into the scheme of local administration.  In their present form there is no room for them, but you could give these bodies supervision of some of the services that they have not at the moment.  Why not add to their duties the supervising of the administration of home help? Have you proper administration and supervision of them now under the Board of Health?  As a nominated member of a board of health, I say you have not.  I prefer an elected body any time to a nominated body; and I prefer it from several points of view. There is no need to labour that matter.  I do not think any Deputy or public man could stand upon any platform and say he preferred a nominated to an elected body.  I can visualise a county authority with a predominating party-vote electing their sub-committees altogether from their own political viewpoint.  Take, for instance, the case of a county council of thirty-two members.  Seventeen are of one line of political thought, and fifteen are of another.  That majority is able to nominate every man they like upon the sub-committees.  I am not saying it would be done, but they could do it. That is a line that this legislation does not guard against.  It is something that the Minister and the Government ought to think about.  I am not, as I said, putting it forward as a probability, but it certainly is a possibility. Now, if the Government cannot agree, and if they will not agree, which I think more accurately represents their mentality, to extend the powers of what is known as district councils, fitting them into the schemes of home help and local administration, there is certainly no case to retain them in their present form.  But I maintain there is a case, and a strong case, to extend their powers and to fit in the local bodies, locally elected, to supervise and administer the necessary county services. I say that your proposals in this connection, as Deputy Baxter has suggested, should be reconsidered and recast.</P>
    <P>There are cases where a county has <Col N="724" /> seven or eight district councils.  Some of them cover large areas, with a valuation of £70,000 or £80,000, and perhaps more.  Others are small, because the administration of the local poor law extended over perhaps two or three counties, with the result that two or three district councils came into existence. That is a state of affairs that exists in Carrick-on-Suir, where portion of the poor law district was in Tipperary, portion in Kilkenny, and portion in Waterford.  Under the new scheme they became three separate district councils.  We say, where it is necessary to do so, do away with that position.  We say that a certain number of the councils should be retained in those districts and given power of supervision and authority.  The Government has referred to the mentality, and to the honesty, perhaps, of some of the members who composed those councils. The same argument may well apply to the county councils, both in intelligence and in honesty.  I think, if I were asked to make a choice between the intelligence and ability of the two bodies, I should naturally expect to find a better standard in the county councils.  But that is all.  They are largely composed of the same men. Generally, the men who are county councillors are also district councillors in their own districts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health made a remark that I think ought to be cleared up.  He referred to the fact that the rural councils in many counties were there for the purpose of making roads to their own residences in many cases, and certainly for the purpose of making roads of very little national importance.  Am I quoting the Minister correctly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a statement, to my mind, that ought not to be made by a responsible Minister. There may be cases&mdash;I do not know of any&mdash;where rural councillors got roads made to their own houses, but when he talks of roads of very little national importance, I would like to know what he is really talking about.  I come from a rural district of a county, and I know <Col N="725" /> the class of roads there.  The people are living on the mountains.  The Government and the county councils and local councils and central authorities made no apology for collecting rates from those people who live on the mountains as well as those who live on the highways.  There is no question of forgiving them any portion of the rates, because they live on the mountains and have no reasonable facilities for reaching their homes.  It would be very much better to give those people something like reasonable access to where they live on the mountains, instead of compelling them to use roads over which it is almost a danger to take a horse and cart, not to speak of a motor car.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells that these roads are of very little national importance. I have heard that argument in another form from the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.  The road-making principle applies also to Post delivery.  Is it the policy of the Government that the people should be removed from those inaccessible places on the mountains and brought under the cultured and intellectual influence of some of our budding statesmen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is not their policy, if they want the mountains inhabited and the rural districts inhabited, they must provide for those people what they never had before, namely, some reasonable access to the places where they spend their lives, and out of which they pay their rates.  If you think that the rural population does not deserve road or postal facilities or the same amount of State services that their more fortunate fellows enjoy, say so and we will understand you.  We are not demanding a twentieth part, or a hundredth part, of the class of road that the people of the more populous and fortunate districts have, but we will demand and we will have some reasonable approach, and we do not want that sneered at by the Minister as being a question of very little national importance.  I say that it is of the first national importance, and people have spent their lives in boreens where it is almost impossible to bring a modern vehicle.  Some people are more fortunate because, like Ministers <Col N="726" /> and some Deputies, they can afford to live elsewhere; they can afford to come up to Dublin.  But I do not think that they ought to sneer at the poor unfortunate people who cannot accommodate themselves like that, and who have to live in the country.  I ask the Minister not to force this clause, but to recast it, to continue these District Councils, and change the form; fit them in to deal with local administration, public health, and home help. Deputy Baxter talked about the supervision that existed previously.  That supervision has departed, but it has not departed for the good of the people.</P>

In County Kildare and some other counties where these gross extravagances have taken place people cry out bitterly against the recent abolition of their boards of guardians and about the institution of their boards of health, and they have reason to cry out; their increased rates is the reason.  You are going to do away with a body of officials again.  You did it in connection with your boards of guardians, but you have had to employ another swarm in place of those you dispensed with.  You will find that the officials will not be able to do the work, and that the new duties you put on to the present officials will have to be compensated for.  That is the position you will find yourselves in. You will have a duplication of officials and you will have no saving.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the whole position.</P>

      <P>The case for the abolition of rural district councils was made by the Minister for Finance. He was the only Minister who has attempted to defend the abolition of rural district councils from the Ministerial point of view, when he said that the rural district councils invariably dealt with every matter under the sun except <Col N="727" /> with what they were elected to deal with.  He told us that they passed resolutions criticising the Government of France and the Government of the Saorstát, and insinuated that many people were anxious that the rural district councils should be preserved as an institution in the country.  But he did not tell us that possibly that is the reason that the Government is anxious to abolish them, and that the criticism that comes from them as representative of the expressed wish of the people is the criticism that he wishes to avoid. The abolition of rural district councils and the putting in their place a nominated body, suggest that the County Councils might be more easily amenable to the wishes of the Government, and that therefore from headquarters you could manipulate and mould public opinion through the county councils, which would not criticise either the Government of France or of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the matter of the abolition of rural district councils there has been a good deal of theory.  We have had theorists from all the benches who suggested that their abolition was not only necessary but commendable. Has anybody who has any experience of local administration, and encountered the difficulties which face these boards, tried to visualise for himself what would be the state in a county council that would be responsible for having a directing and vetoing power over the action of all its committees? I was unfortunate enough to be a member of a board of health.  We started out with high opinions of what wonderful achievements we were going to do, that we were going to bring about the millennium, and all that sort of thing. Did we do it?  We found when we met to transact the ordinary business of the board of health that we were supposed to scan and consider carefully all the recommendations that came into us from the different bodies that were under us, that were supposed to report to us and submit their schemes for our consideration, censure or otherwise. We found that we could not possibly, if we were to deal with them all, attempt to go on with the ordinary <Col N="728" /> business of the board of health.  What have you?  You have the county councils responsible for all their work, and you will be adding another load to their shoulders, to glut their already overfull agendas, and to put them out of court altogether as bodies that would be able to do any practical work for the country.  Yet, in abolishing the district councils it has not been suggested that you should not nominate bodies to do their work.  Why should you nominate them?  Why not elect them?  If they are to be representative of the will of the people, why should they be representative only of the county councils?  Why should they not be representative of the people whose administration they are charged with?  Let us take any county council area.  And let us send a county councillor to transact the local affairs of that area in the county council.  What does he know about the local needs of every part of that large county area? Does he know the needs of a lighting scheme in some small town in that area?  Does he know the needs of a paving scheme, the needs of the paths, the needs of a water supply, or does he know the needs of the poor people in these areas?  He would need to be a travelling encyclopædia.  It is absurd to suggest he could do it.  You suggest abolishing these councils and putting in their place, not a body that would be amenable to the wishes of the people, but a body that would be nominated and only controlled by the county council, and as Deputy Gorey rightly points out, it is quite possible for any body of political thought to secure a majority on these local committees.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible to secure that and that will make the administration, administration not for the people, but for a political party.  It is true that most of the bodies at present functioning in this country were not elected.  It is perfectly true most of the county councillors and district councillors were men selected because they were supposed to have sufficient backbone and strength of character to put out of order the machine that was adopted as an administrative weapon for the control of the country.  You put in <Col N="729" /> these men because you expected they would wreck that machine then, and in putting it out of order, and doing it very effectively, they have neglected other matters, but that is not the fault of the men.  It is the fault of the struggle they went through, and it was owing to other considerations which they had to attend to that they were unable to look after local administration as closely as they might.  If you scrap the rural district councils because of the men you put into these positions you, as a matter of fact, pass a vote of censure upon yourself, because these are the men you selected yourself, and these are the men who made the machine so bad, that you suggest scrapping.</P>
    <P>We are reminded that the rural district councils are an English institution and that we should pay little heed to them because of that.  Possibly that is so.  I wish we would be logical and pay a little heed to all the other English institutions we have copied, and copied very closely.  We cannot forget that this Dáil as a matter of fact is modelled on an English pattern.  I wonder if the Deputy who spoke of the scrapping of the rural district councils because they are an English institution would suggest that we should change our mode of dress.  It is a well-known fact that it was made necessary by the English invader at one time that you should shave your upper lip.  I wonder would any Deputies suggest that we should come here dressed in kilts, wearing whiskers, and speaking the Irish language. If we were logical we would, and if the only arguments that can be put forward for the abolition of district councils are that they passed resolutions condemning the action of the Saorstát Government, in certain cases, or because the rural district councils are English institutions, I think both the Government and its supporters have failed to make their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question.  Can the Minister tell us the number of thousands of pounds extra cost for local administration, now borne by the present Government as compared with the cost of administration of local <Col N="730" /> authorities formerly for the thirty-two counties?  To my mind it costs a great many thousand of pounds more and it is all due to the amalgamation schemes put forward.  The Minister for Finance put forward the amalgamation schemes and he converted this country, that was supposed to be a nation of saints and scholars, into a a nation of pensioners.  In Co. Westmeath in 1920, the cost of superannuation was £27, but under the amalgamation scheme they have to pay £2,327.  The same thing happened in every other county.  If the Rural District Councils are abolished it will cost that much more, probably twice that much, to pay superannuation to public officials.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke to-day about appointing a county Medical Officer. A county Medical Officer will have a salary of at least £500.  At the present time in County Westmeath there are about eight medical officers and these doctors are only in receipt of about £20 each per year for this work.  That is £160 and you are going to give £500 to one man to do the work which eight men did for £20 each.  I do not say that is the whole salary of these men because of course they would not be able to live on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which I think is worth noting, that the Minister has not even said one word in favour of section 3 of the Bill.  He has not said why District Councils should be abolished.  I really think it is only an experiment on the Minister's behalf and on the part of the Government.  You may have 5 other men for whom you have not got positions. By abolishing the District Councils you say this Co. Council must be dissolved, and you do it for the purpose of putting somebody else into that position as a commissioner. I do not know whether that will suit the Minister for Finance.  At any rate it will not be economy.  It will cost you hundreds of thousands of pounds.  In the Co. Westmeath there were 9 relieving officers, each receiving anything from £60 to £65 per annum. They have been dismissed and are now getting superannuation up to £62 per annum.  The County Home had to appoint two home-help inspectors <Col N="731" /> at £250 each, and in order that these two should carry out their duties properly, the Government sent down an order that another inspector should be appointed at £360.  That would make in all £860.</P>

      <P>That is £750 anyhow, and that cannot be denied.  Of course it is amalgamation, and it is an experiment. The same thing would apply to this.  You have the clerks of the district councils and you have several engineers.  What is to become of them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council will not require the whole lot of them.  At present you have a county surveyor. You have three assistant surveyors, and are we to understand that all the engineers were acting for the district councils?  Will those be taken over by the county council, or are they entitled to superannuation?  If they are not they should be.  The Minister for Local Government has so much compassion for the county surveyors that he does not want them to be working too hard going from district council meeting to district council meeting.  So he is going to scrap the district councils in order to give the county surveyors a better time.  County surveyors are satisfied to attend those meetings. The Minister for Local Government should go to their assistance.  I hold if this Bill is passed, it will be passed against the wishes of the people, and we will see in years to come whether it will mean economy or an increase in expenditure.  Personally I think it will mean an increase in expenditure.  The Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance has not explained why we should agree to Section 3 of the Bill.  It cannot be denied that the present Local Government administration is costing this country <Col N="732" /> thousands of pounds more than the local administration cost in 1918 under another Government, and the upkeep now is only for 26 and not for 32 counties as compared with 1918.  I would like the Minister to say how much is the total cost of the administration of the 26 counties now as compared with the 32 in 1918.  The amalgamation system is not a success, and neither will this be, and I sincerely hope the Minister will have this adjourned for a time, say six or twelve months, or get the Minister for Justice to sentence this section to three years' penal servitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am against this, and I believe the feeling of this House is against the section.  I am not in favour of the amendment as it stands, because I think the simple deletion of the section and the retention of the district councils with the small power they have at present would not fulfil any useful purpose.  I believe district councils ought to be retained, and I believe the feeling throughout the country is in favour of the retention of those councils.  I think the Bill will have to go deeper into the matter, and there will have to be readjustment of the duties of the county councils as at present constituted.  If this Bill is passed the amount of work thrown on the county councils would be greater than the county councils can carry carry out.  I have been informed from many sources that, as things stand, the work to be done by county councils at their meetings is not dealt with.  Two, three, or four important items are dealt with sometimes in a cursory and casual manner, and the rest is left in the hands of permanent officials.  That is my experience of public meetings. The members then get tired and perhaps go out for a drink, so that the other business is neglected.  It has to be attended to by someone.  It is done by officials.  I am of opinion that the changes made by the Ministry are largely experimental and dangerous and that serious results may ensue.  A county council will be given extraordinary powers.  Boards of health have been given extraordinary powers of patronage and appointments.  I have <Col N="733" /> seen appointments made by boards of health since they got into power.  I think there is grave danger of corruption, and that a comparatively small board might get into the hands of a small clique who will run the county for their own ends.  The retention of district councils will not necessarily prevent that entirely, but it will to a certain extent.  I believe the Ministry has been swayed by the conditions which existed for the past few years, and the Minister and those associated with him cannot be absolved from blame. The men who manned the county and rural district councils are their nominees. If these men have not done the work as they should have done it, the Ministry cannot be absolved from responsibility. I think another chance could be given for a certain period for the normal working of the present system or some similar system, so that men elected by the free vote of the people and subject to no political pressure, should be appointed.  The people will get a chance of putting men into those bodies purely for business and economic purposes to run the councils on an economic basis.  Deputy Baxter made certain suggestions, and I would like to support him.  I think the county council is not the proper body to deal with home help.  I cannot see how the county councils can deal with home help and anyone in the country with a knowledge of local conditions knows that.</P>

      <P>I believe that home help cannot be adequately carried on under the present system. I believe it should be relegated back to the management of the local body.  If home help is to be properly administered I believe that it can only be administered by those who are in close touch with the people and who know the actual conditions.  County councils represent large districts and do not know the actual circumstances of the applicants.  They will have to depend upon officials appointed to carry on home help.  It is not advisable that the administration of home help should get almost entirely into the hands of <Col N="735" /> officials, as it will under the present system.</P>
      <P>I also agree that the maintenance of district roads cannot be properly attended to by county councils.  Such work would, I think, be more properly done by district councils.  As the system stands at present, I contend that there is not adequate work for district councils to do.  I believe the feeling throughout the country is that these councils should be retained, that there should be a readjustment of their duties, and that they should be given useful work, so as to prevent the accumulation of business for county councils&mdash;work which cannot possibly be done by an honorary body.  While I support Deputy Corish's amendment, at the same time I believe that it will not fulfil my intentions.  I believe, however, that it will be more useful than the abolition of district councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite certain that Deputy Gorey cleared up certain points that the Minister made in reply to some remarks of mine.  I want to inform the Minister that when I was making points about the administration of district roads, I was considering the question of main or trunk roads being administered by, as I think they ought to be, some sort of central authority, and district roads by some sort of district authority.  A section of the Bill states that the number of county councillors shall be increased by a number equal to twice the number of rural districts.  That means that in a county where there are seven rural districts, if the councillors in these districts are abolished the number of county councillors would be increased by fourteen.  Presumably that would mean two extra councillors from each rural district.  The section does not say that but it might mean it.  On the district councils at present we have, I should say, seven members doing perhaps a little work however trivial in their own district.  One man may try to go to a county council to do the work and represent the point of view that seven men represented in a local area. I would like to hear if the Minister holds that one man would be capable <Col N="736" /> of performing that duty.  I do not believe that it is possible.  I feel that there will be such dissatisfaction with such a system after a short time that the system would have to be altered and the present measure amended.  The Minister has made very little effort to make his case.  I think he should take into account the point of view expressed by Deputy Gorey and by other Deputies, to reconsider the position. He cannot blind himself to the fact that every Deputy here is as keen as he can be, while giving the Minister credit for doing what he thinks is best for local administration.  Still Deputies also are expressing a point of view that they think will best fit in with local requirements as being the most sensible. We cannot help remarking that not one of the Deputies behind the Minister gave their viewpoint on the Bill.  If the enthusiasm for the measure is indicated by the support it receives from the Minister's side of the House, then I think the barometer is very low indeed.</P>

If they are bodies that serve no useful purpose, as Deputies have told us, why all this talk?  I am not one who wants to centralise local government in Dublin or anywhere <Col N="737" /> else.  I want the people to have local government in their hands.  In all seriousness I ask the Dáil what have district councils to do now.  I think I know what they have to do.  They have to collect the rents of labourers' cottages and to look after a few roads here and there.  Every scrap of work they do must go to the county councils on voluminous forms to be accepted, amended or thrown out.</P>

Are not these officers in a dual capacity?  They have got to serve both bodies and try to please them. The limited amount of work rural councils have to do cannot, as far as I see, serve any useful purpose any longer.  When rural councillors were also acting as poor law guardians they had sufficient work.

      <P>I beg to move the following report of the Sessional Committee of Selection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Committee met on Tuesday, 4th November, 1924,</P>
      <P>(a)  to nominate Deputies to fill three vacancies on the Public Accounts Committee;</P>
      <P>(b)  to nominate one Deputy to fill a vacancy on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges;</P>
      <P>(c)  to consider the question of four vacancies which have occurred on the Sessional Committee of Selection.</P>
      <P>2.  The Committee has made the following nominations:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Committee of Public Accounts</i>&mdash; Deputies McGoldrick, Nally and Hughes; and</P>
      <P>(b)  <i>Committee on Procedure and Privileges</i>&mdash;Deputy Magennis.</P>
      <P>3.  The Committee of Selection is of opinion that its quorum is at present too large and asks the Dáil to fix it at five.  The Dáil should also fill up the four vacancies on the Committee.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee's report&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the four Deputies nominated belong to the Government Party.  The <Col N="741" /> Independent members, owing, perhaps. to their lack of organisation, have only one representative on the Committee of Selection, and that Deputy unfortunately very seldom attends the Dáil now as he has other professional duties to keep him away.  In filling the vacancies I think the Independent members should be entitled to at least one representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Procedure laid it down when these nominations were made in the first instance that every party in the Dáil should get representation according to its numbers.  The party Deputy Cooper speaks for got representation, and it is not the fault of the Committee if that member does not attend. If the Deputies forming the group for which Deputy Major Cooper speaks wish to have some one else nominated in place of the member originally selected, the Committee I believe would be agreeable.  With regard to the vacancies to fill which nominations have been made, one of the members originally selected has resigned and one has died, and they belonged to the same party.  That is the reason they were selected from the party, and for no other reason, and not to score any party advantage.  The procedure was followed that was agreed to twelve months ago by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I would like to contradict Deputy Hughes.  The Independents did not get representation according to their numbers.  The elections for these came very early, and we were required to propose a second. The various Deputies hardly knew each other, and it was only accidentally that I met Deputy Séamus Cosgrave, and that Deputy Redmond's name went forward for selection.  The result was that we got less than our strength.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I gave notice to call attention to was in respect of the unfinished important works at the Dublin Port.  Some years ago there was a succession of schemes proposed which would have taken many years to carry through, and employ a large number of men for a long time.  Some of that work has been completed.  Much of it remains incomplete, as I understand, in consequence of a shortage of money. My object in raising the matter now is to press it upon the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Finance, or the Government as a whole, with a view to their approaching the Port and Docks Board to find some way of accelerating the work at the Port, and, if possible, set work going so that numbers of men can be re-employed. I understand that at the last portion of the scheme which was completed there were several hundred men employed for a considerable time, and that the cessation of that work was because they had come to the end of their financial resources.  As this is the kind of work which would employ unskilled labour almost wholly, and as all the money would be spent in the direct payment of labour, I press it <Col N="743" /> upon the Ministry to consider how far it could be possible to agree with the Port and Docks Board to set the work going without delay.  If within the next few weeks something of that kind could be started it would relieve the situation for a great many people, and it would be quite productive expenditure and in every way would be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the position in respect of finance is, but I suggest that under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, possibly the Ministry could make some arrangement with the Port and Docks Board to give them cheap finance. In any case, whatever the method may be, I urge upon the Ministry that they should get into communication with the Port and Docks Board with a view to setting in operation a scheme of improvement at the Port and thereby relieve the present situation amongst the unemployed in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Johnson in this matter.  But I rise with a certain amount of timidity.  The unemployment question is very urgently needing solution.  The Port and Docks Board are undoubtedly in the position to give the utmost value for any money received.  Personally, I have always taken up the view at the Port and Docks Board that we are not beggars, and that we do not want any assistance to carry on the work.  But the Port and Docks Board are in this rather difficult position at the present time that the raising of a considerable sum of money to carry on the works that are really very necessary would be a difficult proposition.  I think the Minister for Finance knows some of the difficulties that we labour under at the moment. I would say if the operations of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act can be extended to the Port and Docks Board the money can be very usefully employed by them, and can be received not as a gift, though I daresay some of the members of the Port and Docks Board would regard it as a gift.  Personally I do not advocate any such thing.  If the Government have any money available, I would say that the work that would be carried on at the <Col N="744" /> Port, by the Port Board, would be beneficial to the whole community, and would bring our Port up-to-date quicker than we can do it ourselves as we stand.</P>
      <P>I would certainly support Deputy Johnson in the view that there is no work that could be undertaken that would give more employment to unskilled labour than this particular work.  I would like to say that I am not in collusion with Deputy Johnson in this matter, because it was only after he put in his notice that I heard anything about it.  I hope the Dáil will exonerate me from any suspicion of being twice in one day in league with the Labour Party.  Perhaps if I were it would not be a very retrograde sign. I can at all events very heartily support the claim Deputy Johnson puts forward.  If the Minister, even in the shape of a loan under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, can provide the funds for the Port and Docks Board, I think I can say that, though I have not yet consulted them, the Port and Docks Board would welcome such a step and provide every possible means for the money being expended usefully in the relief of unemployment, and more usefully still in the greater facilities that would be afforded to shipping by making the Port more up-to-date even than it is at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a certain touch in regard to this matter with the Port and Docks Board, the work it had on hands, and the work it could do if funds were available. That was recently.  I found, in a memorandum which I had provided for certain purposes about the middle of April of this year, that I did make reference to the work that the Port and Docks Board had held themselves ready to do provided that funds were made easy for them in a certain way. The particular project the Port and Docks Board put forward for the purpose of getting these funds took the whole matter out of my jurisdiction and took it, indeed, out of the whole ken of my Department.  I believe the passage they attempted to find at that period was blocked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> Deputy Johnson now raises the question in another form.  He puts it vaguely that we should agree with the Port and Docks Board to get work going without delay.  The suggestion was made later that the provisions of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act should be availed of for that purpose.  I have done all I consider incumbent on me to do with regard to the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  I have made the terms of it known, and I have issued advertisements calling attention to its provisions. One of the advertisements went so far as to say that applications, no matter how novel or unusual, would be welcomed, provided they came within the terms of the two clauses of the Act.  I do not think that it devolves upon me to go definitely to a body like the Port and Docks Board and ask them to submit an application under the Act so that the Committee might be able to advise upon such an application.  The question, however, has been raised here now, and Deputy Hewat has indicated that he would be willing, on behalf of the Port and Docks Board, to accept money.  I presume he will also be willing to make application for such money in the ordinary way.  If he does so, I can promise that the project will receive the most sympathetic consideration that the Committee can give it, within the terms of the Act.  Beyond that I cannot go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister think it beyond the dignity of the Government to take the initiative in such work of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not beneath the dignity of the Government, but it might be beyond the powers of the Government, because if this matter were to be taken as a precedent, all sorts of undertakings might afterwards raise the cry that specially-chosen undertakings had been shown all kinds of favouritism, and that this particular undertaking had been introduced in a way that would not apply to other undertakings.  This matter has now been introduced with a member of the <Col N="746" /> Port and Docks Board present, and I have given sufficient indication of my attitude on the subject.  I have indicated that if this is brought forward in the ordinary way it will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Committee. I hesitate to say that I shall go to the Port and Docks Board, because if I took that line now I might have to go to thousands of possible applicants later.</P>
      <P>I prefer to hold&mdash;and I consider I am justified in holding&mdash;that my duty has been done in advertising the terms of this Act widely, and in giving consideration to any applications when they come before me.  Now that the matter has been ventilated, I shall more or less advise and instruct the Committee that it may expect an application from the Port and Docks Board.  It is for the Port and Docks Board to make the application in the ordinary way, and on the terms of the notice that has been issued.  Unemployment in the city particularly is known to be very great, and as money will have to be spent to relieve unemployment in some way during the coming winter, and as this is a feasible project, and as the port is more or less national property, possibly no better way of expending the money could be obtained.  The project, however, must come within the terms of the Act. When it was put up previously it did not come before me in a way in which I could approach it.  It was a matter for the Minister for Finance and the particular project was not found suitable. There was some obstruction discovered and the matter fell through. It is now coming in a different way.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Johnson would be satisfied with the assurance that, after the sympathetic reply of the Minister, I will avail of the very earliest opportunity to bring the matter before the Port and Docks Board.  I do not think there will be any hesitation on their part to make the application that the Minister desires.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 5th November.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="652" /> for Finance whether the amount of the decree of £26 granted to Mr. Martin Concannon, Briarfield, Ballinasloe, at Galway, in February last, for damage to furniture, has yet been paid, and, if not, whether he will see that this matter receives immediate attention; also, whether the claim on account of personal injuries received by Mr. Concannon, in February, 1920, has yet been considered, and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <P>The amount of the decree referred to is £21, and not £26, as suggested by the Deputy.  A paying order for £30 8s. 3d. (including £9 8s. 3d. costs) was sent to Mr. Concannon's solicitor on the 20th ultimo.</P>
      <P>Mr. Concannon's application for compensation in respect of personal injuries was considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who recommended that no compensation should be paid.  This decision was communicated to the applicant's solicitor on the 1st ultimo.</P>
