      <P>I desire permission to announce my decision in regard to the proposed Commission on Local Administration in Dublin City and County.</P>
      <P>The following members of An Seanad and An Dáil have been invited to act on the Commission and have kindly consented to make their services available:&mdash;Senators O. St. John Gogarty, H.S. Guinness, J.T. O'Farrell, Mrs. Wyse Power; Deputies E.H. Alton, R.H. Beamish, A. Byrne, R. Corish, P.J. Egan, Prof. W. Magennis, A. McCabe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Magennis will act as Chairman. Mr. J.J. McAsey, B.A., an experienced officer of my Department, will act as Secretary.</P>
      <P>The Terms of Reference are as follows: To examine the several laws and the practice affecting the administration of local and public utility services, including local representation and taxation throughout the capital City of Dublin and the County of Dublin and to recommend such changes as may be desirable.</P>

      <P>I would like to call the attention of the Minister to the fact that there is no representative of the Farmers' Party on that Committee. I do not know by what process he arrived at the composition of the Committee, but I think we should be represented on any Committee dealing with a matter which affects us so seriously.</P>

      <P>I would submit that there should be some representative of the rural districts on the Committee, though not necessarily a member of the Farmers' Party.  As far as I can see, Deputies Egan, McCabe and Corish are the only Deputies on the Committee who reside outside the City of Dublin.  From the point of view of the rural population, I think it is hardly wise that that should be so.</P>

      <P>Towards the close of the discussion, before progress was reported, I had to express regret that certain lines of information which were demanded from me had not been made in the statement which I had made, the reason being that I understood that demand was for an explanation of the general lines of the educational policy of the Government rather than the detailed measures by which that policy was to be carried into effect. I wish now to supplement the statement which I made then by entering clearly into a statement of the educational measures which the Ministry has had in operation, and intends to develop. With regard to the general policy, I said that my point of view is governed by certain main principles, and one of these was that in education as administered by the State there should be, as far as is possible, equality of opportunity for all those who are the subjects of education.  The second governing principle is that public education should have in view the general national interest and good of the nation in general, and that that view should not be interrupted by the principle of the private and particular interest of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a certain amount of criticism was also directed to the fact that this Department had not sought to proceed through legislation.  It is quite true <Col N="546" /> that if a public Department uses its legitimate powers to carry out and develop a policy through administration rather than through legislation, it becomes all the more necessary why that policy should be fully explained and fully understood by the public representatives. When legislative measures come forward, although they deal with prospective things only, and not with the past and present, the elected representatives of the public have a full opportunity of discussing them, but when things are dealt with by administration within a department a great deal may be done without that opportunity of discussion arising.</P>
    <P>It is my desire, at all events, that the fullest information with regard to the administrative action of the Ministry of Education should be before the Dáil, and before the public.  It is not possible to keep Deputies in touch with all that has taken place, but, so far as can be contrived, it will certainly be my purpose, and I am sure the purpose of anyone else in my position, to afford the fullest information in response to any demand, and also to afford the clearest general statement which will lead to Deputies having that fuller information.  I think the expression &ldquo;obscurantist&rdquo; escaped from one of the Deputies during the debate, and there was also a suggestion that the educational policy of the Government had not been operative.  Well, so far as I can be accused of being obscurantist, I suppose it is because I do not take as many opportunities of talking as possible.  At any time when I have been approached with regard to information, or when information has been asked of me, I do not think I can be accused of having withheld anything material, anything that would give the information required.  For years past the public has been accustomed to the great word &ldquo;co-ordination.&rdquo;  So far as that word expresses something useful, to my mind it ought to carry out that idea, that principle which I have put forward, namely, that there should be for all the children of the citizens of the State equality of opportunity to make use of all the education provided or endowed by the State.  In order that that might be so, the first necessity is to <Col N="547" /> get rid of impassable barriers, or to bridge over gaps that may happen to exist in the system of public education.</P>
    <P>To that end, if you look back a number of years, we find that education in Ireland was divided into very, very distinct and separate compartments, and it was only when this system of government under which we are now moving came into being that the real ground for the unification of the separate compartments of education was supplied.  From the first, from the time when the Provisional Government came into existence, it has been the design to move in that direction.  It has been more than a design; there has been a steady movement in that direction, and not only a steady movement but, I think, the foundations of a unified system of education in the country have already been securely laid, and the actual work of unification has proceeded a considerable distance indeed in being carried into effect.  There are two things to be done.  The administration of education itself had to be unified, and, secondly, the work of education in the country had to be brought into the form of a continuous system. With regard to administrative unification, that was carried out when this Ministry was established.  All the different compartments of education, so far as they were under State administration, were brought closely together. The Ministries Bill enabled a further advance to be made in that direction, but, as Deputies are aware, that Bill has been in existence only a short time, and certain very important branches of national education have only come under the administration of this Ministry, one may say within the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>The aim then of this unified Department of Education is in order to provide equal opportunity so far as it can be provided to ensure that in the system of education there shall nowhere be a gap that would prevent a capable boy or girl from proceeding to the fullest use that he or she is capable of making of public education.  There were gaps, as is known.  There was a gap between what was called primary, and what was called secondary education. <Col N="548" /> As I said before, I deny all validity whatsoever to these titles of primary and secondary, but the gap was there, and it was for the child of the average citizen a very formidable gap, and again between the second of these arbitrary divisions of secondary education and higher education, there was also a considerable gap, and besides the gap in the plan, the system, there was a financial gap.  It is only primary education in Ireland which is free in the sense of being open to the children of all citizens without payment.  Secondary education is not yet free in that sense, and higher education is not free, although something has been done to enable those whom their own resources or the resources of their parents would not enable to proceed from primary or elementary to the ultimate stages of education of which they are capable.</P>
    <P>During the past year the educational gap, as apart from the economic, between what was called the primary and the secondary system has been completely removed.  The plan of those two formerly separate compartments of education have been rearranged in such a way that a pupil can go right through from the commencement of the primary to the completion of the secondary programme without encountering a barrier, without a break, without anything like a violent transition at any stage.  Taking the leaving age, as it is called, for public or primary schools at 14, we have in operation what one might describe as a spliced system, a partly overlapping system, and the programmes for the pupils between the ages of 12 and 14 are now arranged on such similar lines in both systems that the two may be described as undivided parts of one and the same plan of education.  A pupil can enter the secondary system at the age of 12, or he can remain on in the primary system until the age of 13 or 14, but at any of these ages he can pass over into the secondary system without, as I said, encountering a barrier or a chasm, or having to pass through any violent transition whatsoever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Dr. MacNEILL Dr. MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Dr. MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent a boy leaving the primary school at any age, or at any standard, to pass into a higher grade of education. The result I have described has been largely attained by freeing both systems up to the age of sixteen from excessive specialisation&mdash;from the plan of imparting a mere smattering of a variety of subjects&mdash;by founding education up to that age on the main subjects in which an Irish boy or an Irish girl ought to be educated, namely, Irish, English, mathematics, history, geography, and simple but sound instruction in science, including what may be called rural science.  In the secondary schools, even before this age is reached, other subjects such as classics and modern languages may be added.  Here also it is felt that there should be no specialising in any of these until the pupil has reached the age of sixteen and obtained that basis of general knowledge which is the proper foundation for specialised education. After the age of sixteen the pupil is allowed to branch off from that general foundation and to select, or have selected for him, by those who are competent, other subjects, cultural or educational, or that have a direct bearing on the future calling of the individual pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have said before that I believe in giving what one might describe as a material turn, at all events, a connection between education and realities, and while I believe thoroughly and deeply in the wisdom of that, I hope it will not be supposed by anyone who is listening that I regard purely cultural subjects as matters of no utility.  On the contrary, I hold that purely cultural lines of education are not only good, but that they are the birthright of the children of every citizen in this State, no matter what their calling may be.  At this stage, then, after sixteen, the plan of education in existence gives a wide range in choice, and the pupil intended for an <Col N="550" /> industrial, a commercial, agricultural or professional career can have a programme specially adapted for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Before he leaves that point, can the Minister explain exactly how the transition from the elementary to the secondary stage has become different during the past twelve months from what it was before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Dr. MacNEILL Dr. MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Dr. MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is by adaptation of programme, the creation of a similarity of programme for that overlapping period which we had roughly equated from 12 to 14 in both primary and secondary systems.  Of course, it is in pursuance of what I have stated, even with a specialised course, that the future livelihood is selected.  It is still requisite that at this early stage of education there should be a sufficient range of subjects to prevent undue specialisation.  So far as the plan of education is concerned, during the past year a complete programme of co-ordination, leading from the infant school to the end of the primary stage, has been established.  With regard to the whole range of education which is included under primary and secondary, these matters are only as yet in an initial stage.  Everyone who is acquainted with education will know that the putting of a programme into operation is itself only a commencement, and that it will take a number of years to develop and to arrive at the expected results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools are institutions, and even teachers are institutions.  That is to say, they are not even with respect to themselves absolutely autonomous, and they do not switch from one system into another automatically.  It takes a certain amount of time to bring about a change, especially a change the effect of which and the aim of which are not always visible on the surface to those engaged locally in administering educational institutions or in doing their work.  The primary programme itself has been so arranged, and here again we are only claiming that we are in an initial stage and, to some extent, in an experimental stage, although we have to avoid being purely experimental when we are dealing with human material, <Col N="551" /> that the treatment of a number of the subjects is to have the closest possible connection with the actual life of this nation, the inhabitants of this country, and with the vital concerns of the people, I may say of the individual pupils or of the society in which they live.  A pupil may, after the age of 16, choose that section of the programme which fits him for the desk of the clerk or which fits him for one of the professions, most of which, so far as the requirements of this country are concerned, are already over-stocked.  He can choose the line of education that will lead him specially to those lines of livelihood, but so far as my Department is concerned, there will be no special incentive and no special inducement held out to him to do so.  On the contrary, the aim will be and has been so to shape the programme and, if possible, so to direct the mind and purpose of those who are engaged in carrying out the programme on the spot that the tendency of the pupils will be towards the constructive economic life of the country.  In the rural districts, especially including those smaller towns, the aim has been and will be to give a definite agricultural and rural bent both to primary and to secondary education.</P>
    <P>The real gap which exists and which will exist notwithstanding any administrative changes in the programme system that have been made, or will likely for some time to be made, is an economic gap.  When we reach a certain stage, the provision made by the State or, so far as I can see, likely to be made by the State for a number of years to come is insufficient and will be insufficient to place pupils in such a position that they will not have to draw on the resources of their own families for the continuation of their educational work.  The reason for that is plain, namely that young people when they reach a certain age become capable of being self-supporting and become capable of entering into the economic life of the country and as things are, the rule is that when the capacity arises, the need arises, that is to say those who are capable of making their own livelihood when they reach <Col N="552" /> the age of capacity, are expected to do it.</P>
    <P>So that when we come to the secondary schools we find a system of fees universal.  Something has been done and that is not a thing initiated by this Ministry, this Government or this regime to enable the children of those who could not provide secondary education out of their own resources to reach secondary education by the assistance of public funds.  A great deal has in fact been done.  It is not merely the scholarship system but the endowment system of both the secondary education and the university &mdash;largely but not all in that direction. The problem of bringing education primary, secondary or higher, whatever you may call it into close touch and relation with the life of the country so that it reacts on and benefits the life of the country is an extremely difficult one.  When I say that such and such things are aimed at or that such and such things have been done, I do not want anyone to suppose that I look at the thing light-heartedly or suppose that the very great difficulties of achieving this have been made in any considerable degree surmounted.</P>
    <P>It will be, for years to come, a matter of the most anxious care for those who have charge of education, and a matter, as I have said before, and I should like to repeat and emphasise it, in which those who have charge of education ought to look for, and are entitled to look for, the most active sympathy and support of the whole community.  With regard to another branch of education which is modern in Ireland&mdash;that is to say, technical&mdash;that, as I have said, has only come within the scope of this Department so lately that one could hardly say it has fully come within its scope up to the present.  That is to say, it has not been possible up to the present to make such re-arrangements and such harmonising arrangements as would naturally follow from that branch of education being brought into closer contact with other branches. But, even supposing all that could be done, I still feel and wish to confess it, that there would be a serious gap arising, from the reason I have stated, that a large proportion of the youth of the <Col N="553" /> country for economic reasons, whatever the advantage under present circumstances, do not continue from one stage of education to another.  In order to obviate the disadvantage, I might say the injustice, which that difficulty leaves owing to our plan of education, I feel it is necessary that there should be systematic provision of what is called continuation schools for those young persons who are to work for a livelihood, so that, while working for a livelihood, they would have still an opportunity of bettering themselves in an educational way. That means two things.  It means provision of what does not exist at all in this country at the present, except in a kind of disguised way when it exists under the name of technical education. It is well known to those here who have been in touch with schemes of technical education throughout the country, that a very large part of the work carried on in the name of technical education was really continuation education, with this great difficulty, that it was not continuation&mdash;that is, that very often pupils who entered technical schools had been several years away from another school, and that, in a sense, in a technical school their primary education had to begin again.</P>
    <P>Beyond that I do not think that there is any provision in this country for continuation education, and it will require two things.  It will require a provision which will be a demand on the public Treasury, and consequently it will require the co-operation, voluntary or involuntary&mdash;I hope voluntary, but I am not a doctrinaire optimist&mdash;of those who will be in the position of employers. In other countries that has been achieved partly by law and partly, I think, from what I have read, by the cordial co-operation of the employers, not, perhaps, so much acting as philanthropists as through the motives of what has been described as enlightened self-interest.  There is a gap, and it is certainly my aim to see it removed.  I do not see up to the present the means of making any substantial advances in that direction.  I hope, however, that it may be possible, <Col N="554" /> before long, to bring before the consideration of this assembly some sort of proposal in the direction of at least making a big beginning in that important and necessary development.  I have, again, in saying that, my eye on the now proverbial 75 per cent.  It would be useless for me to suggest that in the present stage of our legislative programme I could hope to get further than the introduction of a measure for removing one of the drawbacks, that is to say, the drawback of bad attendance. I do not suppose anyone here would believe me if I were to suggest that such a measure could now before the recess be enacted.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it has been stated in the Press that the Dáil has slaughtered this Bill?  The Dáil has never had a chance of even looking at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen that word &ldquo;slaughtered,&rdquo; but it does not follow because the Bill is introduced and that it has not passed through all its Stages in the present session that it is slaughtered.  One matter more with regard to this co-ordination. It does seem to me most important that in any plan of co-ordination there should not be overlapping of the system of supervision.  To bring that into more concrete form I shall tell the Dáil exactly what has been done during the past year.  In the past year three general inspectors have been appointed by the Ministry to carry out the co-ordination of the primary and the secondary system, co-operating in the work with the chief inspectors of the primary branch and the ordinary inspectorate of the intermediate branch so that we have abolished the idea and the fact of the separate system of inspectorate in these branches.  One of <Col N="555" /> the chief functions of these inspectors is to ensure that the work of both branches&mdash;we have still to call them branches, though they are really not branches, as one is a continuation of the other&mdash;is co-ordinated not only in the curricula but also in the methods and the spirit in the schools.  Also&mdash; it is a detail but an important one&mdash; the educational side of the Civil Service Commission is closely co-ordinated with the work of these branches, and for this latter purpose the three general inspectors act as advisory examiners to the Civil Service Commission for all its examinations.  These examinations are based entirely on the various stages of the primary and secondary education systems, so that, on its educational side, the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Education are practically one.</P>
      <P>The same close co-ordination&mdash;I use this word because it is so popular&mdash;is being effected between the Education Department and other educational bodies.  For example, the department has arranged for a conference of the various university authorities and the education committees of the county councils to arrange that the leaving certificate examination of the Ministry's programme should be made the basis of awarding county council scholarships to the universities.  Similar conferences are being called with other bodies so that there may be the closest co-ordination in all education work, not only between these bodies that I mentioned but between these and all other bodies that are dealing with primary or secondary education or agricultural or technical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the agricultural side of the work, for instance, an agricultural general inspector will be appointed whose business it will be to keep the school textbooks and curricula of the branches of the Educational Department in closest touch with this basic industry, and thereby secure or do something towards securing, that in the future education will not be so detached from the lives of the main part of the people of Ireland as it has been in the past.  If there be any further information, any detail that I can give regarding the policy of the Department, <Col N="556" /> I shall be glad to give it.  I feel that these things are only in an initial stage.  Beyond that, one of the necessities is to familiarise the public mind with what is aimed at and to get the sympathy of the public for it, and the sympathy and the co-operation of those who are engaged in educational work for it, because the general tendency is that when a change is brought in it has an irritating effect and people do not like to change.</P>
    <P>I have met and I have spoken to the heads of educational institutions, and I have spoken of giving them greater freedom, more room for initiative in the future.  I assure you, in more than one case they have made it plain to me that they do not want it.  It really reminded me of the man who was brought out of the Bastile into the light of day and who asked to be brought back again. He was accustomed to a certain line of life and he did not want to change it. It reminds one also of the tale of the old farm horse who, when he was let out of the stable walked straight to the place where the machinery for the revolving churn was placed.  He was in the habit of walking round and round in a ring and he did not want to change; he would rather go there than anywhere else.  We have that to overcome, and I appeal to Deputies to assist in overcoming and to look, on behalf of this Department&mdash;which is not personal to me or personal to the Government; it is part of the machinery of the Government of the country&mdash;for the greatest measure of co-operation with what they consider to be beneficial, even if that means bringing in changes that are at the time irritating.  While they do that, it will be only pleasing to me to have criticism, to give further information, or to meet with any evidence&mdash;the more the better&mdash;that Deputies are keenly and deeply interested in the work of this Dpartment.</P>

      <P>Let us be realists, like the Minister for Education. I feel that we must get on somewhere. For example, Deputies, or the Minister, might go into questions which would come perhaps more properly under, say, the Vote for Intermediate Education.  And the question of agriculture, on which, I presume, Deputy Heffernan intends to speak, might come in under the Votes for Science and Art. These Votes are to be postponed because the transfer to the Minister under the Ministers and Secretaries Act is not completed.</P>

I state, without fear of contradiction, even from Deputy O'Connell, that it is mainly due to the teaching of this Order that we are able to meet in this Assembly.  Therefore, we ought not to be unmindful of them, and we should include them in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this debate changes from the general to the particular I would like to say that there are one or two points that I would like to bring under the attention of the Minister.  There is one matter that comes under my notice frequently in my business in life, and that is the condition of the national schools.  I think it would be quite useless for us to attempt to build up a system of education unless we get the foundation of that system established on a correct and healthy basis, and from my observation&mdash;and I have a good deal of opportunity for observing&mdash;I have come to the conclusion that the majority of national schools in rural districts are quite unfit for the use to which they are put.  I believe that until some measures are taken to improve the conditions of national schools, to scrap the bad ones and rebuild them, and improve the old ones, we never can build up a proper system of education.  Not only does this question affect the education of the children, but I am quite convinced that it must affect their health.  These schools are too small; they are very often insanitary; they have no playgrounds attached to them; they are very often badly lit; badly heated in the winter time, and I would like to call the attention of the Minister very strongly to the necessity for improving them.  About the general conditions of primary education I would say that the opinion which I have formed, and I think it is a general opinion, is that the education of the youth of this country is not so efficient as it was in the past.  What the causes of that are it is difficult to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not inclined to blame the teachers, because from my knowledge of them they are doing their best in the circumstances in which they are placed, and I think the fault must be other than theirs.  I think the teachers <Col N="559" /> are probably as good, as painstaking, and as interested in their work as they ever were.  Of course, allowance has to be made for the last five or six years, because we all know that the youth of the country have been busy carrying despatches, rifles and ammunition, and were prepared to pay very little attention to their education.  But I am rather inclined to agree that the abolition of the examinations had something to do with that.  It is my opinion that unless you have some form of examination you will not have efficiency or well taught pupils.  We all know that in this life we must have some kind of spur, we must have something to urge us on to achievement, and unless we have that spur we do not achieve what has been put before us. I believe that a system of examination combined with inspection is the best. I believe that there is a certain kind of examination now, but it is not what it was in the past.  In the old days of results fees, a system which has been so much condemned, the results of primary education were better than they are now in these ordinary subjects which it is necessary that the pupils should obtain a knowledge through the primary schools.  I refer to the three R's., reading, writing and arithmetic.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I would like to refer to is the question of the teaching of Irish in the schools.  I believe that it is quite wrong to make it compulsory, if it is compulsory, that other subjects should be taught through the medium of Irish.  I think that it is ridiculous to think of teachers, who have themselves only started to learn Irish within the past two or three years, attempting to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish, and if it is compulsory, even if it is urged on teachers, that urge should be withdrawn, and it should be recognised, as Deputy O'Connell has stated, that we cannot teach children Irish in two years, or we cannot have this country an Irish-speaking country in two or three years.  If we do it in twenty, twenty-five, or thirty years we will be lucky, and I think our outlook should be far ahead, and that we should not make any attempt to force the teaching of other subjects through Irish, except <Col N="560" /> to see that Irish becomes a general subject in a short time, because the effect of this system will, in my opinion, be that the other subjects will be neglected, and goodness knows there is no room for neglect in the other subjects. In proof of the fact that primary education is bad, I have it on the words of agricultural instructors who teach winter classes that they cannot teach them effectually because of the poor education of the boys who come to them; that is, before these boys are ready to absorb the scientific agricultural training which it is desired to give them, the instructors have to teach, or re-teach, them what they should have learned in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>The same thing, I believe, applies even more to technical schools, and for that reason there is an urgent necessity to concentrate on the primary schools. The secondary schools to a certain extent will look after themselves and so will the universities.  The primary schools will not, and I think it should be the aim to educate rather the vast majority of the people than a small minority.  I would also call the Minister's attention to the recommendations of the Agricultural Commission. It is in my experience of the national schools that among all the books used in them there is not one which deals directly or indirectly with the problems of farming or agricultural conditions. There used to be an agricultural text book, but that has been abolished.  I do not say that that text book was good, but I think it was better than nothing.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider the systems that are in vogue in other agricultural countries, consider the advisability of having arithmetic and other books with problems dealing with agricultural matter.  In my experience of national school arithmetic text books they dealt with things like bales of cloth, tuns of wine, and things of that kind, which I have never had reason to deal with since I left school, and they never dealt with a system of agricultural accounts, and I might say that agricultural accounts, weights and measures are probably the most complicated of any that have to be learned, in this or any other country. <Col N="561" /> I think that is a matter to be impressed on the Minister, and I think he realises almost fully that it is advisable that the teaching of the children should be turned in an agricultural direction, and their thoughts should be turned towards work on the farm, and that they should be got to realise that farming is an honourable occupation, and can be made an interesting occupation, and that it is not the last occupation that God made, so to speak. And that direction should be followed by other means.  I would suggest that it might be served considerably by attaching gardens or ground spaces of some kind to the primary schools, so that the teachers would have the advantage of giving an object lesson in what they are teaching in the schools. Another matter brought to my attention is the College of Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will leave it over until then.  There is a feeling in the country that education is not improving, and that the youth of the country now is more ignorant than ever it was, and that the ordinary simple subjects which children want and which are taught to the great majority of children going to the primary schools, and who do not go further, are not as well taught as they used to be.  For that reason I urge upon the Minister the need for concentration in the schools upon these simpler subjects, <Col N="562" /> and that they should be taught so that the children would know them in all their details, and that they should be well ground in the essential primary subjects that are of importance to them, that is, reading, writing and arithmetic.  We know of the intention that exists of making the Irish language the language of the country, and we know that that will take a certain amount of the time from the other subjects, but as that is the object and the aim of patriotic Irishmen, we raise no objection to it, but we do raise an objection to using Irish as the medium for teaching other subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for an explanation on two points. I raised a question before with regard to a matter the Minister mentioned about the children leaving the primary school at 12.  In case there should be any ambiguity about what was in the Minister's mind, was it that the pupil can only leave the primary school at 12 for the purpose of attending a secondary school?  As I understand at present as the law stands, a pupil cannot leave a primary school&mdash;I know he does, but he should not&mdash;until he reaches the age of 14 unless he has reached the sixth school standard.</P>

      <P>The second point is where the Minister was talking about specialisation after the age of sixteen. He has not told us, and it is not in his Bill, that he proposes to raise the school age up to sixteen, and these are the points I would like to have an answer on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three remarks in direct reference to the Minister's speech that I could quite easily work in now or under the subheads, if you, sir, prefer I should take that line.  Perhaps I had better get them off my chest now.  With most of the generalities that the Minister gave utterance to I think most of us would be in complete agreement.  There were two remarks at least that I would like to refer to.  One was that the present personnel was a difficulty inasmuch as it was there.  I think perhaps that might be misunderstood, and perhaps I misunderstood it.  I do not think that in spite of the fact that we have a large staff in operation as primary or national school teachers would be any difficulty to a change in the system itself.  It is not the fault of the personnel that there are faults in the present system, and the present personnel could be equally or perhaps better used under any system the Minister might introduce.  The difficulty is not that they are there, but the difficulty is that they are not properly directed.  That is my first point.  The second was the connection in which the Minister said that he welcomed a general discussion inasmuch as it would have an effect, he hoped, on public opinion, and he thought any such discussion was good inasmuch as it would lead public opinion to welcome reform.  He puts that forward as if to indicate he was rather taking up the position that he was rather to follow public opinion.  I consider it is the duty of the Minister for Education to lead public opinion and to be a leader in this matter; if he likes, with as much advice as he can get from experts. I think that reforms that are to come must come from him and he must set the initiative in this matter, and that it cannot come from individual members. I think the Minister got much more closely to the root of the matter, but I do not think he has got there quite. There are various difficulties, and what he seems to be mainly talking about to-day was the passing from what we must for convenience sake call primary to secondary education, a passing from primary education to secondary education of the better boys who have had the advantages, if they can be so called, <Col N="564" /> of primary education.  In that matter I do not think the difficulty has been really a question of programme. No doubt it is a good thing to assimilate the programme and to make one programme lead up to the other.  I do not think that has been a real difficulty.  For a long time I was connected with the society which has been the means of enabling boys educated in the national schools to pass on and to be educated at the expense of the society in secondary schools.  Many of these boys afterwards did exceedingly well for themselves in the University and in public careers.  They took advantage of the national school system as it was, and they picked their boys by the way which the boys had taken advantage of this national school system, and they could do the same thing even if the system was somewhat modified and brought into relation with secondary education.  That is not getting at the root of the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was nearer to it when he was talking about the economic difficulty, and that is a difficulty.  But the passing of good boys from primary to secondary education is only a part of the whole question.  The real question, and the one of greatest importance probably to us at present, is that the general standard that is required in the senior national schools is on the low side, and the Minister, I think, if at all, scarcely referred to that.  Probably he was referring to it when he talked about the need for a School Attendance Act.  No doubt the bad attendance of children at the schools, and the little interest that parents, as a rule, take in the education of their children, are two of the fundamental difficulties that have to be met with, but they will not be met with unless strong measures are taken by those in authority.  That is one reason why I, for one, greatly regret that other things have pressed out, in this session, the School Attendance Bill.  It was one of the things that is probably most urgently wanted at the present time, if not the most urgent. There is one other thing about which the Minister spoke to which I would like to refer to for a moment, his remarks in connection with the bent towards <Col N="565" /> special lines in future life to give to the child in the school.  I gathered from his remarks that he seemed to be in favour of giving that bent even at the very earliest stage, but I hope he has not definitely made up his mind on that point.  It is very doubtful whether any real advantage will be gained by giving that kind of bent to a young child, and it is very doubtful if it ought to be begun before the age of twelve or fourteen.  Probably it could be begun with advantage between the age of twelve, fourteen, or sixteen, and perhaps that is what the Minister had in his mind.  But I do not think that authorities are at all agreed as to the advisability of making early education have any reference at all to what the student is going to do when he grows up.  Specialisation the Minister did refer to, and perhaps he meant by that to say that he did not think at all of this sort of specialisation even for a child before the age of twelve or fourteen was reached.  Certainly I am in agreement with him if he means that too early specialisation is bad.  I have always thought it is. The question simply is what is the best age at which it can be taught.  I am afraid the difficulty is largely this, that it is not the same age for all pupils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to raise now just one point to which I referred on Thursday, because I feel it is a very important one, and I do not want to have it pressed out of the consideration of educational matters here. The point I want to refer to is that of physical training in the schools.  I fully appreciate the Minister's position in this matter, but I feel that he is perhaps not doing justice to the situation when he suggested, as I think he did on Thursday, that he does not wish to give any hope of doing anything in the matter.  I am urged to press him further in the matter by what I have seen myself going on in the different schools in the country recently&mdash;what, for instance, I saw in the secondary school at Castleknock, and what I saw recently in the National School at the Curragh.  At a time when we have our own police forces and our own army machine, I think that a little consultation with the <Col N="566" /> Police or the Army authorities, and a little consideration of the position in their training schools on the part of the Minister could provide for systematic physical training in the schools, and that he could now make a very good beginning.  A beginning has already been made in a few places, and with the assistance and guidance of our own physical instructors in our own Police and our own Army forces a systematic beginning could now be made to deal with gymnastics and physical education in our primary schools.  The matter goes very deeply to the roots of our educational system.  The self-interest that the Minister speaks of on the part of our industrial people should, I think, be centred in the physical training of our young people with resultant reactions on the health of the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig, as I said on Thursday last, had already been speaking to me about the matter, and he will probably be able to add something to what I have said.  Even since I spoke on Thursday last I find evidence of other people interesting themselves in this matter.  I should just like to read a sentence from a circular that was circulated since Thursday last by some people in North Dublin who are interested in work of this kind.  The passage reads: &ldquo;The children of the worker and the young girl and the young man in the factory have no chance of becoming virile.  There is not one properly equipped gymnasium in Dublin and there are but few expert teachers.  We have now secured some expert teachers and we appeal to the public for subscriptions to enable us to establish a gymnasium so that all the children of the workers will have an opportunity of becoming healthy virile citizens.&rdquo;  There is a general appreciation throughout the country of the necessity for this, and I would ask that the Minister would promise that he would inquire into the matter with a view to making a beginning at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his remarks this afternoon, made some observations which are likely to lead to misconception if left where they are at the moment. He spoke of the gap which divided <Col N="567" /> the primary, or the so-called primary education, from what we must call, for want of a better name, secondary education, and he drew a distinction between the educational gap and the economic gap.  He went on to say that during the past year all the difficulties had been removed so far as one of these gaps was concerned, and that it was now arranged so far as the educational side of it was concerned that a boy or a girl could go right through without the inconvenience of that particular gap.  I am afraid it is necessary to stress the distinction which the Minister made, that this only applied to the educational side.  As I say, if it were not stressed, the Minister's remarks might be open to misconception. What has been done is merely a matter of arranging the programmes, and that does not accomplish very much.  The economic gap is there, but I think that if close examination of the whole subject were gone into by the Minister he would find that the difficulty in bridging that gap is not quite so great as would appear to be the case at first view.  The thing to be aimed at is to give a sound education to boys and girls until they reach the age of at least sixteen years.  That is the object to be attained.  Some people speak as if it were absolutely necessary in order to do this that at some stage of their education, up to sixteen years, there ought to be a division at, say, the age of twelve or fourteen, and that at either one or other of these ages the children should pass from one school to another. That is the popular conception of things, that the child should leave what is called the national school, or what is sometimes spoken of incorrectly as the primary school, and go to an intermediate school or college.  Everyone who has examined the subject knows that the difficulties in connection with secondary education, so-called, arise from historical reasons.  The secondary schools or colleges that exist at the present time are largely private institutions. They were there in 1878, before any provision was made from public funds for their endowment in any way, and they were largely provided to fill a special need of the time. <Col N="568" /> They educated people who were able to pay for their education.  When we speak of intermediate or secondary education to-day we have unconsciously these schools or colleges in our mind.  I hold that it is only a matter of organisation to procure for the vast majority of children in the country a good sound education up to the age of sixteen without waiting to solve the problem which these private institutions present to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hundreds, I should say thousands, of National Schools in the country which are in a position, or which ought to be in a position to provide this education and, as I say, it is only a matter of organisation to have that done.  The education in many of our schools, here in the city, and in the country, is such that some children do remain on until they are 14, 15 or 16 years of age; the education which these have got in their third or fourth year in school&mdash;I mean from the age of 12, 13 or 14 to 16&mdash;is in all respects in the nature of secondary education.  There is no reason why, with proper organisation of classes, senior classes could not be organised in most of our National Schools which would give a sound education in these subjects which the Minister mentioned as being the basis of all education&mdash;Irish, English, Mathematics, History, Geography and Science.  I made a suggestion, I think during the debate on the Estimates last year that in very many of our National Schools these &ldquo;higher tops&rdquo; as they are sometimes spoken of, these senior divisions, should be organised.  They cannot be organised, as I quite realise, in all National Schools.  They certainly can be organised in the central schools &mdash;in what I might call the town schools in centres which are within short distances, three, four, five or six miles of the children throughout the country.  I do not believe in this system that we have being trying to bolster up during the past few years, or trying to bring in as a kind of stop-gap arrangement&mdash; that is the scholarship system.  I do not think you will reach many of the children by that system.  What we want is, as the Minister says, equality of opportunity, not an attempt to pick out from a class of 12 boys one or two who are going to get a scholarship provided <Col N="569" /> for them while his colleagues or their colleagues are left behind.  That is not meeting the situation and is not giving equality of opportunity to all of them in the sense that it ought to be given.  I believe that there is a great advantage in adopting the system that I want to create; there are many people&mdash;and this applies especially to small farmers&mdash;who may have boys or girls reaching the age of 13 or 14 years and who, while not in a position to pay the fees for their further education, even the supplementary fees that would be demanded even if they got a scholarship in these secondary schools, are able to afford to let the child go to school for four or five hours a day. They can do that much.  They are quite willing to make that sacrifice for what the child would be worth to them in earning capacity for four or five hours a day.  They are not able to pay the fees; if the boy remains at home he may be of considerable service to his parents during the remaining portion of the day.  To organise these classes in the National Schools is a matter for the Education Ministry, a question merely of reorganisation.  The teachers are there and there is no question of their ability and qualifications to teach these subjects up to the standard required for boys of 16 years of age. That, to my mind, is the way this economic gap that the Minister speaks of, and rightly speaks of, will have to be met and dealt with.  Because even if you were in a position to give scholarships to a vastly greater number of children than you can afford to do at the present time, there is no room for them in the colleges or secondary schools as they exist at present.  It is only necessary, therefore, to make proper use of the facilities which are available at the present time.  This is, in essence, what the Minister has in mind, I take it when he speaks of continued education.  That is continued education in the proper sense of the word. It is for the Minister to say whether he is prepared in the new Bill that he is to introduce to insist that children will come to school until they are 16 years of age.  It all depends on that, and even when that has been done to so organise the system which he has at hand that proper and suitable education <Col N="570" /> will be found for them up to the age of 16 years.  There is no need to allow problems which are no doubt difficult and intricate in their own way to interfere with that work.</P>
    <P>There is one matter arising out of what Deputy Heffernan said that I would like to emphasise, and that is the danger of specialising at too early an age.  The countries that have been most successful in specialised or technical education, or industrial or agricultural work did not go in for early specialisation.  In this connection I would like to point to one country, which we are often told to take example from&mdash;Denmark.  There they have put as the foremost plank in their educational system the teaching of a knowledge of the history, traditions and folklore of their country, combined with a system of physical training which has been referred to by Deputy Mulcahy.  It is a very remarkable thing that the country which has been so successful in the agricultural industry does not take up specialisation in agricultural pursuits in the earlier stage of school life.</P>

      <P>Of course the difficulty always is to know what a &ldquo;bias&rdquo; is.  Deputy Heffernan referred to the question of weights and measures.  I do not know whether this is a matter for the Education Ministry or for the Government as a whole.  But I do strongly urge that the question of doing away with our present weights and measures has a direct bearing on education.  The Minister said to learn our present weights and measures is an education in itself.  Certainly it occupies two valuable years of child-life to learn all these nice distinctions in weights and measures.  That could be easily avoided by adopting the sensible <Col N="571" /> system such as every progressive country in the world has adopted&mdash;the decimal or metric system.  With regard to compulsory attendance, if you can call it such, I might explain the position to Deputy Good.  In the first place, the law is not mandatory on any local authority. Where it is mandatory, the leaving age is 14 years, but it does not compel the child to go to any school provided he can show he is receiving suitable education in some other way. It is not a fact that he must go to a primary school.  The child need not go to a primary school, and, as a matter of fact, some children never go to a primary school at all.  With regard to what Deputy Mulcahy stated, I had no notion of contradicting him.  I do think that the system which the Christian Brothers founded and have carried out in this country for a considerable number of years is one that might usefully be, I will not say copied, but which we might learn many lessons from.  It is the kind of system I would like to see adopted in all the schools in the country, progressive and combined primary and secondary education, all in the one school, without this idea of transferring from one school to another.  But I do think that the claim that it is due entirely or largely to the work that has been done in these schools that we are sitting here now is rather an exaggerated claim.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I was not able to hear the discussion which took place up to the present and, therefore, I was very slow to take part in the debate.  Deputy Mulcahy has, however, touched upon a question upon which, perhaps, I may say a few words. Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out that there is no provision made in the estimate for the teaching of hygiene or physical drill in the schools.  I think that would come up under a different heading later on.  As soon as the new Bill dealing with Local Government is passed&mdash;and we hope it will pass in the Autumn&mdash;then, we will have medical inspection and treatment of school children throughout the entire country. I hope the Bill will also contain a provision for compulsory teaching of <Col N="572" /> hygiene and of physical drill of some description.  It is almost impossible to have physical exercises taught in many of the schools as they exist at the present time.  My experience of National Schools at the moment is not very great, but any experience I have leads me to think that a great many of these structures should be burned to the ground.  It is a great pity that during the conflagration that went on in the country the National Schools were not attacked and burned to the ground. That would be, in my opinion, a very economic and useful act to have done, compared with some of the uneconomic performances which went on through the country.  We want, therefore, schools in which children can be given some of those exercises and, as I have said elsewhere, the least we should expect the teacher in the primary schools to do is to give what is known as &ldquo;breathing exercises.&rdquo;  These breathing exercises are of tremendous importance because of the part of the lung which is ventilated during their operation. I had occasion a short time ago to measure the chests of three athletes and long-distance runners and it was extraordinary to find that the difference between the full expansion when expiring and when inspiring was not less than 5½ inches.  If any of us here were measured it is probable that very few of us would go as far as 2½ inches. In the case of children whose chests have not been fully developed and who have not gone through any of these exercises, it very often happens that the difference between inspiration and expiration is not more than 1½ inches. I do not like to talk &ldquo;shop&rdquo; but I do claim that this subject is as important in the primary schools as the instruction they receive in another direction. I claim that when hygiene is taught, as it can be in a moderate way, in the schools, these children will carry it into their homes and see what the effects of fresh air and cleanliness are. I think, too, that one of the most serious dangers connected with the primary schools, as far as my recollection of them goes, is want of sanitation.  It was something dreadful to think of the unhygienie conditions under which <Col N="573" /> children were expected to exist.  The teachers cannot teach hygiene and physical drill unless they themselves have been taught, but Deputy Mulcahy has put into my mind an idea which I cannot see any reason for failing to adopt&mdash;that members of the Gárda Síochána who themselves have obtained certificates in physical drill should give some little time in the schools to drilling the pupils.  As some of the Deputies know, I have urged very strongly, from time to time, that it is impossible to teach hungry children and that it is very important that children in the primary schools should obtain a meal.  I reiterate that, without going fully into the matter.  In my opinion, it is very necessary indeed that children should have some food provided for them during the middle of the day.  It is not only the parents of the poor children who are unable to provide those meals.  The parents of other children would very gladly pay for a meal if it were available during school hours.  There is nothing worse at the present moment, as Deputy Thrift says, than the want of compulsion in attendance at school.  I am one of those people who occasionally play a game of golf and I see crowds of children from 10 years to 12 years of age gathered round looking for somebody to employ them as caddies, when they should be attending school.  There is not any doubt that for the amount of money spent on education we are not getting sufficient value.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by several Deputies to the question of specialisation. In the medical profession we recognise that it is the very worst system that can be adopted, to allow any young man going for the medical profession to get it into his head that he is going to specialise early in any direction.  We want him first to lay a sound and sure foundation of medical knowledge in all directions.  When he has done that, it is time enough for him to specialise.  As far as children are concerned, I would be very slow to think of their specialising at 12 years of age.  I would like to see them much older&mdash;14 to 16 years of age&mdash;before any idea of specialisation would come into their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has seen in one's own time how <Col N="574" /> boys at school when they are brought into contact with boys preparing for banks or business would suddenly change their minds when, perhaps, they were preparing for agriculture, and would turn around and prepare themselves for other things.  Reference has been made to the subject of education in Denmark.  I want to say that the object of the system adopted in Denmark, namely, continuous High Schools, was to impart to the pupils a certain amount of intellectual culture without putting them out of conceit with agricultural work.  I think that was the point Deputy Heffernan made.  We should have an educational system that would give our young people a certain amount of culture, and at the same time not put them out of conceit with ordinary work, particularly work of an agricultural nature.</P>

      <P>I understand the question of the Christian Brothers has been raised by Deputy Cahill, and I heard it touched upon by Deputy O'Connell.  I think that that certainly is a matter which the Minister should give some attention to when replying, that is, whether the Christian Brothers can be brought under this Vote, and if not, could a supplementary estimate be brought in at a later stage.  I heard Deputy O'Connell make his remarks. He said he did not think all that Deputy Cahill had claimed for the Christian Brothers was properly claimable. But in any case we know, and anyone who knows anything about the Christian Brothers, knows, that they worked for primary education on voluntary subscriptions for practically the whole period.  These voluntary subscriptions went down during the course of the war while everything else went up, and certainly I think it would be advisable if something could be done to see that the Christian Brothers would get some advantages under this vote, and if not that a supplementary estimate would be brought in at some future date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nicholls it seems to me has raised an important principle, one on which I am not very clear, and especially in regard to this subject of education.  It is as to whether in a matter of grants from State funds to educational institutions&mdash;and <Col N="575" /> we are dealing now with primary or elementary education&mdash;are rightly given, and should be given to schools which are not within the system, that is to say, not within the inspection system and generally outside the control of the Minister.  It might well be argued, and I think argued with a good deal of force, that the only test that should be applied is as to whether education in the results justifies the expenditure of public money.  If that is accepted as a principle it will have to be applied to any private institution, any group of persons who consider themselves qualified to call together a number of children and put them through any educational course&mdash;the fact that they can bring children forward and put them through an examination, and if they pass that examination successfully, that that will warrant the payment of public funds to the persons who brought them to that state of instruction.  I think the matter is important, and if it is to be considered in special relation to one group of schools the consequences in regard to other groups, or individual schools will have to be taken into account. The modern tendency, I think, in matters of education and in other matters also is that if there is to be any grant out of public funds for any institution that there should be some kind of public supervision and public control.  I think that before that principle is departed from a very good case would be required to be made.  I raise that because I think it was applicable to more than the matters that have been raised by Deputies Cahill and Nicholls.  There is one other matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister.  He spoke about the co-ordination of the various stages in education, and the bringing together and the supervision of the plans in regard to primary, secondary, technical, and university education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following upon what Deputy Sir James Craig said, I wish to draw attention to the absolute necessity of a similar, or perhaps a greater co-ordination, between the education authority and the public health authority.  I am not quite sure that the references in the earlier discussion on public health <Col N="576" /> showed that there was an appreciation of the importance of public health as part of the educational system, because the exercises that Deputy Sir James Craig has spoken of, and the general atmosphere that might be created through health exercises, while primarily intended for the physical health of the child might be even more important as part of the general mental development, and, therefore, it should not be left over for the public health department as a medical side pure and simple.  It ought to be considered rather in relation to education.  When we are thinking of a Public Health Bill we ought to think of it as part of the educational system with which the public health authorities would be associated, and that it should, in fact, be part of the health department of the educational authorities.  I draw attention to this, for I feel strongly that the physical training that has been spoken of, and which might even include, and does include, in enlightened communities such exercises as swimming and athletics as part of the educational scheme, where child health is not detached from, and is, therefore, not in a separate department from the Education Ministry.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, may I raise a point with regard to your ruling as to the College of Science Vote 44, page 156.  The money we are asked to vote for the College of Science is for the purchase of apparatus, chemicals, etc., maintenance of machinery, examinations, scholarships and prizes.  Of course, if Deputy Heffernan wishes to raise the question of the purchase of apparatus, the maintenance of machinery and the conduct of examinations, he can raise that under Vote 44, but if it is a question of policy, and the effect of policy, such as I wish to raise, does it not come under the Minister's salary?  Is not the Minister responsible for policy, and therefore would we not be in order in raising it under A in this Estimate?</P>

      <P>The College of Science is provided for under Vote 44.  It is provided for, and when we come to consider Vote 44, we can ask the Minister for Education, if <Col N="577" /> he is the Minister that can answer for that Vote, what he means to do with it.  That seems to me to be the place to do so.  If the matter could be raised here, it could be raised also on Vote 44, which would seem to be a needless procedure.</P>

      <P>With regard to the questions raised by Deputy Cahill and other Deputies about the Christian Brothers, I could not say that proposals were before me.  The matter has been brought before me&mdash;adumbrated is, I suppose, the word.  Beyond that stage it has not advanced.  I have no doubt Deputy Johnson is right in saying that any schools which expects to share in the public endowment must come under <Col N="578" /> the ordinary regulations, with regard to supervision and so on.  We have departed from a system of paying for education on results, and certainly it is not my intention to go back to it. Deputy Heffernan made a strong claim for the improvement of school buildings. Everyone admits that a very, very large proportion of the school buildings in the country require improvement. I think it was Deputy Sir J. Craig who spoke about these buildings being unsuitable for physical training. Many of them are unsuitable for a great many other things besides physical training.  Physical existence is about as much as is possible in some of them. The only physical exercise I imagine that could be carried on in some of the schools would be the proverbial whipping of a cat.  The provision which the Dáil make for improvements to schools will be found under the Vote for Public Works, page 40.  Possibly when I refer Deputies to that particular Vote and page it will relieve me of the necessity of saying much more on the subject.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised with regard to the interpretation of things I said, and Deputies were kind enough to suggest that they might be construed in a better sense than I succeeded in expressing them.  On the debate on these matters, so far as I have been able to gather its purport, I never meant to suggest that anything like a particular direction towards future occupation should be given at an early age.  I thought I had aimed at giving the contrary impression.  It was probably the phrase that we find in the report of the Agricultural Commission that was quoted about rural bias.  I do not aim at giving a rural bias.  I aim at removing an anti-rural bias, and I think that is quite sufficient.  I also aim at removing a definite bias towards certain overstocked occupations which are not part of the very necessary business of increasing and improving the material resources of the country.  When I said, in reply to Deputy Mulcahy's suggestion about physical training, that I was not able to say anything definite, I said <Col N="579" /> so because I have a distinct objection to putting before the Dáil the notion that I have anything in mind when I have nothing definite in my mind.  When I am able to give definite assurances on this matter of physical training I will be very happy to give them.  The most I can say at present is that I am quite conscious of what is needed; at all events, that there is a great need, and that, personally, I believe everything we can do, ought to be done to supply it.  I do not know, at the moment, how it should be done.  However, I think I can say, and it is all I can say, that the matter of physical training will not be lost sight of.  Deputy Heffernan contrasted the schools of our time with the schools of former times, and said that the latter schools&mdash;and he gave a very definite opinion&mdash;were more successful in their teaching.  If that is apart from, so far as education is concerned, the incidental phases we have been going through for a few years, I would like to know what the foundation of it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I may say that I do not believe in it.  The test that I knew to be applied to the successful teaching in the schools in former times was precisely the test I have said&mdash;that is to say, the production of good clerks, good civil servants, and good quill-drivers, and I defy any Deputy to produce an atom of evidence to show that the schools of former times did anything to produce better farmers, better workers, and better industrialists.  In my opinion they failed to do so, and the very fact that such success as they had was concurrent with the continuous decay in the economic condition of the country is quite sufficient to show what that success was.  As regards the point of senior classes being continued in the schools, it is quite evident that that could only be done with our present resources in a limited number of schools, and while it could be, and is, a benefit at the moment to a certain number of the community, the <Col N="580" /> number of the community which can be benefitted by it is very small.  So far as I can understand, in countries where it has been tried systematically and generally some years ago, the success of the effort to put a top on primary education in primary schools themselves has been very doubtful.  I think that has covered the principal points of criticism that were brought forward.</P>

      <P>As regards subhead B, which deals with inspection, I would like to say a word or two.  The inspectors are the direct link between the Department and those mainly engaged in the work of education, the teachers in the schools.  It is very important, therefore, that absolute care should be taken to see that the inspectors, who are officers of the Ministry, should interpret the wishes of the administration and the Ministry.  I spoke on last Thursday, and I do not intend to go into it again, of the faults that exist in our present system of inspection. For these, of course, the Ministry itself must be responsible.  It is no fault of the inspectors.  As a matter of fact, the very fact of the existence of these things, which I complain of, goes a long way to divorce the inspectors from what ought to be their real work, namely, co-operation of teachers and managers in the general work of education.</P>

      <P>I was drawing attention to the great difficulty which exists in properly applying a test of efficiency to the schools under the varying conditions and to the temptation that exists, a temptation which is almost more than an ordinary human individual, such as an inspector, has to withstand, that is, of setting up for himself an absolute standard of proficiency and judging all schools that come within his ken by that standard. I will give a concrete example of what I wish to stress.  The Minister and Deputies know that at present great attention is being paid to the teaching of Irish in the schools.  Some teachers are native speakers of Irish and find no difficulty whatever in dealing with the teaching of the Irish language.  Other teachers have taken up the duty within the last two or three years.  We may find side by side in the same district, or even in the same school, two teachers teaching the subject and bringing their pupils to a certain standard so far as they can.  There is no doubt that the man who has the advantage of knowing Irish from birth will be in a better position to teach it and will have his class in a better state of efficiency than the man who might have worked very much harder during the year but, owing to certain circumstances and disabilities, might not be able to bring the children to the same state of efficiency.  There is no doubt that both, if they have worked hard and diligently, are deserving of the same reward, but in our system and because of this temptation, there is naturally a different standard of efficiency.  One may get a mark of &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good&rdquo; and the other a mark of &ldquo;fair.&rdquo;  In one case there is a financial increment, but not in the case of the other.  The man who worked hard and laboured under disability has a grievance, and the accumulation of that kind of thing gives <Col N="582" /> rise to complaints about the inspection system.  It is in the nature of things. My object is not so much to blame the inspectors, because I quite see that it is a difficult thing to get away from, but to call the attention of the Ministry to it and to urge them to impress, and to continue to impress, on their officials and inspectors that the circumstances of schools differ and that the circumstances of the teachers differ, and, further, that the greatest care should be observed in the present system whereby financial rewards and increments depend on the inspector's reports, given in this detailed way. There is another matter I would like to mention, and I mention it because I wish to emphasise that no matter what views the Ministry may have as to how things should be done, unless they take an opportunity of making it absolutely clear to those in charge of the carrying out of the work of administration their attitude and their policy are likely to be misunderstood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the last day and I think the Minister agreed that the proper conception of the duties of an Inspector should be co-operation with the teacher, that he should in a way, act as a kind of Director of Education for his particular district, and be responsible for the efficiency of education there.  The teachers, through their organisation have urged on many occasions that that should be the case, and have especially called attention to the advisability of holding frequent conferences with inspectors.  They made representations to that effect to the Department and the Department so far as I can judge, favourably considered the suggestion, namely that inspectors from time to time should meet the teachers in conference, have a heart-to-heart talk with them and discuss difficulties that they came up against from time to time in their work.  Now a few instances have been brought to my notice where the teachers of a particular area approached the inspectors and asked them to attend conferences but they did not get very much satisfaction.  In one instance a divisional inspector said he would attend the conference, but he made it a condition that no questions should be asked of him during the conference. That does not seem to me to <Col N="583" /> be an especially valuable kind of conference. It seems to me that a discussion of the difficulties met with, and the answers given by an inspector would be the most valuable part of a conference.  In another case an inspector was asked to attend a conference but he made it a condition to attend only a small committee of it.  There was another case where the teacher wrote to the divisional inspector, and asked himself and the district inspector of the area to attend the conference. They stated the objects, that they wanted to consider the question of devising a special programme for their own county, and also wanted to have a more definite idea of what they were expected to teach in the schools.  I think that is a legitimate suggestion.  I will read the letter the inspector sent.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Referring to your letter of the 24th inst., I cannot see that any useful object could be achieved by my attending a conference of the Teachers for the purpose stated therein; for (1) as regards `the schools in the county having a uniform programme,' the National Programme is the programme for every school, unless an alternative programme has been submitted to the Department and approved; and (2) with reference to `the Teachers having a more definite idea of what they are expected to teach,' any Teacher who studies the National Programme courses together with the Circulars that have been issued relative thereto, will acquire all the information which I possess on this point.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You might refer to the attendance of the District Inspectors at a conference.  I cannot answer for them; it is a matter for each Inspector's own consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may be a perfectly correct attitude, technically speaking, but I think it is not the way a body of teachers should be met by the divisional inspector for their area when they ask him to meet them in conference and discuss with them, difficulties they naturally and obviously will find in carrying out their daily work.  I draw attention to this, not for the purpose of pilloring any inspectors but because I think it advisable that the Ministry <Col N="584" /> should see that the policy which we know that they have, should be carried out in the spirit as well as in the letter by the officers appointed by them.  An instance has been brought to my mind too&mdash;I mention this in view of what the Minister said on Thursday last&mdash; where a certain inspector in the South of Ireland is insisting that to children who have only begun to learn Irish for the last two or three years, that arithmetic should be taught entirely through the medium of Irish.  I do not believe that is the policy of the Ministry, but the fact is that one of their officers is insisting that that should be done, and I think it is a matter to which attention of the Ministry should be called.  That is not in an Irish-speaking district.  I intended to raise the question of the general inspectors but I think that the Minister has given the main points.</P>
    <P>There is just one point in connection with what he stated with regard to co-ordination. These I take it are the coordinating links.  Still one thinks it strange that if an inspector happens to be in a town where there is an intermediate school, it is not usual that the National School inspector will visit the intermediate school or vica versa. I think if there were a little more of that co-ordination in matters of inspection and visiting schools between inspectors, it might be more useful all round.</P>

      <P>I may say at once that I quite agree with Deputy O'Connell in his criticism of the inspectoral system.  I am glad, however, to find that he made no charges against the officers who carry out the system.  It was against the system, not the officers, and he gave some concrete cases where this was shown to be to the prejudice of education generally.  I happen to have had an experience in the last month that bears out the remarks made by Deputy O'Connell.  I have heard that the inspectors looked upon the teachers more as inferiors and subordinates than as co-workers in the great system of educating the people.  That is a complaint I often hear.  About a month ago I was speaking to an English gentleman, himself connected with <Col N="585" /> education, and who had been a teacher for forty years.  He said to me that the inspector looked upon the teacher not as his inferior but as his co-worker, and that he discussed with the teacher in an amicable way, hints and suggestions coming from the teacher in the interests of education to which they both were bound.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to conferences and he said that it was the duty of the inspectors to attend these conferences, even to calling them together, and to put forward suggestions for the benefit of the teachers attending. I gather from Deputy O'Connell's remarks that it was his suggestion to the Ministry that the matter should be looked into.  I join in that appeal to the Minister.  I think if all persons engaged in the primary education of the country are not working in a harmonious spirit it is the children that suffer and not the system.  There is one other remark I would like to make. While the teachers, their assistants and the Minister and his proposal are discussed both in this House and the Press, the most important section are being overlooked, and that is the children. The general well-being of the children in this country has not been referred to in connection with primary education.  I might mention that the same gentleman with whom I was speaking in England told me that the custom there&mdash;and I knew it before myself&mdash;and in Scotland was that they had two sessions in the school during the day&mdash;the first from 9 o'clock to 12 and the second from 2 to 4.30, with the consequence that the children were always fresh to acquire any knowledge imparted and that their health did not suffer as it manifestly suffers in this country from over-long hours.  I hope the Minister will take that into consideration in any proposal he intends to make or as it is more properly an administrative affair that he will take action even before the Bill comes.</P>

      <P>With regard to inspections there are no absolute standards of efficiency fixed.  The standards are relative, and inspectors know that. With regard to inspectors fixing absolute standards in their own minds, that depends on the personality of the inspector; there is no guarantee against it in any sense, but it is clearly understood that the standard is relative, and that the circumstances and merit of the work done in the schools is a thing to be taken into account.  The complaints that have been made here to-day about inspectors not attending conferences, I cannot answer because I have heard of them now, and so far as I am aware, my Department has heard of them now, for the first time.  When any such complaint arises, then it certainly will be my duty, if it is referred to me, and it will be the duty of the Department, if it is referred to the Department, to go into the question of the complaint.</P>

      <P>Might I explain that, as a matter of fact, the complaints reached me only within the last few days, and my object in mentioning them was to give the Minister an opportunity of saying what exactly is his policy with regard to these conferences. I did not mention them by way of complaint, but really to show that that state of affairs existed, and to ask whether he is in favour of such conferences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made it quite clear that I regard the inspectorate not as a censorship over the schools.  While censorship is necessary of its work occasionally, its principle work is to assist and develop the work that is being carried on in the schools.  It seems quite obvious to me that the holding of a conference with teachers should be a useful way of arriving at that development, and I <Col N="587" /> am quite in favour of such conferences being held.  Deputy O'Connell appeared to think that the inspectors would require to know the questions to be asked at the conference.  I do not know what exactly he had in mind; whether he would be threatened with questions, and what sort the questions might be.  A conference would not be helpful if the parties were to meet as opponents, or if one side were to pillory the other or the inspectors' side were to pillory the teachers with regard to their defects.  I must say the same thing with regard to the complaints of teaching other subjects through Irish. I have not heard that complaint till now; if I had any details in a complaint of that kind I would have it examined. We do not want to do anything absurd, or to attempt anything absurd in the matter of teaching.  While I say that, let it not be supposed that I am going to be carried off my feet by catchwords such as we have had on a previous occasion of teaching the unknown through the known.  That is only a catchword; that is one of these things, the sort of education that Deputy Heffernan referred to, to enable people to use phrases like that without knowing what the meaning is.  We hear them on platforms and read them in papers&mdash;phrases, words, formulæ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the realities at the bottom, the facts, the people do not think of.  We can get a reputation for ability in politics, and ability in journalism, and ability in other respects by our ability in the use of these phrases.  Now, it is possible to teach the unknown through the unknown.  We would never learn anything if we only learned through what we knew already.  We are acquiring fresh knowledge every day in a thousand ways.  It is quite possible that in a school in which the children had a limited knowledge of Irish they could be taught arithmetic quite efficiently through Irish, so that I do not want to be tied down to any hard and fast generalisations about that.  I only say that where it is shown to me that the kind of teaching that is done is actually on a wrong basis and not achieving its results, or achieving its results in a way that is too painful and <Col N="588" /> too difficult in proportion to the effort, I will try to have it rectified.  As for inspectors alternating between different classes of schools as they are classified at present I must say that I have been for some time past discussing that subject in my own department.  I do not know at present, and as I said on a previous occasion, not having anything definite to say on the subject at present I am not going to say anything about it, but the desirability of it is certainly under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing from this phase of the subject I would like to ask the Minister whether there is likely to be any change in connection with the policy of his department.  The reason I ask is this: an Act was passed here not very long ago&mdash;the Judiciary Act&mdash;which was a very great revolution in the direction of decentralising.  I think in the Department of Ministry of Education the policy in the past has been a very centralised one indeed, and looking at it from the commercial point of view, I think it has already been expressed in the Dáil that the results have not been commensurate with the very large cost of education to the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he, or his department, has considered the question at all, and if there is any change in that direction as regards the decentralisation of the work of the Ministry of Education in connection with the inspectors.  Possibly decentralisation might be in the direction of the inspectors having a closer intimate knowledge in the area with which they are particularly concerned, and possibly the matter that Deputy O'Connell has raised would seem to indicate a want of a close intimate connection between the inspectors and the teachers. I am not sufficiently conversant with the procedure of the educational instrument but it seems to me that that would be a very useful aim for the Minister to have before him if it would tend towards closer working as between the inspectors and the teachers.</P>

      <P>As the Minister referred to my name in regard to the question of teaching other subjects through Irish, I would like to make a slight further explanation of what my <Col N="589" /> intention was.  I would remind the Minister that I did not use any catch-phrases; in fact, I was not aware of the catch-phrases which he mentioned. But as an ordinary commonsense practical proposition I put it to the Minister, and to anybody in the Dáil: Is it practicable for a teacher who has only a partial knowledge of Irish, or even a full knowledge of Irish, to teach any subject through Irish to pupils who have no knowledge, or a very slight knowledge of Irish?  It may be a practical proposition, and it may be possible by doing so to increase a pupil's knowledge of Irish.  But my point is this, that the pupils at present are not getting sufficient time, owing to one reason or another, to learn the ordinary, absolutely necessary subjects, and if this method is adopted of teaching subjects through Irish time will be wasted and pupils will learn less about the ordinary subjects, although they may learn more about Irish.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat seems to be under the impression that we had not that kind of decentralisation he speaks of inasmuch as the inspectors are allocated to districts and remain in the various districts for several years.  On this question of the Training Colleges I need hardly point out to the Dáil that the training which the teachers undergo is of the highest importance in the educational system, and I would like to emphasise what the Minister said, in the course of his general remarks on Thursday last with regard to the part which the University should play in the country.  He said that the foundation of education is the University.  One would draw from that the conclusion that those who are charged with the giving of education at least should have the benefit of a University education. Teachers are trained in colleges under private management, and in my opinion the training they receive in such institutions does not fit them properly <Col N="590" /> for the great work which they are called upon to perform in after life.  Of course it is often said that a teacher who has only to teach elementary subjects need not have a University education.  I am not thinking of actual scholarship when I speak of the benefits and the necessity of a University education for teachers.  It is the broadening influence that such education would give them that is the chief benefit that they would derive.  It is often said, and possibly with some justice, that teachers are rather narrow in their views, and have not a full conception of practical life.  I think that comes to a very large extent from the manner in which they are trained. They are trained in these private institutions, and they are brought up as if they were little better than secondary school children, whereas when they are in these colleges they are grown men and women.  They go out afterwards, and in their schools they are dealing with children all day and they have not the opportunities which people who were trained in the University and who mixed with students who are preparing for other professions acquire. They have not these advantages, and I think it is essential that something should be done to bring the training of the teachers of our schools into relation with the work of the University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, personally, that the main work a university should perform in the country is the training of the teacher. After all, if university education is useful to a country, and there can be no doubt on that, everybody in the country should benefit from the university. It is not open to all to attend and to listen to the lectures provided by the university, but it ought to be open to all to profit indirectly by the universities, and they can only do that if the teachers who conduct both primary and secondary schools have the benefit of university training.  This matter has been raised and discussed for several years.  Some considerable time ago, on the first discussion we had on education in this Dáil the present Minister made a statement something to the effect that, if those concerned in the universities and the teachers came to him with a scheme he would consider it.  The matter was taken up between <Col N="591" /> the representatives of the teachers' organisation and the universities and eventually a scheme was evolved and we came to the Minister nearly two years ago now, or at least a scheme was put before him certainly 12 or 15 months ago, and we have not yet seen any development.  Something has been done by the universities but not by the department concerned.  At least, I do not know what exactly has been done towards extending to the teachers the benefits of university training.  Now, there are one or two other matters. Under sub-head C, page 174, there is a note as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;It is estimated that the number of students in training in 1924-25 will be approximately 385 men and 360 women.&rdquo;  That does not mean the number that leave the training colleges.  Half of them will leave the training colleges and I would like to know if the Minister has any figures to show the number of teachers who leave the service in any given year, and are likely to leave the service in any year in which students will be coming out of the training colleges, because it is essential that the number of teachers in training should approximate to the number of teachers who are estimated to leave the service either through resignation or death or any other cause.</P>
    <P>There is just one other question I would like to get information on. Some years before the establishment of the Free State the old Dáil established the system of Dáil scholarships, and I wonder what has become of that scheme.  The idea was that students in the Irish-speaking districts, and students who are Irish-speaking, would get special encouragement to go in for the teaching profession.  They had two objects in view, and I think they were commendable.  It gave opportunities to the children in the Irish-speaking districts; it opened the door for them in the first place, and in the second place it ensured that people with a good knowledge of Irish&mdash;native speakers&mdash;would go in for the teaching profession. I do not know what the position is, and I cannot gather from the Estimates, because there is only one small reference on page 174, &ldquo;Grant to students in training colleges, Dáil <Col N="592" /> scholarships, £140.&rdquo;  That is the only reference I see, and I do not know what has become of it, and I would be glad of the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of this matter of the training colleges, there is one very important matter which I wish to refer to.  Our enthusiasm for the Irish language, and what is behind the Irish language, from the point of view of our history, and tradition, and culture, comes not from our books and classes of the Gaelic League attended here in Dublin, but from the men who made the Gaelic League movement and saved the Irish language to the extent it has been saved, and drew their inspiration from the language and what it stood for, from the people in the portion of the country where the language is a living thing. And anything we do for the language in the primary or secondary schools in counties like Wexford or Dublin is work that will be of little value if we do not attend properly to the language and properly to education through the means of the language in all those counties where the language still lives. If we do not pay attention in a systematic and a proper way to Galway, to Donegal, to Clare, and to Kerry, then we are simply occupying our minds and occupying the minds of other people in the country with something that is not going to lead to anything in dealing with the problem in other parts of the country.  I draw attention to this aspect of the matter to ask from the Minister what prospect is there of the setting up of a training college to accommodate a small number of teachers. I do not mean as a beginning to accommodate more than a small number of woman teachers, but a training college, the whole work of which would be done through the medium of Irish in the training of teachers for the Gaedhealtacht and the leath-Gaedhealtacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More, we can show in brief discussion here that we can bring to the Gaedhealtacht highly educated and highly trained men and women who have received their training and education through the medium of the Irish language and therefore have that self-confidence, that poise, that full and proper expression that our teachers <Col N="593" /> who deserve to be called teachers will require.  The matter is of the utmost gravity, I think, from the point of view of the cultural development of the country, and apart altogether from that, and viewed in the light of what we say here, with regard to Irish, and what we do in the Estimates with regard to Irish, we are neglecting a most important matter judged from the abstract and comparative point of view, if we do not see we are going to do something definite no matter in how small a way, to rear up young teachers for the counties where Irish is a living language, and to rear them up in an absolutely Irish atmosphere.</P>

      <P>I rise to prevent a misconception arising from some criticisms which Deputy O'Connell directed against the Ministry.  The connection between the training colleges and the universities&mdash;I am speaking now for my own university&mdash;is a fact and has been for the last three years. I am sure that Deputy O'Connell must be aware of that.  The point of this criticism is that the Government makes no contribution towards defraying the cost of the training of the students in the university.  I can assure Deputy O'Connell, particularly on behalf of the university which I have the honour to represent, that the universities are fully conscious of their responsibilities as trainers of the future teachers of the country.</P>

      <P>In connection with the training of teachers, everyone is agreed that they should be men who are as highly skilled as possible.  There is another aspect of the training that appeals to us industrialists, and it is a very important aspect.  During the discussion that has taken place on the subject of education it has been mentioned several times&mdash;it was mentioned by the Minister&mdash;that the output of our National Schools was rather in the direction of producing clerical workers than in the direction of producing industrialists. We in industry, like those in agriculture, have to complain that the brilliant boys from the National Schools do not come into industry. They go into the Civil Service or they take up clerical appointments. For that fault I think we <Col N="594" /> have to blame our teachers.  The teachers, to my mind, have more influence in moulding the future of those attending schools than anybody else the children come in contact with. Therefore, if we care to have the minds of those children trained to the advisability of going into industrial pursuits when they leave school, we must have persons in charge of them in the schools who will have influence over them and who will be fully aware of the national importance of industry in the success of the State.  Therefore, I would impress on the Minister that it should be an essential part of the training of these teachers to take courses in industry wherever they are trained, and also courses in agriculture, so that they may be capable of putting these important national problems before the minds of those whom they are called upon to teach.</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Connell said on this subject appeals very strongly to me, and more particularly when I look at this account here.  The sum in the Estimates for training colleges is £72,866.  Turning to page 174, I find that that sum has been expended on approximately 385 men and 360 women.  That works out somewhere in the neighbourhood of £95 or £96 a year on each student.  It seems to me that the money might be better spent and more effectually spent in a thorough University training for the teachers embracing all the subjects that are dealt with in the training colleges. Apart from the benefit to the teachers themselves, I think it would be highly important to have these teachers going out straight from the Universities to the country schools.  In my opinion that would be an inestimable benefit to the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make just a few remarks on some points that were urged by Deputy Hewat.  One is that the complete training of a teacher and the taking of a University course cannot be accomplished in two years.  It would take a good deal more than that.  It is, of course, a question which we will probably solve by experience: that is, as to how much of the course which they require for training can be made <Col N="595" /> simultaneous with the University course, and as to how much ought to be consecutive, one with the other.  The other point he made was that he objected to the expenditure of £90 a year on the training of a teacher in the training colleges.  I should like to point out to him that that includes the complete cost of upkeep and maintenance of the student as well as the cost of his instruction.  While I am on my feet I would like to refer to Deputy Mulcahy's remarks and to draw attention to their real importance in connection with the teaching of Irish.  I think he really struck the nail on the head when he said that what was of importance in that connection was the training in Irish of those who can teach those who naturally think and speak in Irish themselves.  That, I think, is a most important matter. There is another side to the question, and I take this opportunity of making a mild protest.  I am not greatly excited about it, but I desire to make a mild protest against compulsory Irish. I think in that respect we are suffering from a re-action, but we shall get over it soon.  At least, I hope so.  I do not agree at all with those who say and think that the development of Irish everywhere is necessary for the development of the national life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Language and the growth of language obeys definite natural laws, and they are stronger than anything we can do by our means of compulsion.  I daresay Deputies have heard of Mrs. Parkington and her contemplated sweeping out of the Atlantic rollers breaking in under her kitchen door. If there is a definite natural bent in the Irish language towards its growth and complete spread throughout the country, I am not going to be Mrs. Parkington trying to sweep it out with any kitchen broom.  If, as I believe to be the case, the trend of national development is something quite different and something tending more towards world development, and that the real development of this country will not be through the language, which would make us more insular than we are, but through something which would make us of far greater utility in the world, then I think any measures of compulsion <Col N="596" /> will be more like Mrs. Parkington's broom, because they will be trying to keep out the real demand, the growing national demand of people throughout the country for an education which will fit them for their place in life combined with the mental and moral development which education ought to give them.</P>

      <P>Under Estimates C. 1 and C. 2 (Training Colleges) I notice &ldquo;decrease,&rdquo; which is the interesting column for 1924-25.  The decrease is more than £7,000.  That reduction, as will be seen at page 174 of the Estimates, where the details are set out, is chiefly in respect of the fixed grants payable to the colleges.  This is, perhaps, a mare's nest that I have discovered. I hope it is.  But if there is no explanation forthcoming for this reduction, except that of pure economy &mdash;and that is an explanation I refuse to forecast&mdash;I should be obliged to hold that in this important respect, at any rate, the admirable policy of education expounded by the Minister has not been followed either in the spirit or in the letter.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that that is the explanation. A very important consideration is this &mdash;the Estimate for this year preserves the language of former years &ldquo;Training Colleges under private management.&rdquo; They are all under private management, and that is the source of one very considerable grievance, which <Col N="597" /> I occupy the time of the Dáil in setting forth.  Under the late regime it was the custom to make grants to these colleges, bearing in mind the number of students that were in training.  As a Commissioner of National Education I proposed in reform of that, a consideration which I take the liberty of repeating, for the educational authority the chief concern ought to be the efficiency of the training colleges.  The training college evidently does not carry in detail home to the mind of the readers of these Estimates, what the part is that is played in the educational system by a training college for primary or national teachers.  The French have a very convenient word for describing something which is essential to a whole fabric&mdash;the central bolt of a great machine&mdash;the <i>clou</i> which if withdrawn makes the whole machine merely a mass of scrap, but which, if replaced and put together, organises what would otherwise be scrap into an effective machine which functions perfectly. Now the <i>clou</i> of the whole educational system so far as regards primary education is the training college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the training college that the teacher is trained to be an effective teacher and trainer of youth.  It is not merely that he goes, as Deputy Heffernan has in contemplation, to the college to learn more.  That is the least part of the work done&mdash;the increase of knowledge or the enlargement of the range of information of the teacher in training.  He is re-taught the subjects that he had learned before with a special view to proficiency in the impartment of that knowledge to young pupils.  Now that is a very difficult art to acquire, and it is an art that can be imparted or can be learned only under the direction of experts.  I dwell upon that because so many people allow the name &ldquo;training college,&rdquo; to flow trippingly from the tongue and consider it no further.  It is some sort of college, a college in which teachers pass a number of years. But it is really a centre for vocational development as well as cultural development. The interesting thing with regard to the training of a teacher is that what will be a cultural element for the ordinary student of any one of <Col N="598" /> the colleges of the usual type is not only an element of culture in regard to the teacher, but is part of the very subject matter in which he is to work. Consequently the way in which the teacher in training learns the subject in the training college, and the tests that are applied to his acquisition of knowledge in the training college are altogether different in character from those with which we are familiar in colleges of the usual type.</P>
    <P>The professors or lecturers who form the teaching staff of a training college are men who until recently were not paid those salaries which would lure them into the service of the training college.  I dwelt on this in another context, in connection with the University professors, and you will pardon me perhaps for dwelling upon it again in this connection, because it is of the last importance in the consideration of money grant for institutions of this type.  For professors a training college is in competition with the University colleges and with the high schools. As regards some subjects it is really in competition with the larger extensions of public life, and more notably with the professions.  It is difficult, therefore, to get the proper type of professor for one of these training colleges and difficult to keep him when he is got.  Now, the unfortunate thing with regard to these training colleges is that they are living, so to speak, from hand to mouth.  They are private property in effect, and they are under private management, like so many of the Intermediate schools, and the annual grants that are given to them are not sufficient to enable them to create a pension fund.  I examined, before the National Board, the principals and representatives of the principals of these training colleges, and they admitted that a full-time professorship in one of their institutions should be a pensionable office, and is not.  The only explanation is that they are under private management.</P>
    <P>Quite recently one of the most distinguished professors in St. Patrick's Training College was taken with a very serious illness, from which he died only a few weeks ago.  The college was in this difficulty that it could not very well treat him as a civil servant in a <Col N="599" /> similar position might be treated, because the Minister for Finance, if he were granted that allowance, would immediately rule that the college was receiving more money than it needed, and deduct the amount accordingly. That is an undoubted hardship.  It is not merely a hardship with regard to professors in the training colleges, but it reacts injuriously upon the efficiency of the college and through that upon the whole educational work of the country in so far as that depends upon the teaching in the national schools. I hold, if you allow me to repeat, that unless the training college is all that it ought to be, the future teachers of the country who are trained there will not, except occasionally, be all that they ought to be.  Long ago the idea was that the moment a man got a degree in a University, he might immediately turn teacher.  He has been facetiously called by Professor Laurie &mdash;one of the most distinguished philosophers of Scotland to-day, and himself personally interested in and actually engaged in training college work in Scotland&mdash;as &ldquo;a teacher by the grace of God.&rdquo;  I do not know whether he was alluding to the inscription with which we are occasionally made familiar by looking at the obverse of a coin&mdash;&ldquo;Queen Victoria by the grace of God Queen of Great Britain.&rdquo; Those teachers were teachers also through whatever natural gift they had &mdash;a natural calling for that particular work&mdash;but they had to train themselves by practice upon the victims of their first few years of occupation.</P>
    <P>That has been rectified.  New ideas, such as the Minister for Education stands for, have come into play and there are training colleges for teachers. But there is no use in having these colleges unless the requisite grants to make them effective are provided. There is one reform&mdash;an easy reform&mdash; by way of administration that would to some extent meet the case: if the grants were payable, not as hitherto under one heading but under three separate headings&mdash;so much for maintenance of the buildings and repair of these buildings where necessary; so much for the upkeep of the students and the resident administration staff, <Col N="600" /> and then, most important of all, so much for the proper remuneration of the teaching staff.  It ought to be obvious that whether there is a large number of teachers in training in an institution, or a comparatively small number, so long as the institution is not closed up altogether, through failure of numbers, it must be kept to the pitch of efficiency, and consequently the outlay upon teaching staff is bound to be as large as if the students were twice the number.  That, I hold, is an obvious truth.  It only requires to be mentioned to be accepted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Estimate, it has been said by that severe critic of all these things in the Farmers' Party&mdash;Deputy Heffernan&mdash;that education is worse now than it was in his younger days, some twenty years ago.  A young artist who was making great efforts to develop his talent, complained to an elderly lady, who had patronised him by buying of his pictures, in the following words: &ldquo;I feel I am not painting better than I did last year; I am making no progress.&rdquo;  She artlessly and tactlessly replied: &ldquo;You are painting infinitely better; it is merely that you have better taste this year than last year, and that you are in a better position to judge.&rdquo;  Would Deputy Heffernan be offended if I were to point out to him that in the past twenty years education has not been growing worse but Deputy Heffernan has been growing not merely in physical but in mental stature; he is better able to take stock of the type of education and he feels himself raised so far above that level as to think that the teacher of his primary days ought to have left him at that level which, as Euclid would say, is absurd.  In one respect there is something to be said for the Deputy's contention&mdash;as regards teachers in boys' schools.  The competition for the class of man which it is desirable to retain for these schools is becoming fiercer and that was one of the unanswerable claims for increasing the salaries of National School teachers &mdash;in order that a man with a natural bent for teaching, and a desire to make that his career, could really afford to yield to the vocation and take up that type of work.  If Deputy Heffernan is <Col N="601" /> under the impression that education has gone backward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy Heffernan is under the impression that primary education has gone backward, if there were no collateral influences at work, it would really be an indictment of the training colleges.  That is what I want to impress upon him.  It it were true that, all other things remaining the same, the education imparted in the primary schools was worse to-day than twenty years ago, inasmuch as it is in the last twenty-five or thirty years that these denominational or private-management training colleges have been doing their work and doing it in their best way, then it would mean that the training there was a failure.  No one has made that accusation.  There are very severe critics of these institutions. There are some who, like Deputies of the Business Party, would like to transfer the training of teachers wholly to the Universities.  Yet even advocates of that have never suggested as a reason for such transfer that the training colleges had failed.  There is a very important point that must not be overlooked by the Deputy who spoke for the Business Group.  As I have already mentioned, there are two courses of study which the teacher in training pursues.  But the dominant idea is that he should leave the training college a trained teacher.  Therefore if he is imbibing, as he is, scholarship, it is with a view that by the method of acquirement and through the training he has got in educational work, he may have not merely the enlarged mind, the greater scope of information, but the greater faculty developed&mdash;the organised faculty for teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When, as Deputy O'Connell reminded me, the National School Teachers' Organisation and the National University representatives in combination proceeded to frame a scheme for bringing the advantages of the National University within the reach of the teachers who are, or have recently been, undergoing training, we had to take into account that these teachers, or potential teachers, would have to satisfy two authorities.  The <Col N="602" /> educational Ministry tests would have to be satisfied to show that they were competent in their profession, and the University authorities would have to be satisfied that they had the right proficiency demanded of a University graduate.</P>
    <P>When one considers the arduous day of a teacher in training who goes to the practising classes, and who is really like an apprentice with a master craftsman, for so many hours of the day, I need hardly stop to point out it would be impossible for the teacher in training to satisfy both of those requirements, even if there were no physical disabilities attendant on it in the same way as an ordinary University graduate would be able to do it.  Consequently, what could be done by the ordinary undergraduate in two years should in fairness be expected to be done by the teacher in training in less than four years.  The teachers are allowed only two years in the training college.  That is an unsatisfactory situation due to limited finances, and it is a great pity that there is no scheme by which promising students in the training colleges might not, by scholarships, be assisted through the further course of the University.  We had, on the general debate, disquisition upon physical education, and all the time from all sides upon intellectual education.  I should have loved had there been time to ride my hobby.  One very important thing that we ought to keep repeating when we come to discuss education, but that we occasionally seem to forget, is that the whole object of education is to produce a good citizen of the good State.  In our programmes at the training colleges recently there have been introduced elements of citizenship, so that the future teachers may repair the omission that was sadly prominent in the school programmes of the past.  It is in the training colleges that the religious and moral influences are brought to bear upon the future teachers in their formative period, and that is an advantage which cannot be provided in undenominational institutions.  I need not stress that point.  When the subject of moral training of pupils came into my mind I thought immediately &mdash;I wonder was it thought transference or telepathy from some of the other <Col N="603" /> Deputies?&mdash;on the Christian Brothers&mdash; and then I noticed in the estimates that provision is made for approximately 385 men as students in training in 1924-25.  No one in this country needs to be told about the Christian Brothers, and the great, constructive, prominent work they have done in building up not merely the pure sense of nationality and citizenship in hundreds and thousands of pupils, and for what they have done for general morality, or religion, or, let me say, Christianity.  They are rightly called the Christian Brothers, the Religious Congregation of the Christian Schools.</P>
    <P>There is no longer any reason why these schools should be excluded, if they themselves are willing to come in, from the operations of our Ministry of Education.  I am speaking now in ignorance as to whether they are willing or wishful to come in.  I am speaking in total ignorance of what conditions would be imposed on them if they came in.  I am merely noting the fact that the reasons which kept them out no longer exist, and if anyone were under the impression that those bars would be maintained and perpetuated it would be a deliberate infringement of our Constitution which says &ldquo;Neither the Parliament of the Irish Free State nor the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall make any law so as either directly or indirectly to endow any religion&rdquo;&mdash;those are passages I should like to emphasise&mdash;&ldquo;Or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference&rdquo;&mdash; again I emphasise these words&mdash;&ldquo;Or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status or make any discrimination as respects State aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations.&rdquo; Everyone is aware that the practice in the Christian Brothers' Schools is to exhibit religious statues and pictures, and for students to wear religious emblems.  School day opens and ends with prayer, and religious instruction is given at a certain portion of the day.  That congregation has a training college which provides for the schools which are their property and under their control.  I wonder would the Minister give the same status under <Col N="604" /> the Ministry of Education, and the same advantage to their training college as to those which are also denominational and under private management.  It seems to me a great pity if those who were so strong for co-ordination of the schools should fail to see that this problem was worked out many years ago with the utmost success in the Christian Brothers' schools.  In the same building, under the same roof, but in different class-rooms, and under the control of different teachers, you had the primary system and the secondary system worked out in intimate conjunction so that the boy who displays marked capacity in the primary classroom is passed on rapidly into the other division of the school.  So that the very ideal the Minister stresses and that Deputy Johnson has spoken so forcibly on behalf of, is an ideal realised in those schools.  Need I say this, I hold no brief for the Order, except in so far as I am willing to entertain for it an admiration and a feeling of respect that words cannot adequately express.  I know the work they do.  I have been in a Christian Brothers' school myself for years, and I know the quality of the men who have devoted themselves to the service of these schools.</P>
    <P>I have examined their pupils as an Intermediate school examiner; I have seen their work in the case of colleagues who in their early life have been pupils of the schools, and I have had the most ample opportunity for understanding the great and high quality of the work they do.  It is not merely through that sense that I make this plea&mdash;or, rather, it should not be called a plea&mdash;as I really address it to the Minister in the form of a query. The Training College question, I again repeat, is the one that goes to the root of the whole future of this country. Everyone of us has his own panacea for the national ills.  The Deputies who represent what, at any rate, are called the Business Party, believe that instruction in business methods is the great <i>desideratum.</i>  I believe, with the Deputies who have spoken to that effect already, that the work in the primary school is purely educational and not vocational.  That does not say that it need have no trend in the direction of <Col N="605" /> the future vocation.  It is a common mistake to imagine that if the educator has not his eye upon utilitarian ends in the framing of programmes and the arrangement of schemes that he is going to produce someone who is pre-occupied with abstract things and unfit for life.</P>
    <P>It is a very curious thing that those who have laid stress upon what they call the three R's will, at some other moment, be found eloquent on democracy and the rights of the people. Are we to doom through ineffective Training Colleges all the children who can go only to those first schools, into which they enter in their earliest years, to a low type of instruction which will merely enable them to be hewers of wood and drawers of water?  Are we not to consider them as men and brothers, who are entitled to have their minds so cultivated, and their souls so enlarged, that they may have all the height and depth of life through the span of years that belongs to them? To talk of imparting only the three R's in the primary schools is to stand for privilege and caste.  The Deputy who spoke in these terms would not do that if his attention were consciously directed to it, but by implication he has advocated a system of things in which all that is best in life would go, not to those who began with a handicap, but the richer pearls would go to those at least with a better social status.</P>
    <P>One of the great things with regard to the Christian Brothers' Schools is that they have brought within the reach of the poorest and humblest all the advantages of the highest type of education, and they have done that with the personal sacrifice of themselves.  I have known Christian Brothers who, in view of their attainments, educational and otherwise, were well fitted to be University professors, and who could discharge the duties in a University with that thoroughness and completeness that they did in the schools among the boys.  They were saints amongst men, as well as being effective teachers and scholars, who gave their services to these schools without reward or honour.  I think they inspired pupils with ideals of life, because it must be impossible for the open-eyed boy in <Col N="606" /> school who has growing ideas of what life is, and what things in life mean, not to be inspired with respect for men of that sort, to feel that there are values in life of different standings, and to be differently computed from the standards of life that are computed in business.  I am not opposing anyone who speaks for education in business. It is a necessary part of the national greatness and national stability, but let us not forget that not by bread alone doth man live.  We declare in our Constitution that we would not stand for privilege.  It may be that I appear to enthuse in attributing all these things to training colleges, but I am speaking now about my business; about things that I do claim to know; what a training college is and what a training college does.  I say without any fear of being declared guilty of exaggeration, what I said earlier, that the training college is the <i>clou,</i> the central bolt, of the whole educational fabric.</P>

      <P>With regard to training colleges and the endowment provided for them, it may be at once admitted that our provision is not adequate, and not complete.  Again, it is one of the things we have taken over. The small provision for training provided, and the shortness of time allowed, is, as it appears in these Estimates for the public service for Saorstát Eireann, 1924-25, except in mere matters of detail, almost a repetition of what might be found in the Estimates of the British Government for the same service in the years 1914-15.  I may point out that at that time, at all events, provision was only made for two years' training for teachers.  No provision was made for them having access to the benefits of University teaching.  No provision was made for having the professors in training colleges placed in a position, with regard to remuneration, relative to what they ought to occupy in regard to their knowledge, skill and power in their work.  All that is part of the inheritance that I spoke of before.  In Belgium four years is, I think, the term for training in the normal training college. I am sure that consideration would appeal to those here who take up the stand of being the representatives of business and of industry.  Belgium, <Col N="607" /> I think, is counted, and counts yet, very high in the world with regard to success in what is called business and success in what is called industry.</P>
      <P>As for bringing the training of teachers into close relation with the work of universities it was pointed out here that mediaeval universities regarded their work mainly as consisting of the training of teachers.  I think it would be an excellent thing if universities of the present day reverted to a large extent to that position, and if that service were expected and required of them by the public in general.  As a matter of detail, a scheme for training in connection with universities has been put into operation.  Again we are only at the beginning of things.  The inspectors of this department, and the university examiners have already met and a scheme for the training of teachers in connection with universities has already begun to operate.  Details of it have, I think, been published some time ago in a publication called &ldquo;The School Weekly.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As I stated, we are only in the beginning of things and we are only finding our way.  Deputy Mulcahy raises a question which, to my mind, is one of great importance, and that is of providing a system of training which for the purpose of utilising the Irish language and giving it its position in education would bring in as teachers capable students who are already native speakers of Irish.  We had a plan.  A question was asked about it, and it is called the Dáil Scholarships.  It figures in the Estimates in a rather insignificant way. That plan was not a success, but I have on hands a proposal which, I think, will lead up to the systematic training of teachers trained from the Irish speaking districts, and I trust that in a very short time it will be possible to <Col N="608" /> establish within the Irish-speaking districts a number of preparatory training schools for the purpose of preparing teachers.  I propose to commence with two such schools for girls and one for boys.  I hope I have made it quite clear, but, if not, I am going to make it clear now, and if the Christian Brothers' Schools come into the system of public education under the ordinary terms applicable to other institutions, they have the right to come in, and it is not a question of the will or the wish of a Minister or a department.  The same would apply to their system of training.  Their system of training comes into the system of public education, and when I say that, I do not mean that that means any turning upside down or anything of that kind, but it does mean accepting the supervision of this department, the test of standards and so on.  If things come to that stage it seems to me it is not a question of decision for the Minister of the Department, but it is simply a question of exercising a public right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out in that connection to the Dáil that if and when those events come to pass the Estimate which appeared before you to-day will have to be considerably amplified.  Deputy Magennis dealt with the point of the special sort of work that is being done in training colleges and the special qualification which ought to be required from those who ought to do that work and the corresponding special provision which ought to be made by the State to enable that work to be done.  I may say that I am in agreement with his argument on that point.  I think that a professor in a training college ought to be a man of very exceptional qualifications. He is not only teaching particular subjects, but he has to teach how these particular subjects are to be taught, and he has to teach how they are to be taught under conditions quite different from those under which he is teaching them.  Deputy Hewat, I think, put in a mild plea against what he termed compulsory Irish.  I am not going to enlarge on that except to say that I gave a list of subjects which constitute <Col N="609" /> our present basic course of elementary education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a mistake in my notes.  These subjects are very few in number.  They are Irish, English, Mathematics, and so on.  I want to make the position perfectly plain. Remove Irish from that list and what is the effect?  Remove Irish from that list of subjects which you require as a basis and what is the effect?  You at once proscribe Irish by doing that.  A subject which is made voluntary in competition with a list of subjects which are made compulsory is a subject which is placed under a disability.  If that be the public demand, the public mind ought to be clear about it.  No one raises the question of compulsoriness in the sense of coercion, for example, about the teaching of arithmetic. It is not held to be oppressive. It is not held to be an interference with liberty that the student is required to learn arithmetic.  Consequently certain subjects are, will be, and must be compulsory, and I repeat you can either put Irish inside or outside that list.  If you put it outside that list the result is certain.  You will also put it outside the schools.  If that be the public demand the public must make that demand clear.  It is entirely in opposition to my idea of what is right and what ought to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards sub-head E the first thing, I suppose, that will be noticed is that there is a reduction under this sub-head of £314,000. That, of course, is due to matters which have been brought to the attention of this Dáil on another occasion.  It is due to the 10 per cent. reduction in teachers' salaries.  I do not intend at this stage to make more than a passing reference to this for the reasons, first that this particular Ministry is not entirely responsible, possibly not at all responsible, for the reduction.  It is a matter of Executive policy and is an Executive decision.  In the second place, all I have to say on the matter was said on a previous occasion here. A greater reason is that the legality of the action of the Ministry is a matter <Col N="610" /> which will in the very near future be decided in another place, and they will there have an opportunity of justifying their action.  I mention it in case my neglecting to mention it might be misinterpreted and taken that the people whom I specially speak for were satisfied with the decision.  As to this heading of &ldquo;National Schools,&rdquo; I am not quite sure how many schools are in operation in the Saorstát at the moment, and, perhaps, the Minister would be in a position to tell me, but I think, judging by the statistics, which are now four years old, there are something like five or six thousand schools in operation in the Saorstát.  In my opinion, the number of schools, after making due allowance for the nature of our population, is too large, and I believe it could be very considerably reduced, and that the reduction would not only make for economy, in the sense it is understood sometimes by the Government, that is, the saving of money, but it would make for economy in the wider sense and certainly make for efficiency.  I never could understand why you have side by side and under one roof two separate schools. They are called schools, two separate institutions, one attended by 35 or 40 boys and the other attended by 35 or 40 girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each of those institutions you have the standard duplicated, necessitating, of course, an increased staff.  I have called attention to this before, and repeatedly the attention of this Ministry has been called to the large number of schools which we have and which is undoubtedly adding to this Vote very considerably.  I must say that I am not satisfied that the Ministry has made a real effort to deal with this matter. There is a regulation&mdash;it is not a new regulation&mdash;which existed since the time of the old National Board to the effect that where any two such schools are possible of being amalgamated and where a vacancy occurs, amalgamation must take place, provided the average number of attendances in such schools is less than 35 at the time the vacancy is created.  That is the rule, which would help so far as it goes.  I maintain those figures of average attendance should be increased at least to 50 or 60. That is, where you have two little <Col N="611" /> schools beside each other, and where the attendance is up to 50 or 60, it should be amalgamated, especially when a vacancy takes place.  There is no reason why it should not be amalgamated without any vacancy taking place.  There are instances where even the existing rule has not been insisted on.  There is a belief and a general feeling that if the manager or somebody or other objects to the amalgamation and puts up a strong enough fight the Ministry will give way.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, there are cases&mdash;I have a couple in my mind at the moment&mdash;that happened within the past year or two, where that rule, such as it is, and it does not go far enough, has not been carried out, just because the local manager possibly had some reason to think that amalgamation should not take place.  I do press on the Ministry the necessity of dealing adequately with this question of the amalgamation of schools.  I must not be taken as urging the creation of big unwieldy schools.  I do not believe in the school of a thousand pupils by any means, but that is a different question to what I am dealing with at the moment. Then there is the question of two or three little schools inside an area of half-a-mile or so.  I think serious efforts should be made to get in such places a central school where the teaching would be very much more efficient than in these small separate schools.  These are matters that ought to engage the serious attention of the Ministry.  Then as against that there is the inclination on the part of people sometimes to apply for the erection of new schools.  I have no statistics with regard to these, and perhaps the Minister would be able to give me statistics as to the number of new schools which have been taken into connection or which have received sanction.  I do not mean in this connection any new schools which are replacing old ones, but schools erected in places where previously there was no school.  I think it was the Minister himself on one occasion who said in such cases it would be better if provision were made for taking children who may be living in an outlying district or a long distance <Col N="612" /> from the school, by way of a motor van into school rather than to take the trouble of erecting a new school to be attended by a small number of pupils. As I am on this matter of the erection of schools, might I say that a good deal could be done to relieve present congestion in regard to school accommodation, if something in the nature of temporary school premises were erected, and I think that could be done cheaply and quite effectively.</P>

      <P>I have said all I intended to say on that matter anyhow. I come now to the question of the teachers.  There is a matter in this connection that I think is not generally known, and a matter to which sufficient attention is not given.  I refer to what I might call the security of tenure of the teachers.  A teacher is a public servant in the fullest sense of the word.  He is trained at the expense of the State largely, he is paid by the State and his conditions of service are settled by the State, but he is not a State servant in the sense that a policeman or civil servant is a State servant, inasmuch as once he is employed, he is not continued in employment as a matter of course by the State.  His employment depends on the number of pupils who may be attending at the school.  If a certain number of pupils attend the school an extra teacher is appointed.  If the number of pupils decreases for any reason&mdash;it does not matter that it may not have, and it generally has not, anything to do with the teacher himself, but there is a decrease owing to a movement of the population&mdash;the teacher, often a man who has given twenty or thirty years service, finds himself out of a position, and there is no provision in the Department whereby a position is <Col N="613" /> found elsewhere for that man.  He simply has to go out and as best he can seek another position.</P>
      <P>That does not seem to me to be proper.  It is absolutely necessary that when a man occupies the position of teacher, and when, as well, he has given satisfactory service, he should have security of tenure in his position. Various proposals have been put forward from time to time to deal with this matter, but the simplest seems to me that such a teacher should be continued in that particular school until suitable employment is found for him in another school, and that while there are such teachers available, no new appointments should be made.  There are instances where such teachers are available, highly qualified and experienced teachers of twenty years' service possibly, yet new teachers are being trained, and sometimes untrained teachers are being appointed.  That is a question that should be tackled by the Ministry.  It is a question that affects assistant teachers mostly, but the same thing applies sometimes to principal teachers also when the average comes below a certain figure.  There is no provision made for the teacher, in the way of finding other employment.</P>
      <P>The only other matter I wish to refer to is E 9&mdash;the grant towards the heating of schools and the cleansing of out offices.  That grant is £13,500, and as I take it on the basis of the number of schools, would average about £2, £2 10s. or possibly £3 per school.  I am sure everybody will agree that that sum is not sufficient, not nearly sufficient, to meet what it purports to meet. The conditions under which it is given are, that an equivalent sum will be found by the locality.  Anyone who knows the conditions of the schools and the provisions that were made for the heating and the cleaning of the schools will know that it is a matter that is not done in the way that it should be done.</P>

      <P>Possibly there are places where it still lingers, but there are some schools where even that provision is not made and there is often doubt on the part of the teacher as to what steps he should take when he finds that nobody is making provision for the heating of the school.  Some instances have been brought to the notice of the department where a teacher wired to the Education Office to know what she would do on coming into school on a winter's morning and finding no provision made for the heating of the school, in spite of the fact that such a state of affairs was brought to the notice of the manager, who is supposed to make this provision.  The manager of the school is supposed to make this provision.  Sometimes he does not make that provision, whether it is from inability or unwillingness I cannot say; but it shows the position that we are in with regard to the matter, the want of proper provision for the heating, cleaning, general upkeep and maintenance of the schools.  It is a peculiar commentary on the position that public buildings, such as local hospitals, gaols, courthouses and asylums, are all provided for.  Special provision is made in our legislation for them, but so far as the schools are concerned there is no such provision. There is this very small grant which was given on certain conditions, and which is quite inadequate to meet the very great need there is for keeping our schools in a proper condition.</P>

At all events, I have no hesitation in saying that my point of view is that that is a very excessive sum for the amount of value received. I can quite believe that Deputy O'Connell is right when he says that there are far too many schools.  I believe that must be so, and I believe it is so to the knowledge of every one of us.  There is a tremendous number of schools, and the number of different schools in certain places cannot, I imagine, be for the good of the general education of the country.  I think that as far as that is concerned we can class two things together; too many national schools and too many public houses.</P>

      <P>Without going into detail, I would put it to the Minister that this country cannot afford to pay the amount of money that is in the Estimates for the amout of educational work that is being done.  I maintain that a very much more perfect system of education could be set up for less money.  Deputy O'Connell may say that that means cutting the teachers' salaries.  I do not think it does.  I agree with him in this, that a high standard of teacher would be beneficial to the schools; a far less lesser number of teachers would be to the benefit of the pupils, and in that way a very considerable economy could be effected for the whole system.  I only got up to emphasise that one point, that the amount is more than the country can afford, and at all events if we are to be compelled to contribute on this scale, certainly that amount of money ought to give us very much greater efficiency in connection with education.</P>

Both he and I have brought it before the Dáil previously, and I wish to support as strongly as I can his remarks as to the possibility of economy in this respect securing greater efficiency in the schools.  I do not think there is any real danger of <Col N="616" /> that economy leading us into the other pitfall of too large schools, and I quite support his contention that there is a great possibility of economy, without falling into that danger.  As to what the limits of the amount of that economy would be I do not suppose any of us could really form an estimate without having access to official information on the point; but for my own part. I am convinced that there is a possibility of very large economy.  Of course, it is not an economy that could come about rapidly, but I do not think we are really moving appreciably in the direction of effecting that economy, and I do put it up to the Minister that it is one of the things that he ought most seriously to take into consideration and have investigated, to see in what way and to what extent we can curtail the number of our schools, without necessarily curtailing the amount of money that is given to education&mdash; because I have never taken up the attitude that it is too much&mdash;but to have more available for expenditure in other directions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word in regard to Deputy Hewat's statement. He refers to this large sum of three million odd pounds.  He speaks of it in relation to education, but he thinks of it in relation to taxation and income tax.  He speaks of it in relation to education, and he says that we could be getting a very much better system, a very much better return in educational results.  I wonder what test the Deputy is going to apply.  Does he think that because this sum is perhaps thirty per cent., possibly fifty per cent. &mdash;I do not know the amount&mdash;above what it would have been five or seven years ago that he is now in a position to assess the value he is getting for three million pounds?  I suggest to the Deputy that he cannot tell; he does not know whether he is getting value for this sum to-day or not.  What we are suffering from now, all these complaints about the position of boys and girls coming out of primary schools, is the result of the earlier policy, the starvation policy.  One cannot tell whether the value is being received for these three millions, and you will not be able to tell for quite a number of years yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> After all, money spent on education is largely spent in faith; one has to have certain intelligence in the application of the faith, but you are relying on what you believe will be the result, and you are not going to assess it within a year or two of the expenditure of the money.  It is quite a mistaken notion that you can take the sum of three million pounds and relate that to what you conceive to be the educational results to these boys and girls. You may quite legitimately criticise the method of the expenditure, but to take hold of this sum of money, as Deputy Hewat did, and to say that the education returns are not good enough for the expenditure of the money, I say is looking at the matter falsely, and prejudicing education and the Ministry in a way that is not fair to either.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite right, and very desirable, that having decided to spend this sum of £3,389,000 for teaching, we should insist on doing everything possible to secure that the quality of the teacher, the capacity and character of the teacher, should be such as to ensure that the money will be well spent, but you cannot judge that by the results you see in this year of 1924.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a few words with regard to Deputy O'Connell's statement concerning the amalgamation of schools.  If such a system were to be carried out in, say, my own county, it would mean that some means of conveyance would have to be provided to take the children to school.  In my county there are schools which are two miles, and in some cases, a longer distance apart.</P>

      <P>I misunderstood the Deputy, then, in the point he was making in that.  I may say, however, that in my opinion small children have, in most instances in the country, to trudge too far a distance to school, and I think that something might be done in the way of providing a conveyance for these children.  I know, of course, that that implies expense, but still it is deserving of consideration.  I know that in my own case I had to travel <Col N="618" /> three Irish miles to school.  I left home in the morning at 8 o'clock and did not get back until 6 o'clock at night.  During that period I had to do with a very light mid-day lunch.  Such a system as that imposes a very severe strain on a child's physique.</P>

      <P>I maintain that the children now going to the primary schools are not as well educated as the children attending them, say, twenty-five years ago.  That is my contention, and it is the general opinion throughout the country.  It is not a case of what a Deputy says here that matters, but that is the general opinion throughout the country, that the children are not as well educated now in the primary schools as they were a quarter of a century ago.  The point I make is that the three primary subjects: reading, writing and arithmetic, are not as well taught now as they were then.  I find it is a very difficult matter to get any young fellow in the country engaged in farming pursuits to take up such a simple position as the honorary secretaryship of the local branch of the Farmers' Union.  There are very few youths in the country who, from an educational point of view, are qualified to take up such a position. I remember the time when the pupils from the national schools in the country were getting places in the Civil Service.  They were able to pass from the National School into the Second Division of the Civil Service, and some even got higher places.  Pupils are not now being turned out from the national schools who are able to take these high places.  The Minister will say, I expect, that that is not an ideal to be aimed at.  I acknowledge it is not an ideal to be aimed at for boys to get places in the Civil Service or in a shop or employment as a clerk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may also say that they turned out good Civil Servants in the past, but that they did not turn out good farmers.  What is the position now?  We are not turning out young men from the national schools who will make good Civil Servants or clerks, and neither are we turning out young men who will make good farmers from <Col N="619" /> the scientific point of view.  They are not good either for the one or the other occupation.  In saying that, I do not believe that the fault lies with the teachers.  I have been in fairly close association with the teachers, and I believe that the teachers are just as competent and as painstaking, and that they are giving just as good a service now as ever they gave.  I do not say that for the purpose of giving lip service, but I believe it is a fact.  I believe there is something wrong with the system, and that some change ought to be made in it.  Otherwise, instead of having an educated country we will have one which will earn the term that it is the worst educated country in Europe.  It is useless to talk about cultural education.  Deputy Professor Magennis, in the course of his speech, implied that the children of the poorest parents have the right to a cultural education just as much as the children of the richest parents, but his statement, I think, implies class education. I asked Deputy Professor Magennis what is the use of talking about cultural education if a boy cannot read or write.  I am not against culture.  I presume the Deputy thinks that we on these benches dare not raise our voice when it comes to a matter of education.</P>

I would say to him, and to other Deputies, that we come here to do the work of the nation just as much as any other representative in the Dáil.  We may have a bias towards farming, but we are interested in the general work of the country and we are particularly interested in the matter of education, because we are convinced that the future of the country and the future of the calling to which we belong depends on the success of our educational system. We are aware that an immense sum of money is being spent on education. We have not proposed any reduction in this Vote, because we realise that the money, if properly spent, will be well spent money.  What we do complain of is that for the money we spend on education we are not getting <Col N="620" /> proper value, and we justify our view on that by the results as seen throughout the country and on the results of the immense number of children who are badly educated, or at least are not as well educated as the children attending the schools a quarter of a century ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Estimate of three millions.  I think there is a good deal in what Deputy O'Connell stated as regards the amalgamation of schools.  The main idea with all of us is that the education of the youth of the country wants to be improved.  I fear that Deputy Heffernan did not follow quite accurately what Deputy Professor Magennis, Deputy Professor Thrift, Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Johnson said on this subject.  He spoke of these Deputies as having referred to a cultural Ireland, and seemed to think that the bedrock of that cultural Ireland has got to begin in primary education. There is one thing that I do not believe Deputies in the Dáil are likely to forget, and it is that the whole basis of education in this country has to begin in the primary school.  The education has to be continuous, and if the grounding which the pupils get in the primary schools is not good then these children will not be able to go to the secondary schools or to the Universities to continue their studies.  The first essential is that they should be well instructed in the primary school. That they have not been well instructed in the primary schools has been one of the failings in the whole of our educational system.  That is why our technical education system has been a failure, because in the technical schools they have to do the work which should have been done in the primary schools.  The childrens' education was so sadly neglected in the primary schools that they were unable to take advantage of the instruction given in the technical classes.  To my mind this Vote of three millions is altogether inadequate for education, but inadequate as it is, I think it could be handled to better effect in the country and with greater benefit to the children if the local school attendance committees would do their duty.  From <Col N="621" /> a return I saw in the daily Press lately, school attendance in Ireland is one of the lowest in Europe.  In fact it is an absolute scandal.</P>

On the discussion of it I have allowed a little latitude, but we must not go too far. We are now discussing education as carried on in the national schools.  On this Vote School Attendance Committees do not come in.  Under this Vote there is nothing on it as to the expenses incurred by School Attendance Committees or anything of that kind.  That has been discussed as a general question already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I was not present when the general discussion took place.  I refer to it largely on the grounds that the statement was made by a previous Deputy that education in Ireland is not as good now as it was twenty years ago, and I refer to this fact about School Attendance Committees as being one of the reasons why the children are not attending schools. I believe that, in the hands of the Minister we have, the future of education is secure.  I believe that these three millions, if properly expended under proper supervision, and, above all, if a proper amalgamation scheme for schools were carried out, the standard of education in these schools will <Col N="622" /> be greatly increased.  The inspectors will have far greater power of supervision where you have an amalgamation of schools than they have at present with schools in which there is an attendance of less than 35 in many cases.  I support Deputy O'Connell's suggestion for that reason, because I see in it an opportunity for bringing these schools up to the standard that they should attain to, and I hope that the Minister will take a note of the remarks that the Deputy made on the subject.</P>

      <P>I accept that disclaimer.  There was a general concensus of opinion that there were too many national schools in the country. That view was echoed more than once on the occasion of the debate upon the estimates last year.  But that reference was not altogether the representation that Deputy O'Connell makes this evening, because what some of us had in view was that in country districts possibly to meet the requirements of a sparsely populated country there was a multiplication of small and consequently of unsatisfactory school houses. Now, that defect of the administration of the national school system was realised, even under the late National Board, and a policy had been inaugurated of reducing the number of such schools as far as possible.  It is a very difficult problem to deal with for a variety of reasons.  First of all, the multiplicity of schools is not in every case due to geographical requirements; there is the consideration of the various Christian sects who like to have their schools representative of their own religious views, and to have these staffed by members of their own religion, and none of us that belong to the religion professed by the majority of the population, would care to propose or to suggest even that the number of schools should be reduced by incorporating the existing schools to the detriment of any particular denomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards what is quite free to deal with, it would be possible, I have maintained, and I have seen no reason to alter my views in these years, to amalgamate the schools and provide not merely for the health of the pupil through living in a better constructed school-house for so many school hours of the day, but to minister also to his <Col N="625" /> intellectual benefit by the result being achieved, that the larger centralised school could be better staffed and better provided.  Now the difficulty that was raised against my contention on a former occasion was that it is not always good educationally to have very large schools, that difficulty would arise of too large schools only in the city.  I do not think it is necessary to consider the possibility in the case of country districts. A provision for bringing children from distant places to the schoolhouse is not an insuperable difficulty, because, as I pointed out on many occasions and I may repeat it again, in Saskatchewan, Alberta, a distant province of Canada, and in Scotland the local authorities provide covered vans. and in some cases even motor vans. for taking the children from their homes and delivering them in the schools and returning them in the evening.  Such a provision as that would not cost any more than the saving that would be effected through the amalgamation of small schools.  Furthermore it would enable the public authority by having a smaller number of schools, to have more frequent inspection and also would enable the provision as is taken account of here of the free grants of books and equipment to be less costly to the State.  Now there is one point in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>My limit of time is not yet exhausted and I would like to deal with this. &ldquo;E 7, Evening Continuation School, £5,000.&rdquo;  I seem to have a natural capacity for exciting antipathy at public meetings.  The last time that I addressed an assembly in the Mansion House I aroused the wrath of the Chairman, the Lord Mayor, by declaring that the great need of the city at the present moment is adult education. He interpreted that as an attack upon the interrupters in the audience.  The provision of continuation schools is an arrangement by which in Great Britain they have dealt with the problem of extending the education of those who unfortunately were taken away from school prematurely and have had therefore no opportunity of continuing their mental development.  In Ireland <Col N="626" /> the utmost provision that we have been able to make, so far, is that of the evening elementary school and that is usually contemplated as meant really for youths, not for adults.  I miss from these Estimates anything towards the providing of schools for adults.  It is a curious fact that it is supposed that after a man or woman has reached a certain age he or she is not to be expected to learn any more.  That is a most narrow-minded view to take and it presses with undue hardship upon the adults in cities, especially amongst the working classes.  In England an effort has been made to provide University Extension.  University Extension Lectures can be made use of, and the fullest advantage derived from them only by those who have not lost all traces of the results achieved in their schoolboy days.  In order to provide the proper type of audience for University Extension Lectures it seems to me that the elementary education side should be advanced to meet the need.  Anyone who sees the avidity of the citizens of Dublin for lectures, and who observes that they will come to hear a lecture on any subject no matter how repellant it is or seems to be from its title, will realise that there is at hand in our towns, and above all in our large cities quite a considerable body of evening school-goers who would take advantage if they were given the opportunity. So it seems to me that the Minister might extend his aims&mdash;and they are great aims that he has expounded to-day&mdash;in that direction most profitably.</P>

When 20, 30, 40 or 50 pupils come into the presence of a professor, the amount of ascendancy that he is able to exercise over them is one of the marvels of our civilisation.  But I find myself here one pupil in the presence of, I do not know how many authorities, all equally formidable to me and all at once.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of schools in operation at present within the area of jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann is roughly 5,700.  Everybody who has spoken has been at one as regards the question of amalgamation.  I am speaking in the presence of two former Commissioners of National Education who, I think, have a thorough appreciation of the position with regard to the multiplicity of schools and the problem of amalgamation. Getting down to actual figures, the year before last the number of schools was diminished by 80, and last year it was diminished by 40.  On the other side of the account, the number of new schools the previous year was 12 and last year it was 16.  It is sometimes necessary to open new schools even under present conditions, when there is such a large number of schools in the country.  Deputies here know that, because I have been approached by Deputies from every part of the House with regard to the necessity of opening new schools.  We have been steadily trying to deal with this problem of reducing supernumerary schools.  Continuously and incessantly it has occupied the attention of my department.  If my department were not as keen on that matter as it ought to be, it has at its back the Department of Finance.  I can assure the Deputies present that the Department of Finance is in no respect lacking in its pursuit of this particular object&mdash;the reduction and amalgamation of schools. The opinion of Deputies who have spoken here this evening represents, I take it, the opinion of those Deputies who have not spoken as well.  This is a problem that belongs to the rural districts almost entirely, and I would suggest that each Deputy would come to me with a list of the schools in his own <Col N="628" /> constituency which he thinks ought to be amalgamated.  It would be an excellent exercise in public responsibility if the Deputies would publish those lists locally before they come to me with them.  Deputy Heffernan was absent, I think, when I spoke the other evening about provision for school gardens, because he recommended this course this evening.  That would arise properly now and I hope some of the Deputy's colleagues will draw his attention to what I said the other evening.</P>

      <P>Yes; but in order to prevent it taking up too much time again it would be well if Deputies who were not present last evening would refer to the report of what was said on the subject.  There were other points made that I think were more points for debate than anything else. Deputy Heffernan insists on the all-importance of the three R's.  Some of the most remarkable men that ever shaped the course of events in this world knew nothing about the three R's.  William the Conquerer could not do the simplest sum in arithmetic but yet he constructed a great State.  I noticed that when Brian Boroimhe went to Armagh he had to get another man to write his name in the Book of Armagh.  I presume instances of that kind of great men who have really accomplished great work without the ordinary education could be multiplied without limit.  I am not pretending that the three R's are not valuable things and not of importance, but let us not go on our knees before things of that kind and adore them.  There are other parts of education beside the three R's., and if these other things enabled other men to do great things in the past they can enable other men to do great things in the future&mdash; especially with the assistance of the three R's.  I would be strongly inclined to fall in with what Deputies say about a higher grade of Civil Servants and a higher grade of clerks having been produced in a former generation, or at some other time than the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I throw myself back for the <Col N="629" /> space of a generation, I find that I was a Civil Servant and I would like to think that I was very much superior to the kind of Civil Servants we have at present.  But the fact of the matter is that I do not believe a bit of it.  I believe we have just as good a stamp of Civil Servant and clerk now as we had 30 years ago.  The defects of the National School were said to be the cause of partial failure in technical education.  I do not think that is so. I think the failure results from the gap of time between the leaving of the school by the pupil and his going back to learn things in the technical school. We are all subject to that.  I think if Deputy Thrift or Deputy Magennis or any other of the most learned Deputies that we have were separated from the particular subjects in which they are eminent and distinguished for a number of years, they would find that a certain amount of depreciation had taken place in the meantime and that applies even more to pupils from the primary schools.  When their education is interrupted and when they go back to get primary instruction, as they have to do, in the technical schools it is quite a natural thing that a great deal of what they learned before has to be learned again.  It is a large figure, one of the largest votes we have in comparison per head of the pupils educated.  It is very much less than what is spent in England, or than what is spent in Scotland.</P>

      <P>This deals with manual and practical instruction. In this connection I would like briefly to refer to the subject of practical instruction which was referred to by the Minister in his address on Thursday, and to which he was about to refer when you called his attention to the fact that it came properly under this Vote.  The Minister spoke of his experience some weeks ago.  When he spoke of horticulture I might take the liberty of saying that the term was not properly descriptive of the subject which was under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the learned Professor to whom he referred on that occasion will be the first to say that there was a very, very marked distinction between horticulture as such and rural science as such.  There is no doubt, to those who are intimately acquainted with the subject, a very great distinction, for while horticulture might treat merely of the technical methods of growing plants and flowers and that sort of thing, rural science teachers, and purports to teach, a different thing.  Rural science is important in a country like this, and I am rather disappointed, therefore, that under this heading of manual and practical instruction, while provision seems to be made for organisers of elementary science, musical instruction, drawing, kindergarten, and various other things, no provision is made in this Vote for an organiser or inspector of rural science.  Some years ago, in 1914-'15-'16, especially 1916, this subject was one which was receiving growing attention in the national schools. The number of school gardens taken in connection with the schools was yearly increasing up to 1918 or 1919.  Since then there has been a falling off.  One reason, no doubt, is that the question of school time again comes in.  Provision cannot properly be made in the school time table for the teaching of this very important subject, but I think all the same that it is a question of proper organisation of school time.  That is why I regret that a special organiser or inspector who would have special knowledge of this particular subject is not provided for, because I think it can be shown that many of the subjects which we speak of as ordinary school subjects, such as reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and so on, could be taught through the medium of, and in connection with, rural science.  There is no reason why composition should not take the form of writing on an experiment on the growth of plants, or on the various systems of manuring, for instance; neither is there any reason why arithmetical calculations should not have some connection with the work the pupil would do in his experiments in rural science.  There is no doubt whatever that it is in that direction that the bias which the Minister <Col N="631" /> speaks of, and which we all acknowledge to be necessary, can be given. For this purpose it is essential that provision should be made for setting aside plots adjacent to schools.</P>
      <P>But this is one thing I would like to impress on the Minister, that to get the best advantage from this particular subject that could possibly be got in a school, it should be taught by a man or woman who has a special interest in that subject.  If you begin by compelling, or trying to compel a man whose taste does not lie in that direction to teach ao subject of this kind, you do much more harm than good.  I believe some provision is made, and the Minister referred to it last Thursday, in the training colleges whereby the students are given the opportunity of doing something in connection with this subject of rural science.  What I urge is, that it ought to be encouraged in the schools where there is the opportunity, and where teachers are prepared and ready to take it up.  It should be encouraged in every way in that connection.  A small point to which I wish to refer is that of special fees for the teaching of mathematics as extra subjects, which means that they are subjects taught outside the ordinary school hours under special conditions, and special fees are paid in such cases.  I see, under D, the word is not &ldquo;fees&rdquo; but &ldquo;grants&rdquo; for gardening, and I was just wondering whether the fees available some years ago, when this subject was effectively taught, are still available.  The distinction seems to be that these are not grants in the way of fees, and I would like to have some information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with what our friends in the Farmers' Benches have said repeatedly as to the necessity for training the children, in our rural schools especially, to have a love for the land. I know of no way in which an interest in the land can be so well created as through this subject of rural science. Interest in this case is derived from knowledge, a knowledge of the science underlying everyday operations.  A person who has a knowledge of rural science will see a new interest in every clod of earth, in every spade of earth <Col N="632" /> that is turned up, and in every plant and flower along the wayside.  If you want to make this country what we would like to see in the matter of agricultural education, it is along that line we must work.  I do not for a moment say that this subject means the keeping of gardens.  That is not the intention at all.  It is not intended that gardening as such should be taught.  That would be in the nature of technical education, or specialisation, and the garden is used only as a medium for teaching the science which underlies plant life, and farming and gardening operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unnecessary to say that I agree heartily with what Deputy O'Connell has said about rural science, but there is another kindred subject, so far as girls attending national schools are concerned, that is, the subject of domestic economy.  I notice that, in so far as italics indicate the aims and desires of the Ministry, the schools were, and have been, provided with a head organiser of domestic economy, and eleven assistant organisers at fairly respectable salaries.  For 1924-25 we are permitted to have one head organiser at a lower salary, with ten assistants.  I spoke upon the application of this subject on a previous occasion, but, unfortunately, as far as I can judge, it was treated as a jest on my part.  If I had spoken of the brightening of the home, I might have been taken seriously, or if I had dwelt upon the basis of domestic happiness in a well-ordered home, and then had addressed good citizens on the beneficent influences of the good home life, it would not have been regarded as a jocose criticism.  I am looking, not merely to the acquisition on the part of girls attending the national schools, of the knowledge of the ordered house, as indicated by domestic economy, but I am thinking of girls who will go into domestic service when they have left school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the extraordinary ideas that have survived out of the Victorian age into the present is the idea that domestic service is something inferior&mdash;that it is a type of occupation of which those wholly engaged in it ought to be ashamed.  It is the fault of the employer, <Col N="633" /> if that is so.  I am not unwilling&mdash;let me put it in that mild form&mdash; to confess that I joined in a movement to organise employers of domestic service, so that domestic servants in their turn might be organised as a union, and that it be a reciprocal action that those who employ, and those who were employed, in this very vital service, should come to a mutual understanding and that the community should have its conception of things so widened and so enlightened as not to speak of, say, a successful cabinetmaker as marrying beneath him if he married a parlour-maid, a cook, or a kitchen-maid.  These are part of the social reforms that are not unworthy, I think, of the attention even of the Dáil, to have, through our accepted institutions, provision made for the well-ordered life.  I think it is one of the scourges of life in the rural community that farmers' wives, or farmers' servants, are altogether uninitiated as regards the great art of running a house, that is, the great art of domestic economy.  In the training college for women teachers&mdash;one of the training colleges to which I referred recently&mdash; considerable attention is given to this, but unless the guiding force of the Ministry of Education is applied through these organisers of domestic economy, and the teachers are kept up to that pitch during the years that follow after they have left the training college, the subject will get into the background again and lose its interest, and the old false notion will dominate the schools and dominate the homes, that it is not the sort of subject that can be learned or lectured upon.  I think the Ministry would be well advised to pursue their first ambition and set up a well paid Department for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There is one other respect in which the organisation of the staff appears to me to be defective, and that is as regards drawing.  As a subject, drawing seems to the superficial view to be a type of accomplishment, whereas it is one of the most important of the educational agencies.  It is not merely a question of turning out a good draughtsman, or someone who can draw well, it is a training in accurate <Col N="634" /> observation, as tested through accurate reproduction.  It is more than that. It provides the boy who becomes the craftsman later in life with a capacity for work, without which he is maimed and truncated in his work.  There are types of employment in which it is essential that a man should be able to draw, draw to scale, and work from drawings.  Unless at the time of pupilage his mind is directed to that, and unless he is given facility for it in the exercises of the school, he will not acquire the requisite proficiency later on in life, and he remains the inferior workman and cannot rise in his craft. It is a most important subject in the school curriculum, and I cannot understand the narrowness of view that prevails by which it is regarded as one of the subsidiary and unimportant subjects.  If a boy has a natural talent for it, the teacher will try, if he can, to make arrangements in the school hours to let him have half an hour twice weekly, instead of the thing being made part of the discipline of the whole school, just as it is said, in respect of singing, that everyone has a voice of some sort, and that a good voice producer could make something of it.</P>
    <P>Everyone has the capacity to draw and when it comes to explaining one's requirements, the capacity to draw is a tremendous economy of time and words.  If we could only draw our views here, the ten minutes' rule could be abolished, and the Chairman's difficulties reduced considerably.  That is why I would urge upon the Minister that it seems insufficient to have one single organiser of drawing.  Anyone who has seen the work done in the training colleges by the teachers of drawing will simply be amazed. Teachers who will not impress one profoundly with regard to other subjects will surprise you by the facility they have in adapting, say, the leaves of a plant, and illustrating their lessons on a blackboard, with really vivid little pictures.  The capacity of the ordinary boy or girl attending an ordinary National school is beyond belief until those who have seen what can be done, and done in a limited time, are able to appreciate it.  I am sure the Minister and those associated with <Col N="635" /> him in the Ministry are as well aware of that as I am, and I am confident that in the provision for future years, more allowance will be made for a subject that is really so important educationally, as well as in other respects of utilitarian consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words in connection with the teaching of cookery, to which Deputy Magennis has referred.  This is a matter upon which there is discussion as to the advisability of introducing it into National Schools at an early age, and whether it is not more important for technical schools.  That is a point I do not wish to discuss at the moment. I do say, wherever it is taught it is essential that proper facilities should be provided.  An attempt was made some years ago to have cookery taught in the day schools of the country.  We had the example in one room schools, as they are in the rural districts, of the teacher attempting to teach cookery at the fire with a class sitting around, the other children being also there.  The cookery, to make things worse, was the last lesson of the evening.  I think Deputies can fancy the feelings of the children down at the end of the school while the cookery was going on at the upper end of the school.</P>

      <P>Sometimes they did not wait until the cookery was finished.  I think that is not a proper condition of things.  I think if cookery is taught that it should be confined to those places where there is adequate accommodation for teaching it in a separate room.  I should like to see the cookery class conducted in a neighbouring cottage on the actual conditions under which the cookery has to be done in the homes of the children. There is little use bringing children from the ordinary home in the rural district and putting them through cookery lessons in a modern equipped room, because these conditions will not be the conditions under which they will be asked to do the cooking at home.  I think it might be a good thing in this connection if there were attached to the school a model cottage, in which <Col N="636" /> not alone the cooking should be done, but which should be used as a model in the matter of cleanliness and tidiness in the way a cottage ought to be kept. This, too, could be kept in connection with the school plot, and the whole thing could be worked into a very nice educational scheme.</P>

      <P>I do assure Deputies that as far as I was guilty of that exhibition of cookery which was described by Deputy O'Connell, I am sincerely penitent.  It is a difficulty, certainly, how far such a subject as cookery can be effectively taught as part of the ordinary school programme. Such suggestions as Deputy O'Connell made in regard to the utilising, say, of neighbouring houses and so on may possibly be achieved in particular instances, and, if they are, it is so much to the good.  It is not possible to make arrangements like that in the case of all schools, or even a large number of schools.  Still, if managers, teachers, and the parents of children would interest themselves in a development of that kind, even in a few localities, the effects spread around generally.  It would be wrong to suggest that there has been a reduction&mdash;I do not know whether that was the suggestion&mdash;in the salaries of organisers and sub-organisers. There has been no reduction.

We do propose to provide an organiser for rural science, and I think it would have been done earlier if the combination of the educational side of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction with the other branches of the Ministry of Education had been made earlier. We hope to be able to make use of that combination in the future for this <Col N="637" /> particular development.  I do not think there is any other point.  There were some illuminating things said in the course of the discussion, but I think I have dealt with the main points of criticism.</P>

      <P>I think the explanatory note with reference to sub-head G. appears on page 176.  It appears to me to be misplaced, but it does show that there are, as far as I can read the note, something like 1,600 residences built in connection with schools.  We have 5,700 schools.  I should say there is no good reason why there should not be attached to every school a suitable residence for the teaching staff.  It is essential that the teachers should be properly housed, but we know that in some of the rural districts especially, teachers have to go very long distances every morning to school.  This is not good for the teacher himself, and it does not add to the effectiveness of his teaching if he comes into school tired and, very often, wet. I do not wish to dwell on the point now except to call the attention of the Minister to the fact that a few days ago, when we were discussing the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, when this matter was raised the Minister for Finance said that they had set aside in the Estimates this year a Vote for local loans and at the moment they were considering the matters to which these loans could be applied.  I want to impress on the Minister the advisability of approaching the Minister for Finance at the earliest possible opportunity and impressing on him that the provision of loans for teachers' residences is very urgent and is one of the matters to which these loans could be usefully devoted.  On this matter, too, of teachers' residences, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to a point I made a few days ago when the same matter was before us, that is, that he should take steps to see that when a residence is built by a public loan supplied by the State Funds that it should continue to be used for the purpose which was originally intended, namely, that of a residence for a teacher.  There have been instances where such houses have been devoted to other purposes and one or two cases, in which the residence has been actually <Col N="638" /> sold by a person who had no moral right to do so in any case, inasmuch as it was his property only by accident. The loan was provided by the State.  It was paid off by the rent paid by the teacher and partly by the contribution made by this Department, but because the school manager happened to be the legal owner of the site on which the house stood he claimed the legal right to sell the house, and did so.  There have been one or two cases of that.  There have also been one or two cases where the house has been given to, say, a local curate or somebody else besides the teacher.  I think it should be the duty of the Minister to see that in such cases where such a house is provided for the teacher it should be devoted to that purpose and to no other.</P>

      <P>I will bear in mind the point that Deputy O'Connell has raised in regard to the provision of loans for residences.  No instance has come to my own knowledge, but it would certainly be a very great abuse if residences provided for teachers, really as part of the school provision for a district, and provided at the public expense, should be converted to any private purpose by sale, occupation or otherwise.  I do not know whether I mentioned that the case is analogous to what was in my mind, at all events, when I was speaking about the horticultural plots, or agricultural plots as I think they might be better called.  While it is possible, where the Land Act is operating in a district, to have such plots set aside for schools, the greatest care would have to be taken against allowing public plots of that kind, just the same as schools, being converted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just showing, with the amount of intelligence that is at my disposal, the complete analogy between the two things; that whether in the case of residences or in the case of plots, it would be a gross abuse to allow such a provision to be converted into private property or to be turned to a private purpose. <Col N="639" /> I do not know of any such case, but I am taking the opportunity of reinforcing what Deputy O'Connell has said, that so far as this Ministry can exercise legal powers to prevent any abuse of that kind taking place, I hope it will exercise it.</P>

      <P>I wish to explain.  I did not claim any such right whatever for the teacher.  I claimed only the right of occupation where he is the teacher of a school.  When he ceases to be the teacher he ceases to be the tenant of the residence.</P>

      <P>That is assuming that the teacher has not repaid the loan.  If the loan is made to the teacher for the purpose of providing his house, surely when he finishes his part of the contract the house becomes his.  If that is not so, of course it is all right, but if that is so, and if the teacher in course of time pays off the loan which is advanced by the State, I do not see how Deputy O'Connell, or anybody else, can say that that house ceases to be the property of the teacher, whether he remains a teacher or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain? The loan is not made to the teacher in the first place.  The loan is made to the manager of the school as the representative of the locality.  The loan is really made to the locality and not to the teacher.  The intention of the Act of 1875 was that the residence should be a free residence, and, in some cases, it is a free residence.  The locality, through the manager, pays the local moiety of the loan, but, in the vast majority of cases, the teacher pays the local portion of the loan.  He is the locality for the purpose of paying the portion of the loan.  But that does not <Col N="640" /> give him any right to it, and his agreement is that he occupies the residence while he is the teacher of that particular school.  What I claim is that even when the loan is paid off, the residence should be used as accommodation for the teacher, whoever the teacher may be who is teaching in that particular school.  I should explain, too, that it was not the teacher who sold the residence I referred to.  He had not the right to sell it.  It was not the teacher I was complaining of, but rather the manager, or somebody who purported to represent the locality, and who insisted on his legal right to sell.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell has now cleared up what seemed to be very involved before, because as I understood it, the argument was based on the teacher having paid back the loan. I understood the teacher had sold the house in the instance given.  Apparently, the loan is given to the locality and the teacher merely gets the use of the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As to sub-head H, &ldquo;Superannuation of Teachers,&rdquo; I suppose it is only proper that at the end of the day we should now come to superannuation and pensions.  I do not intend to deal with that matter as fully as I would like to do.  It is a very important matter.  There are, however, one or two things I should like to point out for the benefit of such Deputies as Deputy Hewat and those who are hearing these things for the first time now.  In the first place.  I would like to say that teachers, although they are public servants, and almost in the same position as civil servants so far as their relation to the State is concerned, have not the same conditions in the matter of pensions as civil servants have.  They do get, after forty years' service, a pension equal to one-half of their average annual income, but they do not get what civil servants get, a lump sum equivalent to one and a half-year's salary.  That is a very important difference.  There is also another difference.  Teachers contribute four per cent. of their salaries to a special pension fund; civil servants have a non-contributory fund.  That, too, is an important difference.  The <Col N="641" /> amount contributed in this way by teachers in the Saorstát to the pension fund for the last year for which we have statistics was, approximately, £116,000.  This year, I think, it would be about £135,000.  That should be remembered when we are speaking of the salaries of teachers&mdash;that a deduction is made from their income each year.</P>
      <P>There are some other advantages that civil servants have in the matter of pensions and which teachers have not.  I do not, at the moment, press for the reforms which were almost about to be made at the time when the slump came in 1921, when the Geddes axe came down in Britain and prevented the British Treasury from making the reforms which they had practically promised to make in the pensions of Irish teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several conferences were held at that time between the educational authorities and the teachers' organisation, and to us it seemed only a matter of a short time until those concessions would be granted.  I do not at the moment press for these concessions, because I know the position.  I quite realise it.  But there are one or two things that are urgent and that I think ought to be dealt with.  The first of these is that we have practically 2,500 whole-time teachers, who have no pension scheme whatsoever.  They are paid directly by the State under exactly the same conditions&mdash;I do not mean the same conditions so far as qualifications are concerned, but so far as the employment is concerned&mdash;as the ordinary teachers who are pensionable. I think Deputy Magennis, speaking earlier in the day, gave us an explanation of why training college professors were not pensioned.  He said the only explanation was that they were employed under private management. That explanation does not hold good here.  These teachers are what are euphoniously called junior assistant mistresses.  The term &ldquo;junior&rdquo; was used to cover the fact that they were employed at £24 a year.  But, in fact, they were adult persons, some thirty and forty years of age, and some of them are now reaching the age of sixty, and no provision whatsoever is made <Col N="642" /> by way of retiring gratuity or pension for these people.  That is a matter that, I hold, is extremely urgent, and I think it is one phase of the pension question that ought to be dealt with immediately.  I do urge strongly on the Minister the necessity of taking up and dealing with that particular matter, that is, the placing of these 2,000 or 2,500 junior assistant mistresses and the lay teachers engaged in convent schools on the pension list.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter, and that is the question of the old pensioners. An Act was passed last July which to some extent gave relief to them.  It was not much relief, and I dare say that it did not raise the average pension of these old teachers who retired before the new salaries came into operation to more than £52.  I doubt, indeed, if the average pension of those pensioners who retired before 1920 is £50 a year, and I think anyone who knows the work which those old teachers did must admit that that is a very poor reward indeed to offer the men and women who gave their best years to the work of the nation.  Many of them served for 40 and 45 years and they, too, contributed to the Pension Fund.  It is sad to think that in their declining years they are faced with the task of keeping body and soul together, as many of them are. The Act which was passed in 1920 to cover the case of these pensioners made provision on a percentage basis.  As I pointed out on several occasions here, the percentage basis does not meet the position.  Some of these are getting the old age pension.  They have now suffered a cut so far as that is concerned, and the hardship is increased. I believe that the Teachers' Pension Fund would be able to bear the additional claims on it, without even adding to this Vote, which would be necessary to give a substantial increase to those old pensioners.  Their number is small, comparatively speaking.  It would grow gradually less, and the teachers in the service now would certainly not object if the fund were drawn upon to an extent that would be necessary to give substantial relief to these old men and women in their declining years.</P>

      <P>I have only a <Col N="643" /> few words to add to what Deputy O'Connell has said with regard to these old pensioners.  I understand that this relief to them was given in 1920.  I have had some correspondence in connection with this from teachers of this class who are now living in the Six Counties and who taught in Southern Ireland.  After they got their pensions they went to live in the Six Counties, and now it seems that they have not been granted the relief that has been given to the old pensioners in the Free State.  I brought the correspondence under the notice of the Minister for Finance, and he promised on two occasions to have the matter looked into. He thought it was a matter that ought to be dealt with justly and fairly, and I gathered from him, at all events, that he thought that these old teachers in the Six Counties were entitled to relief. I wish to call the attention of the Minister to this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular point in this connection to which I wish to draw attention refers to a certain number of teachers who, under the terms of the 1923 Act, were not entitled to an increase of their pensions. I agree with Deputy O'Connell completely in his reference to the inadequacy of the total pension, but in certain cases that is working out even more harshly than it is in the general case.  I think it was due to a technicality in the Act, which, I understand, also occurs in a similar Act that was passed in the Six Counties but has there been rectified by subsequent legislation, and I think it is due to that kind of technicality that there are a certain number of these old teachers who only got the benefit of one increase in their pension, whereas there are others who got the benefit of three separate and distinct increases, culminating in the 1923 increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is a very complicated and involved one and I do not think there would be anything served by going into it to-night, more particularly perhaps because I am not sure that I understand all the points that are involved in it.  I do not think I have met anybody who does, but I want to <Col N="644" /> make out a case that this matter really requires investigation.  I am particularly sorry that the Minister for Finance is not with us, because more strictly this comes under his sphere of operation than it does under that of the Minister for Education.  It is under this Vote, and therefore, I take advantage of the occasion for raising it. I have brought it already under the notice of the Minister for Finance, and I brought it in this way, that I took two particular instances of nearly the same service, not quite, and merely equal qualification, not quite.  But the case with the longer service and the better qualifications turned out to be the case that has now very appreciably lower pension than the other.  It arose from the way in which the pension was originally claimed.  Under one of two possible alternatives naturally a person chooses the one which would give him the maximum pension at the time, but under the way in which later legislation was framed that, in many cases, turned out to be a pension which was least satisfactory to him in the end, and I do not think that that sort of thing was intended by the legislature. In the two particular cases that I gave the person with the better kind of service, the longer service, has now an appreciably lower pension than this other teacher who was pensioned at about the same time with a somewhat worse record and a shorter period of service. I have not these cases with me, because I supplied them to the Minister for Finance, and he promised to look into them, but I have two other cases.</P>
    <P>There is one case of a pensioner of 77 years of age who actually paid over £9 a year premium towards pension and retired on a pension of £55 a year.  She retired as a &ldquo;first of first&rdquo; teacher, and since then only got one increase, which brought her pension up to £82 10s.  There is another case of a teacher who was qualified as &ldquo;first of first,&rdquo; but who was only recognised as second of the first class&mdash;a technical description&mdash;but she retired on a pension of £60 a year.  She obtained in 1915 an increase which brought it up to £73, and in 1920 another increase which brought it up to £84, and a further increase in 1923 which brought it up to £103; whereas I am informed <Col N="645" /> that if the claim to be recognised as &ldquo;first of first&rdquo; class had been admitted by the authorities at the time that teacher would not be entitled to a third increase and her pension would be £20 less than at present.  Cases of that kind are sufficient to show that the matter requires investigation.  I believe it does, and I think there is real hardship in the case of a considerable number of these teachers, and I want the Minister to say that he will have the matter inquired into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely to support the statement made by Deputy O'Connell in regard to the old teachers. I feel Deputy O'Connell has put the case very fairly, but he fell into one error, which I shall point out to the House.  Deputy O'Connell said that teachers make contribution towards a pension fund.  I think he mentioned that this year they made a contribution of something like £116,000, and that civil servants, with whom he compared them, made no contribution.  He is not quite right in that.  The salaries of civil servants are calculated on the basis of a contribution for pension, and there is a deduction from the salaries from the very start.  That is well known.  It is mentioned in Blue Books, before Royal Commission, in the British Parliament's time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the plea that Deputy O'Connell has made in regard to the pensioned teacher, and I am thinking more particularly of the old pensioned teacher.  Unfortunately, like some other old people, they still live&mdash;unfortunately for them &mdash;and, more unfortunately, they taught at a time when wage scales were low, but they have lived through to a time when costs are high, and they have to suffer because of both misfortunes.  I feel particularly bound to put in my plea on behalf of these pensioners, first, because the claim is upon a fund which was established for the purpose, and, as Deputy O'Connell says, the existing teachers and contributors to that fund are friendly to the claim that the older pensioned teachers are making in this matter.  But more particularly <Col N="646" /> because to-morrow we shall be dealing with another Bill which is going to provide pensions for another set of State servants.  Now, the man that served 40 years teaching the youth of the country did at least as good service, notwithstanding the immediate results to the State, as those who served for four or five, or seven or ten years in military operations, and I do not feel that I would be justified in supporting that Bill, which I have done and will do, unless I also support this claim of the pensioned teachers. I feel that there is an injustice done and that we are favouring the youth as against the aged.  We are favouring war against peace.</P>
      <P>I feel that we are in duty bound, having accepted the principle that pensions should be provided for old State servants, to see that these pensions are sufficient to keep the men and women in something like decency in view of the new conditions under which they are living.  Everybody, I think, has spoken favourably towards the claim, and nobody dismisses it as being unjust or unfair.  The question seems not to have been dealt with partly because it raises technical difficulties and partly, I am afraid, because it will solve itself in time.  That is not the way this should appeal to us, and we should not allow ourselves to be persuaded that if we can keep putting it off long enough all the pensioners will be dead and they will not be able to upbraid us.  I hope that we should be able to do better for them than that, and that when we are going to vote for the pensioning of young men who have done military service we can do so with better grace if we have determined that the old school teachers shall be reasonably provided for in their old age.</P>

      <P>I would like to join my colleagues on impressing on the Minister to consider the claims for these pensioners who certainly have a grievance, though, like my colleague, Deputy Thrift, I cannot say exactly what the grievance is.  I have tried to understand the technicality of the rules by which they have been excluded from the benefits of the 1920 Act.  I seemed to understand some of <Col N="647" /> it, but still it remained a surprise, and it must be a surprise, a very unpleasant surprise, to the teachers who are in the position of those that Deputy Thrift mentioned.  I have only one thing to add that has been omitted, and that is that the fund can stand it.  If I am rightly informed, the Pension Fund at the present moment is about £3,000,000, and in 1922, £170,000 was added as an excess of income over expenditure. I think under these circumstances that the Minister should make it his business to thrust aside these technicalities, this red tape, that has created a sense of grievance, of heart-burning in the breasts of fellow-citizens who have deserved well of the State. An act of this sort will be wronging nobody.  It will not mean a penny increase in the Vote; it will only mean an equitable distribution of pension to people who deserve it.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to add a further discordant note to what seems to be the general impression that there was some injustice done to these old teachers, that they did not get the benefit of the rise in the pensions.  On this subject of pensions, I would like to say that as far as Deputy O'Connell makes out a case for the pensions to be contributory, or so far as the statement that the Civil Service Pension Scheme is contributory, I am satisfied; but I think Deputy O'Connell's case was that it should not be contributory at all.  I think that was the basis of his argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear a great deal of importance attached to this question of pensions amongst the civil servants. It is no doubt very right and proper that they should have pensions, but may I point out that amongst the army of industrialists there is no pension scheme provided.  It is the big army of industrialists that is paying for these pensions, and make no mistake about that.  The big bulk of the pensions, notwithstanding the fact that we hear seventy-five per cent. of the wealth of the country is produced by the farmers, is paid out of industry.  The people in <Col N="648" /> industry have to contribute to pensions for other people, whereas they themselves are expected to make provision for their old age during their own lifetime. I do not wish to take away from the merit of the men who have been in the public service and who have retired on pensions, but I do say that a man during forty years in the Civil Service has had as good an opportunity of providing for his old age as the mass of the people in the country, who have no pension scheme provided for them, but who have to contribute to pensions for other classes of people.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the case made for adequate pensions for the old people.  I admire the spirit in which Deputy O'Connell, on behalf of the existing teachers, said that they had no objection, if I rightly understood him, to allow these old pensioners to partake of some of the benefits of the fund provided at the present day.  That spirit is only in keeping with everything that the present-day teachers do. They are a splendid body of men, and they should be supported well.  These old age pensioners&mdash;I call them that because the phrase is so much in my head that I cannot get away from it&mdash; had the misfortune to go out in the wrong time, and if you call it a misfortune, they lived too long.  They are living now, and the pensions they get are not able to support them.  I was amazed when I heard Deputy Hewat say a moment ago that they had a right to put something aside during their lifetime, and not be depending on a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Hewat did not know the old school teachers.  He has no idea of what they were paid.  On the sums they received they were <Col N="649" /> hardly able to rear their families, but they were expected to do so respectably, and be it said to their credit, they did so.  The young teachers, most of them the sons of the old teachers and of respectable men, are living in better times.  They are charged with the performance of an onerous duty in the country, and if we want good value we will have to pay for it.  If we want good teachers we will have to give them a good salary.  As I am on my feet, there is another point on which I would like to remind the Minister, if he has not been reminded of it already. Perhaps, it may be no harm to give the Minister a second touch.  The point I want to make is, that there are some old schools and they are a disgrace.</P>
