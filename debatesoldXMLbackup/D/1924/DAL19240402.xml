      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state (a) the estimated amount of the Saorstát liability for pre-Truce claims for damage to property, (b) the amount of post-Truce reported cases still unpaid, (c) the amount of post-Truce decrees still unpaid, (d) the total amount of post-Truce claims lodged but as yet unheard.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information at present at my disposal, the liability of the Saorstát in respect of pre-Truce damage to property may be estimated at about £3,500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount recommended by judges in reports received in the Ministry of Finance under Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, and still unpaid, is approximately £221,600.  Many of these reports are subject to a reinstatement condition, and can be paid out only as the work of reconstruction proceeds. The amount of post-Truce decrees <Col N="2728" /> received in the Ministry and still unpaid is approximately £10,500.  In a number of cases which have been adjudicated on the judge's decrees or reports have not yet been received in my Department.</P>
    <P>I regret that it would not be possible without considerable time and labour to give the amount of post-Truce claims lodged but as yet unheard.  A very rough estimate would be about £12,000,000.</P>

Cavan, for compensation for destruction of house and property caused by the Irregulars during the raid on that town; if he is aware that the claim, the amount of which being £552 1s., was made by Mrs. Dolphin fourteen months ago, that the delay in making payment is causing great hardship, Mrs. Dolphin having to pay heavy interest on money which it was necessary to borrow to pay for goods destroyed and repair of house, and if he will see that immediate steps are taken to expedite settlement of claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state by what authority or under what powers arrangements were entered into to pay Messrs. Siemens Schuckertwerke the sum of £5,000 for the preparation of the scheme for the development of the River Shannon, as set out in the White Paper; what expenditure on the part of the Government, in addition to the £5,000, will be necessary in connection with the investigation work; under what Estimate the money necessary for the Shannon Investigation has been provided; further, whether the Ministry of Industry and Commerce were advised by any power supply engineer in the matter of the Siemens Schuckertwerke arrangement; whether any opportunity was given to any firm other than Messrs. Siemens to put forward proposals for the Shannon power investigation and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT, replying</NameTxt>
      <P>No liability for the payment of £5,000 to Messrs. Siemens can arise until firstly, their scheme has been approved by experts; secondly, the Government has decided not to promote that scheme; and thirdly, Messrs. Siemens have had a period of 12 months to promote the scheme themselves.  The liability may therefore never arise, and in any event cannot arise for a considerable time. If it does arise, provision will be made in the appropriate Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only expenditure on the part of the Government in connection with the investigation work will be the cost of employing experts.  This, should it fall due in this financial year, will be provided <Col N="2730" /> for in a Supplementary Estimate for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, if not met out of savings on other items in the Ministry's Vote.</P>
    <P>The Ministry was not advised in the matter by any power supply engineer; the stage for such advice will arrive when Messrs. Siemens detailed proposals are available.  No firm other than Messrs. Siemens has sought an opportunity to put forward proposals relating to the Shannon, and consequently no other firm has been given that opportunity.  If Messrs. Siemens can satisfy experts of their ability to distribute from the Shannon power in sufficient quantity at an economic price and a minimum capital cost for the whole Free State, there is no need to invite other firms to put forward a similar scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that answer, will the Minister state whether it is contemplated that the production of power from the Shannon, which he said in his reply to the first question could be distributed to supply the whole Free State, should be to the exclusion of power schemes generated from other power-producing rivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily. If it be sufficient to supply the whole Free State there would be no necessity to generate other power.  In other words, it would be extra expense, and the cost of production would naturally be increased if the Shannon scheme can supply a sufficiency of current for the whole Free State.</P>

Siemens Schuckertwerke, and, if so, what is the purport of the representations; further, whether it is proposed to instruct the Siemens Schuckertwerke to proceed with the Shannon power arrangement, as set out in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT, replying</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations on this matter have been received from the Institute of Civil Engineers and the Electricity Supply Association of Ireland.  The purport of these representations is that the proper procedure would have been to employ Consulting Engineers to report on the possibilities of the Shannon, and to put up any scheme they recommended to general tender.</P>
      <P>Rigid adherence to such a procedure would rule out of consideration any such offer as that made by Messrs. Siemens to satisfy experts that a national scheme, based on the Shannon, is practicable, and would consequently restrict unduly the possibilities of electrical development.</P>
      <P>Messrs. Siemens are being instructed to proceed on the basis set out in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Daniel O'Shaughnessy, of Grange, Co. Limerick, who applied for unemployment benefit on 20th September, 1923, and received the sum of £2 12s. on December 24th, 1923, has from that date received nothing further; whether this case will be reconsidered, and if he will say why benefit was discontinued in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT, replying</NameTxt>
      <P>Daniel O'Shaughnessy made a claim to unemployment benefit on the 20th September, 1923, and gave proof of unemployment for 18 days in respect of this period of unemployment.  He was paid the maximum amount of benefit that could be paid.  He made no further claim to benefit nor otherwise gave any indication that he was unemployed <Col N="2732" /> until the 3rd March last, when he lodged a further claim.  Payment of benefit for 50 days has been authorised on this claim, subject to proof of unemployment, but no payment has yet been made because the applicant has not given evidence of unemployment in accordance with the requirements of Regulations on the subject.  Payment will be made as soon as the applicant furnishes the Local Officer with the required certificates of unemployment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he will give the names and addresses (with particulars of the class of goods supplied) of contractors to the Curragh Command; further, what proportion of contracts, if any, are given to contractors in the Curragh area; further, if he is aware that in February, 1922, General Collins, on behalf of the Provisional Government, recognising that the change in Government would mean considerable loss to the Curragh district, promised a deputation representing all classes, that the interests of local workers, farmers, market gardeners, dairymen, and traders of all sorts, would be safeguarded, and whether the Minister will now, in view of the great loss in trade and consequent unemployment and starvation, see that the undertaking is now carried out.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind contracts for the supply of foodstuffs to the Curragh Command.  With his permission, I will circulate the particulars he asks for in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the late General Collins received a deputation representing local interests in the matter, but I am not aware that a definite promise of the kind mentioned was made by him.  I understand that the main proposal of the deputation was that such Forces as the Provisional Government might decide to raise should be stationed as far as possible at the Curragh, and that thereby the loss of trade resulting from the departure of the British Army should be reduced to a minimum.  As is known, a considerable number of our troops have been, and still are, stationed at the Curragh.  Nevertheless, only two local contractors tendered for supplies of foodstuffs, other than milk, for the period since 1st January last.  One contractor tendered for milk and turnips, and the other for milk, bacon and potatoes. Their tenders, except that of one for milk, were accepted.  I may say that all the milk required was purchased from seventeen local contractors. In all the circumstances, I do not see what steps I can take in the direction desired by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if it is the definite policy of the Government to give contracts for the supplies of foodstuffs, etc., for troops in the various Army Commands in the Saorstát to groups of contractors operating from Dublin, and whether he will consider the advisability of placing those contracts with local traders, and thereby help to relieve local unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy to place contracts for foodstuffs locally, other conditions, for example, price, quality of goods offered, and certainty of delivery, being equal.  The Deputy no doubt, is aware that the tendering is competitive.  It happens that in some cases that Dublin firms are able to quote lower prices than local traders. The Deputy will understand that it would not be in the public interest to extend a preference to local traders in such circumstances.  They, however, manage to secure the bulk of the contracts for supplies on the merits of their tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very willing to give any notice reasonably required.  I put it to the Dáil that in this case I was asked last week to know when I could make up my mind on this subject, and when I hoped to have an opportunity of consulting the Executive Council.  Deputies will quite understand, in view of the fact that two Ministers had left the Executive Council, that a considerable amount of heavy work has fallen upon those who remained. In that connection, I may say that a good deal of time has been absorbed in the last few days on one matter affecting the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. While I admit that the Dáil has a perfect right to time or fair notice for considering a matter of this sort, I do urge in the circumstances that some latitude should be extended in view of the pressing matters of public importance involved in this particular Ministry. I say that I was pressed last week for an early intimation of a nomination to this office, and I thought that in the circumstances there would be no application for time to consider the nomination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a question of 24 hours.  Would 24 hours' notice make much of a difference?  I cannot help feeling that the nomination of a Minister ought to be on the Order Paper for the day, so that Deputies would know that such a nomination was coming on, and could be in their <Col N="2749" /> places either to oppose or to support it. As Deputy Johnson says, this is a case of establishing a precedent.  The announcement of the name is absolutely right, but to ask the Dáil to approve of the nomination now without any previous notice having been given to absent Deputies is, I suggest, pushing the matter too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we have the right to assume that there was a certain definite purpose in the minds of the Provisional Parliament which framed the Constitution and which says that Executive Ministers shall be nominated by the President and approved of by the Dáil.  Presumably approval necessitates some consideration, and that consideration cannot be given at a moment's notice.  I press for at least some consideration, even if it is only for one day.  I would be quite prepared to agree to that, but I think that we ought not to let it be assumed that it is a matter of course that the Dáil would assent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir. The first amendment on the Paper is purely a formal change from the figures 1923 to the figures 1924.  The second amendment is in the Definition Section, and the object of it is to enable Commissioners who might be sent out in special circumstances to try criminal matters, also if necessary, to hear special cases which, being only within the High Court jurisdiction, it might be desirable to hear locally with a local jury.  The Government agree to that amendment.  It does not imply that any such Commissioners will be sent out at any particular time or that the old system of Circuits will at any time be renewed.  I move, therefore, that the Committee agrees with amendments No. 1 and No. 2 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1.  The figures &ldquo;1923,&rdquo; line 19, deleted and the figures &ldquo;1924&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>Section 3.  Line 35.  The words &ldquo;civil or&rdquo; inserted after the words &ldquo;of any.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In connection with these two amendments I might mention relative amendments in other parts of the Bill.  The first deals with the age of retirement. When the Bill went up to the Seanad certain retiring ages were fixed with <Col N="2753" /> the power to the Executive Council on certain advice to extend those retiring ages.  That provision was one which the Government had agreed to rather as a concession, lest hardship might fall upon particular individuals, for it is said that hard cases make bad laws, and some evils of this particular arrangement were stressed.  It was decided to accept the Seanad amendment, that no such powers of extension should be given to the Executive Council, and in lieu thereof there is now fixed a retiring age which varies to some extent from the retiring ages that were in the Bill when it went up to the Seanad. Originally the retiring age in this section for Supreme Court Judges was 70, with power to extend the age to 75. Now, there has been substituted a compromise retiring age of 72, with no power of extension, and similar provisions have been made with reference to Circuit and District Court Judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that originally the optional increase in age was inserted on my amendment, or rather the Attorney-General adopted my amendment.  Since then, I have seen there is objection in principle to leaving a judge dependent upon the Executive Council as to whether he will get this extension or not.  Personally, I think I should have preferred to have 75 kept as the age throughout and not have it reduced to 72, but if this is a compromise which the Seanad has approved of, I am not going to oppose it now.  I think it is better that the judge should be free from any dependence on the Executive, and the extension of the age to 72 will prevent too heavy a burden being placed on the Pensions Fund, which was my object to avoid.</P>

      <P>I beg to move agreement with Amendment 5 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The following words added at the end of the sub-section (1):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from the exercise by the Chief Justice of the jurisdiction transferred by this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary by reason of the transfer to the Chief Justice of jurisdiction in lunacy which hitherto has been exercised in a particular way under the Royal Sign Manual.  In future this will be exercised as a Statutory Jurisdiction under this Act, and it is necessary for the purpose of providing the method of appeal.  This amendment provides that there shall be an appeal to the Supreme Courts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately before Section 23 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judges to be placed on the rota for the trial of election petitions in Saorstát Eireann in each year under the provisions of the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868, shall be selected out of the judges of the High Court in such manner as may be provided by any rules of court to be made for that purpose, and in the meantime and subject thereto shall be selected out of <Col N="2755" /> the judges of the High Court in like manner as they have heretofore been selected out of the judges of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the subject of election petitions.  When the Bill was originally drafted, the matter was not dealt with deliberately, for the reason that the procedure under the old Election Petition Act is of a most complicated nature, and it was then anticipated that it would be possible to pass the Act completing the whole electoral code enacted by the Oireachtas.  This subject of election petitions may be dealt with in a separate Bill.  It will be necessary, until such Bill is passed, that jurisdiction under the Act of 1868 should be provided for.  It is provided that there shall be a rota of judges under the High Court as in that Act.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.  New section ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All after the words &ldquo;Provided always&rdquo; in line 9 deleted and the following words substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That no judge shall sit upon the hearing of an appeal in an action tried before him whether with or without a jury, or upon an appeal from a judgment or order made by him or to which he was a party whether concurring or dissenting.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;in which the same might have been commenced or to any court that may appear,&rdquo; lines <Col N="2756" /> 20-22, deleted and the following words substituted therefor:&mdash;&ldquo;or (where the action might have been commenced in the District Court) the District Court, to be prosecuted before the judge assigned to such circuit or (as the case may require) the justice assigned to such district, as may appear to the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is really a drafting amendment, though it does alter the section in one particular.  The section, as it stood in the Bill, would not enable the High Court to remit to a District Court.  This amendment, while improving the wording, also provides that the High Court may, in appropriate cases within the District Court jurisdiction, remit to the District Court.</P>

      <P>This is one of three similar amendments dealing with each of the three courts.  It is in substitution for Section 56 which, as it stood, was really not very happily drafted, and instead of Section 56 we are proposing to accept this amendment, having a similar amendment dealing with each of the three courts.  The object of it is to enable rules to be made for the entering-up of judgments in default of defence and for summary judgments in all courts equally.</P>

      <P>All from the words &ldquo;but the Executive&rdquo; in line 53 to the end of the section deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a corresponding amendment as regards the age of Circuit Court Judges.  It deletes the <Col N="2757" /> clause which gave the Executive Council power to extend the age, and it leaves the age-limit at seventy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have from the Attorney-General some explanation as to why the age of retirement of Circuit Court Judges should be earlier than the age of retirement of High Court Judges.  I think it was said that certain judges would be perambulating, and therefore more would be taken out of them, but I do not think that there is very much in that.  After all, they were not judges from childhood in either case, and the extra wear and tear upon a judge on circuit could not naturally be held to shorten the judge's life by three years, as compared with a High Court Judge. If this proviso is to be deleted, which I am inclined to agree with, I think it is better that the age should be fixed, but I think that the age should not be lower than the age of the High Court Judges. I would ask the Attorney-General if he would give some explanation or justification for making the alteration removing the discretion from the Executive, but leaving the maximum age for retirement of Circuit Court Judges at seventy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government do not propose to agree to alter that particular age limit nor the age limit for the perambulating District Court Judges.  There are two reasons. One is, that it is believed that men who are moving about through the country should have a somewhat earlier age limit for retirement, as they cannot continue to render efficient service beyond a certain age.  They are likely to become, perhaps, crabbed by the conditions of life in the country, and by passing from hotel to hotel, and the manner of disposing of their business would be affected by conditions of that kind.  In fixing the age limit for High Court Judges one ought to remember that they are likely to be appointed at a later age, and that the appointments in the other courts are more likely to be made at an earlier age, and the judges will consequently qualify for full pension at an earlier date.  We cannot agree to alter the age of 70 unless there is power of extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the statement of the Attorney-General. In Committee, the Attorney-General admitted that there were cases in which the Circuit Judge over 70 could render valuable service. He accepted an amendment making it possible to extend the age to 75, but now he comes and takes away what he gave in Committee.  I am going to oppose that. Let us take a case in point.  The Recorder of Dublin is in the position of a County Court Judge.  The Recorder of Dublin, as the President told us before the Christmas Recess, has been doing most valuable work, and has been a credit to the Bench.  If this Bill, however, had been law during the last year, with this amendment included in it, the Recorder would have been compulsorily retired a year ago, and it would have been impossible for him to do this valuable work.  It is impossible to lay down the age of 70 for compulsory retirement without hitting men doing valuable service, and pensioning them off while they are still in a position to do valuable work.  I prefer the original arrangement, to make it possible to extend a valuable man's tenure to 75 years of age, and so I shall oppose the adoption of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at Deputy Major Bryan Cooper's resentment at what I have said in this matter.  When the Bill was before the Dáil formerly we agreed, in consideration of the fact that there might be exceptional cases, to take power in favour of these exceptional cases, to extend their tenure, but no one ever undertook&mdash;I certainly never undertook&mdash;that there would be an extension. This is where the difficulty comes in if one speaks of particular individuals, that because there might be particular individuals, we are to inflict on the whole country a number of persons who might not be efficient, competent, or suitable to continue in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to particular individuals, I do not like to make an estimate of people's age, but it will be found that there is a new proposal dealing with the case of persons who have actually reached the retiring age named in the <Col N="2759" /> Bill, and enabling the Government to appoint such persons, and giving them an automatic extension of three years. That would meet most of the individual cases that are in the minds of Deputies. But the general principle is that some power of extension is given in some particular cases which the Seanad is unlikely to agree to, or that the age limit capable of being applied all round with advantage has to be adopted.</P>

      <P>As it reads, the age of retirement of a Circuit Judge shall be 70 years, and the Executive Council may, after consultation with the Chief Justice and Attorney-General, extend that to 75 years.  The word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo; and, therefore, there is no possibility of any undesirable people in the shape of County Court Judges, being inflicted upon the community without the consent of the Executive Council.  Hence, the opening remarks of the Attorney-General do not apply.  This section, as it stands in the Bill as it left this House, is merely an option given to the Executive Council that they may extend the age from 70 to 75 years, and in no sense is it in any way compulsory or mandatory that the age shall be 75.  I do not really see why in this matter, as in so many others, the Executive Council could not be trusted to make a wise and discreet choice in the personnel of the new judiciary that they may appoint in regard to retaining them up to the age of 75.  Therefore, I cannot see how the Attorney-General has made any further case to-day than he endeavoured to make in a previous discussion in this House as to necessarily limiting the age of retirement to 70 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <P>The Attorney-General has referred me to an amendment which, I presume, is Amendment 43.  Why should there not, in the future, be some desirable person that they may wish to extend the age of? This is really a vote of censure on the generation to which the Attorney-General <Col N="2760" /> and I belong.  It is assuming that those appointed in the past are so virile, so competent and so wise, that they are good for work three years longer than anyone who may be appointed now.  That does not meet my case in the least, and I continue my objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Major Bryan Cooper has never followed the course of a County Court Judge at Quarter Sessions.  If he had pursued a judge from town to town, he would have felt the years mounting up against himself, to say nothing of the judge, who would have a considerable lead.  Those judges will have constant travelling in the country and will have to put up with considerable inconvenience and a greater strain than men who were formerly nourished to a hearty old age by the Liffey.  Their chance of being fit for ardous work beyond the age of 70 is not considered sufficient to justify the Government in adopting a higher fixed age limit.  The Government was prepared here to accept a power enabling the Executive Council, at the time, to extend that age limit, but once that power was attacked in the manner in which it was attacked the Government would not, for a moment, stand over, or ask for it.  The position they take up now is to say that the conferring of such power of extension upon the Executive might affect the administration of justice, and, accordingly, the Executive Council does not ask the House to confer that power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I dislike the idea of any option in the matter being exercised.  Rather I am in favour of a definite line, by which the age of 70 will be the time when a man has completed his service.  Looking upon <Col N="2761" /> it from the point of view of the good of the general community, we all know of instances where men will never admit they are getting old and carry on in their offices long after their efficiency has come to an end.  Looking upon it from the broad national point of view, I do not think it is good that those offices should be occupied indefinitely to the detriment of younger men.  I think the age limit is necessary, even though the man who has been retired is in full use of his powers.  It may be so in one case; it will not be so in all cases.  In the one case where a man is in that happy position, to extend the period might be wise for him, but would be very bad as a general practice.  After all you cannot discriminate between individuals and say one man must retire at 70, inferring that his capabilities have depreciated, and that another man should continue beyond the period because he is virile.  I think it is safer to limit the age to a fair age, which is the age of 70.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The next amendment states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately before Section 43, a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>So far as may be practicable, having regard to all relevant circumstances, the Circuit Judge assigned to any Circuit which includes a district where the Irish language is in general use shall possess such a knowledge of the Irish language as would enable him to dispense with the assistance of an interpreter when evidence is given in that language.</P>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment.</P>

      <P>The following words added at the end of the section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided also that no temporary Assistant Circuit Judge appointed under this section shall continue to hold office after the expiration of three years from the commencement of this Part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>These two are parts of the same amendment. They arise on the section which enables appointments to be made of temporary Assistant Circuit Judges in case accumulation of business might require that course to be taken.  It was explained here originally that, first of all, there is business in relation to the Damage to Property Compensation Act which, for the time being, is causing a heavy pressure of business, and, second, the fact that one is not quite sure yet how far the number of judges provided for will be exactly equal to the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the amendments proposes to limit that power to a period of three years.  The first limits the power of <Col N="2765" /> appointments to three years after the commencement of that part of the Act. The second amendment provides that no such temporarily appointed assistant judge shall continue to hold office after the expiration of three years.  I move that that be agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendment to Section 46.&mdash;&ldquo;The following words added at the end of the section:&mdash;`and an appeal shall lie under Section 59 of this Act from the exercise of the discretion of the Circuit Judge in making or refusing to make such an order.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment adds a clause at the end of Section 46.  The proviso at the end of Section 46 enabled a Circuit Judge, of his own motion, to change the venue for the trial of an action, and lest that might be exercised capriciously, the judge having power to do it of his own motion, it is provided in this amendment that an appeal shall lie from the exercise of that discretion.  I propose that that be accepted.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 50.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Immediately after clause (iv) a new clause (v) inserted as follows:&mdash; `(v) If the plaintiff so elects, in any action founded on contract, whether the claim be to enforce, rescind, dissolve or annul the contract, or for damages or other relief for the breach thereof, by the judge for the time being assigned to the Circuit within which the contract was made.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The origin of this amendment is the contention that was put forward that the defendant's venue should be the venue for the trial of actions, a principle that we could not accept.  On consideration, it was seen that there had been under the existing procedure a jurisdiction given, for instance, in relation to cases as <Col N="2766" /> between the jurisdiction in Ireland and the jurisdiction in England under the former regime in matters of contract that was determined by the place where the contract was made.  It occurred to us that we might accept the proposal that the place where the contract was made was, if the plaintiff so chose, a venue which could not be objected to on any substantial grounds.  Otherwise, there is no alteration.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Attorney-General where would it be said the contract was made in the case of a traveller going from Dublin to Ballina, pressing upon a shopkeeper the desirability that he should purchase certain goods, getting orders for those goods, subject to approval, when he got back to his base, that approval being in the form of an acknowledgment or confirmation of the order.  Would it be said that the contract in such a case was made in Dublin?  I rather suggest that it would, and the result of this amendment would be that all contracts of that kind would be made in Dublin, and debtors would be obliged to come to Dublin to defend any action.  If I am wrong in my assumption, my objection to this amendment will be modified.  But as I think it is intended to give exceptional powers to wholesale houses, to protect the big man against the small man, and to impose obligations upon the small man to come to Dublin to defend actions, I will oppose the amendment and ask the Dáil to support me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the hypothetical case put by the Deputy, it is important to remember one matter in relation to this amendment.  This provision only applies to Circuit Courts.  We were urged but did not see our way to accept a similar provision for the District Courts.  Consequently, the case the Deputy has in mind of small people with small contracts and small debts, does not fall within this provision.  It deals only with the larger contracts which are within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts.  That is the first point. <Col N="2767" /> Secondly, it should be pointed out that the powers of changing the venue which existed both in the Circuit Court and the High Court remain.  There must be rules to cover these applications for change of venue, and if a case can be made the venue can be changed and the case sent to another circuit&mdash; the circuit of the defendant, for instance. I rather hesitate to interpret any particular instance because this question of where the contract is made is one of argument.  The broad principle is that it is made where it is accepted. So that if the contract is accepted in Dublin the contract will be made in Dublin.  As I say, however, this only relates to the larger cases within the Circuit Court jurisdiction and not to the small cases within the District Court jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see that if the evil is not quite as grave as I thought, nevertheless, it is there.  It simply means that within a given area smaller than the country as a whole&mdash; within the circuit&mdash;the firm which gives the credit which seeks the order and persuades the purchaser is to have the advantage.  I submit that when a person goes out to secure orders he should be obliged to take some of the risks and not to impose upon the buyer the responsibility of having to follow the seller to the court which the seller chooses.  If the seller goes to a place and persuades a man to purchase certain goods he has a right to go to that place to secure payment for those goods. Whether it is a large area or a small area I am not prepared to agree to this proposition, and I ask the Dáil to refuse to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>In the hypothetical case now put by the Deputy, that is to say, of a traveller going and offering goods to a local trader, and the trader then and there accepting the offer, of course that contract will be made locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we know how it is done.  We know that printed at the bottom of the order form are the words &ldquo;subject to confirmation by headquarters.&rdquo; That is easily done.  Headquarters <Col N="2768" /> are up to all these little tricks and will certainly protect themselves, so that in case of need they will be able to compel the defendant to go to the court chosen by the head office of the firm in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to intervene too often, but in the cases of larger dealings, I suggest that the local trader who is able to enter into these large contracts is able to stipulate to a large extent his own terms.  He may refuse to accept the condition that the contract is made in Dublin.  It is quite a common thing to have provisions in contracts determining jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, I suppose it would be the case on the other side. The seller could do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Attorney-General speaks of these traders engaging in large contracts, does he know that £26 would be considered a large contract?  In the District Court the limit of jurisdiction is £25.  A £26 case would go to the Circuit Court. You would not by any stretch of the imagination say that a trader would be in a large way who gave an order for £26.  It is only right to show that there is a case of hardship in the smaller cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson has made the point I was going to make.  So far as a trader is concerned, I admit that the little notice at the bottom of the order may technically be an acceptance on his part of another jurisdiction.  Would it not be better if it was the duty of a wholesale firm here in Dublin to state that, rather than get it in by a side wind against traders, who will not know that the little note that Deputy Johnson suggests might be put in, binds them to have the case tried in Dublin?  Imagine the hardship it would be to a large number of small traders in the country to have to come to Dublin to defend these cases, and consider the amount of work it would throw on the Dublin District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>They are Circuit Court cases from £25 to £300. There still remains the power to change the venue in any substantial case.  In a large number of these cases there is no contest.  It is entirely a matter of time.  People want time to pay, and put in a defence simply to gain time. The majority of contract cases are not fought at all.  In a comparatively small number, which are substantially contested, it will always be open to the <Col N="2770" /> party to apply to the High Court to change the venue to his venue, as being the more convenient and more suitable in the circumstances.</P>

    <P>So far as may be practicable having regard to all relevant circumstances the Justice of the District Court assigned to a District which includes an area where the Irish language is in general use shall <Col N="2774" /> possess such a knowledge of the Irish language as would enable him to dispense with the assistance of an interpreter when evidence is given in that language.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides that, so far as possible, the Justice of any District Court assigned to a district which includes an area where Irish is spoken, shall possess a knowledge of the language sufficient to enable him to dispense with an interpreter.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee agrees with the Seanad in the amendment&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Section (69) deleted and the following new section substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The age of retirement of a Justice of the District Court for the time being assigned to the Police District of Dublin Metropolis or to a district comprising or including the City of Cork shall be 70 years, and the age of retirement of every other Justice of the District Court shall be 65 years. Provided that in the case of a Justice of the District Court who shall have been a District Justice under the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, and at the date of his appointment to the last mentioned office was over 55 years of age and under 60 years of age, the Chief Justice may, if he thinks fit, extend the age of retirement of such justice to such date as will enable him to complete a period of service sufficient to qualify him for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the age of retirement of District Justices.  As the provision stood in the Bill, the age was limited to 65 in all cases, with power to the Executive Council to extend the age to 70 in special circumstances.  This amendment of the Seanad, which the Government proposes should be accepted, provides that in the case of the District Justices in Dublin City and in Cork, who will not have the amount of perambulation that the other District Justices would have, the age limit be 70, and <Col N="2775" /> the ages of retirement of every other Justice of the District Courts be fixed at the limit of 65.  In view of the same consideration that moved the Government not to agree to ask for the power of extension in these cases, they suggest that the Dáil should agree with the deletion of that power of extension. There is a proviso here dealing with certain special cases.  When the temporary District Justices were appointed there were a few of them who were of an age which would make it practically impossible for them under this provision to qualify for a pension. These men took up the position at a time of danger, and at a time when their willingness to assist certainly deserved special consideration.  The proviso in the new sub-section enables the age in their cases to be extended by the Chief Justice if he thinks fit, without the intervention of the Executive, to such an age as would qualify the District Justice to complete a period of service sufficient to qualify him for a pension.  It must be remembered in the case of District Justices that their qualifications require a shorter period of practice in their respective professions, and that they will be appointed at a considerably earlier age than the judges of the other courts. Consequently, they will normally be qualified for a full pension at a very much earlier age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer that this amendment would be amended so that the age should be normally 70, but that if necessary there should be an option to the District Justice to retire at 65 or earlier.  Again, I am not satisfied that perambulation is so wearing and tearing as the Attorney-General would suggest.  The Dáil has agreed that a little variation adds occasionally to one's years.  This is a matter of fixing the age, but leaving two or three District Justices in the Police District of the Dublin Metropolis and in the City of Cork the right of not retiring until 70, but that in all other cases 65 should be the age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I am not satisfied at all as to the reason for the discrimination.  I suppose we have not very much option. We have either to agree or disagree <Col N="2776" /> with this amendment, unless the Attorney-General is able to put forward an alternative amendment and carry it, as he can, raising the age to 70 in all cases.  I would much prefer that, in view of the proposition that the other judges shall retire at 70 in one case and 72 in the other.  I think there is a provision made that where a judge or justice is infirm and unable to carry on his work, he will be allowed to retire. We are now assuming that a man is unable to do his work at 65 years of age, but that we may in some cases allow the Chief Justice to extend that age.  As for the Attorney-General, he is not willing to say that he believes the District Justices are quite capable of carrying on this work as well as Circuit Judges, and for as long a time. I think it was argued that they may have a more wearying occupation.  But they are not quite as liable to be worn and wearied with abstruse legal problems as the higher judges.  Some people tell us that it is this wearying, mental work that brings age and decrepitude upon men.  If that be true, we should not cut down the age to 65 in the case of District Judges.</P>

      <P>It should be remembered in relation to the District Judges that their sitting in a particular place rarely lasts more than a single day.  They go to out-of-the-way places in a county; they travel a good deal by car, and there is considerable wear and tear involved in the life of a District Justice.  The Circuit Court Judge, on the other hand, will sit in the principal town.  That office will, while it involves moving about, at any rate provide a longer period of halt in that particular district.  The Circuit Judge will probably sit for a week or a fortnight in a certain place, but the District Court involves constant moving on the part of the judge.  He rarely sits continuously for two days in any particular place.  The experience, I understand, is that the age-limit of 65 is necessary and desirable in the case of persons who have to carry on their work in such circumstances.  I would not propose an amendment or alternative, <Col N="2777" /> because this new section, as it stands, is a proposal of the Government which was accepted in the Seanad, after various controversies had arisen on this matter.  The Government consequently proposes that this amendment be agreed to.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Attorney-General's personal tastes are, but I personally would find it less weary spending my time in my own house than spending a week or a fortnight in a country hotel, as the Circuit Judge will often have to do.  I cannot remember what was the retiring age of the old Resident Magistrates, but I think it was 70, and they were appointed, and worked under conditions which would produce far more wear and tear than those prevailing at present. When they were appointed, there were no motor-cars available, as there are now, and they had to travel long distances by train, and on outside cars. I well remember some of them hail and hearty at 70, and not at all anxious to retire.  The District Justice, with the allowances which he has for expenses, will be able to provide himself with a motor-car, and he will have far less wear and tear than the old Resident Magistrate.  That being so, and in view of the urgent necessity of relieving the Pension Vote, which is a non-productive Vote, and of giving the Minister for Finance the assistance he desires, I cannot understand what can be said in favour of this compulsory retirement at the age of 65 in the case of men who are healthy and capable of discharging their duties for a much longer period. It is not a case of keeping reluctant men on after the age of 65.  It is merely the case of not keeping men who feel fit and well for work and anxious to continue their work.  If it were possible to move an amendment to this amendment I certainly would do so, but I do not merely want to divide the House again.</P>

      <P>I would like to know on what information the Attorney-General is acting.  Has he himself a doctor's qualification?  We do not know.  I know his advice is altogether different from that of medical officers whose advice is to keep out in the open country.  The Attorney-General's doctrine <Col N="2778" /> is a new doctrine to me and something I never heard before.  I would like to know the Attorney-General's reason for advancing the theory he has advanced that these men cannot work in the country to an age equal to that which men can who work in the towns.  I think it is altogether in favour of the District Justice in the country that he should have the option of operating there.  If any distinction is made at all, it should be made in favour of the District Justice in the country, and I would make his years of service up to 75.  I cannot understand how the Attorney-General can explain the advice he has got on this matter or how he will explain it, and I cannot understand how any doctor in any country could give such advice.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I am expected to answer the inquiries as to all my sources of information or to state from what quarters I have had expressions of opinion.  The Government, having taken the best advice it could get, has formed the opinion that the age of 65 should be recommended as the age of retirement for District Justices.  I understand that in the course of inquiries made, for instance, amongst civil service people, having knowledge of outdoor workers and indoor workers, the opinion was strongly expressed that the age of 65 is found to be the generally necessary retiring age for civil servants who have pursued an occupation of this kind, involving considerable amount of travelling from place to place in all weathers.  I am not bound to express any expert opinion upon a matter of medical science.  What I say is that the Government, having taken the best advice it could get, recommends to the House to agree that the age of 65 is a suitable age limit for District Justices.  These matters must always be matters of opinion.  Opinion may be informed, or it may be ignorant opinion, but the Government is trying to obtain the best opinion it could, and this is the submission which it makes in the light of that opinion.</P>

      <P>I cannot see why this discrimination in ages should be <Col N="2779" /> brought into an Act of Parliament&mdash; that Supreme Court Judges should retire at 72, Circuit Court Judges at 70, and District Court Judges at 65.  To anyone who looks into the matter the retirement of such a large body of justices as will be required in the Saorstát&mdash;26 or 30&mdash;at the age of 65 is going to place an undue weight upon the finances of this country. Having regard to the fact that we should do everything to relieve taxation, I do not see that any case is made out at all that these men should retire at 65.  The Attorney-General says that the Government has got the best advice possible.  It is reasonable to expect that they have taken some advice, but whether it is the best possible advice is another thing.  The old R.M.'s were not retired at 70.  Did they show inability at 70?  Their ability was exercised in accordance with their instructions, and they carried them out to the letter.  It was not a question of want of ability or knowledge.  I think the Attorney-General ought to amend the Seanad's amendment in this case and have the figure of 70 inserted as the retiring age of those justices, whether in Dublin, Cork, or elsewhere.  To my mind, the matter is put the wrong way about.  I believe the District Justice, living in the conditions of a city like Dublin, could not be expected to live nearly as long as a Justice living in the garden of Ireland, touring the country and enjoying the fresh air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Following out my recent exposition on the question of County Court Judges, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to say that the speakers on this question have drawn attention to the difference in the ages of retirement for the judges of the different courts.  Essentially I think there is a very great difference in the occupation of the three different sets of judges.  In the first case, you have the High Court Judge, whose occupation is distinctly studious and who can carry on efficiently for a longer period than can those engaged in the more active occupation of the County Courts, the Circuit Courts and, incidentally, the District Courts.  Now, <Col N="2780" /> coming down to the District Courts of Justice, I visualise, rightly or wrongly, a state of affairs as regards those District Courts which does not apply to the High Courts or the County Courts at all.  As a matter of fact, in connection with the District Justices I would rather avoid calling them judges.  They will preside over courts which function on lines rather like those of the head of a family in correcting children and in intimate association with the life of the people of the district, acting as a kind of lawgivers, if you like, and giving fatherly advice such as Deputy Wilson will well understand.  Now in the operation of his duties, which I think will be rather strenuous, I certainly think that the individual would not be as active at the age of 70 as he ought to be.  I think it is quite right that there should be a difference of ages marked as between the different courts.  What we want in the District Courts is comparatively young, extremely active and live persons who will move about amongst the people, with intimate knowledge of the surroundings and the people themselves. I think in the discharge of such duties, when he has reached the age of 65 he might well transfer his activities to his successors to carry out the duties in connection with such courts.</P>

      <P>I do not think we ought to let the gospel that has been preached here pass without some challenge. First of all, the Attorney-General referred to the fact that the Government had taken the best advice on this matter.  I admit that it may have taken advice, but in my opinion it did not take the best advice.  This matter has been argued as if we were dealing with machines in a factory. The argument seems to be that these human machines used in the courts will get run down and will become useless in the case of the High Court Judges at 72 or the Circuit Judges at 70 and of the District Justices at 65.  That argument would be all very well if we were dealing with machines, but we are not. I heard Deputy Hewat support that contention.  I wonder what would some members of the Dáil, or some men outside who have ambitions of becoming members later on, think if they were told that at the age of 65 they <Col N="2781" /> would be worn out and would not be fit to give useful service here or anywhere else.  The arguments that have been used from the Government side on this matter have been very foolish in my opinion.  I know men myself, 65 years of age, who are as capable and as active as men a good deal younger.  A man's capability does not depend on circumstances.  It depends rather on the individual's state of health and his constitution, and I suggest you cannot make any hard and fast rule in this connection at all.  The arguments that are being put forward are simply ridiculous for the reason that at 70 years of age you may get a man who would be quite active and capable, while at 50 years you might get a man who would not be capable of much service at that age.  I think the suggestion that one man is capable at 72, another at 70 and another at 65 is too ridiculous for anything.</P>

      <P>I think a good many of the circumstances of these cases have not been referred to.  The facts are, that the High Court Judges will be in a place where lack of accommodation will not affect them.  To that extent, we think that the ordinary comforts of life contribute somewhat to longevity.  If abused, of course, I will admit that it may be in the other direction, but I hesitate to think that a Judge of the High Court would abuse these things.  Now, with regard to the District Justices, in Dublin or in Cork they are in much the same position as the High Court Judges, but in the country they will have either to motor or to drive on a car from town to town, and to spend a night, or many nights perhaps, out of their own houses.</P>

      <P>I would not say that, but I do say that we have heard of persons who, having to sleep in strange beds, cannot sleep in the late or early hours of the morning.  There is a strain on the physique there which must be admitted.  Therefore the District Justices will not have the ordinary comforts of domesticity, if I may say so, and some allowance must be made for that.  What is the position of a man <Col N="2782" /> who has to drive four or five miles, say, in a snow storm, a shower of sleet, or on a cold day such as we are having now, and of that of the man who walks, say, from Fitzwilliam Square down to the Castle and takes his seat on the Bench, where he remains at work until 4 o'clock in the evening, when he drives home in a carriage or a motor-car.  Take these two cases. Surely the circumstances are against the District Justice in such a case. One, I think, will readily admit that there are occupations which call for a big strain on the physique.  In estimating the longevity of the judges, their usefulness and capacity, we have taken into consideration that these District Justices, going about the country from town to town, having perhaps to sleep away from home two or three nights a week, there is unquestionably something asked from their physique not asked for from a High Court Judge, and to that extent there is a big justification for a difference in the age.  Now we have had experience of men living beyond 70 years of age and occupying very high places in the public confidence even though far beyond these years.  There were other cases in which men did not warrant public confidence after a certain age.  All that has to be taken into account.  What we have endeavoured to do here is to restore public confidence in the Judiciary even at a little higher cost to the State.  The amount is not much more in the long run than if we were to extend the age from 65 to 70.</P>
      <P>Take the case, let us say, of a District Justice of 70 years of age who has to travel 10 miles on a bitterly cold day. One would naturally expect that at 70 years of age a Justice would not give that consideration to a case that you could expect from a younger man, and in these circumstances we thought that, even if it were a little more costly on the State, there would be very good value got for the extra cost involved by fixing the age at 65.</P>

      <P>The President's comparison between the High Court Judge and the District Justice is extremely adroit, but if he were here earlier in the discussion he would have heard a comparison between the Circuit <Col N="2783" /> Judges and the District Justices, and would have heard that the Circuit Judges do their work under much greater discomfort than do the District Justices.  Outside, perhaps, of Tirconaill and Kerry, I do not think there is any district in Ireland where a District Justice has to sleep away from home two or three nights a week.  I have not heard of any such cases.  It is certainly not the case in Sligo.  The District Justice is allowed £300 a year travelling expenses, out of which he can provide himself with a motor-car and reside in his own home all the time. The longest journey he would have to go would be about 40 miles.  That is about the distance from Sligo to Ballina, and the Justice with a motor-car could easily do that in a day.  In the case of a Circuit Judge, his work is carried out under conditions of much greater discomfort.  He has to stay in a little country hotel, and yet he is not allowed to retire until he reaches the age of 70 whereas the retiring age for a District Justice is 65.  I cannot see any justification for that distinction. As regards the President's other point, dealing with the cold and the fatigue that the District Justice has to endure in the performance of his duties, that, I suggest, has not been found to be so in the past.  I have already referred to the old Resident Magistrates, and I will not refer to them again except to say that they did good work up to and after 70 years of age.  I know that my grandfather at the age of 72 used to go from near Sligo to Ballina by long-car and sit on the Diocesan Council&mdash;upon which I believe he did good work&mdash;and go back by long-car again at night, a distance of 40 miles each way, but it did not incapacitate him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The same idea underlay both of these amendments, and it will be remembered that in the Bill as it left the Dáil the salary of the District Justice was to be provided by annual vote, and the argument which was made here in support <Col N="2785" /> of that provision was that, certainly for a while, it would be necessary to be in a position to discuss the number of Justices until one had arrived at any rate at a settled decision as to what the number ought to be, having regard to the new jurisdictions given and the jurisdictions transferred to the District Court.  Though that case was made for the manner of providing for the salaries of the District Justices there seemed to be an idea in some quarters that there was a sinister intention behind that provision, and that that sinister intention was that the District Justice should not rank as a judge.  Now, one can say quite honestly and frankly that that is not so.  There was no such intention in the provisions in the Bill as it stood and as it was carried here.  The amendment which was proposed in the Seanad gave rise to another matter, a question as to the effect of the provision of the Constitution, which requires a message from the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council before money can be appropriated for a particular purpose.  The form of the message and the form of the resolution founded on that message were the subject of considerable discussion in the Seanad as to how far the action of the Seanad was limited by them.  The matter was referred to a special committee of the Seanad, as a result of which they came to the conclusion in the Seanad that the message and resolution as they stood exceeded the powers of the Governor-General and did not hamper the power of amendment of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I think I may say that, in so far as the form of the message is concerned, I do not think that the Government would say that it was such as could be considered the best form, and the form of this message will have to be reconsidered for the future.  As regards this particular amendment, we did not accept it in the Seanad.  We contended that there was not in the circumstances power to carry such an amendment, but it is questionable whether, having regard to the form of the particular message, it is desirable to <Col N="2786" /> pursue any constitutional controversy on this particular amendment, particularly having regard to the fact that the Government's intention was that only for a certain short period there should be freedom of discussion as to the number of Justices required to discharge the duty of that office.  The Government is prepared to consider now binding themselves, having allowed first for a short period during which the matter should be tested that, after that short period&mdash; say three years&mdash;for the future, the salaries of the District Justices shall be a charge on the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of a District Justice is recognised by the Government as that of a judge under the Constitution. There is no desire to interfere with the District Justices in the exercise of their official functions in so far as they derive protection by having their salaries a charge on the Central Fund. The Government intended that that shall be the case after a short period during which the exercise of their functions shall not be discussed.  It is intended to submit to the Dáil that this particular amendment, in the form in which it stands, should not be agreed to, but that another amendment in another form which will give effect to what I have said should be sent up to the Seanad.  That will involve another message, and it is suggested, therefore, that the consideration of this amendment should stand over until to-morrow.  The other amendment, the real object of which is undoubtedly to attain the same purpose as was attained by this amendment, would really become unnecessary once the security of the position of the independence of the District Justices is established by a charge on the Central Fund.  The Seanad amendment 22 is quite impracticable as it stands and quite incapable of being given effect to.  It would have the most extraordinary effect on the text of the Bill.  Wherever the District Justice Temporary Act, 1923, is referred to, it would change the title of that Act into District Judges Temporary Act of 1923.  Under this Bill we speak of the Justice of the District Court.  This amendment quite fails to recognise that under the Temporary <Col N="2787" /> Act we had the title of District Justice, and fails to recognise under the present Bill that these are justices of the District Court.  To carry out an amendment of this kind in the way which must have been before the mind of the mover of this amendment, it would be necessary to move upwards of twenty amendments in the text of the Bill&mdash;that is in order to avoid those particular things to which this amendment could not apply, and in order to give effect to it without upsetting the whole Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>The matter was here discussed at full length as to whether those Justices should be called District Justices or District Judges.  It was pointed out that this position had become a position of credit to those who held it, and that there was no sufficient reason for causing an upheaval there where you had swept away the old regime and set up a court which was recognised, established, and accepted with goodwill everywhere.  The Dáil approved of the retention of the title &ldquo;justice of the District Court,&rdquo; with the Irish equivalent for judge as applied to judges for all the courts.  It is now submitted that this amendment 22 should not be agreed to, and it is intended, if the Dáil will consent, to postpone number 25 until to-morrow.  It is intended to propose an alternative for submission to the Seanad, which will secure that position of judicial independence to the District Justice.</P>

It was thought as the proviso stood that its effect was narrowed by the words &ldquo;for a declaration of title or in ejectment,&rdquo; in relation to such lands, and the amendment provides that the decisions of the District Justice in matters of trespass or tort are not to operate as estoppel in any action dealing with the land.

      <P>The next is, after the word summarily, page 17, line 4, to insert the following words &ldquo;and the accused (inquiry having been made of him by the judge) does not object to being so tried.&rdquo;  This amendment arises on head (b) of Section 74, which defines the jurisdiction of the District Courts.  The matters which are collected under heading (b) would in a certain degree be capable of being considered minor offences within the terms in the Constitution, but it has been considered well to have the attention of the accused directed to those in particular so that he may be in a position when charged to object that in his case the matter is not a minor offence, and to require that he be sent on for trial by jury.  Consequently it is proposed that in cases arising under those headings two conditions precedent are requisite; first, that the justice shall be of opinion that the facts proved against the accused constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily, and secondly, the accused, inquiry having been made of him by a Justice, does not object to being so tried.  It is proposed that that amendment be agreed to, subject to the substitution of the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;judge.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="2796" /> This amendment deals with the possibility of any existing judge being appointed to office under this Act, such existing judge having exceeded the age limit imposed by the Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a little more light on this, because the way it is phrased points almost to a particular case or cases.  &ldquo;Any person who is at the passing of this Act a Judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland, a Recorder, County Court Judge, or District Justice in Saorstát Eireann, or a Divisional Justice of the Police District of Dublin Metropolis is appointed to be a judge of any court under this Act after he has attained the age of retirement.&rdquo;  It seems to say that the intention of the Ministry in regard to the ages of retirement are not to have effect in some cases.  I am at a loss to understand the attitude of the Attorney-General on this matter.  He has argued, and the President has supported him, in such a way as to persuade the Dáil that it is not desirable to have any relaxation of the age limit, and now he says that a person, provided he is already a judge in one court, may be appointed to be judge of another court, notwithstanding age limits; that is to say, the age limit may be extended by three years.  I am not able to appreciate the point, unless the Attorney-General will tell us that he has specific cases in mind, and let the Dáil judge as to those cases.  I would ask first whether this word &ldquo;is&rdquo; on line 1 should be retained?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I may assure the Deputy that the Government has no specific cases in mind. The Government field of choice in filling these positions is, I think, still unexplored, if that will allay any anxieties.  The intention of this rather was to prevent exclusion from the field of choice of persons who might be of assistance, but who had reached the <Col N="2797" /> age limit.  Whether it will ever be put in practice I cannot say.  It does not relate to any case or cases in particular. Without taking any executive power of extension, it enables a person who has reached the age limit to be appointed with a three years' fixed extension beyond that age limit.  If no provision of this kind was contained, and the other power of extension having been cut out with the consent of the Government, there may be persons who would be excluded from appointments in the first instance by reason of the age limit.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;No rules of court made under this Act shall come into operation unless and until they have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and have been approved by resolution of each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in substitution for Section 97, but the essential difference between the two is this, that under Section 97 the rules became operative and of full effect unless a motion had been made annulling them in whole or part. Objection was taken to that on the ground that the matter might be overlooked. People might not bother, and <Col N="2798" /> it is said that people do not bother, with these documents laid on the Table or read them with that detail or interest that perhaps some of them deserve. Under the new section it would be the duty of a Minister to come in and propound the rules to each of the Houses, explain them, and get a positive agreement with them.  The Government recommends that that proposal be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a great improvement on the section originally passed by the Dáil.

I think that is the effect of this new section.  It is an improvement, and meets most of the criticisms that were made against the original section.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he can state what is the reason for the delay in settling the claim of Mr. M. Fleming, of 13 Dolphin Avenue, South Circular Road, Dublin, for cycles and fittings commandeered by the Volunteers <Col N="2743" /> at Killeshandra, Co. Cavan, in May, 1920, the amount of claim being £18; if he is aware that particulars of claim have been already furnished to Portobello Barracks, and if he will undertake to have same dealt with promptly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim in question relates to a period prior to the Truce.  The position at that time was that responsibility for discharging any liabilities incurred rested on local Volunteer Authorities.  Claims of the period cannot be paid out of funds voted by the Dáil for the maintenance of the Army.  The general question as to what extent and from what funds any of those claims may be settled, has yet to get consideration.  Pending a decision, Mr. Fleming's claim cannot be given further consideration.</P>
