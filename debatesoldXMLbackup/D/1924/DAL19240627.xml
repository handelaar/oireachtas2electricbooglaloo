      <P>asked the President if he will now state whether it is the intention of the Executive Council to release all political prisoners, tried and untried, before the Dáil adjourns for the summer.</P>

      <P>asked the President if his attention has been drawn to a statement in the Press to the effect that there were many more persons interned in the Saorstát than in Northern Ireland, and whether, in view of this, he would consider the immediate release of all prisoners taken in the recent hostilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer questions Nos. 1 and 2 together. There are at present only 123 persons interned, and releases are proceeding as speedily as possible.  I can not undertake to specify a date by which all these men will be released.  One hundred and four sentenced prisoners are still in custody.  These prisoners have themselves occasioned delay by refusing to avail of the facilities afforded them to have their cases reviewed by a judicial tribunal in connection with the Indemnity Act of last year.  All the cases, however, have now been generously <Col N="2" /> considered, and His Excellency the Governor-General will be advised to remit the unexpired portion of their sentences in all cases except those guilty of ordinary crimes.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are over 250 internees detained by the Northern Government, and consequently it is obvious that the statement referred to by Deputy Hogan is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that in the reply from the Secretary of the Cabinet of Northern Ireland the implication is that their justification for holding the internees and prisoners in Northern Ireland is founded on the fact that the Saorstát is holding prisoners of proportionately equal number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that statement.  They held their prisoners, in the first place, before we did.  In the second place, I think they distinguish as between sentenced political prisoners and ordinary political prisoners. In our case the two classes were in one &mdash;that is, the internees and the prisoners sentenced.  Now, I have before me cases in which the sentences have been reviewed, and it is obvious from that review that some prisoners are not correctly described as &ldquo;political prisoners.&rdquo; In other words, they are persons against whom crimes have been proved, and no case was made here that they should be released.  One of the difficulties in the case is that while internees proper&mdash;that is, political prisoners or persons interned for political reasons&mdash;do themselves object to being mixed with persons charged with crimes, or &ldquo;criminals,&rdquo; as they call them, they give us no assistance in the <Col N="3" /> matter of identification.  It is consequently our duty to distinguish between them, to divide them and to treat them accordingly.  That is being done as rapidly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question directly.  The whole matter is under consideration, and it is being expedited as much as possible.  Of course, connected with this matter of ordinary political prisoners, there is the question of soldiers&mdash;men who joined the National Army, and who were charged in respect of offences which would be on a par with those committed by political prisoners.  I have had a review of those cases also.  I do not expect to be able to give the Dáil a satisfactory answer until somewhere about the end of next week.</P>

      <P>It appears from the official file that the claimant was then about 3½ years home from Canada, where he had lived about 20 years.  The date of his return is not mentioned, but July, 1916, is possibly correct.  The case has not since come to me on a fresh appeal upon a new claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> Mr. Devers is admittedly a citizen of An Saorstát, and fulfilled the statutory condition of nationality even in 1920 but was then debarred from a pension on the ground of residence, that is to say, that he had not resided in the United Kingdom for at least an aggregate period of not less than 12 years out of the previous 20 years. The residence qualification still holds, and is not in any way varied by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The claimant's age was not established in connection with the appeal of 1920, and I have no evidence on that point or in regard to his means.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is regretted that the claim cannot be entertained until he has fulfilled the residence qualification.</P>

The intention, as far as I know, was to finish the Dáil business&mdash;that is, the sending up of Bills to the Seanád&mdash; about the 16th July.  It was not anticipated that so much time would be taken up this week by matters which were not provided for in the Schedule, such as the motion in connection with Clause 12 of the Treaty and also the Army motion.  The latest date I find is the 16th July, but that, of course, does not provide for the return of measures from the Seanad.

    <P>(1)  An Executive Minister may refer to the committee established under this Act any claim made by a person claiming to have suffered any direct loss or damage necessarily arising from interference with his property after the 26th day of January, 1919, and before the 28th day of June, 1922, by&mdash;</P>

    <P>in the proper exercise or execution of any power, authority, or duty vested in or imposed on him by virtue of such office or employment.</P>
    <P>(2)  The said committee shall inquire into all claims referred to them pursuant to this section and shall report to the Executive Minister whether the person making the claim has suffered any such direct loss or damage as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section, and the compensation (if any) which, on the principles laid down in this section, might reasonably be paid to such person in respect of such loss or damage.</P>
    <P>(3)  In assessing the compensation pursuant to the foregoing sub-section the committee&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall not take into consideration any loss or damage&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  arising from the billeting or quartering of troops, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  arising from sums paid or subscribed, whether voluntarily or under pressure, to any national or local levy, requisition, or loan, or</P>
    <P>(iii) arising from any fines imposed <Col N="14" /> by any tribunal deriving authority either directly or indirectly from the First Dáil Eireann or the Second Dáil Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  due to or arising through the enforcement of any order or regulation of general or local application made by, or directly or indirectly under the authority of, the First Dáil Eireann or the Second Dáil Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(v)  due simply and solely to the existence of a state of war, or</P>

    <P>(c)  the committee shall only recommend the payment of compensation in cases where special or continuing hardship has resulted from the loss or damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned here, I think, on the Second Reading, that it would not facilitate public business, and it would not enable us to deal with legitimate claims if this particular amendment were passed.  I mentioned that there was one case in which we had a claim from a man for the billeting of a Volunteer at three guineas a week, and it turned out that the billeting was in respect of his own son.  A good many other extravagant and, I think, inequitable charges were made against us in that respect.  This particular committee has a certain work to do.  The measure of satisfaction with which that work will be done will be interfered with to a very large extent if this particular amendment is passed, because something like 18,000 cases of billeting and quartering of troops in respect of the National Army were before us in March, and General Mulcahy's promise as to their being disposed of was kept. They were disposed of by the 31st March, but those claims are coming in at an enormous rate still, even in respect of the National Army.  How much larger it would be in the other case can be estimated from the numbers that are coming in in respect of the National Army.  The particular orders I circulated to Deputy Johnson, I think, explain what the general circumstances were at the time, that each area was to support its own particular section of the military forces, and as far as this particular clause is concerned if the amendment were passed the committee can really do no other work.</P>

      <P>The President has not answered my question.  I wanted to find out whether it is intended <Col N="16" /> to repudiate, for instance, legitimate debts contracted by the Volunteers.  The President has not answered that point.  I am afraid he could not very well consent to that, and I will have to insist, as far as possible, on the revision of this sub-section. I appreciate, however, the difficulties of the Minister in dealing with a lot of extravagant and absurd claims, but in certain cases where people from disinterested motives gave goods to the Volunteers, put them up, and rendered other services, is it not at this time of the day perfectly right and legitimate they should receive fair compensation?

      <P>I move: &ldquo;In sub-section (3) (a) (ii.) line 55, to delete the word `whether,' and in line 56 to delete the words `or under pressure.' &rdquo; The Bill provides that no claim shall be made in respect of money contribution or loan contributed voluntarily or under pressure, and I want to remove <Col N="17" /> the words &ldquo;under pressure,&rdquo; which is legal English for at the point of the gun, because I think even a subsequent validation of that doctrine would be disastrous to the State.  I admit some justification for the insertion of these words in the Bill, for I have no doubt whatever that in the country there are mean minded men who at the time they gave money gave it with a show of the greatest patriotism, and boasted highly of their patriotism, but who would come in now and try to get it back by saying they gave it under pressure, though I admit as far as that argument is concerned that that is a matter for the Commission.  If the Commission are an efficient body they ought to be able to find out whether the money was contributed under pressure or not.  It is possible to find out something about the political opinions of an individual, or the opinions expressed by the individual, which is not always exactly the same thing, and the general circumstances under which this money was given.  I do not want to suggest for a moment that a great deal of money was levied under pressure in the country. Two gentlemen came to me and informed me they had been sent to collect for the Volunteers.  I told them at that time I did not recognise the court.  They were very polite, and I was very polite.  We talked for about half-an-hour, and parted on excellent terms.  They said they hoped I would recognise that they were doing their duty, and I said I recognised that, and that they had done it in the most courteous manner possible, and I was never the worse for my refusal to contribute. I have no doubt that that was the case in the greater part of the country, but there were parts of the country, and there were individuals who were not so scrupulous.  I think we should take into consideration the position of the man or woman living alone in an isolated district, when people come to their house at night knocking at the door demanding admission.  No doubt they ought to refuse, but it is very hard in a lonely place when you do not know what the consequences may be, to refuse. If even ten per cent. of the cases in which contributions were made were of that kind I believe it would be for <Col N="18" /> the good and credit of the State to redeem that debt, because this doctrine that in support of a case you may go down to people who are living alone, people who are not very brave, and take their money out of their pockets, is an abominable doctrine.  It is a doctrine that the Minister for Justice knows is at the root of half the trouble in the country.  I have no doubt that the men who first propounded it believed they were acting patriotically, and that they were thoroughly justified in doing so.  I do not doubt that, but the result has been that the example has spread.  There are always plenty of blackguards who will dignify with a high-sounding name the aim of filling their pockets.  We know that is going on.  I would urge on the Government to consider whether it is wise by including the words &ldquo;under pressure&rdquo; in this Bill to justify that doctrine, even retrospectively or in the smallest degree.  I hope and believe that they will perceive that if we are ever to make progress, or ever have a sense of security and stability in the country, that doctrine must be killed, and because this section even indirectly suggests that it may, under some circumstances, be a right and valid thing to collect money under pressure of the gun, I think that ought to be altered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal in Deputy Cooper's objection to having these words in the section. I think that if all the words after &ldquo;subscribed to any national or local levy&rdquo; were removed the object both of the Minister and Deputy Cooper will be attained.  The paragraph would then read &ldquo;arising from sums paid or subscribed to any national or local levy.&rdquo; The question of a voluntary gift, or a gift under pressure, would not then arise.  I think in practice, assuming that the principle of the Bill generally is accepted, claims for the return of sums of money would be very difficult to make.  I do not know whether it was general or the practice at all that receipts were given for sums subscribed in these circumstances; it was certainly not universal, and in such a case how is there going to be proof made of a claim, inasmuch as this deals with sums <Col N="19" /> of money paid or subscribed?  I suggest to the Minister he might delete the words &ldquo;whether voluntarily or under pressure,&rdquo; and by so doing he would remove these objectionable words &ldquo;or under pressure,&rdquo; which do not seem to me to give any added strength to the section, and leaves us under the imputation that we are legalising acts which might well have been highway robbery.  I submit that to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not know it was practised.  There were cases where, in different parts of the country, particularly where the struggle was most intense, where men had to be supported when the principle adopted was that men could not be supported and the struggle could not be financed from a central fund.  The call for financial assistance fell on a very small number of people in these parts of the country, and the local military authorities in the end came to the conclusion that it was not proper to be bleeding a small number of persons in order to finance their struggle, and they adopted, with the permission of headquarters, the idea of a levy.  Where, it was announced that a levy would be made in the district as a whole for the collection of funds for the support of the local volunteers, I do not know that it was ever known that the imposition of that levy was pushed to very great extremes against any persons, or that terrorism of any kind was utilised in connection with it.  What was stirred up was the pressure of public opinion&mdash; that the cost of maintaining the Volunteers <Col N="20" /> should not be borne by a small number of people and that the community at large should bear their portion.</P>

      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the word &ldquo;necessarily,&rdquo; in line 32, and to get some explanation in regard to its application. &ldquo;An Executive Minister may refer to the Committee established under this Act any claim made by persons claiming to have suffered any direct loss or damage necessarily arising from interference with his property.&rdquo; It seems to me that is going to make the claimant's task a very difficult one indeed.  He will have to prove to the Committee that under no circumstances could the loss have been avoided, that it was a loss or damage inevitably arising from interference with his property, and I think that circumscribes the claimant too much.  The case that the claimant has to make will have to be made to the satisfaction of the Committee, and to put in the word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; gives a hint of a direction to the Committee to assure itself that in no conceivable way could the claimant have prevented the loss, that it was something inevitable which could not in any circumstances be prevented. I suggest that if a loss occurred which could not have been prevented by any reasonable precaution, that would justify the claim, but to put the word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; in seems to me to remove half the value of the section as far as the claimant is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that without <Col N="21" /> that word, the door would be open very wide for claims, which certainly was not intended by this Bill.  I think it is absolutely essential that any claim made and referred to the Committee should necessarily arise from interference with property.  If the word is left out it is more than possible that consequential losses might come in and be claimed for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Say a number of persons went into a house and damaged the property, but it was not necessarily arising from interference, that is, with the occupation of the house&mdash;I think that the word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; is going to make the applicant's case a very difficult one, provided the court is going to take advantage on behalf of the Treasury of the opportunities for refusal of compensation as it stands.  I am sure there must be some other phraseology available for the draftsman which would cover what the Minister desires and which would not be quite as confined as this word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; seems to me to be.</P>

      <P>I move formally the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 10, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Oath to be administered to the jurors empanelled to try whether a prisoner is competent to plead or not shall be in the following form, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do swear by Almighty God that I will well and diligently inquire whether A.B., the prisoner at the bar, be insane or not, and a true verdict give according to the best of my understanding.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This amendment which Deputy Dolan has moved is simply a rectification of an oversight in the Bill.  There is still a third form of oath.  There is the ordinary oath taken by jurors in trying a prisoner, and there is the oath where the prisoner stands dumb, and a jury is empanelled to say whether in fact he is dumb or refraining from speech to obstruct the trial.  There is this form where a prisoner seems to be insane, and the jury has to say whether in fact he is insane or whether he is simply shamming insanity.  That oath is for use in cases of that kind.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. I think it will be generally admitted that this is a measure which we ought to have introduced much earlier.  But the great accumulation of public business and other matters we had to deal with naturally <Col N="23" /> delayed its production and introduction. It is proposed by this measure to make a certain allowance for great and unselfish services, rendered in times of difficulty and danger.  We hope that this measure will satisfy the persons whom it is proposed to compensate, that the country has not forgotten their services, and has realised that generous compensation was due to them by reason of the extraordinary interruption that was occasioned during those trying and eventful years we have passed through.  I do not think it is necessary to go into at any great length the reasons that prompted the introduction of the measure.  I think they are well within the knowledge of the Members of the Dáil.  I think that the amounts specified are calculated to bridge this chasm that there is in the lives whom we propose to compensate in the measure.  I think it will be admitted that the interruption which occurred just at the particular time it did in those men's lives was an interruption which would take a very considerable amount of compensation to provide for.  Many of them entered the service of the nation at a time when they should have been attending to their studies, or when they should have been learning business or engaging in some other sphere of activity which would enable them to take their part in the battle of life.  The interruption just at that period was a very serious interruption to them, and they would have reason to complain if, having given of their best at that particular time, when it cost them most, that consideration should not be given to claims such as they have, and which they have never made upon the nation. As I said, this measure should have been introduced long since, but we introduce it now in good faith, the Government realising its indebtedness to these gallant young men, and we introduce it in the hope that it will be accepted by them, not in a sense of discharging their obligations and being done with them, but as our appreciation of the amount that is due to them in the nature of compensation for the services they have rendered.  We hope that it will lead towards a better atmosphere, <Col N="24" /> that those men cannot now that they have rendered that service, regard the nation to which they have rendered such good service in any other but a friendly spirit, and that it will conduce towards more friendly relations between those of them who have left the Army and those who are still in it, and that it will bring home to them, too, some of the difficulties of the Government and Parliament in dealing with such cases as theirs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a very hearty and cordial welcome to this Bill, particularly as one who has come into contact with those men during the years in which they gave their services so freely.  I think that this is a right method of recognition for the service which was then given and which was given without any thought or prospect of any reward of this kind, and, therefore, a service for which a reward of this kind is all the more appropriate and fitting.  The service that was then given was a service that was given for the national cause, purely as the national cause, and there was not one of those men who undertook it but did so feeling more or less certain in his mind that, whatever might be the outcome, his own particular case would not receive any reward, and that he was incurring the possibility not only of grave risk for himself and his own life, but the blotting out of any future that he might have. I was glad that the President, in introducing this Bill, stressed that point of view, because I think it right that it should be stressed that this is not a reward given for something that was done and some services that were rendered in prospect of this reward that would forthcome, but is given for men who undertook their work, their risks and their dangers, not having any such prospect at all.  We know that at the present moment there is a large number of them who are in very grave need of assistance such as this Bill will render. The best reward, of course, would be that employment should be found for a great many of them who are not now in employment, but that is another matter; I only touch on it in passing, because I believe it is the real end to be aimed at.  There is only one matter <Col N="25" /> that I am not sure I correctly understood the President's reference to.  I understood him to mean that these services that were given by these men, whose courage brought the Free State into existence, would be recognised by this Bill, whatever their subsequent political decisions and careers might have been.  I believe that to be the intention of the Bill.  I understood from the President's introduction of it that is to be the purpose of the Government in the administration of this Bill.  If that be so, I desire to say it is a very wise and statesmanlike procedure to adopt, because even though many of these men turned against the Free State afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then I misunderstood it.  I was dealing with that portion of the Bill that referred to services rendered during Easter Week.  I think it could easily have been made to extend to those whose services applied for a period before then, and whose services helped to bring about the existence of this State.  In any case, even in that limited sense, I think the Bill is a wise and necessary one, and it is one the Dáil might unquestionably give a very cordial welcome to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the President should have introduced the Second Reading of this Bill without giving some general description of it, and an explanation of its purpose, and how it would effect its purpose.  After all, a Bill presented in this way has to be examined pretty closely to understand how it is going to be received, and what will be its effects.  I think the Second Reading is the opportunity that should be availed of by the Minister to explain in some detail the intentions of the Bill, and how it will work out in practice.  I think it is necessary, both for the Dáil and for those people who might be expected to be recipients of benefits under the Bill, that they should have made clear what the intentions of the Government are.  I think the Bill is not likely to be read by those persons as carefully and closely as would be necessary to <Col N="26" /> make them fully aware of what the position will be.  I am sorry the President has not taken the opportunity of doing that.  For instance, Deputy Figgis would not have fallen into the mistake that a good number of people have, through not reading the Bill carefully, in assuming that this is a Bill to provide pensions for services during the years preceding the Truce.  It is not.  It is a Bill to provide pensions for persons who have served in the Army since the 1st July, 1922, provided that they had served in the Volunteer forces before that time.  The pension is not for services&mdash;at least it is not to be paid to people unless they had also served in the National Army after the 1st July, 1922.  I am not finding fault with that, but I want it made clear, at this Stage of the Bill, that that is the intention of the Bill.  The Bill, as I read it, will allow of a maximum to be paid to persons who served from April, 1916, right on to the 23rd September, in the case of those who left the Army in 1923 as privates or non-commissioned officers, a pension of £70 per annum; commissioned officers, second lieutenants, first lieutenants or captains, £140 per annum; commandants or majors, £210; colonels or major-generals, £280; and officers of a higher rank than that of a major-general, £350 per annum.  There will be, apparently, considerable deductions in some cases, if the recipients are already or become paid officers of the State.  I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister to give us any estimate of the number of people who will receive benefit under this Bill for continuous service from March, 1916.  We have not had from the Minister any indication of what his estimate is of the total cost.  I think we should have had that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, when the Minister replies, he will give us at least some idea of his expectations in this matter.  There are two queries I would like to put to him with regard to the application of the Act.  Sub-section (2) of Section 8 relates to the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1923.  I am not sure whether those Superannuation Acts are the Acts under which local authorities, as well as the State, pay pension or superannuation allowances.  I think they are. <Col N="27" /> The effect of this section seems to me to place upon the local authority the liability for an increased superannuation or pension because of military service. I suggest that it is not fair to the local authority.  If a person is entitled to a superannuation allowance under those Acts, and he desires to surrender his military service pension, he may claim to have the period of his service for superannuation increased according to the scale set forth in the Schedule.  That is to say, for the military service rendered in the Army from 1916 onwards, he is to be enabled to claim upon the local authorities for an increased superannuation allowance amounting to, perhaps, fourteen years. The period will certainly be a number of years.  That is not fair to local authorities.  If there is to be a pension because of military service it should be charged upon the State, and there should be some amendment of this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is the question of men who were in the Army from 1916 onward who took service under Dáil Eireann and who have been maintained as servants of the State. Their service in the Army is apparently not to be credited to them.  That is to say, men who desired to enter the Army but who were precluded from doing so because they were required to serve the State in other respects, are not to get any benefit for their service in the Volunteers.  I draw attention to that while bearing in mind what I have already said, that the pensions under the Bill are intended for service in the National Army as from July 1st, 1922. I think there will be a sense of grievance amongst men and women who find their position worsened by the fact that they were not able to serve the Army, as the State preferred them to remain in civil occupation and as civil servants. Consequently they are not receiving the benefits in the way of pensions which accrue to those who were allowed to go into the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those effects, I believe, will probably cause some dissatisfaction amongst a considerable number of persons.  I <Col N="28" /> would like the Minister to make clear that the pensions will cease on the death of the recipient.  It should not be a continuous pension that will go forward to relatives.  There has been some disappointment&mdash;a great deal of disappointment&mdash;because it was expected, in accordance with a promise made, that in a Bill to be presented this session relating to pensions, provision would have been made for men who have contracted disease within the Army and have been rendered unfit for earning a livelihood, or for men who died as the result of disease contracted during, and as a consequence of, service. It was expected those cases would have been dealt with in any Pension Bill that was to be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to bring forward that measure.  I fear very much, however, that it is not likely to get beyond its Second Stage this Session.  The Bill is in course of preparation.  It is one of those measures which, perhaps, takes more time than 19 other measures would.  We were anxious that while it would be complete it would also be fool-proof.  That Bill is under consideration at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear that the matter has not been lost sight of.  I realise how important it is to take great care in the preparation of such a measure.  The omission of those clauses from this Bill has certainly entailed a great deal of disappointment. The delay occasioned will, I hope, not be too long.  I hope further that while the delay may be inevitable, and because it is inevitable, it may be possible to meet, by way of ex-gratia grants, some of the claims that are being made upon the State in expectation, or in advance of, claims for pensions under the promised Bill.  There are many cases of distress and suffering which will, one would hope, eventually be eased by the Bill now promised.  In the meantime, some provision should be made to assist those people.  I welcome this Bill, but I hope the Minister will make a fuller statement as to its probable cost and the probable numbers that will be in receipt of various grades of pensions.  I do not want a too detailed statement, but I think we are <Col N="29" /> entitled to some review of the Minister's expectations.  If the effect of the Bill will be to heal sores and to make the path easier, then it will be worth a good deal.  I suggest to the Minister that many of the men in receipt of those pensions will be young, healthy, capable men who will have long lives, and I think some opportunity should be found so that they may be required to give service to the State in one or other occupation and so ensure that the cost to the State for a considerable number of years will not be entirely wasted.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should endeavour to get some value, and that the men should be called on to give value for the money they receive. It is far better to call upon them to render some service to the State rather than pay out sums ranging from £70 to £350, according to rank, and not require, or give an opportunity which will probably be the equivalent of requiring, that they should continue to render service to the State.</P>

      <P>While I share the good wishes that Deputy Figgis bestowed on the Bill, or on the intentions of the Bill, I think before we give it a Second Reading, we should get more information.  I am sorry I did not hear the whole of the President's speech.  I did not anticipate that the Minister for Justice would get through two Bills in two minutes.  There are two or three points on which, I think, we would need to be enlightened.  In the Supplementary Estimates three months ago we voted a considerable sum for gratuities to men with pre-Truce service.  Does this Bill supplant those gratuities, or is it supplemental to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the men with pre-Truce service be able to claim gratuity as well as a pension?  Will a colonel get a gratuity as well as a pension&mdash;a gratuity of, say, £250?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>We should know that.  The second point is the one raised by Deputy Johnson.  Is there, together with this pension, any liability for future service?  Will there be any power given to the State in time of emergency to call back to the colours <Col N="30" /> pensioners as long as they are of an age that would render them liable and fit for service?  The third point is a technical one, but yet it is one of considerable importance.  How is this Bill, when it becomes an Act, going to be administered? It is going to be a very large order indeed.  Already, before we have reached the Second Stage, we begin to get letters, grumbling letters.  We have got letters from individuals who set out their cases and who complain that they did not get what they considered they were entitled to.  They bring up local grievances.</P>
      <P>For instance, I got a letter from Waterford mentioning that the date, July, 1922, was most unfair as Waterford was in the hands of the Irregulars then and the people there could not enlist until the place was relieved.  No doubt letters will come in greater intensity from Cork; when Cork is annoyed it lets the fact be known.  This measure is going to be a burden on Deputies.  We are going to have every person that is dissatisfied, in and outside our constituencies, writing to us and telling us about their complaints. It is going to be a far greater burden on the Government if the administration is thrown on the shoulders for the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Finance.  In view of the magnitude of the thing, and seeing that there are likely to be some 250,000 claims, many of them bogus, sent in, we shall have to give the question of administration very serious consideration.  You are bound to get every sort of fantastic claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of that fact, I think the President has here a case for creating a Parliamentary Secretaryship.  If this is to be part of the policy of the State, a Parliamentary Secretary for Pensions, who will deal with this matter independently and whom Deputies can approach with their grievances, will be a necessary part of the machinery.  Now as to my last point&mdash;it is the most important point&mdash;I have never heard any precendent for bringing in a measure of this kind without any indication of what it is going to cost. That, surely we have a right to know. There must have been estimates&mdash; actuarial estimates&mdash;made of the number of people likely to be entitled to <Col N="31" /> a pension, their age, and how long the burden on the State is to be continued, because I am quite sure this is not a light matter.  We are undertaking to-day, in a thin and tired House, a responsibility that is going to fetter the Minister for Finance of the Saorstát for fifty years, or very nearly that.  A great many of these pensioners are very young men.  Some of them are not twenty years of age, so that for nearly fifty years we shall be under liability.  I am not an actuary.  I have no access to the official reports of the Ministry of Defence, but I have tried to work out, from what one knows of the men serving in the Army, the cost. I estimate that, leaving out liability for pre-Truce service of any kind whatever, the liability for people who joined up in June and July, 1922, will be about £100,000 a year.  I shall be somewhat surprised&mdash;of course, the President speaks with much greater authority than I do&mdash;if the total liability is less than a quarter of a million a year.  That, in our present financial condition when we have made, or claim to have made, every cut that can be made, is a somewhat serious matter.  It is imposing a burden, less in size but similar in degree, to the burden imposed by Article 10 of the Treaty.  Like the story of Issachar in Scripture, the President found the Minister for Finance as the strong ass, couched under a heavy burthen on one side, and he added another to the other side to balance it.  There is another burden now added to that of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I do not grudge the money that goes to the men so much, but it is going to be a very costly measure to administer. The bulk of the men who joined up in 1922 will be drawing about £15 a year each.  How are they going to draw it&mdash; monthly, quarterly, or yearly?  However it is going to be done, it will require a considerable staff; it will require a staff for checking to prove that the right man is drawing the pension; it will cast a burden on the Post Office, where presumably these pensions will be paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but I think I should point out that it is not the intention <Col N="32" /> to give pensions for National Army service alone.  One must have previous service, so that the Estimate, as mentioned by Deputy Cooper, will not arise.  I should apologise for the manner in which I introduced this measure. I have been steeped in it to such an extent that every part of it to me seems the same, and I imagined that everybody else was as well acquainted with it.  To that extent, I should apologise for the manner in which I introduced the measure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Figgis was certainly not the only person, because I do not think the summaries in the Press make that point very clear.  After all, the average man whose letters fill his letter box, has not time to read the official reports of the debates, and I am glad to have drawn form the President the explanation he has given that only those who have pre-Truce service will be included.  That removes some of my objections on that point.  It also meets some of the points I made in regard to administration; further, it removes the fear that I felt that this was an Act of extraordinary and almost unnecessary generosity.  There is no doubt that within the last two years our troops did very arduous service; they incurred great danger and many discomforts, but there has never been any case made, except possibly after the American Civil War, for giving troops pensions merely for two or three years' service, unless they were disabled by either wounds or sickness.  Neither the French nor British troops, who went through five years' war, got any pensions. At the same time, the impression is abroad that everybody who served in the National Army is going to get a pension.  That should be corrected, and a case made&mdash;and authoritatively made&mdash;to show why that is not right, because the general rumours about this Bill have created such a state of mind that everybody thinks the <Col N="33" /> sky is going to fall, and they will get larks.</P>

      <P>Realising the fact, as I think one must do, that the profession of arms is a profession in which it is not possible to make much money, any more than it is possible for a churchman to make anything more than a bare living, I think it is only reasonable that the State should provide as generously as it possibly can for those who have given good service, and who have placed everything&mdash;their lives, reputation and all&mdash;at the disposal of the State.  Reading this Bill through, in conjunction with the particulars one saw in the newspapers as regards pensions, I think the system being tried is as just as the Exchequer can afford. I regret to see that there is no provision made for widows or orphans of men who have given their lives to the State.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that this matter is provided for, because, unfortunately, it is a well-established fact that in most countries the widows and orphans of the soldiers come off extremely poorly.  England has been notorious for that.  Therefore, I am glad we are the exception.  I am sure the country will in no way grudge pensions to men who have given good service to the State or dispute that the pensions should be according to the degree of service they have given.  It is recognised in this Bill that those who have given most service should have the biggest pension.  That is a proper principle, and I am glad it is recognised in this Bill.  I am sure the State will not grudge it.  Moreover, I think if the people of the country had the opportunity of seeing the splendid review last Sunday of the new Army, they would not grudge the giving of money for pensions or for the up-keep of the Army henceforth.  I think everybody acknowledged that the general turnout and the knowledge displayed by the officers and men, was worthy of the National Army of Ireland.

      <P>I confess, sir, that with all the talk of hundreds of thousands of pounds by Deputy Cooper, I do not know whether this Bill is really the reversal of financial form that it first struck me as.  It is impossible to say from the Bill as it stands at present how many persons are likely to get pensions and what is likely to be the average amount of the pensions. There is one necessary thing to do in connection with this Bill, and that is to define &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  If &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is not defined in connection with this Bill, then I do not know where the Minister for Finance may find himself some day.  Much of what you could say about this Bill hangs upon the definition of &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A point arises out of Section 2, where it is stated that a person may apply within the prescribed period.  That raises the question as to whether officers who are at present in the Army and who may elect to leave the Army will come under this particular Bill. Beyond the question of defining what &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is, which I think is very important in connection with the measure, there is nothing to which I wish to draw attention at this stage.</P>

      <P>There is a set of men I should like to hear the President say something about. One would imagine from some of the speeches made that the country was divided into two political camps, so far as the old I.R.A. was concerned.  But there is a section who gave very good service from 1916 up to the signing of the Treaty, and who did not elect to take part on either side.  I would like the President to make some statement as to what the Government thinks of the service these men rendered during a <Col N="35" /> very trying period.  They, surely, deserve some consideration, and I invite the President to make some statement in that regard.  It is to be regretted that those men, who come under the special protection of the new Party, should not have the new Party present to advocate their cause.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that this Bill is receiving the consideration which it is from every section of the House.  I am extremely glad the Government have taken in a measure of this kind, and that they are not treating the men who fought and gave good service to the country in the past as other countries have treated the soldiers who fought and won glorious victories for them.  It is a good thing to see that the Government has been thinking, as this Bill shows, of the men who risked everything they had that the country might survive and that we should be here to-day making laws for the better government of the country. Unfortunately, our countrymen in the past who, in many instances, gave their lives and who, in other instances, made many sacrifices for other lands, were thrown on the scrap heap and got no recompense for their services.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing to know that the native Government here is going to see that the men who gave good service to their country at home are not going to be thrown on the scrap heap, and that their services are going to be recognised.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson raised a question on Section 8 of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1923.  He wished to know if local authorities are to be involved in that action.  They are not.  What that particular section was inserted to meet was the case of one of those men who had military service, and who then entered the service of the Dáil, or rather entered the Civil Service. Now, in entering the Civil Service a man who had previous service with Dáil Eireann got certain allowances or certain advantages in the matter of years.  In this case, this particular section is drawn so as to give him <Col N="36" /> an option in the event of whatever advantage he derived.  Where he got this pension, if the advantage were greater than what he would get by reason of the allowance he would get in connection with his service in pre-Truce days in the Civil Service he would have the advantage and would get the better of the two pensions.  In other words, let us assume that the military service would give him a pension of £60 a year and that the advantage he got in the Civil Service gave him £40 a year.  He would be entitled to get the difference of the two added to the Civil Service pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have it examined to see that that is the case. It would not be possible for me to give anything like an approximate estimate, but as far as I can learn the ultimate liability in respect of this particular measure runs to between fifty and one hundred thousand pounds a year. That is the nearest I can get to it in an estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>What I say on that is that it is not contemplated in the Act to make any condition as regards future service, but I think I would be entitled to say this, that practically 95 per cent. of those who would be benefited, perhaps I would be more correct in saying 99 per cent., by this Act are persons who, during a series of years, rendered service without any payment whatever in the interests of the nation.  I am satisfied from what I know that one need only ask for mobilisation at a particular place, and whether there was a legal liability or not to serve, I am satisfied that they would serve; but if the Dáil considers that it would be desirable to insert a section of that sort, I would not object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That meets Deputy Cooper's point, but does the President <Col N="37" /> contemplate inviting pensioners under this Bill to take up positions in the Civil Service and so work out some of the value of their pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>To enter the Civil Service?  No, we do not contemplate that.  Looking over the cases of persons who have made application for supplementary grants, I have been perfectly satisfied in my mind that a real effort must be made to compensate them for the loss of that period which, in some cases, was two or three years, in others four or five years, and in some six or seven years.  It really comes to this, that quite a number of these men in their present position without this measure would really have no interest in life.  There were two or three points mentioned by Deputy Cooper.  He asked if this was supplementary to the gratuity.  It is supplementary to the gratuity.  This particular Act, if it comes into operation on the 1st October&mdash;I mean that the payments are to come into operation on the 1st October&mdash;our calculations are that the supplementary grant will reach from the time of their demobilisation up to the 1st October.  I was also asked if there was any liability for future services.  I think I have answered that.  As to how the Act is going to be administered I think the fact that he misread the Act in regard to Army service since 1922 disposes of that particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference between pre-Truce service, service which stopped at the Truce or stopped at the period when the National Army was mobilised in uniform, and service which continued with the National Army.  I put it this way, that we mobilised during the period from February, 1922, to March, 1923, something like 52,000 men. By reason of that mobilisation many civil occupations were opened to those who had pre-Truce service but who did not join the National Army.  They had certain advantages by reason of their pre-Truce services in getting in, as it were, on the ground floor with regard to any such civil occupations that might be going.  On the other hand, those who joined the National Army having had pre-Truce service, cut themselves off from any opportunity of getting <Col N="38" /> civil occupation, and were then unloaded on the industrial, commercial and labour market at a time when there was very considerable depression and very little opportunity of getting permanent employment.  To that extent there is a difference.  I should say until we see what the cost of this will be, and until there is evidence produced to us that the loss I mentioned and that we are trying to compensate in these cases has been sustained as it has been in the other cases, I could not promise a measure of compensation for these.</P>
    <P>That there is liability, I admit, but we can only shoulder liability in regard to our capabilities to bear it.  From an examination of the cases that have come before me for these Supplementary Grants, I should say that the average number of cases that will arise under this Act will be those running somewhere from the year 1920 up to date.  There are not so many who have 1916 service in which the greater liability would be occasioned, and it will be observed that under Section 2, sub-section (4) (b), that certain periods are specified which are essential; that is (a), (b) and (f) in the first clause of Schedule 1.  The reason of that, I think, will be admitted when we come to that particular section.  It is known that quite a large number of men joined the Volunteers at the time of the Conscription menace, and we did not regard that in the same light as the men who joined before them, or after that particular menace had passed.  So that an effort has been made in the first place to give compensation for big service which we regard Easter Week as and also in the more difficult periods, and at the same time not to give an advantage where the services were not up to the high water standard.</P>
    <P>Now there may be some objection or criticism of the Third Schedule; that is the calculation of the suspension of pensions.  There have not been many cases.  I do not remember coming across one single case.  But Deputy General Mulcahy may have come across one where the maximum pension under the &ldquo;Wounds Pension&rdquo; Act has been allowed.  I think the maximum I came across is £150, and it will be observed from that that any reduction there is <Col N="39" /> comes in under this Act, and not under the other.  Having passed the other Act, we leave it there.  There was a difficulty in assessing what measure of reduction there ought to be.  It occurred to us at one time that it might be better not to give a captain a higher or a double pension than what would be received by a commandant.  That is, that a man in a particular rank would not with the two pensions have a pension higher than the man of a rank immediately above him.  That was open to objection, and we put down this particular schedule, which I think will be fair.  A double pension is a most unusual thing.  I believes it shocks staid, level-headed civil servants.  But it will be admitted, I think, that our Wounds Pension Act compensates for the damage that has been done to the man.  We deprive him of some efficiency, and he should be compensated for that.  This particular measure comes in, and in order to settle the equities of the case this particular matter that is mentioned is given with regard to that.  It appears in the Third Schedule, Sub-section (2). General Mulcahy struck the nail on the head when he sought a definition of &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  There are various interpretations as to what &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is, and I do not propose to enter into a detailed exposition of that here, other than to say this: that the mere joining of the Volunteers in a particular place, and the mere drilling and going on with one's occupation in the ordinary way without interruption is scarcely a claim for consideration that should be given as compared with a man not in his ordinary occupation but night and day doing the work of the State.  That particular definition, I suppose, will be prescribed&mdash;that is the usual term with regard to it&mdash;and I expect it will take a military description.  But at any rate it is not intended that there should be any soft pensions.  It is not intended to afford a measure of compensation for that interruption.  Anybody who has ever experienced active service will admit the strain of mind and body on the physique, and that the strain generally on the mentality of the person is enormous.  We do not intend that <Col N="40" /> any sort of soft service should be included in this measure, and to that extent the description &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is put down there to be on the safe side. The State will bear its obligation, but it ought not to be asked to bear a liability beyond its capacity, and for services not rendered.</P>

      <P>I will have to look into that between this and the next Stage.  There will be also some amendments necessary to meet the cases brought forward by General Mulcahy and Deputy McGrath.  There happen to have been one or two men sent away to distant parts somewhere about the Truce time, or shortly after, and these cases have to be regularised. They were sent away suffering from disorders&mdash;I think it was tuberculosis in both cases&mdash;which was contracted during the period of active service. By reason of service in the National Army being an essential condition, these cases would be ruled out, and I will accept an amendment from General Mulcahy to meet such cases. There may be others.</P>

I notice in these estimates that four or five barracks are being restored.  I want to know on what principle these particular barracks are being selected? I know of cases where there is very strong local demand for the reconstruction of the barracks, and there does not seem to be any prospect of their being reconstructed this year.  I want to know what is the reason for the selection of these particular barracks that have been selected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection was made in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs.  So far the policy in regard to the Civic Guard has been one of concentrating on getting them premises, and whatever staff was employed it was employed on getting premises and getting the Civic Guard in.  We recognised that many premises in which they were put were unsuitable, and that it is bad for the morale and efficiency of the Civic Guard to have them unsatisfactorily housed.  Seeing that with a comparatively small number of exceptions, the quota of stations for the Civic Guard throughout the State has been opened, we are now turning to the question of further buildings.  We are anticipating that it will be possible to contemplate considerable extensions very shortly in the number of buildings. These particular cases were selected because they seemed to be the most satisfactory way of providing barracks there, and they were the most urgent from the point of view of re-building. For instance, take the Ennis barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are bound there by lease to rebuild Ennis Barracks.  In that particular case it was satisfactory.  Then some others are being rebuilt because it was not possible in the particular places to find any accommodation for the Gárda Síochána.  In the case of one of those Gárda Síochána stations the men are actually housed at the moment four miles away from the place where it is intended to station them.  We decided in that case, contrary to the general policy of hiring or commandeering premises, to proceed with the rebuilding at once.  When further consideration has been given it will be decided <Col N="44" /> to rebuild a great deal more than is indicated in this particular vote, and after some time a supplementary estimate will be brought before the Dáil in connection with the Gárda Síochána buildings.</P>

Is the £20,000 an estimate for the possible or shall I say the probable re-seating of this building?  Or what else may it be for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply a rough figure put in.  It was put in, in February last when the estimates were being prepared to provide, so far as we could, for the contingencies that would arise. It could be used for such purpose as the Deputy suggests, but it could be used also for structural alterations necessary if we stay here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem to the Minister that the very putting it in of this £20,000 is rather an inducement to the spending of money on something or other that might not be on the best lines?  I would like to put it to the Minister that it is unsatisfactory to put in an estimate for something which does not represent anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is certain, I think, that some money will be spent during the year.  I think that it may be accepted that a certain amount of money will have to be spent; if the Oireachtas is to stay here it will be necessary to make some changes.  If a plan like Deputy Thrift's were to be adopted, a great deal more than that would be spent, as it is certain that some money will have to be spent in connection with the Oireachtas.  It was thought desirable to make some provisions for it, and not to rely entirely on coming forward at a later stage with a supplementary estimate.  I do not think that the putting in of the figure here will have really any great effect on the decision as to expenditure.  But if it is within this figure it will prevent any further application to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that in <Col N="45" /> running through these Estimates I find a great many items like this, and it is only dangling money before people who may be inclined to be extravagant. Having that item here avoids any necessity for coming again to the Dáil. Now I say it is wrong to have something on your Estimate which does not represent something definite at all.  The Minister says if Deputy Thrift's ideas of a temporary building were to be considered it would cost us considerably more.  True, but in this way you have a sum of £20,000 down there on the Estimates, and that can be spent on anything and in any direction without coming before the Dáil at all.  For instance, if Deputy Thrift's scheme could be carried out, that £20,000 item need not come before the Dáil at all, because the £20,000 would be already provided for in the Estimates that we are now considering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputy is making a mountain out of a molehill.  If some sum were provided that we could see was absolutely certain to be required, some very trifling sum, and some decision were come to by the Dáil, for instance during the next week, as to what should be done in the way of temporary housing, it certainly would be necessary to go on and spend whatever money was required, and simply go for the covering Supplementary Estimate afterwards.</P>

      <P>Under the Ministry of Agriculture, which, I take it, will now be under the Ministry of Education, a sum of £9,500 is provided for the extension of the National Library, and I would like to have from the Minister a statement as to the particular nature of that extension.  Under the heading of the Ministry of Education there is, I am glad to say, an increased grant for the building of national schools.  Perhaps the Minister would say a word as to whether it is the intention to engage in a scheme in a increased way for the rebuilding of schools.  I would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that throughout the country many of the school buildings are in a very bad state, a very dangerous state, and new <Col N="46" /> buildings are urgently required.  I doubt very much if even this sum of £50,000 would go very far towards meeting the need that there is for the provision of new buildings.  The Minister said a few moments ago that it was bad for the morale and the efficiency of the Guards to have them badly housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that could be more aptly and more correctly applied in the case of schools, where the fact is that in some cases in the West there are insanitary buildings which are very much overcrowded.  On the question of teachers' residences I would like to know what exactly is the position with regard to the special Act which was passed in 1875 or 1876, and under which special provision was made for the granting of loans for the provision of teachers' residences, especially in rural areas.  Nothing has been done in this way since 1914.  The provision was that a loan of 5 per cent. was provided; the locality paid half the interest on the loan, and the Commissioners of National Education paid the other half.  The locality generally meant the teacher.  There is one particular question with regard to these residences that I would like to draw the attention of the Government to.  I am sorry the Minister for Education is not here. These houses have been built by the State for a particular purpose, that is for the accommodation of the teacher of a particular school, while he is the teacher.  But as the law stands at the moment it is open to certain people, when the loan is paid off, to take over possession of those houses, and even sell them.  It has been done, and that is a matter which the Government ought to look into at the earliest possible opportunity.  As I say, the house is provided for a special purpose, that it should be the residence of the teacher while he is the teacher.  That is the usual practice, but it has been abused in some cases, and as the law stands, the owner of a site on which the house was built, after the loan has been paid off, is at liberty to take possession of the house, sell it, and put the money in his own pocket.  I would like, as I say, to hear from the Minister whether it is proposed to continue the work under that Act, which was discontinued <Col N="47" /> during the war period, or what is the intention generally with regard to these residences.</P>

      <P>I would like at this Stage to call attention to the fact that there is a very small House.

      <P>I want to call attention to the Vote for the Dublin Metropolitan Police, Kill-o'-the-Grange Barrack, Restoration.  There is a vote there of £3,000 for an ordinary country police barrack which was, I presume, destroyed during the last five years. I happened to have a police barrack of similar size and character destroyed, and when I put in for compensation I claimed £1,400, and I got £1,200.  Why should it take as much as £3,000 to reestablish this country police barrack when the compensation given in the other case is less than half?  I think this is an estimate which requires a certain amount of scrutiny.  It is a small sum, but it raises a question of principle. If private individuals can only get from £1,000 to £1,200 compensation for destroyed police barracks of very much similar size and character, I cannot see why there should be a vote down for £3,000 in this particular instance, and I await the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <P>There is a matter under the heading of Post Office&mdash;&ldquo;Dublin G.P.O., New Sorting Office.&rdquo; I think everybody is agreed that it is most essential that provision should be made immediately for a new sorting office in Dublin.  The only thing I wish to say on that point is to ask the Minister how soon the work will be put on hand.  Since the old G.P.O. was burned down there was never any really suitable position for a sorting office in Dublin, even in the Rink.  As conditions exist at the present time they are altogether unsuitable.  I would like to urge that the work of providing this new sorting-office should be put on hand at the very earliest opportunity.</P>

A sum of £20,000 is required for this year, and £10,000 is the estimated sum already spent.  The revised estimate is £30,000.  I would like the Minister to give us some information as to what that actually means.  What was the nature of the revision?  Is it a revision since the £10,000 already spent was voted?  Does it mean an enlargement or an alteration in plans, or is it a reduction in the size of the barracks?  I would like some information as to what the term &ldquo;revised estimate&rdquo; means.</P>

      <P>With reference to Deputy O'Connell's question as to the extension of the Library, that extension is several years overdue.  The National Library is very congested, indeed, in the matter of space.  In some <Col N="52" /> sections of it is not possible to have the files of newspapers that are attached to the Library stored away.  It is proposed to erect at the rere of the School of Arts an extension which will cost the amount that is mentioned in the Estimates.  For many years there have been in existence plans for that and for the extension of the National Library.  The accumulation of books and other material requires additional space.</P>
      <P>With regard to the loan under the Act of 1875 for teachers' residences, since the start of the European War and before the change of Government, the issue of loans out of the Local Loans Fund has been suspended. This year we have put in the Local Loans Estimate provision for a certain sum that will enable us to re-open to some extent the Local Loans Fund for the issue of loans.  We are now considering under what category loans may be issued out of it.  In view of the fact that we would have to borrow, and borrowing has its difficulties particularly at the present time, we were not able to provide a large sum for the Local Loans Fund; but we have devoted some money to that purpose, and I am hoping that a decision will be come to very shortly as to what class of work it may be possible to issue loans for out of that Fund.</P>
      <P>I will consider the question of money for teachers' residences.  Prior to the change of Government it was, I believe, recognised that the position indicated by the Deputy which enabled a house built for a teacher's residence to be sold as soon as the loan was paid off, was undesirable, but it was difficult when the loan had been paid off, and liability did not exist, to prevent the person occupying the house disposing of it.  It is a matter that I have not looked into, but it can be taken up. I refuse to be drawn into a discussion on the Damage to Property Act, which was referred to by Deputy Cooper.  I do not think I need say anything on the point raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time it has been recognised that it was costly to have the Post Office sorting done under the circumstances in which it was done prior to the desctruction of the Rink, and that it is costly to have it done under <Col N="53" /> present circumstances.  It is recognised that a new sorting office should be provided.  Negotiations are now in progress for the acquisition of a very suitable site.  I hope that before we come to the Post Office Estimate, negotiations will finally be completed, and it may be possible to indicate to the Dáil where the site is.  Once that has been accomplished the work of carrying out the necessary building will be at once undertaken, and we hope by this time next year the Post Office will have possession of the new sorting office which it is intended to provide.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate for the Mícheal Barracks, Cork, the revised Estimate is one of £30,000 as against £40,000 originally.  The reduction was arrived at by deciding to omit certain works originally contemplated.  We are building for 700 men, with the appropriate number of officers, and we are not reinstating the building fully. If that were done it would provide accommodation for 1,400 men and officers.  The cost, therefore, would be much more than proportionally greater. It would amount to something like £187,000.  It is necessary to have the accommodation in Cork, because, of course, it is a place where we are always bound to have a military establishment, and there is no excess accommodation being provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Urgent Unforeseen Works&rdquo; is it really necessary to vote any money?  It seems to be something in the air altogether. Last year £10,000 were voted, and there was nothing spent.  Now we are asked to vote £5,000.  Is something unforeseen likely to arise?  If something does arise could it not be put on the Supplementary Estimates?  It is rather much to expect that the Minister is going to run through the year without Supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being a prophet, I cannot answer Deputy Hewat, but I think there is really no harm in providing this small margin.  We should aim at running through the year without Supplementary Estimates.  If we decide on further buildings, for instance, for the Civic Guard, it will be necessary to have a Supplementary Estimate, but that would be for a definite and specific purpose.  I think this is <Col N="54" /> not an excessive margin, and, contrary to what Deputy Hewat feared when we were dealing with the previous provision, it does not seem to have led anybody to expend money.</P>

      <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Maintenance and Supplies&rdquo; I wonder whether the Minister has taken into account the amount that might be saved in respect to the Governor-General's residence?  Last year £11,000 were voted, and this year £10,000 are asked. For maintenance and supplies £7,500 are allocated; £900 for furniture, fittings and utensils; and £1,600 for fuel, light, water and cleaning.  It seems to me that in the present circumstances the sum for maintenance of that residence, including the Private Secretary's lodge, is excessive as a charge upon the public fund, particularly in addition to all the other charges.  I ask the Minister whether he is as economical in respect to this as he is in matters dealing with the public who are not Governors-General.  To ask us to vote £10,000 for the maintenance of that residence, is asking us to show an example of extravagance.  I want to bear in mind that this vote is additional to what was voted for the household. It is a sum intended simply for the purpose of maintaining the place and providing fuel, light and cleaning, things that would ordinarily come out of the pay of any other officer of the State. We are bound to provide for the establishment, but I am doubtful that we are bound to provide for maintenance at this rate.  I think we could save probably £5,000 and still do the thing well.</P>

I would like to have some definite assurance that the Minister has been as close in his scrutiny of expenses in this respect as he has in other respects, more especially when dealing with the average man in the street.  I think the amount is too great, and there should be a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the amount provided for the maintenance and repair of Dun Laoghaire Harbour.  Some considerable time ago Deputy Cooper, in the Dáil, and Senator the Earl of Mayo, in the Seanad, drew the attention of the Minister for Finance to the discomforts arising as a result of the lack of proper accommodation on this pier.  In the Estimates for the year there is, apparently, no provision for anything in the nature of repairs to this harbour.  I believe and am aware that engineers attached to the Board of Works and the different railway companies who do business at the pier and who have reason to appreciate the difficulties of the situation there, were in consultation some time ago.  Naturally, one would expect something to result from their consultation.  It must be quite obvious to anybody who has had experience of travelling either to or from England, especially in a boat where you have usually three or four hundred passengers or over that number, that there are discomforts, especially since the setting up of the Customs barrier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those discomforts are very great.  I draw attention to this matter to show that although people may be interested, and are, no doubt, interested, in doing useful work in regard to the development of tourist traffic in this country, that the inconveniences and discomforts caused by lack of proper accommodation at Carlisle Pier are injuring the work those people are doing and the objects they have so much at heart. On to-day's Order Paper we have the State Harbours Bill put down for consideration. The Ministry of Finance are seeking the right, and properly so, to impose dues in Dunmore and Dun Laoghaire Harbours and to alter the laws which apply to those harbours.  If it is the duty of the Government, and I believe it is, to seek those powers and impose those dues to whatever extent they may think fit, it is also their duty to see that the harbour accommodation is suitable.  I believe the matter is purely an engineering one, but if it is the intention of the Government to alter the position in regard to Dun Laoghaire Harbour they should also make provision in the Estimates to <Col N="56" /> carry out necessary works.  This, I consider, is a suitable opportunity to endeavour to ascertain from the Minister what is being done or what has been done to effect, what must be obvious to him, are desirable improvements.  I would like if the Minister would indicate whether or not it is the intention of the Government to make any improvements in the existing accommodation at the Carlisle Pier.</P>

      <P>This Estimate covers such a variety of subjects that I am afraid my remarks will rather follow the Scotchman's description of the haggis, a fine, confused feeding.  But when one has to deal with Government offices and parks, the sea and the land, one must cover a good deal of ground.  I would like to endorse what Deputy Davin has said about the Customs arrangements at Dun Laoghaire, and also Deputy Johnson's remarks about the Viceregal Lodge.  I would like to supplement Deputy Johnson's remarks by asking whether any person who is fortunate enough to possess a house of the same size as the Viceregal Lodge would be allowed to deduct £10,000 for maintenance and upkeep from his valuation for his income tax.  I return to the sea.  We are in discussing this Estimate under one disadvantage that I do not know that the Dáil has realised. About three months ago I saw in the publications of the Stationery Office the annual report of the Board of Works.  In order to discuss this Estimate, I will not say with more intelligence, but with less stupidity, I got that, and I found to my surprise it did not deal with the year 1923-24 at all; it dealt merely with the year 1922.  So far from dealing with the destruction and the harm done by the Irregulars, it dealt at considerable length with the problems of taking over from the British.  I do not blame the Ministry. They are following a very bad precedent, when the Irish Estimates were barely discussed, and if they were discussed the discussion was concentrated on one or two points, bad administration, or something of that kind, and the result was that no one read the Blue Books when they came out.  The Board of Works are now <Col N="57" /> getting into the habit of thinking that it does not matter when they produce their official reports, but an official Department ought to be able to produce their annual report for the year it is dealing with, and we should not now be getting the report for 1922 instead of the report for the year 1923-24.  I hope the Minister will consider this. Any improvements of this kind must be gradual, and I do not ask that next year we should have the Estimate instantly, but that gradually an endeavour should be made to expedite it. That is not the only thing which makes you know that the Board of Works is a Department which moves with somewhat dignified deliberation. The National Association of Fishermen are very anxious to obtain a fish-curing station on the West Pier at Dun Laoghaire. On May 21st the Ministry of Fisheries wrote to them that the decision of the Board of Works as to the establishment of this fish-curing station was expected in a few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>If it did not, I hope the Board of Works Ministry will realise that in matters of business sometimes time is money, and that long deferring the consideration of a matter of this kind is injurious, for assuming that the establishment of this <Col N="58" /> station is rejected, then some other station ought to be established somewhere else, and it is important to the people interested in the matter that they should know where they stand.  I turn from Dun Laoghaire to Howth Harbour.  I understand, but I should like more detailed information from the Minister, that regulations are to be issued, and administrative arrangements are being made, to prevent fishermen from mooring their boats more inland on the quay.  It is obvious when a good many boats come in they can unload more quickly if moored end-on, and unless that does injury to the pier it should be allowed.  It may be, I do not know, that there is no precedent for that.  I know that in the Mediterranean I have seen ships so moored for a mile and a half, but that is not tidal water.  The intentions of the Department in this matter should be made clear, for the fishermen are entirely in the dark in the matter.  I leave the sea and return to the Phoenix Park.  I understand a responsible body, the National Athletic and Cycling Association, which has control of athletic and cycling events in the Saorstát, made application to the Board of Works for ground for a pavilion for training purposes in the Park, and it was refused, and no reason was given for the refusal.  I think, when we are dealing with a representative body of that kind, and where there is, as I think, space in the Park that could be used for this purpose, at least some definite reason should be given for this refusal.  You cannot deal with a body that has a King's Counsel as Chairman, and a representative Committee, and who are sending people to maintain the honour of the Saorstát at the Olympic Games, as if they were a girls' school asking for somewhere to play hockey.  I hope the Minister will make a case in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter is the disposal of the present unoccupied buildings in the Park for which we are voting a considerable sum of money amounting, in all, to £12,000.  The Royal Hibernian Military School, the Chief Secretary's Lodge and the Under-Secretary's Lodge were voted a large sum of <Col N="59" /> money.  If it is not proposed to put these buildings to any use whatever, is there any reason why they should not be sold, and if there is, is there any reason why the cost of the upkeep should not be placed either on a Government Department or the occupant, whoever he may be?  We are asked to vote £2,000 for fuel, light, water, and cleaning for the Royal Hibernian School.  That is an excessive amount. A certain amount of heat is needed, undoubtedly, as the building would deteriorate unless it is kept warm, but I think £2,000 is a large order. It is not a proposition.  I think, that any of us would adopt in the case of a house of our own, and nobody knows what is going to happen to this building.  A statement of the intentions of the Government is, I think, overdue.  Now, I come to the last point, which may be described as a small point, and that is the discrepancies in the amount voted for the service of various Government Offices.  For instance, take fuel, light, water and cleaning, it costs £15 a year to light and clean the Postmaster-General, but it costs £25 a year to light and clean the Minister for External Affairs; why this discrepancy?  The Postmaster-General has a very much larger Department, and there are many more employees; why should he be able to have his official Department warmed, lighted and cleaned for £15, while the Minister for External Affairs requires £25?  Is it that the Minister for External Affairs entertains Oriental potentates, and that he has to keep up large fires in order to make them feel at home?  The Minister for Fisheries comes half way; he costs £20 for fuel, light, water and cleaning, and I hope a certain excess of water may be allowed in that Department. I do not quarrel with that.  I would like to know is it the policy of the Board of Works to accept what a Government Department puts down as necessary?  For instance, for furniture, fittings and utensils the Postmaster-General's account is economical, costing £10, whilst the Minister for Fisheries costs £25.  It may be the fishing utensils are fishing rods for use on holidays, in which case I would not quarrel with that.</P>

      <P>I would like to support and supplement a little what Deputy Cooper has said in reference to the application of the National Athletic and Cycling Association, because that application, I understand, was made in reference to having some ground on which athletes might obtain the necessary training with a view to the forthcoming athletic events, and it does seem that there is very reasonable grounds, indeed, for their request. Provision could be made for them very adequately in the Phoenix Park.  There is plenty of room there, I think you will all admit.  It seems to be a very reasonable application, and apparently it has been turned down without any justification.  I would like also to refer to the point Deputy Johnson raised, for the special reason that he refers to the different charges in regard to the maintenance of the Governor-General's residence.  Now, I fully agree that if we are to maintain that residence we could do it on a scale that would be a credit to us; but I am not prepared to say whether the sums I see specified in the estimate are requisite for the purpose or not.  As a matter of form, however, I think it important we should not have the same matter referred to in two distinct places in the Estimates.  In one page of the Estimate we have a definite sum put down for the maintenance of the Governor-General's residence; apparently the very same heading occurs <Col N="61" /> in quite another part of the Estimates. There appears on page 36 a provision for the maintenance of the Governor-General's residence, £5,000, and then later on under the heading of &ldquo;State and Official Residences&rdquo; the maintenance of the Governor-General's residence is again mentioned on an estimate of £7,500.  I think as a matter of form that every item should have its special place, and not appear in two distinct places.</P>

      <P>I see the Passport Office is put down under the heading of the Ministry of Home Affairs, but I presume that is a mistake, in view of the passing of the Ministries and Secretaries Act.  There is the question of the coastguard stations and their maintenance.  I wonder if the Minister can give any information as to the exact position of the coastguard stations at present.  I know of a case of a coastguard station which presumably belongs to the Government, and which presumably was then sold to a private individual, and the Government now pays a substantial rent for a small section of the building for the benefit of the Civic Guard.  I do not know how that transaction is brought about, but the Minister will, no doubt, give some information as to how coastguard stations were sold and what the position is in regard to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Cooper in the request he has made in regard to the National Athletic and Cycling Association.  I did not know, as a matter of fact, that the subjects mentioned by Deputy Cooper and Deputy Thrift could be raised on this point, but the matter has been brought under my notice by some people who are interested in the promotion of athletic clubs, and I have been asked to support Deputy Cooper and Deputy Thrift in calling attention to the matter.  I might refer to the fact, that for a number of years I devoted most of my spare time, before I became a member of this House, in availing myself of the privileges of training with an athletic club in the grounds of the Phoenix Park.  It must be obvious to everybody who has taken <Col N="62" /> any notice of the activities of such clubs in the Park that they are suffering under great disadvantages.  You have to go to the Park, strip and dress in the open, and be attended to by your trainer in the open, if you are able to afford one.  I think that is not right or proper.  The Board of Works might out of the very great amount of land at their disposal in the Park, set aside some portion of their property as a ground for training purposes upon which an athletic club or the general body of the clubs could, at their own expense, erect a suitable pavilion for the purpose of seeing that athletes were properly attended to.  I think, at any rate, the Minister might, if he has not got the time to consider the proposal, instruct the Board of Works to receive a deputation from the National Athletic and Cycling Association, for the purpose of discussing the application which has been already turned down.  I think the claims of such bodies are entitled to more considerate treatment than they have received by the curt refusal which they have got from the Board of Works in connection with the application already made. I trust that in view of the Tailteann Games and the Olympic Games and the return to normal conditions in this country, that anything that is concerned with the promotion of sport will receive the support of the Government. If you get people to think more about sport and less about politics in this country you would have a more normal condition of things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also been approached in this matter, and I desire to put in a word on behalf of this Association.  I understand the members of this Association come from the class who generally cannot join individual clubs and therefore have not at their disposal grounds such as Trinity College grounds or the University College grounds.  I am also led to believe that when the Association approached the Board of Works they were received most courteously, and they also received a certain assurance that grounds in the Phoenix Park would be placed at their disposal.  To their great surprise they were subsequently told that the decision had been reconsidered. Now this Association comprises young <Col N="63" /> people from all classes and walks of life in and around the City of Dublin, and I am told that there is no place at their disposal.  They are not in a position to provide out of their own funds for suitable grounds, and I do not think that the expenditure, if any, would be very great on the Exchequer. At first I rather gathered from Deputy Davin that the Association wished that the Government should erect this shelter or pavilion, but I gathered afterwards that they were prepared to stand the necessary expense themselves.  If that is so the only obstacle, in a financial way, at any rate, would seem to be the preparing of the ground or the marking of it off.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell the Committee what that would amount to.  I do not think it would amount to very much, and in view of all these representations coming from different parts and different parties in the House, I hope he will be able to reconsider his decision in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I just desire to make a general criticism of the various items under the heading of B.  It is very hard to follow the whys and the wherefores of the various alterations one sees in the Estimates, and this is, therefore, hardly perhaps the time to criticise them very minutely.  There are some things, however, that strike the eye.  Take, for instance, the Stationery Office.  Last year the Estimate was £3,155; this year it is only £977.  That seems a very meritorious performance and would seem to indicate the exercise of some economy in some direction, but where the difference can arise it is difficult to see without some explanation.  On page 40 we have an item in respect of the Museum, School of Art, National Library, etc. That is an item one would imagine would be a reducing estimate, whereas the Estimate last year was £4,500, while this year it is £5,800.  That is a fairly substantial increase on that particular item.  Then, again, the Land Commission last year were satisfied with £2,008, and this year they want £4,344.  No doubt there is some explanation which does not appear on the face of it.  On page 41 we find that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce <Col N="64" /> were satisfied last year with £2,615; this year they are looking for £4,048. One would have imagined that there was nothing in the Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that would call for that increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, again, I can only draw attention to the fact that there is an increase without giving any explanation for it, because I have not got it.  On the same page we find that last year the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was not called on to provide anything for Coast Life Saving Service, but this year they want a sum of £3,900.  A Coast Life Saving Service is, of course, a very meritorious thing, but it is a new service altogether. There was no charge under this heading before, and one is curious to know how the necessity for this expenditure of £3,900 has arisen.  Under the heading of the Post Offices a sum of £17,965 was sufficient last year for postal telegraph and telephone services, notwithstanding, I suppose, that there was some exceptional expenditure during that time.  This year the estimate jumped up to £21,200.  At a time when we are supposed to be exercising very drastic economy in all the Departments, some of these figures are rather startling.  Further down on the same page one would naturally look under the heading of the coastguard stations for some increase, because under the new order of things it is very necessary to develop coastguard services throughout the country.  A good many of them were shut up during the war, and one would expect an increase there. On the contrary, the estimate here shows that only a sum of £4,670 is provided as against £8,250 last year.  I hope the economy in that direction is not false economy.  Of course, it is very welcome to see a saving, but one would prefer to see these savings on the other heads that have an increased expenditure rather than on that particular service. Again, we want an explanation on that point.  Deputy Cooper referred to the maintenance of the Chief Secretary's and the Under-Secretary's Lodges.  They do seem to cost an extraordinary amount of money.  In the case of the Chief Secretary's Lodge there is an increase over last year, and in the case of the Under-Secretary's <Col N="65" /> Lodge there is a very substantial increase. One would have expected to see the estimates under these heads considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Harbours, Howth has already been referred to.  I do not know whether the trade of Howth is increasing by leaps and bounds, but it does not appear to me from casual observation that there has been such an increase in trade there as would warrant an increase in expenditure to the extent of £2,145 this year as against £1,664 last year.  Under the same heading you get an estimate for dredgers of £9,350 as against nothing last year.  That will probably be explained somewhere else, but this seems to be very considerable expenditure.  I do not know that I have in my experience found that there is any unusual activity by the Government in regard to dredgers.  Certainly the harbours in the neighbourhood of Dublin do not seem to have been dredged to the extent that that expenditure would indicate. I presume that is capital expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the matters raised in the order in which they were raised.  On this question of the Governor-General, it seems to me that we generally have a political discussion masquerading as an economy discussion, and it is very difficult to take it always as seriously as some people would expect.  The residence that is occupied by the Governor-General is a huge rambling building which is most costly to keep up.  There are grounds around it which must be kept in some sort of decent condition, and the expense of keeping it up is not considered high in the circumstances.  As a matter of fact, during the last years that there were Lords Lieutenant there, the cost of maintenance averaged about £12,500 as against, I think, £7,500 that we have down.  I do not know that we could well reduce that without allowing the building and the place to become dilapidated and discreditable to us, as the establishment where the Governor-General resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the discomforts at <Col N="66" /> Dun Laoghaire Harbour, I must say that I have crossed to England and back several times, got my luggage examined by Customs officials in the ordinary way, got no exemption, and I experienced no discomfort.  I really think that while there might be minor matters on which it would be possible to have more ideal arrangements, there is nothing pressing about the present state of affairs.</P>
    <P>On the question of reports, I will look into that.  I think it would be impossible to have a report at the end of the year with which it would deal if the report were to be at all carefully compiled.  Then, it must be remembered that on account of all the work that had to be done by the Board of Works during the last year or two years, not merely in connection with the military, but also in connection with the Damage to Property Act, there has been a very great strain thrown on that Department, and it certainly has been more necessary to try to get on with the current work than to be preparing reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that. With regard to the fish-curing station at Dun Laoghaire, I have really nothing at hand about it.  It seems to me that this matter, like a couple of other matters that have been raised, should either be brought up in the Dáil, in the first instance, by way of question, or notice should be given that they would be raised on the Estimates.  It is impossible for anybody to have notes or any means of answering offhand matters of casual operation by Departments when raised on the Estimates. It seems to me that to raise matters of that sort, in the first instance, on the Estimates, without notice, simply means that time is taken up, since no satisfactory answer can be given. Those are things about which anybody who is responsible must have notice. The same remark applies with regard to the application of the National Athletic and Cycling Association.  I do <Col N="67" /> not know when this refusal was given. It may have been given recently or it may have been given some time ago.  I do not recollect that any question was addressed to me in the Dáil, and certainly no notice was given me with regard to it.  I simply know nothing about it.  I could not be expected to answer questions regarding the everyday business of Departments in that way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson gave me notice about a matter in connection with the Stationery Office a month or so ago.  I may not be able to satisfy him, but I will not be able to say that he sprang the matter on me.  Dealing with the question of unappropriated buildings, at present the Royal Hibernian School is used as a barracks. The expense is borne here exceptionally on the Board of Works Estimate, because it is not estimated that it will continue as barracks.  If it were to continue as barracks the cost would appear otherwise.  With regard to the late Chief Secretary's Lodge and the late Under-Secretary's Lodge, it is an extravagance to continue them as they are at the present time.  I am not very keen on letting them to private individuals. I do not think it is very desirable that that should be done.  The point has been raised as to whether at some later stage, so that disturbance would not be caused, the Chief Secretary's Lodge might not be a good enough establishment for some other purpose.  However, I think this is a matter that might remain over.</P>

      <P>If you are going to put the President there, you will have to give him a salary of about £10,000 a year.  I suggested at one time that the President should occupy it, and he was very much offended, indeed.  He was just as much offended when I mentioned the occupation of the Under-Secretary's Lodge.  They are really houses that it is impossible to use for the residence of Ministers or any officials we have, because they could not afford to live in them.  We have under consideration the disposal of these buildings.  Meantime they have to be kept up, and the furniture cannot be allowed to become blue-mouldy.  But I realise that the present position cannot be continued.  Some use must be found for these premises, or it might be as well definitely to dismantle them.</P>
      <P>Somebody referred to the official residence of the Minister for Defence. Lissonfield House was the official residence of the Minister for Defence, and he paid a rent for it.  It was so set apart during General Mulcahy's tenure of that office, as it was considered desirable that he should be close to the centre of military activity.  It is still occupied by General Mulcahy.</P>
      <P>The discrepancies Deputy Cooper talked about, in regard to the cost of fuel and cleaning in the different offices, arise out of the size of the offices.  The Postmaster-General in Government buildings only occupies two rooms.  The Ministry of External Affairs occupies a greater number of rooms, and I do not think we could really ration them out and say that the cost shall be the same in the case of each Ministry, irrespective of the number of rooms occupied or the number of staff employed.  On the question that Deputy Esmonde raised, I would have to ask him for some information.  I would like to know of the coastguard station he referred to.  I have nothing which would enable me to deal with the matter at the moment.  So far, we have been simply holding on to the coastguard stations.  A great many of them were burned and are in ruins. Until some decision has been come to as to what will be required in the way of a coast-watching service, for which they might be used, we cannot do anything.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat referred to a large number of matters, all of which I was unable to take a note of.  In the case of the Stationery Office, the reduction that occurred was really due to the question of rent.  During last year the Stationery Office Authorities were in a building which was let to them at an outrageously high rent. They had to take it at the period of the fighting which followed the Four Courts, when it was difficult to get a building, and when they were obliged to leave the building in which they had been, because it was not weatherproof. They had large stocks of paper and articles that would have been destroyed by rain.  They went into a building which they hoped to occupy only for a few months until they would get into Oriel House or some of the military barracks.  Delays occurred. They were not able to leave the temporary premises which they took at what was an excessive rent, and it was only comparatively recently they were able to get into Oriel House.  The saving is due to getting into a building which we had possession of at a moderate rent.</P>
      <P>I will consider whether it would be possible to set out those Estimates in some other form, which would enable the comparisons to which Deputy Hewat drew attention to be more easily made and to be more easily explained. But there are, as everybody knows, quite a number of casual expenditures in connection with every office&mdash;items that are not recurrent or not recurrent annually.  These Estimates are bound to go up and down because of that.  As regards dredgers, that matter arises from the fact that the cost of dredgers is now being shown separately, and is not being included in the cost of any harbour maintenance or other works.</P>

      <P>The only thing I should like to ask the Minister, with regard to compensation for premises <Col N="70" /> commandeered by the Army, is how far this Vote of £100,000 is likely to meet that compensation.  Has he any sort of Estimate as to what is the total amount that will be required for compensation, because we know from a previous debate that there has been a great amount of damage&mdash;and sometimes unnecessary damage&mdash;done, and the compensation required will be very heavy.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would give us some definite information as to what is the basis on which he calculates the compensation to be paid for these premises.  There seems to be nothing definite in the matter.  I had occasion here some time ago to make similar references and to point out that the troops occupied these premises perhaps months in advance of any investigation by the Board of Works.  The Board of Works Inspector goes into these premises, and it is not what actually was in those premises that compensation is paid for at all.  It is what the Inspector thinks should be in the premises.  He reconstructs the house and the furniture and the general get-up, and he makes no allowances whatever.  It would be impossible for him to do so, because he does not know what was there.  It would be impossible for him to reconstruct the place even in his imagination. Unfortunately, he gives nothing like adequate compensation.  These things are being referred to from every quarter in the Dáil, and it is nearly time the Minister gave us some definite statement as to how the compensation is assessed and on what basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of delay. I have in mind at the moment one particular case where the troops were in possession of the whole place, which was, one might say, rendered useless for occupation for a considerable time.  An assessement was made, and I drew the Minister's attention to it in a question here.  Subsequently, with the applicant, I went to the Board of Works and put the position up to them.  This applicant had to leave his house and live outside with his wife and family.  I put it up to the Board of Works that the difference between what he could live in his own house for and what he <Col N="71" /> would pay outside was at least reasonable compensation to pay the man. That was put up six weeks ago.  I spoke to the Board of Works people the other day, and I was told that that position was never put up.  I put it up myself to them for two hours.  Those are things that are likely to sap the confidence of any people in the sense of fair play of a Board dealing with matters of this kind.  There is the method of assessment, the delay in dealing with claims, and the evasion of straight cases which one puts before them, and I would like the Minister to give us some definite statement on these three points.</P>

      <P>This is an Estimate for £100,000 for the present year.  I presume it has nothing to do with the year that the Estimate is for at all. These are claims that are coming in from a previous period.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that the whole system of commandeering has ceased.  It is not reasonable to commandeer any man's property, except in case of emergency.  One recognises, of course, that it was necessary in the past, but I would like a clear assurance that in the future it will not be a case of commandeering any man's property without his permission or without has having agreed to terms.  This question of the terms and the value of the service and all that sort of thing must be a very heavy item in administration, but it is caused by the fact of the Government coming in and taking a man's property without any agreement as to what they were going to pay or any recognised rule as regards compensation. If that has been necessary in the past, may we hope it will not be necessary in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point that Deputy Hewat has raised, there is a definite Army Order against commandeering now except in cases of extreme emergency.  It has been arranged that if such a case should occur, arrangements are to be made to have some representative of the Board of Works attend for the purpose of making a valuation of anything that may be there, with a representative of the owner, so that it will be possible to <Col N="72" /> have a firm basis to go on for compensation afterwards.  But I would hope there would be little or no commandeering in future.  It is impossible to know whether this Estimate of £100,000 will suffice.  Claims are still coming in, and there are still large numbers of claims unsettled.  It is difficult to know the precise figure, but this is the best Estimate we could make of what would be required.  It is simply a shot at the amount, but it was thought it would probably be sufficient.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan makes a sort of complaint about the way these matters are dealt with.  There are one or two things I would ask the Deputy to bear in mind.  The officials who deal with these cases have no financial interest in paying less than is due.  It gains the official who cuts down a claim absolutely nothing.  He gets no commission on reductions.  It will gain him no credit or promotion if he gets the name of being unreasonable and of being likely to cause questions to be put here which cannot be satisfactorily answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that, really, it must be taken that the people who are dealing with this, if they are stringent, are only stringent out of a sense of duty, and are only anxious to do what is fair to the State. But there is no reason why an official should go beyond what is reasonable and fair, and I do believe there are no cases where there is any attempt to do other than what is right.  The Deputy must be aware that the great majority of claims put in are exaggerated.  I heard lately of a series of cases&mdash;I think almost 200 cases&mdash;which were heard recently in one particular county under the Damage to Property Act, where the awards totalled eighteen per cent. of the claims.  That is the sort of claim that we have coming in under the Damage to Property Act. We have really the same sort of claim coming in in great numbers in connection with commandeered premises. There must be a great deal of scrutiny, and there must be an attempt to get the people who claim for certain things to prove that they were there. I do not stand for depriving people of what is justly due, and there is no encouragement or any attempt to get any official to stand for that.  On the <Col N="73" /> other hand, I think the officials who act in the matter have a duty to the ordinary people who are paying as well as to the individuals who are claiming, and they must examine these things with all possible care.  In a great majority of cases we have been able to effect settlements and, so far as I know, the big majority of the people are reasonably satisfied, even if they did not get all they wanted to get. Even where they were excessive, they were put in from, what you might call, a comparison point of view.  When people see damage they think of what it will cost to repair.  They do not think of the amount of wear that has been got out of things and how they have depreciated.  All these things are taken into account.  People are often dissatisfied to a certain extent when they are beaten down.  There might be cases where the thing works unfairly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the difficulties.  I can imagine that there was a great deal of talk about things that never existed.  An inspector would be up against that; he would have that sort of suspicion in his mind. As regards the matter of delay, of course, there has to be a great deal of sifting of claims.  The very fact that there are claims which are not only excessive in the ordinary way of bargaining, but which are grossly and almost fraudulently excessive, take up a great deal of time.  You cannot employ an unlimited staff in these matters.  You cannot employ anybody off the street to deal with them, and there must be delays, but I think a good deal of the work is being got through.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his reply, stated there were some cases that might be considered unfair.  I have a case in mind; I am going to ask him if he considers it unfair.  There was a lady in Millstreet, a Miss O'Mahony, whose house was commandeered, originally by the military. After the military had been there about five months they evacuated it and left it idle for three or four months.  During that time the windows and doors were open, the locks having been smashed.  The wind kept the doors banging day and night.  Finally she had it put into repair, and she was exactly one day in occupation, when it was again commandeered by the Civic Guard.  Since then she has been living with a sister about four or five miles away in the country.  She was awarded £75 compensation for the original occupation and damage done by the military. She has been unable to arrive at any satisfactory arrangement with the Board of Works in regard to the occupation by the Civic Guard.  Finally they decided to offer £4 10s. a month rent.  The house contains four or five rooms, and a shop is attached to it. The lady had been living for years in these particular premises.  She had a small business of the usual huxter's shop kind, dealing in cigarettes, candles and other things.  She claims that for many years she lived completely out of the profits of this shop. And the Board of Works offer her £4 10s. a month for the premises, making <Col N="75" /> no allowance for the loss she has incurred, due to her business being destroyed for the last eighteen months.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he considers that one of the unfair cases, and if it is one of the unfair cases whether he will consider the whole thing with a view to having the lady compensated for her loss of business. I received a reply to a letter of mine from the Board of Works on the 9th June in which they stated that there are no alternative premises for the Civic Guard in Millstreet.  There were some items on the Estimates about repairs having been done to Civic Guard barracks.  I pointed out in a number of letters, extending over the last seven or eight months, that there is an old barracks in Millstreet.  The information I got down there was that it belongs to the Government.  It would not cost more than about £400 to put in proper order for the habitation of the Guards.  Yet they are prepared to spend £3,000 in the repair of a Civic Guard barrack in the vicinity of Dublin. They would not spend £400 on this barrack so that this lady might get back her premises and be able to earn something like a living.  I would like to ask the Minister is he prepared to consider that particular case as an unfair case.</P>

      <P>Just before we report progress, I want to say that I will have that case looked into.  There is no doubt if there was a profit being made out of the shop that compensation should be given for loss of business as apart from the rent of the premises. A barrack, of course, could not be built instantaneously, and there is no discrimination against Cork in the matter of building barracks.</P>

      <P>I would like to say at the outset that it was my intention, <Col N="76" /> until the President stated he would not give any more time to private members, to put down a Motion to discuss the question of the further detention of the prisoners.  As a result of his statement I have to be satisfied with raising the question on the adjournment, but I will not keep the House very long with what I have to say regarding the matter.  Needless to say, I, no more than any other Deputy in the House, am not anxious that any criminal should be released one minute before his time is up.  I recognise full well that on occasions of strife such as we have passed through, from experience I have had in the past, it is certain that a number of undesirables, apart from what you might call the political element, will get into gaols and internment camps.  That is naturally understood, and it takes some time to weed out those.  From the reply of the President to-day it appears there are 123 persons interned.  I am quite satisfied if that list is produced to me or to other Deputies in the House that we could point to seventy or eighty per cent. of these who are well-known to the Deputies and to the people of Ireland not as criminals but as a purely political class.  There may be some very special reason for keeping them interned.  If there is, I certainly would like to know it and have it definitely stated.  I mentioned the case of Austin Stack to-day. I have no brief for him.  I have no doubt that they will be very annoyed to know that I am speaking here for them.  His is the only name I can think of, except De Valera, as a really political case.  I do not know of other individuals at the moment.  It cannot be that the Government are afraid that the release of individuals such as the Stack type will cause any outburst in the country.  If that is the case I must say that they are being wrongly and badly advised.  When one can see the Acting-President of the Republic walking about quite openly and no effort being made to arrest him, surely there cannot be any fear of De Valera or Stack being released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will take the other type of individual who might be classed as a political, the dangerous gunman.  Surely when a man like Frank Carty can wander around quite openly and do <Col N="77" /> even more than that, can even threaten at the present day, without being molested by the forces of the State, there cannot be very much fear that the release of men of that type who are held in prison would cause an outbreak.  Some releases took place nine or ten months ago of men far more dangerous than any man at present interned.  I can back my opinion against any of the member of the Executive Council in what I say.  You had the man who was responsible for the blowing up and the burning of the picture houses in Dublin released nine or ten months ago, while others were kept in.  When I stated it was a shame to have him released, I was told that he was not out by the then responsible Minister, but I knew he was out at the time.  That being so, unless some very definite reason is given to me, I must believe that there is some other reason that has not been stated for keeping in those prisoners than fear of an outbreak.  I can walk through the streets, the same as any of you, and actually see the principal of the I.R.A. in Ireland, the most wanted man of all, walking the streets within thirty yards of this House, four times within a month.  It is not for want of touts, because I can say definitely that there are more touts now in the military intelligence in Dublin than there were at any period of the past two years. If these men can walk about freely, in spite of the fact that these touts are supposed to be looking for them, there is something wrong somewhere.  I suggest in this case it is not the fault of the Executive Council, but rather it is the fault of their advisers.  They are advised that certain men of these 123 should not be released for one reason or another, and they are accepting their advice.  Three weeks ago I intervened for the first time on behalf of a prisoner.  It was the only case in which I was asked to intervene.  I knew from my own personal knowledge that the particular man in question would not kill a fly, and that he never handled a gun in his life.  I knew exactly the suspicion he was in on, because at one time he happened to be employed in the Department for which I was directly responsible.  That <Col N="78" /> man would still be in were it not for the fact that I intervened.  He was probably classed as a dangerous man, or as one who would not be released till the last.  In view of these facts, I think we ought to hear from the Executive Council what is the real reason for detaining the prisoners further. To my mind, there is no fear that is understandable in view of the releases that have already taken place, and in view of the fact that the really dangerous men, if there ever was any danger, are walking about quite openly the streets of Dublin.  I have not the slightest doubt that on yesterday at the meeting in Ballina at which the anti-Treaty candidate was selected, that the anti-Treaty candidate, who is a wanted man, was present, and also that the Acting-President of the Republic was present.  That can happen in a small place like Ballina, and there was no attempt at arrest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the plea of Deputy McGrath in regard to the release of prisoners, with a slightly different note.  I think that it must be evident to the Executive Council that there is a very general desire, backed by a conviction of safety, that there should be detained no longer Prisoners or internees who are kept for political offences.  I think that desire should be met. I think that the Executive Council is more or less clearly convinced that there ought to be a general release. They have released very many during the last two or three months.  I think that is evidence of a desire, at least, not to detain longer out of pure vengeance, but I see no reason at all for detaining men such as those who have been named and persons who are clearly detained because of what has been generally called political activities, or military activities for purely political purposes, and not for self-aggrandisement or for serving personal desires&mdash;I mean such things as theft and crime in the ordinary sense.  I am quite confident in saying that the Dáil would be relieved greatly if the Ministry would freely say to-morrow morning that they have no more prisoners of this character.  The Dáil is backed in this <Col N="79" /> view by the country, from one end to the other, and the country is fretting that the Government are keeping these men so long as they have done.</P>
      <P>Now, the President, this morning, made a remark about certain difficulties in respect to soldiers who had been sentenced for offences more or less in connection with the troubles, and he thought the release of nonmilitary prisoners, that is prisoners who were not members of the Army, would necessitate as a corrollary the release of prisoners who had been sentenced for offences, men who had been members of the Army, and he explained the difficulty from a military disciplinarian point of view.  No doubt, it is a difficulty.  It was the difficulty put forward by the British authority in relation to other prisoners in the same category.  But we pleaded with them, and we pleaded eventually with success.  Can we not, even in the case of these men, do the same thing as was done then, as we then pleaded should be done, and was done eventually by the British authorities? I am convinced that it would be a statesmanlike act, an act that would give a feeling of relief, and it would be looked upon as a commonsense action on the part of the Ministry to make this general release of political prisoners. The continued detention is simply making more and more difficult the position of those who want to strengthen the State; and to retain men because of their official positions in the forces that opposed the State, and detain them, as it seems, as hostages, is anything but satisfactory.  I do urge the Minister&mdash;I think I am unquestionably voicing the general views of the Dáil, and I hope other Deputies will do the same&mdash;that there should be a general release at the very earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexMcCabe" hpid="Mr. McCABE Mr. McCABE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCABE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to what Deputy McGrath and Deputy Johnson have said in regard to the desirability of immediately releasing the men imprisoned.  Some months ago I referred to the question of the Northern internees, and I see most of what I said at that time has been borne out by the events that have recently <Col N="80" /> occurred.  I saw the other day a letter from the Home Office to a Committee for the release of prisoners in County Armagh, and the tenor of the reply was that there were more prisoners interned for political offences in Southern Ireland than there were in the North of Ireland.  They took as an excuse for holding those internees indefinitely the reason that they should not be expected to do what the people of Southern Ireland, who were of the same religion and politics as their internees, were not doing with those they had interned in the South of Ireland.  I think that is one very good reason why there should be a statement made by the President and a decision come to to have all political prisoners in Southern Ireland released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of criminals, I do not think we could, by any stretch of the imagination or any straining of logic, describe such men as De Valera and Austin Stack, and the other leaders, as criminals of the ordinary type, or criminals in any sense of the term.  The fact that all over the country the most dangerous type of revolutionary or Irregular, or whatever you like to call him, is at large, and that he has been at large for some months; that the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order which was sounded some fifteen months ago has been observed, and that no organised disturbance of any kind has occurred since, forms a very good answer to any arguments put forward for keeping those men in indefinitely, on the assumption that their release might mean another revolution.  Now the detention of those men in prison has had, in my opinion, very deplorable effects on the credit of the country.  I believe this country at the present moment is as stable as any other country in Europe or in the world, but the fact that those men are now in prison tends, in my opinion, to spread an impression abroad that we are expecting another revolution, and that the moment we let them out, or trust to chance to release them, we are going to have a repetition of what occurred in 1922.  In my opinion that fact has a lot to do with the depreciation of the Loan and the country's credit at the moment, and it is more than anything else a factor that will weigh with people in investing in <Col N="81" /> this Loan and keeping up our credit. The detention of the prisoners spreads the impression abroad that the country has not definitely settled down from revolution.</P>
    <P>I think we are done with revolution once and for all.  We certainly will have revolutions at some time, because every political organism in the world will revolt.  All parties in Ireland have been seared and burned by the violence and revolution of the last few years, and I do not believe that in this generation you will have any return to the violent methods that were resorted to in 1922.  I would appeal to the President to make a definite announcement on this subject and to tell us here and now that he is going to release leaders such as Stack and de Valera, who cannot be described as criminals in any sense of the term.  Let him make a generous gesture in face of the widespread demand all over the country for the release of those men.</P>
    <P>There is no respect in Ireland for grudging concession, but there is always respect and appreciation for a generous gesture.  If the President makes the generous gesture he will have a very hearty response in return. As regards the question of criminals, I think that could safely be left to a committee of the Dáil to decide as to what individuals amongst the people who are interned belong to the criminal class.  I would suggest that the President would leave it to the committee to decide who are and who are not criminals.</P>

      <P>I want to say that as far as I am concerned any prisoners I was interested in, and any prisoners I have asked the Minister for Defence to release, have been released.  In one instance there were three men undergoing penal servitude, and they have been released.  Notwithstanding that, I think it would be advisable for the Minister for Defence to put his house in order by releasing all political prisoners. He would by doing so show a good example to other Governments and they might also release the prisoners that they have interned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they will follow the good example if you lead the way.  It is time the Government did something in the way of a general release of prisoners.  If they do not release those prisoners very soon they may find themselves slipping in the wrong direction.  Seventy per cent. of the people of the Sáorstat are on the side of the Government, and that is really because so many prisoners are being released.  If the Government release the remaining prisoners I believe they will succeed in gaining the support of another 20 per cent.  Then they would have the support of 90 per cent of the citizens.  In my opinion it would be advisable, not alone charitable, to release all the prisoners, and by an act of that sort our President would show that he is, indeed, the President of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced on the 21st or the 22nd May that we had in prison on the 1st April 941 prisoners. I then stated that the number had been reduced to 616 by the 22nd May.  At the present moment we have 228 interned, and of that number nine, I find, are sentenced prisoners whose sentences are being remitted in full, and there are releases pending in 19 cases.  That brings the number to 200, and of that 200 two are waiting transfer to civil custody.  That brings the number below 200.  Of that number we think that about 70 constitute cases of prisoners whose sentences have been reviewed and <Col N="83" /> are under consideration.  Now, that is a pretty considerable reduction in the number from what it was on the last day I spoke.</P>
      <P>I submit, with great respect to the Dáil, that I have carried out the promise made on the last day, that a very considerable reduction would be made. At that time I was not in the position to estimate a larger reduction than 300 in a month.  The number has actually gone down more than that, and further releases are pending.  Those releases may be from the present moment.  It takes time to cover all the formalities. This particular subject has taken up a very considerable portion of my time and the time of many officials.  I am not in a position to deal with the matter to-day, because there are many issues involved in dealing with the many considerations which it is our duty to pay attention to, just as it would be the duty of Deputy McGrath if he were in my position, or Deputy McCabe if he were the Vice-President.  We have to take into consideration certain circumstances and certain events.  One cannot with a stroke of the pen, or, according to one's judgment, say that this person is a criminal or that person is a criminal. There must be grounds for coming to that conclusion.  There must be a reason, and even in cases where there are reasons for putting a person in that category, there may be reasons now for absolving him from the particular criminal event that occurred.</P>
      <P>All that takes a very considerable time and involves trouble.  We have reduced the number of cases very considerably since the last time I spoke. Possibly before the adjournment I would be in a position to make an announcement on the question, and I can assure Deputy McCabe that nobody is more anxious than I am to see the prisoners out.  It is not correct to say that we have a greater number of internees than there are in the North. They started before we started, and perhaps they will finish having internees after we have finished with them.  I have not stated at any time that Mr. de Valera or Mr. Stack were in the category of criminals.  With regard to one of them, I think there is a recommendation that Mr. Stack should be released.  I think there is.</P>

      <P>Most gracious. You have experience of their graciousness, and I believe you will live to have much more experience of that graciousness. I should say that within a week or possibly within a fortnight I would be in a position to deal with this matter more satisfactorily than I can deal with it to-day.  All I have to say about it is that we have, generally speaking, less than 200 prisoners at present.  A large number of cases are down for consideration and decision as to their removal from the list of internees.  A reference to this matter on the adjournment, particularly at short notice and after a strenuous week, is scarcely reasonable, and it is unreasonable to expect that I would be in a position to make a satisfactory statement.</P>

      <P>Would the President give some statement of his policy or some information in regard to men like de Valera and Austin Stack?  Is he going to keep them in for life, or when is he going to release them?  We want to have that one way or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated that I would be able to deal more satisfactorily with the subject of the prisoners in a week, or in a fortnight, at the outset. I have never stated that it was my intention to keep the particular individuals referred to in for life, nor have I stated that any political prisoner would be kept in for life.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will expedite payment of the sum of £52 0s. 8d. due to Mr. Michael Bergin, Connolly Street, Nenagh, for goods supplied to the Military Canteen at Nenagh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Canteen at Nenagh Barracks is run not by military but by civilian contractors.  At the time the goods in question were supplied the contractors were Messrs. A. Dunne and Company, of Burgh Quay, Dublin.  The goods were therefore supplied by Mr. Bergin to that firm and not to the Army.  In the circumstances his account is not one for payment by the Department of Defence and Mr. Bergin was informed accordingly on the 17th instant.</P>
