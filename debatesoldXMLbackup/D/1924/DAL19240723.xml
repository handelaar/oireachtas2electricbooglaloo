      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Deputy Peadar O hAodha on 23rd February, of last year.  All applications by civil servants alleging that they were victimised by the British Government on account of their national sympathies and activities have been brought before the Advisory Committee referred to, and reinstatement has been offered in all cases in which the Committee so advised. As I stated in my previous answer, the Government decided that no payment can be made in respect of loss of salary for the period of dismissal or by way of compensation for loss of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is also being accepted.  Sub-section 2, Section 16, provides that a special licence may be granted to a creamery to bring on the premises butter, which is not Irish <Col N="1957" /> creamery butter, and it was previously pointed out that while any such licence is current the creamery should not be allowed to use the national brand.  We debated that at length when the Bill was re-committed.  The suggestion was made by Deputy Heffernan, but we did not come to any final decision, and I promised to consider the matter.  I now agree that the amendment is desirable. If this amendment is adopted no creamery can bring in other than Irish creamery butter and at the same time use the Irish national brand.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16 to add at the end of Section 19 a new paragraph (e) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Butter to which the word `creamery' has been applied, or which is described as, or represented to be `creamery butter' or which is contained in packages marked with the word `creamery' or any colourable imitation of the word `creamery' shall not be packed for sale, or sold or offered or consigned for sale or for export from the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been looking through the Bill as amended, and the purpose of this is to prevent a butter factory purchasing a consignment of creamery butter, bringing it into the creamery, taking the wrappers off it, blending it with factory butter, repacking it, and then sending it out.  I have not been able to find any effective safeguard in the Bill against such a thing, and I think <Col N="1958" /> it is a point which requires some consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Milroy reads sub-section 2 of Section 42 he will find it covers the point which he wishes to have covered, and I would point out to him if his amendment were accepted, it would prevent the owner of a butter factory from purchasing creamery butter, and from re-blending and selling it, even without the word `creamery.&rdquo;  That would prevent the owner of a butter factory from buying creamery butter, re-blending it, and then selling it as factory butter, because it is butter to which the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; has been applied.  The Deputy's purpose has been covered by sub-section 2 of 42.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the assurance from the Minister.  I had already studied that sub-section, and I can see the weakness of the drafting of the amendment.  The defect in that sub-section as it stands is that there is no guarantee that such an operation will be detected at all, and what is stated here as the product using the word creamery, would be using a false trade description.  There is no evidence there, as far as I can see, that the operation would be detected, and where it is impossible to detect such an operation, the best thing is definitely to prohibit it.  That is the defect.  I quite see that my own amendment is defective in some ways, but that is the defect in that particular sub-section, that there is no guarantee that this illegitimate operation would be detected.  I do not wish to press the amendment if the Minister says the contentions I made are met in this.</P>

      <P>In page 21, before Section 31, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) The Minister may by order make regulations prescribing the nature and general character of the plant and machinery with which premises registered in any specified register kept in pursuance of this <Col N="1959" /> Act (other than the register of non-manufacturing exporters) are to be equipped in addition to or substitution for all or any of the plant and machinery with which such premises are required by or under any other provision of this Act to be equipped.</P>
    <P>(2) All premises registered in any of the registers aforesaid shall be equipped with the plant and machinery with which such premises are required by or under any other provision of this Act to be equipped, with such (if any) additions thereto or substitutions therefor as may for the time being be prescribed under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment meets the objections that were made to the amendment previously suggested. It makes it quite clear that the provision can only be made as to the general character of the machinery, and obviates any possibility of misuse of the powers which the Department has under the Bill on the lines of prescribing the machine of any particular manufacture.  The only regulations that can be made under that are regulations of a general nature prescribing the general character of the machinery. It was agreed in Special Committee that it would be necessary that the Ministry should have power to vary the Schedule, or to substitute other machinery for the machinery prescribed in the Schedule.  The only point at issue was whether the Ministry should be in a position to prescribe definite specific machinery, say, the machinery of one as against another manufacturer, or of one particular type of machine as against another.  This amendment empowers us merely to make regulations as to the nature and general character of the machinery.</P>
      <P>Amendment put, and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the new section be added to the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on the changes introduced into the Bill since <Col N="1960" /> it was drafted.  A new class has been introduced, and this amendment is to meet that particular class.</P>

      <P>I think this is a reasonable amendment. The sub-section as it stands means that even though this Dáil may annual some of these regulations the decisions taken prior to that annulment would still remain in force.  I think that is rather a dangerous provision, and I suggest that the words &ldquo;but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulations&rdquo; be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that amendment under any circumstances. This particular sub-section of Section 45 is common form; it is inserted in every Bill; it is common to every Bill which we have introduced up to the present time.  It provides that the regulations shall be made and laid on the Table of each House, and may be annulled within 21 days by either House.  It must be remembered that it is within 21 sitting days that the annulment may take place, but it is to be &ldquo;without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulations.&rdquo;  If Deputy Milroy's amendment were accepted it would mean that the Ministry could not possibly take the risk of making regulations and acting on them, in face of the warning that if the House thinks fit not to endorse the regulations they might leave themselves open to penalties. In any event they would have to reverse the whole policy.  It should be made quite clear that if the urgency of the situation demanded it they should have power to make such regulations as they thought necessary, and should be in a position to go ahead and put them into operation, and they should not be faced with a threat, that either House failing within twenty-one days to endorse the regulations, they might leave themselves open to penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1961" /> Deputies will have to remember that the Seanad might not meet for, say, three months.  The Seanad does not meet as regularly as the Dáil.  We cannot say how often the Seanad or the Dáil will meet five or six or seven years hence.  There may be an interval of three months during which one of the Houses might not meet; and if the amendment were accepted, it might mean that the Department, after making regulations, would have to sit down and do nothing until after the Seanad and the Dáil had met.  There is no particular reason why we should make an exception in this case.  The Deputy has not suggested any particular reason why, if the regulations in this Bill, as in every other Bill, are to be laid before the two Houses, the form that is being followed in regard to every other Bill, should not be applied here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Deputy may be attained in another way.  There are two forms regarding regulations made by a Minister and laid before the Dáil and Seanad.  One is the form in which it is essential that there should be the conclusion contained in this sub-section. To that Deputy Milroy objects.  The other form provides that the Minister should make regulations, but that they should not come into operation until they are approved of.  It is by the adoption of that form that Deputy Milroy would get what he wants.  The procedure might be to delete the sub-section altogether and put it in the other form which provides that the Minister may make regulations, that he must submit them to the two Houses, and that they do not become operative until they are approved of.</P>

      <P>I think that would be much the better way, because I can quite see that it would be a rather serious decision for this House to annul any regulations that may have been made.  There should be very strong grounds for taking such action.  But it seems to be a rather serious state of affairs that if this Dáil came to the conclusion that a regulation did a serious wrong or injury to any person or service, that yet such a regulation should continue to have force.  I think <Col N="1962" /> the way that has been suggested by you, A Chinn Comhairle, of getting the regulations operative, is the better alternative.</P>

      <P>Deputies seem to be amused at the suggestion that this is a compromise.  Obviously the clause as it stands is objectionable from a great many points of view&mdash;a rigid halfpenny without any elasticity whatever, without any opportunity of going above it or below it under any circumstances. If instead of one halfpenny you had sixpence, there would be some chance of cutting it down, and of providing a smaller fee by regulation; but as to simply prescribing a halfpenny under all circumstances, a rigid regulation of that kind is undoubtedly objectionable. Deputy Johnson and other Deputies may suggest that I fell into that very error myself in the original draft of the Bill.  I did.  I quite admit it.  I am quite well aware now that it would have been better to leave some discretion in the matter.  I admit that. This Bill has been changed in a great many respects.  In a great many respects it has been left, I may say, to a free vote in the Dáil; and it certainly has been improved by that particular process.  While on the first draft of the Bill I myself inserted the provision which was just as rigid as this, I am quite convinced on consideration of the <Col N="1963" /> matter that that was a mistake.  Apart altogether from the amount of the fee, it is a mistake to have it rigid.</P>

      <P>The administration of this Bill will cost £16,000, nearer to £18,000.  That is not due to any mistakes in calculation at the beginning, but is due to the fact that amendments have been inserted which have thrown more duty on the Ministry.  These amendments mean far more inspection, and as the Bill has been debated it has become quite plain that more inspection will be necessary from many points of view and for a great many reasons.  I am satisfied myself that it will take about £18,000 to administer this Bill.  One halfpenny would bring in about £4,000.  My suggestion, if the maximum fee were charged, would bring in £8,000.  One penny on every 28 lbs. is about 1d. on every two guineas on the turnover, or one-fifth of a penny per cent.  That is the fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>One and sixpence per pound, the average for last year.  Certainly the price is not too high.  Deputies should remember that that is what the dispute is about, as to whether the fees under this Bill should be one-fifth of a penny per cent. or one penny on every two guineas, that is 4s. on every £100 of turnover.  I suppose it will take ten minutes to debate this, and every Deputy knows that the difference between £4,000 and £8,000 on a trade of £4,000,000, which with anything like efficiency should develop into a trade of £8,000,000, is not worth talking about.  Deputies may say, &ldquo;If that is so why not accept the £4,000 &rdquo;? Simply because farmers should realise that they ought to pay a fair contribution towards the expenses of the Act, <Col N="1964" /> the sole purpose of which is to increase their trade and to increase their wealth. This particular clause will get more debate not only here but amongst the creameries and amongst trade generally than any other clause, and yet it is the least important clause in the Bill. I challenge any Deputy to say that is not the fact&mdash;that it is the least important clause&mdash;but that is the way we have of looking at things.  We concentrate on the unessentials and ignore the essentials.  Here we are arguing about some £4,000 on a trade which is worth £4,000,000 and which should be worth £8,000,000.  There certainly will be more argument, debate and contention about this £4,000 than all the measures which are to be taken in a Bill which we hope will double the trade.  I do not want to pander to that point of view.  I think anyone who has the interests of the country at heart should get up and tell those concerned the truth, and the truth is that this difference of £4,000 does not matter compared with the immense benefits that the Bill, if properly and efficiently worked, is going to confer on the trade.  I am willing to meet the trade on any of the other clauses, and I am willing to discuss with them any of the contentious and highly important issues that arise on the Bill.  It is absurd that the interests of the trade should apparently be concentrated entirely on a comparatively unimportant detail like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say for Deputy Gorey that he went down and bearded the lions in their dens, and told them clearly what every go-ahead farmer knows, that this 4d. on every cwt. does not matter, but what matters is to do their business better. Deputy Johnson is fond of reading lectures occasionally to people, telling them what they ought to do, and I should like to read him a little lecture as some return for the various lectures he has given to me.  I want Deputy Johnson to say what he knows is right about this matter&mdash;all the farmers of Ireland are not on these Benches.  He is constantly advising them as to what they should do and should not do.  I want him to say here what he knows to be perfectly correct, that this charge does not matter and is of no importance compared with the other provisions of the Bill, and that the difference <Col N="1965" /> between £4,000 and £8,000 on a turnover of £4,000,000 which may develop into £8,000,000, is of no importance. What they ought to concentrate on really is to co-operate with the Ministry in carrying out the provisions of the Bill, and making it work efficiently.  He knows that is true, and I ask him to support me in this matter here and now.  I might mention that this is the exact fee that we charge under the Bill.  It is little less than the fee we charge under the Egg Bill.  The fee under that Bill is 1d. on every £2 worth of eggs, and in the case of this Bill it is one penny for every two guineas worth of butter.  There are half a dozen organisations in the egg trade, and every one of them, without exception, have agreed that that is a fair charge, and the people connected with a few organisations in the butter trade agreed that this is a fair charge. They were even suggesting that it should be increased.  Some of these suggestions that the charge should be increased may have been for reasons not stated, but which we may suspect, but they all agreed that it is a fair charge.  The average turnover, if you can deal in averages, would be about £10,000.  I ask the Dáil to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support strongly the Minister for Agriculture. Here we are haggling unduly and unfairly. By this Bill we hope to reach, at all events, the price of the Danish butter, and, roughly speaking, the price of the Danish butter is 20/- a cwt. over that of Irish butter.  It means, at all events, that we aim by this Bill to increase the value of our butter by over 2d. per pound.  What is the cost at which this result is to be realised?  It is .038 of a penny per lb., against the 2d. per lb. increase that we hope to realise.  Any person except Deputy Johnson would agree, and I do not wish to be in any way rude, that this is a distinct advantage to Ireland.  If we are not going to gain a serious advantage by raising the standard of our butter, we do not require a Bill at all. Then why do we discuss the whole Bill? In our humble-mindedness we think that we will not gain more than 20/- but we may gain 30/-; even if we only <Col N="1966" /> gain 20/-, and come up to the Danish standard, we are going to gain that 2d. per lb.</P>
      <P>We are haggling over .038, a thing that is so small that we can hardly see it.  There are a few creamery managers who may think that £25 does not matter.  They would sooner gain £25, or have their overhead charges £25 under what is estimated every year, and produce a bad butter, than get twenty shillings a hundredweight more.  That does not matter.  We are equivocating with regard to this.  We are going to discuss a gain of 2d. per pound in butter at a loss of .038.  The difference is so great that we are hardly able to subtract .038 from 2d.  I beg heartily to support the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment.  From the Minister's point of view of the value of the butter exported, the fees may seem light, but you must also consider the very low price the farmers receive for milk. Last year they received an average of 6?d. per gallon, a very small price, notwithstanding that all profits retained by the creameries on their capital were a little over a half per cent.  There is no margin left in the business on which any further burden can be placed without running the grave risk of the smaller creameries being knocked out with the consequence that they would be replaced by stores.  Consequently there would be less employment for the rural workers.  At the present price of milk it does not pay to send it any considerable distance to a creamery, and in my opinion the fees should be left as they are until the farmers reap the results of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I am quite certain, is very anxious that this Bill should run smoothly, and he desires to get the general assistance of the farmers in regard to its working, with a view to the improvement of the butter trade.  It is because of that that I oppose the amendment.  I suppose the Minister would agree that it is a bad practice to turn down committees. Usually when we have passed amendments in a Committee Stage the Dáil supports and confirms the amendment. Now the Minister comes forward and asks us to refute what was done in Committee.  I ask the Dáil to agree with the Committee and to leave the Bill as it stands in this respect.  The halfpenny per 28lbs. applies to all butter that is exported, not merely to creamery butter.  It is hoped that the effect of the Bill will be to improve the quality of the butter, improve its standing in the British market, and improve its relative position as compared with the Danish and other imported butters.  But that is not going to be a very quick process.  It is going to be imperceptible.  It will not be recognised perhaps at all by anybody until in a general way there will be an assertion.  &ldquo;Well, we are at least equal to the Danish,&rdquo; and it may be that a considerable section of the population will agree that the result has been obtained by the action of this legislation. But if you want easy working I say that you ought not to put in these small obstacles which will be of so little value in cash.  You want to save for the State a maximum sum of £4,000, that is between the halfpenny and the penny, and for the sake of £4,000 you are going to irritate a very large number of people interested in the butter trade.  I would say that it would be better still to abolish this fee altogether, and that for the sake of £8,000 you are much more likely to <Col N="1968" /> get the general assent, the goodwill, and the assistance of the trade.  Bear in mind that for a couple of years exporters will have to pay this fee, without realising any benefit.  They will not see that there is any benefit.  They will be told by people who are undertaking the role of lecturers to the farmers, that if they look ahead their prices will be advanced and they will get better value in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, they are to pay this penny per quarter.  I say that you are increasing difficulties for the Government and for the administration.  You know that the Bill is not enthusiastically received by considerable, closely interested sections, and they will have to be persuaded that it is going to be valuable to them.  In my opinion, it will be better to forego the total £8,000 rather than to add this little irritant in the working of this machine. I think the benefits that will accrue will be much more easily attained by having no such imposition.  I believe that the irritation will be only half as much if the Bill is kept as it emerged from Committee, and that only one halfpenny is charged as a maximum.  It is for these reasons that I think the amendment ought not to be accepted. If you could go to the farmers and say: &ldquo;You, the individual farmer, are sending so many gallons of milk to the creamery which has to be turned into butter, and you will get the benefit in the price of your milk&rdquo;&mdash;if you could demonstrate to him that he was going to get a personal benefit, no doubt you would have no opposition.  But you cannot do that.  You are dealing with institutions, and the managers of those institutions will be asked to give accounts to their suppliers of their busines, and they will point to the various charges.  They will point to this charge of a penny per quarter, and it will be put into the indictment against the administration of this Bill.  The manager may be opposed to the Bill; he may say that it is not satisfactory; that it is not going to do any good, and he will simply use its monetary effect amongst the suppliers as an illustration of the inutility of this Bill.  He will say that it is not doing any good, but that it is costing them a penny per quarter.  I say that it is not worth it, and it would <Col N="1969" /> be very much better to abandon this charge altogether.  Certainly the increase from a halfpenny to a penny will add to the difficulties of the administration of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the passage of the Bill in Committee was left to a free vote, and that it was improved by that process.  I hope the Minister will have the good sense to see that the Bill will get the same chance in its final stages, and that the decision on this amendment will be left to a free vote of the Dáil. If the Minister desires that it should be amended and improved as much as possible, I think he will follow the course pursued so far.  This is all a question of £4,000, and the question is whether the State shall pay this £4,000 or whether a particular branch of the farming industry shall be taxed to pay it.  The Minister's argument amounts to something like this: that because there is to be an improvement and an increased income for the dairy farmers they should pay the greater portion of the tax that is to bring this improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Johnson that it would be much better if the Minister abolished this charge altogether.  If he is not prepared to do that he ought to be prepared to do the next best thing; and the Minister should not forget that this Bill is certainly giving the Department authority to interfere in private business&mdash;a very considerable authority and going very far indeed.  We accept that because we recognise that perhaps it is inevitable at this stage, but if the State is to interfere, the State should not tax those people whose business they are interfering in, for the right to interfere&mdash; tax them to a higher extent and the State to pay a lower proportion.  It is not a fair or just basis.  The interference is all on the part of the State.  We are not questioning the right of the State to interfere at this juncture, but if the State does take such a step it is the business of the State to pay, at least, the greater proportion of the sum that is required to enable the State to interfere.  It is all right for the Minister to argue that the <Col N="1970" /> dairying industry will benefit and that the farmers who will have increased revenues, should pay the bigger portion of the tax contribution, but when will the benefit come and will the benefit come to all?  Now, I do say there are dairying concerns in this country to-day that will not benefit very considerably from the passing into law of this measure.  There are concerns which are producing an article of as high a standard as they will produce under this Bill and which are to-day getting as good a market as they will have when the Bill is law, from the improvements which we hope will be in existence for other concerns, and yet these concerns, some of them the most prosperous in the country, with the biggest turn-over, will pay a tax to bring about improvements in other concerns.  That is the position and after all if the Minister agrees that this industry should pay in order that there may be improvements in the industry itself, and believes that is fair and just, I do suggest that it would be much fairer for the State to contribute their portion for the right to interfere with some concerns and not to put a heavy tax on other businesses that will not benefit very much, if at all, by the passing of this measure.  Deputy Beamish talked about .038 of a penny per pound as being the amount of the tax. While it is true that some of the concerns will have to pay, the butter factors particularly will be in the fortunate position of being able to pass on the tax to the farmers from whom they will procure the butter.  These businesses will not pay; the farmers will pay everything.  Many of our cooperative creameries, as Deputy Hogan said, are in an unsatisfactory condition and the money will have to come out of their pockets before any of it will come in.  Along with that, the Minister must recognise that none of the improvements he hopes for can be brought about without a further very considerable expenditure on the part of a great many creamery concerns.  They have all got to proceed at once to instal machinery, perhaps in some of them, complete fittings, in others, parts, but many of them will have to instal at considerable expense portions of new machinery.  That will be a further <Col N="1971" /> handicap on their trade.  The Minister may suggest that a penny on 28 pounds will not be very much but that, along with further difficulties they will have to meet in procuring new machinery that will enable them to benefit&mdash;if there is to be a benefit as I hope there is&mdash;will be a serious handicap and the Minister would be well advised if he is not prepared to accept Deputy Johnson's suggestion to withdraw the charge altogether, at least to accept the Bill as it is passed through Committee.  If he is not prepared to do that the least he should do is to give the Bill the same chance it has been given so far and to leave it to a free vote of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment.  I do not know whether Deputy Gorey's announcement on the industry can be taken as infallible, but I doubt if the Minister would have called attention to it unless he said something with which he agrees himself. This was very much discussed in Committee and the majority of the Committee opposed the Minister then. I hope the majority of the Dáil will agree with the Committee.  Those who have studied this Bill and analysed its provisions will recognise that it has about as comprehensive a scheme of interference with private business as it is possible to condense in a measure. The arguments I used in Committee I propose to refer to again because they still hold good.  This Bill only stops short of nationalisation of the industry. There is not a single person connected with the industry who is not met with some aspect of officialdom somewhere in every phase of every department.  This is not being done for that very altruistic purpose that the Minister would like us to believe, that is, making more profits for the people in the industry.  Nothing of the kind.  I think that would be a most illegal operation for the State to engage in.  This comprehensive scheme of supervision and interference is mildly directed rather to the advantage and safeguarding of the public than to the advantage of the industry itself. It is rather a curious doctrine to preach that the industry must bear the cost of the administration of the <Col N="1972" /> statute.  We might adopt that theory and be landed into a most peculiar situation.  The licensed trade would have to pay for the administration of the Liquor Act, and so on.  Take factory laws, which were for the securing of proper conditions of work and the safeguarding against accidents&mdash;the particular industry concerned would have to bear the cost of the administration of the Factory Act if this principle that the Minister enunciates is accepted. As some Deputy has said, there is considerable doubt amongst those who are concerned in this industry as to the value of the measure to the industry, very considerable doubt, and very emphatic opinions are expressed that the industry will get no benefit whatever and that the only result will be to have an additional crop of officials interfering with the course of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly there are some enterprises connected with this industry that will not receive any advantage. They have an excellent market, and the quality of their products will not be improved by this measure.  Yet they will have to bear the heavy costs under this Bill.  I oppose this amendment. I would like to know who is responsible for the particular fee that the Minister urges us to accept.  Is it fixed after consultation with those who are representative of the industry, or is this the expression of the official mind pure and simple?  The Minister may say that it is only a very insignificant tax, but it may in some cases be like the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  This is not the only expense that will be put upon the industry as a result of this measure.  The regulations that they will have to comply with will mean a considerable expenditure of money for the equipping of the dairies or premises and the putting of them into a suitable condition. It is not fair when the State takes such a sweeping measure of control over the industry that that particular industry should be compelled to foot the bill for the carrying out of that interference which the industry itself has not sought.  It cannot be said that this Bill is the outcome of a demand from the industry.  If it has any objective <Col N="1973" /> at all, this Bill is for the protection of the public interests, and the public have the right to pay for that which safeguards them.  I know the Minister's reply will be that he is glad to hear Deputy Milroy say that anything that benefits the farmers should be paid for by the general taxpayer.  That is the contention he put forward before&mdash; a most fallacious one.  I say it is the general body of the community that will really benefit by this measure, not the industry itself.  It is doubtful, I say, if the industry itself will profit much from it at all, but the general body of the community will profit by it, and it is they who should pay for the expense of the administration.</P>

This Bill was brought in expressly for doing a good turn to the English consumer.  It is a lamentable position that Deputy Milroy is driven to in order to defend his attitude to this amendment, but I must say it is just about as rational as the position of some other Deputies in the matter.

It is unimportant as compared with any of the benefits that may be conferred by other sections of the Bill.  Not a single Deputy addressed himself to the merits.  They all took up an entirely different line.  Even though it was unimportant, even though it did not matter, they asked what would the farmers think about it? Deputy Johnson went so far as to point out that even though this charge is extremely small, it is irksome.  Farmers, we are told, will not like it.  They have to pay out money; for that reason we would drop the charge if we were wise. That doctrine may be all very fine; but where does its lead?  It might be all right if we were considering this measure alone and if we were perfectly certain that we would not have similar measures in other directions afterwards. Are we, on this particular Bill, to adopt the principle not to charge any industry any fees for any benefits that may be conferred on that particular industry by any legislation?  That is what it comes to.  If Deputy Johnson is correct, then the same principle will apply to the Egg Bill, to any Bill that is brought in for the purpose of regulating the bacon trade, to any similar Bill introduced for the purpose of standardising produce by another Minister.  Nothing is to be charged. Do Deputies think that is sound?  Do they realise where that will lead them if carried to its logical conclusion?  I will not put it any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard, to my surprise, for the first time that this was simply interference by the State for the pleasure of interference. I remember having been asked by Deputies from every party in the Dáil as to when the Bill would be introduced and what the reasons <Col N="1975" /> were for the delay in introducing it. The farmer Deputies were very much interested in it.  They wanted to know why this Bill was not introduced long ago.  Similarly, I was asked from the Labour benches as to why the Bill was not introduced.  The same questions were put to me from the benches of the party which supports the Government. Now, I learn that this measure is simply a gratuitous piece of interference on the part of the State with a particular industry.  I learn that for the first time.  All this sort of argument is used for the purpose of dealing with this extremely small charge on the industry for the benefits it is believed the Bill will confer.  For the last four years practically every organisation connected with the industry has been asking for the Bill.  The creamery managers have asked for a Bill.  They suggested a different type of Bill, but a Bill that would give the Department of Agriculture at least as much power of interference.  The Farmers' Union asked for this Bill, and pointed out the necessity of it. The I.A.O.S. pointed out the necessity for a similar Bill.  Every organisation of farmers asked for a Bill.  There may have been differences in detail between them but they all asked for a Bill regulating the trade, and regulating it just as much as this Bill proposes to do.  Now, I learn that this is purely a wanton act on the part of the Minister for Agriculture, that he simply loves to interfere with trade, and that the Bill is not going to do any benefit to the trade.  That is the sort of argument put up to support opposition to this amendment.  Deputy Baxter wants to know will we leave this question to the free vote of the House.  Deputy Baxter should have addressed himself to the merits of the question.  He is in the happy position that he is not on the <Col N="1976" /> Government benches and hence can afford to have all the advantages of opposing this halfpenny in the pound.</P>

      <P>He kept very far away from the merits, and the point of view is to let one party take all the disadvantages and all the odium, if there is any&mdash;and I do not believe there is any &mdash;of doing the right thing and they will take all the rest of the advantages.</P>
      <P>I do not want to pander to the point of view of the farmer who believes he should never put any fertilizers on his land, because he would have to spend money on them, that he should never make any improvements in connection with his holding, because he would have to spend a certain amount of money, and that he should never add to the equipment of his farm, because it means the spending of money.  That is the point of view behind the opposition to this amendment.  That is the point of view of many farmers in the country.  The sooner they get away from that point of view, look at their business rationally as business men, and think of their business along the lines of getting a good return for the money spent, the better.  Deputies who have the interest of the farmers at heart should endeavour to turn their point of view in that direction&mdash;to show that money well spent and economically spent, after full consideration, may be well worth spending and may be far better for their business than keeping that money in their pockets.  If any Deputy has the interest of the farmers at heart, that is the point of view he should put to them, and I would have expected more support on this amendment than I have got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to move a reduction of this Vote by £1,000.  My purpose in doing this is to give an opportunity to the Dáil either to receive a satisfactory explanation or to enter its protest against a course of conduct of the Army administration and the Executive Council in respect of what has become known as the Kenmare case.  It is about the most unpleasant duty that one could take up, but I believe that it is a duty and that the Dáil would be guilty of condoning wrong-doing if we did not either get a satisfactory explanation or make known our protest and opposition to the course of conduct which I want to deal with.</P>
      <P>There has been published during the last few days in a newspaper which is widely circulated&mdash;&ldquo;Eire&rdquo;&mdash;a statement regarding the Kenmare case.  So far as I know it is the first time any particulars have been made public, any allegations have been published regarding this matter.  In the Report of the Army Inquiry Committee there are references to the Kenmare case, as there are references to the Mayo case.  The references to the Kenmare case are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It was suggested that the late Adjutant-General condoned or connived at insubordination by failing to punish it in the case of highly placed officers.  The principal instance was the Kenmare case.  In dealing with that the Adjutant-General strictly followed the advice of his legal adviser, the Judge Advocate-General. He put the case in train for a Courtmartial, and he was no party to dropping the proceedings.</P>
      <P>General Mulcahy accepted full responsibility for the decision to drop the Kenmare case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our opinion this was a grave error of judgment on his part.  It did not contribute to the mutiny, but it did militate against discipline generally by encouraging suspicion <Col N="1979" /> in the minds of officers and others that the Army Authorities were disposed to hush up charges against persons high in authority.</P>
    <P>Apparently information was given to the Committee of Inquiry in regard to this case.  The evidence which was adduced to the Committee was not published, and the only information regarding it appears in the speech of Deputy General Mulcahy made during the discussion of the Army Inquiry Report on the 17th June, in which he explained that the Kenmare case was sent to the late Attorney-General for decision, and that he gave his decision in a long statement as the result of his examination&mdash;</P>
    <P>That there was no shred of evidence against Major-General O'Daly, who, it was alleged, was mixed up in this case, and that there was no shred of evidence against the second officer, and that there was only a shadow of evidence against the third. He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>And it will not appear that the parties who had a grievance in this particular case were advised that there were not sufficient grounds for the State to take up a prosecution, and that, if they considered well of it, they had the law courts to go to in this particular case.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that discussion, the newspaper has made certain charges purporting to give the facts about this case.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>What actually took place in Kenmare was that two daughters of a well-known and highly-respected medical practitioner at an evening entertainment frankly gave their opinion of some of the performances of Free State troops.</P>
    <P>... That night four Free State officers forced their way into the doctor's house, dragged these two girls from their beds in their night attire, hauled them out into the garden, there flogged them with their belts, and, not even satisfied with that, afterwards smeared their hair with cart-grease.  Next morning investigation took place into the circumstances of this disgusting outrage, and Lieut. N. Harrington, a son of <Col N="1980" /> the late Mr. T. Harrington, M.P., found in the grounds where the scourging took place a revolver which he identified as belonging to Brigadier-General O'Daly.  One of the young ladies in defending herself had also left ample identification marks on the face of one of her assailants.</P>
    <P>... a deputation which, we believe, included the Free State solicitor, journeyed to Dublin to place the facts before the responsible Government Department, and it happened that in the train with them was the officer whose scratched cheeks bore convincing testimony of his chivalry when dealing with defenceless girls. The complaint was made in the first instance to the Minister for Home Affairs, and General Mulcahy was sent for, informed of the allegations made, and requested to place under arrest the subaltern who had come to Dublin on leave.  General Mulcahy undertook to do so, but when inquiry was made after a lapse of a week it was found that he had done nothing...  The matter came before the Executive Council, and they decided that a courtmartial of the officers implicated should take place. That tribunal was fixed to meet locally on a certain date, and all the arrangements for the hearing were made...  On the eve of the day appointed for the opening of the proceedings all the persons connected with the Army who were to give evidence were seized and whisked away to distant parts of the country. When the courtmartial met there was no one to give evidence, and the whole thing collapsed.</P>
    <P>These are the allegations without any of the comments.  I have no particular reason for putting faith in the story printed in this paper but it is quite clear from the report of the Army Inquiry Committee and the comments of Deputy Mulcahy that very serious matters were under consideration.  It seems to be undoubted that two ladies were maltreated and that the persons who maltreated them were either soldiers of the army, or persons posing as soldiers, and in the uniform of soldiers.  It also appears that charges <Col N="1981" /> in regard to this, and certain information was placed at the disposal of the Executive Council and the Army authorities, and that some kind of examination took place..</P>
    <P>It is said in defence of that inaction that the legal advisers decided that there was not sufficient evidence to bring the matter to the courts.  But this allegation that the witnesses who were to have given evidence were dispersed and made not available, is, to my mind one that will have to be answered.  I want to know, and I think the Dáil should require to know, what has been done to these ladies who were maltreated.  Have they been left to their own discretion as to whether they should bring a charge against some person or persons unknown into court?  It is admitted by the Executive Council that soldiers did maltreat them, and has any regret or apology or other action been taken to disown and denounce on behalf of the Executive Council the action of any person who was a soldier?  Is the Ministry of Defence satisfied that there was no evidence against the persons who were charged or are alleged to have been implicated in this offence?  Is the Executive Council satisfied that there was no case made, and can we have information as to what was done in the matter &mdash;and why action was not taken&mdash; whether it was the mere absence of sufficient evidence to ensure a conviction that deterred the Executive Council from taking action?  Were the officers concerned allowed to remain within the Army for long after this incident, and if so, was it because the Executive Council were satisfied that there were no grounds for the allegations? If there were grounds for the allegations but not sufficiently satisfactory from the point of view of legal evidence, will those officers be now in the position of every other officer who is demobilised in regard to pensions, for instance?  I do not know whether we have a right to consider that the charges have been sustained, but presumably not, inasmuch as there have been no prosecutions.  It appears from the facts brought out in the Army report, or at least from the references to certain matters which are made in the Army report, that this was a <Col N="1982" /> serious case in the eyes of the Ministry, and considerable notice was taken of it inasmuch as not only did the Judge-Advocate-General advise in the matter but the Attorney-General also. It is quite evident that very serious notice was taken of the charge.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary that we should have a full and complete statement from the Minister responsible as to the facts, and as to the position of the Executive Council and the position of the Ministry for Defence in this matter.  We should be told what is the truth relating to this charge, that the witnesses who were to be called to give evidence in the matter were not available and were dispersed prior to the hearing.  The refusal of the Ministry to publish first the report of the Chairman, and secondly the evidence, makes it imperative upon us in view of the publicity that has been given to this story, the first statement that I have seen in any detail, either to get a satisfactory explanation or to make as emphatic a protest as we can at the inaction of the Executive Council or of the Ministry of Defence in the matter. I hope it will be possible for the Minister for Defence to clear my mind at any rate of the thought that there has been a hushing-up and a refusal to do in this case what would have been done if the persons concerned had been ordinary civilians in an ordinary criminal case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case which has been referred to by Deputy Johnson and by other Deputies as the Kenmare case, the Executive Council had it under consideration, or rather, they had under consideration some allegations concerning this case and all relevant files and documents were sent to the Attorney-General for his advice. The Executive Council acted on that advice, and there the responsibility of the Executive Council began and ended.  If the Executive Council do not take the advice of their Law Adviser they have got to get rid of him. In this case they took his advice and they do not intend and will not publish the advice that was given to them <Col N="1983" /> on that occasion.  The Army Inquiry Committee had this case before them, and they did not get the Attorney-General's advice and were informed by that matters such as that would not be disclosed and that I would take myself personal responsibility for refusing to disclose confidential matters coming before the Executive Council. The allegations that are made in a journal such as this, in &ldquo;Eire,&rdquo; bring to my mind an incident that happened in the life of the greatest man who ever lived, where certain allegations were made against a certain person. When the virtues of those who made the charges were written in the sand, there was no accuser for that person, and I think the very same thing might apply to the authors or the editor or the owners of the business engaged in the production of this particular journal.</P>

      <P>I would like to assist the President in this matter to this extent: to state definitely that the most exhaustive inquiries were made in the matter by very responsible officers.  It seems that Deputy Johnson is stressing the point in connection <Col N="1984" /> with the collection of information in the matter.  That is quite in keeping with the whole trend of the article in &ldquo;Eire&rdquo;&mdash;to say that the witnesses were made to disappear and were not available when the court of inquiry sat on the matter.  That is utterly untrue. A most exhaustive inquiry was made and a complete verbatim report of every scrap of evidence that could be given in the case was made.  The whole of that evidence, as well as the opinion of the Judge-Advocate-General and of the Military Authorities generally was before the Attorney-General when he made his summing-up of the case and gave his advice.</P>

I want to know if the Executive Council invited any statement from the parties concerned in this scandalous case.  I would also like to know how does the Minister regard as confidential a matter of this kind when it is generally known, and I have been told it is generally known all over the County Kerry&mdash;that is the details in connection with this particular incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to answer that question.  The parties who had complained in the matter, and all the witnesses they desired to bring forward, came forward and gave formal evidence before two very definite sittings of courts.  One was held by the police authorities in an irregular way, but it was a very definite sitting and a very definite taking of what was alleged to be evidence, and another was a court set up by the military authorities, and a verbatim and signed statement of the evidence of any witness who was examined there was forwarded and laid before the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I might be allowed to make a short personal explanation. I have responsibility for establishing precedents in connection with matters that come before the Executive Council, matters which should be confidential matters, and which should not be disclosed to any person in that connection.  I have this responsibility: that once a precedent in that connection be made my successors will be in the same position.  As far as that is concerned, it is more a concern of my successors, but I do not want, in this matter or in any other, to make any precedent, or to give rise to any precedent, which would be a serious drawback to the persons succeeding me in my position.  To that extent I am very jealous to keep in the strictest possible confidence matters coming before the Executive Council as such.  If a Minister, in his capacity as Minister, in a matter dealing with his department, is asked for information in this House that is one matter.  But in a matter coming before the Executive Council, and concerning it and the confidence relating to it, I must say that while Deputies may, at times, think that there is something being kept back, I must exercise the most jealous supervision over matters coming before the Executive Council and to that extent my answer must necessarily be reticent on matters of this sort coming before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>What the President has said drives me to make a small personal explanation.  I did make a <Col N="1986" /> statement here, portion of which was read by Deputy Johnson, in which I referred in certain terms to the decision of the Attorney-General given in this particular case, and to a certain extent, from his point of view, that was a breach of a certain amount of confidence. I gave evidence to that effect before the Army Inquiry Committee, but in my statement before the Army Inquiry Committee I very explicitly said if there was anything in the evidence I was giving before that Committee that could be in any way regarded as a breach of confidence with the Executive Council, I was quite prepared to have that evidence removed from my statement.  If here subsequently when dealing with the matter of the Army Inquiry Report I did repeat remarks of mine indicating something at any rate with regard to the Attorney-General's report, and if there was a tinge of breach of confidence in that, I submit to the House it was wrung from me by insinuations and allegations made in a most unwarranted way and by, in my opinion, very lying and insidious tongues, against the honour of men who, as army officers, have rendered very valuable and distinguished service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very peculiar matter to have to discuss at all in the manner in which it is brought up here. I only know of this case from the very brief reference to it made in the report of the Army Committee of Inquiry. I have not read and never heard before the statement which Deputy Johnson has read to us on this matter from the paper here to-day.  It is the first time I had the remotest idea what the Kenmare case was.  But for these facts all I would know about the case still would be from what was published in the report of the Committee of Inquiry. I suppose I am precluded from going into that question of the publication of the evidence, but I want to say that the President's reply is not, to my mind, satisfactory.  The very little I know of this shows me that the President and the Executive Council decided not to take any action in this matter, because of the point of view put before them by the Attorney-General.  I do <Col N="1987" /> not know what point of view was put before the Attorney-General or whether the evidence that went before the Attorney-General was also put before the Executive Council, or whether the bald decision of the Attorney-General himself only came before the Executive Council.  But we do find in the report of the Committee that they say that Deputy Mulcahy accepted full responsibility for the decision to drop the Kenmare case.</P>
      <P>They go on to say that, in their opinion, this was a grave error of judgment on his part, and that it did militate against discipline generally, by encouraging suspicion in the minds of officers and others, that the Army Authorities were disposed to hush up charges against persons high in authority. Now, apparently, the Army Committee of Inquiry had before them sufficient evidence to conclude that, from their point of view, Deputy Mulcahy committed a grave error of judgment in deciding to drop the Kenmare case, and, in doing that, that the Army Authorities were disposed to hush up charges against persons high in authority.</P>

      <P>I am not going to plead the same amount of ignorance in regard to the case referred to by Deputy Johnson as Deputy Baxter professes to have so far as he is concerned.  There is no doubt that both inside and outside this House rumours have been circulated giving this, that, and the other version in regard to the Kenmare case. I have been speaking to officers and soldiers who served in Kerry, and they have heard rumours of what is supposed to have taken place in regard to this incident.  There is only one matter that I would like to draw attention to, and the President apparently has not made it clear in this debate.  We all regret that certain officers took upon themselves responsibility for doing things which neither this House nor the Government could stand over.  It should be made clear by the President <Col N="1990" /> that where charges, or allegations, have been made, and steps have not been taken to prove them, so far as these actions are concerned,, the Government does not stand over these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think from what has transpired during the last twelve or eighteen months, it will be admitted that the Government prosecutes, without any discrimination whatever, officers who have rendered good service, either in the pre-Truce or post-Truce period.  But if the case be made that every officer is not being prosecuted, I can only say that the same thing applies to people other than officers and soldiers.  On many occasions we have been criticised for placing men in the dock who rendered great and brilliant services at other periods of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention this because on previous occasions I felt that there was reluctance on the part of members of the Ministry to say anything that would be likely to displease army officers, whether of high or low rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no doubt whatever in the mind of officers and soldiers that the same law is for them as for all of us.  During the last election I said that there was the same law for every member of the Executive, and for every member of this assembly, as there was for the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, to a certain extent, when a robbery is committed. When proof was forthcoming that officers have committed a robbery, they have been dealt with in the way other people have been dealt with.  If this State is to allow it to go abroad that servants of the State are not to be dealt with in the same way as people who come under the title of Irregulars, then it will be very difficult for this State to insist on a proper civic responsibility as far as the general body of the community is concerned.  I do not wish to go back on things that have happened. I raised the point really because I wished to hear what the President would say, and to see whether he would not say, what has not been said in this <Col N="1991" /> House before, that is, that those people would be dealt with more severely than Irregulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that we can get information regarding officers and soldiers that we cannot get regarding the Irregulars.  The amount of damage done by the Irregulars is known, and compared with the damage done the number of prosecutions against them is negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

I have assumed from what was said that all the evidence in the hands of the Executive Council, and the Minister for Defence, was placed before the Attorney-General, and that on going through it he advised the Ministry that it was not of a character that would justify a prosecution.  I take it that is correct.</P>

      <P>Then the Minister is taking upon himself the responsibility for not having instituted the prosecution. He refuses to put that responsibility upon the Attorney General. He refuses to say it was the judgment of the Attorney General that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant a prosecution.  Therefore, no prosecution having taken place, it was the direct responsibility of the Executive Council without regard to what the Attorney-General said.</P>

      <P>Well, the House can judge.  The Army Report that was presented to us was minus what I conceive to be the most important and authoritative part, that is that part to which the Chairman, appointed because of his legal learning, had appended his signature.  The Chairman made a report which has not been disclosed. I have just as much right to assume that the Chairman's report had reference to this case as to assume anything else.  We had also from Deputy Mulcahy, who was the Minister responsible at the time, that there is no warrant for the assertion that the witnesses who were capable of giving evidence in this case, were dispersed and removed to different parts of the country, and therefore not available.  I am glad to have that denial from the ex-Minister, and I hope it will be taken note of by all those who are asserting the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it, from what has been published and stated here, that the Ministry was at least satisfied that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case that those ladies had been assaulted by soldiers.  Apart from the identity, there was insufficient evidence to warrant any charge against a particular person, but I take it, in view of the serious steps that were taken to inquire into the matter, that it is not denied that the maltreatment did occur, and that soldiers did enter the house of those ladies, take them from their beds, and beat them with belts.  I want to know what action has the Ministry taken with regard to those ladies.  Granted that the evidence was insufficient to punish the culprits, has anything been done to give those citizens, (disloyal or otherwise,&mdash;I do not know) some feeling that the Ministry reprobated any such action and that they would, if they could, punish the offenders?  Has the course of conduct been that you do not believe that the girls had been maltreated by soldiers, or that you accept the general statement of facts, but could not identify the culprits, and that you have expressed <Col N="1993" /> your reprobation and, shall I say, apologised on behalf of the Army to those persons so maltreated?</P>

From my knowledge of the case, I deny that there was evidence that soldiers were mixed up in the matter at all.  I cannot help feeling, by the general recital of this case here from this Irregular paper &ldquo;Eire,&rdquo; that the Deputy is endeavouring to get information which, the President has stated, is privileged information.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson raises this question on the Army Vote, and any information I may have gleaned at all was from his statement made here to-day.  As I understand it, this, whatever it was, happened considerably more than a year ago in disturbed times.  Since then the whole Army Inquiry has been before the Dáil. A Commission has been appointed, and personally I was hopeful that it would not be necessary to bring this rather serious matter before the Dáil again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Johnson, in raising this, is quite within his rights as regards the investigation of the administration of the Army.  But unless he has some information founded on facts which supplement the information which was before the Committee, I wonder whether it is quite wise to open another discussion on this matter at this stage.  Of course, I understand, or I presume, that Deputy Johnson, in raising this matter, is likely to follow the usual procedure that he follows where he is convinced that there is a matter of principle involved; in other words, that he is going to call for a division.  Consequently I, as a member of the Dáil, will be called upon to <Col N="1994" /> vote.  The President has said that in connection with the advice given by the Attorney-General to the Executive Council, that advice is privileged.  I think it must be so.  Even in very much less important spheres in connection with commercial bodies, we always look on advice asked for and received from legal personages as privileged, privileged for the information of these to whom it is given.  It would be very unsatisfactory that advice given in that way should ever become public property. That it has not been given is, I think, the gravamen of the charge that Deputy Johnson has put forward in this case.  We have the assurance from the President that in asking for the advice of the Attorney-General all the information that was available in this particular case was submitted to him, and that the advice that was given by the Attorney-General to the Executive Council was based upon that full statement of the case as it was known to the Executive Council.  Having regard to that assurance, I personally am prepared to say that the attitude taken up by the President is the correct one as regards procedure.  There are, and there must be, confidential communications, and I do not think that in reading out a statement in a paper Deputy Johnson has made a case that requires the re-opening of matters that must have been, and, I think, were before the Committee appointed by the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

As far as the case has proceeded, I only rise to say that I am prepared to support the Government, not from any desire particularly to support the Government, but on the merits of the case and from the public point of view.  Unless there is further need for re-opening this Army question, I do not think it is wise that the people should dwell on this matter, nor do I think it is wise to use it politically as an explosive force which it is very dangerous to handle in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the Army should be brought into the region of politics <Col N="1995" /> more than is absolutely necessary.  I quite see that Deputy Johnson has the right to raise this matter on the Army Vote, but I do deprecate the continuance of a state of affairs which has been dangerous in the past unless there is very strong justification for raising it again in the Dáil.  Seeing that there is no apparent demand from anybody, seeing that there is no statement that any injury has been done to anybody, I think it would be better not to raise it.  Under all the circumstances I certainly am prepared to vote with the Government in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my position clear.  I do not demand and I have not suggested that the advice given by the Attorney General to the Ministry in this or in any other case should be divulged.  I realise quite well that it would be very undesirable that a demand of that kind should be used as a precedent or become a practice. I have not suggested any such thing.  We have the report of the Army Inquiry Committee which was presented to the Dáil by the Executive Council. In that report a certain case was referred to and it was stated that a grave error of judgment had been committed by the Minister responsible at that time in the decision &ldquo;to drop the Kenmare case,&rdquo; and that the dropping of that case did militate against discipline generally by encouraging suspicion in the minds of officers and others that the Army Authorities were disposed to hush up charges against persons high in authority.  That is all we know in this Dáil about the matter.  That is all I know about the matter until there is put into my hands by a responsible citizen, not of the camp which may be suggested, a detailed statement of the case in question&mdash;certain circumstantial statements in regard to it.  Under the circumstances I have the right and every Deputy who knows the facts and has the matter brought to his notice in relation to this paragraph 27 of the report of the Army Inquiry Committee, has the right to raise the matter; and I say it is a duty imposed upon us, or at least, it is a duty imposed upon me to protest against the inaction of the Executive Council in the matter <Col N="1996" /> even as disclosed by the President here to-day.</P>

I cannot help recalling in connection with this arising here this evening the Irish phrase that says: <i>&ldquo;Is leithide an bualtach satailt air.&rdquo;</i>  I do suggest that people have been putting their feet into the <i>bualtach</i> that is very carefully prepared by other people, and it is not the Army <i>bualtach.</i></P>

Deputy Mulcahy will vote for the amendment under certain circumstances. It is not in view of Deputy Mulcahy's statement I made this offer to Deputy Johnson.

That paper contains what he calls certain circumstantial evidence, and people reading that are bound, according to the Deputy, to take it as <Col N="1998" /> referring to the particular paragraph of the Army Inquiry Report which deals with this Kenmare case.  I suggest to him that there is only one item in what he has read which relates at all to the Army Inquiry Report, and that is a statement that witnesses were dispersed in order to avoid evidence being taken from them.  That statement was made before the Army Inquiry Committee and was examined.  I personally am convinced, and I have consulted some of my colleagues in the Committee, and they, too, are convinced that there was no truth in that statement. Deputy Mulcahy has denied it here this evening, and I join with him in the denial.  I suggest that is the only substantial point in that paper with regard to the report of the Army Inquiry that Deputy Johnson has referred to.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I asked a question of the Minister for Defence as to whether or not the scheme of Army re-organisation had been drafted, whether that scheme had been submitted to the Executive Council, and whether the Executive Council had sanctioned it.  I was led to believe by the answer that the scheme was then under the consideration of the Executive Council, but the President as Minister for Defence did not say whether the Executive Council had sanctioned or were likely to sanction it. A very important statement was made yesterday by the ex-Minister for Defence when he gave it as his opinion from his long experience in matters of this kind that the scheme that is now being put into operation, and that was not sanctioned at the time I asked my question, is a scheme that does not meet the requirements of the situation.  I think that statement requires a very definite answer from the Minister for Defence.  While on that matter I will <Col N="1999" /> express the opinion that I expressed before, that it is very unfortunate, for reasons best known to the Executive Council, that they should have decided to place upon the President, who was already over-loaded with work, the additional duties and responsibilities of Minister for Defence.  I cannot find a good reason as to why that should have been done.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that the Army Inquiry Committee had to be set up.  Now that that Inquiry has concluded its work, and as many Deputies have expressed their view that they do not want to hear any more about Army questions, I think that the Executive Council and the President should realise that the time has come for them to find another Minister for Defence.  I say that without any disrespect to the President, because I realise, and I am sure the Dáil realises, that the President of the Executive Council cannot, in fairness to himself and to his own work, be asked to bear the very heavy and additional responsibility of Minister for Defence.  Therefore in the interests of  country, and in the interests of Deputies who have from time to time to bring matters before the Dáil, and who expect that these matters should be dealt with properly, I say that it is impossible to have them dealt fairly and squarely by the President acting also as Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>I quite realise the circumstances under which the National Army was set up, and I think it was the duty of the Executive Council when considering a scheme of reorganisation, or the first scheme of organisation of the Army on proper lines, as far as they could to lay down lines that would put that organisation on a secure and permanent foundation.  It has been already admitted that the scheme which has been sanctioned and passed is only a temporary scheme.  I am not quite sure if the Government realise that in playing with Army schemes in the way of organisation and reorganisation they are playing with fire.  They are setting up a scheme to-day which, as far as we can understand, is only to remain in existence for three months.  What is the position from the point of view of the men in the Army?</P>

      <P>That statement is not quite correct.  This scheme is now set up.  Any imperfections that are in it will be observed within the next six or nine months.  But it does not necessarily follow that you will have a new scheme in six or nine months, or even in twelve months' time.  This scheme is thought to be the best at the moment.  It is not intended to scrap it, but simply to change it in view of what experience we may derive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the admission made by the President as bearing out what I say, that this is only a temporary scheme.  I want to know whether it is temporary or permanent.  Who was responsible for drawing up the scheme?  Is it the G.O.Cs. or the Commander of the Forces, who was only brought out of his position as Commissioner of the Civic Guard and placed in temporary control of the armed forces?  If it was the G.O.C. was he acting on the instructions of the Executive Council, or in consultation with the General Officers Commanding different areas?  I want to know what expert advice they had, other than their own experience, and I hope I will not be taken as meaning anything disrespectful when I describe it as experience in Army circles on amateur lines.  If an Army in a new State is to be established on a permanent, secure foundation, I say that the body that is appointed to deal with such a big proposal should have at its disposal expert advisers, and I think Army officers on active service could not see imperfections in the same way as outsiders, and could not to that extent be held responsible for drafting a scheme that would not admit of any imperfections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President rather takes the view that he would later, after six, nine, or twelve months had dragged along, allow the imperfections to come out in the ordinary course of the operation of the scheme.  I put it in this way, and I put it to the President simply because I have been talking in a casual way with Army officers from time to time: A great number of Army officers at present, believing that this is only a temporary scheme, that some other scheme will take its place at the expiration of six, nine or twelve months, feel <Col N="2001" /> that there is no security for them, and when there is no security there is really no incentive to them to do real work.  There is a danger from that point of view, and I hope that the President will realise if there is anything in the scheme that is wrong and if it is looked upon more as a temporary than a permanent scheme, that the sense of insecurity that it places on the shoulders of officers is bad for an Army that should be properly disciplined and under proper control. I do not know how it is proposed to discuss the Estimate, but I wish to draw attention to one matter which is more or less a matter of policy.  I want to draw the attention of the President to the increase in the figure for Warlike Stores, from £115,000 last year to £136,000 this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Davin, I have to say that this scheme of organisation is a permanent scheme, permanent as far as the Civil Service is permanent, permanent as far as the Police Force is permanent, and that any reorganisation that takes place will not affect, and cannot affect, any officer holding a position in the Army; it is his efficiency, his adaptability and qualifications for his Commission which will ensure his retention in the Army. Should it be necessary during the next six months, nine months, twelve months, two years, three or five years, to furnish a better scheme than this one, that will not affect the Commission held by any officer.  It is no excuse for dissatisfied officers to say that organisations and re-organisations follow one another in such quick succession, and that they feel insecure.  It is not their business.  He should be satisfied that it is in the power of the Civil Government of the country to organise or re-organise the Army in accordance with whatever appears in their judgment to be best at that particular time, and of the Dáil or the Oireachtas to which they are responsible. This scheme was put up by the General Officer Commanding, having had the opportunity of consulting the officers of the Army, and seeing the situation as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the President exactly mean by saying the General Officer Commanding had an opportunity of consulting the officers of the Army; can he say did he consult all the General Officers Commanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect he consulted quite a number of officers, not confining himself to the G.O.C.'s, but officers in various capacities and various ranks over the country, and his information to me is that this scheme will give satisfaction and will give the major satisfaction.  He got that instruction <Col N="2003" /> from the Executive Council. I believe that the Executive Council had this matter under consideration only for a very short period.  Deputies know the strength of the Executive Council and that the Executive Council is not at full strength, that a good deal of work, legislative and other work, has had to be done, that there have not been so many meetings of the Executive Council as I would like, and that in consequence this particular scheme did not get from the Executive Council that discussion which it should, perhaps. But this is the second scheme that we have had this year.  Army re-organisation schemes, if I am not giving too much information away, are very voluminous in character.  Quite endless pages succeed one another in continuity, and the mere reading of a scheme of reorganisation is enough to set one thinking for a week. In this particular case I have read about 200 pages dealing with the essence of the scheme, its general characteristics, its details, the various commissions, the various ranks that are to be held in the re-organisation scheme, and so on, and I do not know that it would have been possible, having regard to the amount of legislation each Ministry had to deal with, to give it more than partial consideration. Ordinarily I should say the Minister for Defence would have made himself thoroughly acquainted with the whole matter, as General Mulcahy did, and nobody is in a better position to appraise the value of the work and the amount of work that was done by General Mulcahy than I am.</P>

      <P>The President, yesterday, in answer to a question by Deputy Johnson, as to what this Vote was for and the reason why he should be expected to devote nearly four million pounds to the Army made a statement of policy or intention on the part of the Government with regard to the Army.  He stated, amongst other things, that the Defence Forces could only exist for one purpose&mdash;to meet any national emergency that may arise; that the State must be defended both from external and internal aggression, and that the Government policy was to have an efficient military machine, capable of being used on the shortest possible notice, a body trained to discipline and efficiency and a credit to the nation.  That was a statement of the policy or intention of the Executive Council.  Their intention was not only that the Defence Forces should be capable of defending the State from external aggression, but from internal aggression.  I am afraid, on the facts and figures we have got before us that the Army does not bear any relation to that policy or that intention. The President knows perfectly <Col N="2005" /> well that the Defence Forces, as at present constituted, cannot defend the State from external aggression. He made a statement not long ago in regard to the inadequacy and the extreme weakness of the Defence Forces of this State as compared with the Constabulary of the North-East. He mentioned just that one instance. That is a very serious matter of policy because it seems that we are not taking adequate steps for the defence of the country and that we are not taking responsibility for the defence of the country.  We are placing the country in a position of definite inferiority, more in the position of a protectorate than a sovereign State, which we claim it to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the limits of this estimate, of less than £4,000,000, there is adequate money to create a really efficient Army.  In fact, that sum would not really be necessary if it were properly administered.  One has only got to compare the figures which we are paying for this particularly large and cumbersome police force with the figures of small armies in other parts of the world to see that that would be possible.  At the present time in Belgium an army of, practically, 100,000 only costs £5,000,000, of which the pay, wages and allowances come to less than £2,000,000.  In Switzerland this year the army costs only £3,250,000, although that involves a complete reorganisation of the artillery of the Swiss Army.  In Roumania, with an army of over 125,000, they are paying this year less than £3,500,000.  That includes the complete reconstruction of a large Air Force.  In all these countries you will find that they are paying less&mdash;or most of them are paying less&mdash;than we are, and they are paying for a real army, whereas we are paying for something which is not in a position to defend the country from both external and internal aggression. When one considers this Estimate, we find that the wages and allowances which are written down under eight sub-heads come to over £2,500,000 out of a sum total for the whole Army of £3,800,000.  We find very large sums <Col N="2006" /> being paid under five sub-heads, amounting to £318,000 for transport of various kinds, whereas the sum total which is being paid and which Deputy Davin drew attention to for warlike equipment is only £136,000.</P>

      <P>Only.  If you compare the amount we are paying in wages and allowances with the corresponding figures in an ordinary up-to-date army, you will notice that a sum of £136,000 is not very adequate.  In other Votes we are paying for preserving order in this country a sum of £1,700,000&mdash;for keeping up the Gárda and the D.M.P.  If you add that to this Estimate, you will find that we are paying over £5,500,000 solely for the purpose of keeping order in the country.  It is not very creditable for any country to pay about one-fifth of its total revenue for the purpose of keeping order inside its own borders. There are various items in this Estimate which can be discussed.  I presume we can discuss them one by one. At any rate, I must say, as the Estimate stands at present it does not bear out the statement of policy made by the President yesterday that this Army was intended to defend the State, not only against external, but internal agression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two minor points that I would like to raise and I feel that I cannot raise them except on this particular sub-head. I wish to say that I simply leave what I said with regard to the general policy of the Army as I have said it, because I fully realise that force of circumstances and time will, very soon after the Recess, make the Dáil take the question of the Army and Army organisation seriously and go into it in a more thorough fashion than we were able to do on those Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only under sub-head A can I raise two questions to which I desire to refer.  One is the question of an Irish Battalion.  Would the President let us know how the position is as regards the formation of the Irish Battalion? It was intended that one of the twentyseven battalions arranged for would be <Col N="2007" /> an Irish-speaking battalion.  The question is most important from the point of view of the status of our national language and from the point of view of the position in which our national language is and the fact that we have to nurture it and get it back into a more prominent, a more vigorous and a living position in the country.  The Army gives us, without any trouble at all, the place in which to give a small reservation to the language.</P>
    <P>The next question I desire to refer to is the question of the music school. I refer to it in order to draw attention to what I consider is a serious matter&mdash; the appearance of the hand of the Philistine in the music school.  When we brought a distinguished musician to found our music school, we brought him, bearing in mind that we do not want in this country to be in the position with regard to music that we have to import our distinguished musicians. We brought a man of experience and capacity and culture, such as would help to develop musicians to his own standard and provide a headline here and that not only would we have in the army, bands that would be a credit to the country but that in our scheme of Army bands we would have machinery from the working of which we would get big and experienced and distinguished musicians.  It was proposed that each band should have a commissioned officer in charge of it. We started modestly and only gave him the rank of First Lieutenant or Second Lieutenant.  But in taking in a young musician and putting him in touch with the work of the music school and putting him under the tutorship of the present Director of Music, we were placing opportunities before him that, where we found the right type of man, he would be glad to have.  It is true we only had succeeded in getting one musician to take on as an aspirant band master.  But he is a man who will undoubtedly fill the bill and we could have got others if we were satisfied to take minor material.  The school did make provision for four vacancies for musicians of that particular type.  While the Estimate as it stands makes provision, apparently, for those officers, the scheme of organisation <Col N="2008" /> or establishment, which has been put up to us in the small White Paper, cuts them out.  When you consider that in a company you give an officer to something like thirty-four men, it is not too much to ask that to a band, which numbers thirty-seven men, you should give an officer, too.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter very carefully.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question that I would like to refer to. When the school was founded I went to the Professor of Music in the National University, and I asked him to be my adviser in the matter.  He very willingly consented to do so, and has been to a large extent instrumental in seeing the school developed along the particular lines it has developed.  I paid him, at one time, a small fee for his services, and, on the mandate of the Ministry of Finance, I told him I could not recompense him for his services any more. But I asked him to continue still as adviser in the matter.  It was very necessary that we should not start or establish a very important Irish School of Music and hand it over entirely to a foreigner, without connecting him up with the very great field of music and the particular musical feeling we have in this country.  We do not want a foreign School of Music started in our midst.  We want proper training, so that we will have a School of Music that will preserve and develop our national tradition with regard to music. I have to complain, with regard to the school, that since I left the Ministry, the Professor of Music of the National University, who was my adviser in this matter, has been very discourteously pushed aside and told in an indirect way that he was not wanted any further.  The school is now in the hands of the Director from a musical point of view.  I consider that very wrong, and I consider it is introducing a danger with regard to the school.  It is leaving to a very big extent in the hands of&mdash;however distinguished and however cultured&mdash;a foreigner, who no doubt fully appreciates our Irish music and has said with regard to it that his only regret in connection with the field of native music he has struck here is that he will not live long enough to enjoy or develop it properly.  I do consider <Col N="2009" /> that you do want some type of musical control or assistance in connection with the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he could say what number of N.C.O.'s and men are employed on clerical work in the Army and what amount of proficiency pay they receive while so employed.  The reason I ask the question is that I have been informed that highly-trained clerks who joined the Army and who are employed on Army work in the different Army offices are, in some cases, only receiving something like 9d. a day extra, as proficiency pay. I would like to know if that is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard recently about the Irish Battalion, but I will make inquiries about it.  As regards the School of Music, I observe from the establishment, that there are a Colonel, two Captains and two Lieutenants and the ordinary number of men in each of the bands.  There was, I think, only one band in March last, and it is proposed now to have four or five bands.  It is considered advisable to have one band in each of the Commands, and, even though it does not come up to the excellence of the No. 1 Army Band, the general impression is that each Command ought to have a brass band.  Some twelve or eighteen months ago, I think, there was a band in almost every command.  There were certainly three or four bands, and even though they were not of the same excellence as the No. 1 Band, they were a certain satisfaction to the men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other matter mentioned about the services of the Professor in the National University, I think that the Army ought to be able to look after itself with regard to a matter of music or anything else.  I must say from my experience that there is hardly much unanimity amongst professors of music or bachelors of music.  As far as I have been able to learn, there is more disagreement amongst them than there is agreement, and while it is true that there might be certain advantages in getting advice from one person, one might antagonise another section.  If in matters of this sort one were to look for advice from a person interested in <Col N="2010" /> Irish music, there might be a chorus of disapproval from the remainder of the profession that the correct person had not been consulted in the matter.  That is the only objection I would have to getting in a particular person.</P>
    <P>The proficiency pay given to clerks is at present 9d. and 1s. 6d., according to qualification.  In certain cases I think there are complaints that persons doing clerical work have not got this pay at all.  These cases, I think, are under examination at present.  In the last case brought before me I know I was satisfied that within a very short time that particular matter will be cleared up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President say what is the reason for the very great difference between the proficiency pay which is allowed to highly-trained clerks and the amount of proficiency pay which, say, is allowed to a tradesman working at his particular trade in the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  I got the machine in this order, and I have not altered it.  It is a matter which the new Minister for Defence should take up.  I cannot say at the moment what the difference is.  As to proficiency there can be little doubt about it in the case of tradesmen, but it is open to doubt whether persons are really doing the class of clerical work which it is claimed they should get three shillings per head for.</P>

      <P>With regard to what the President said as to differences of opinion amongst musicians, no doubt that is possible.  But, as a matter of fact, when in October, 1922, I got in touch with the Professor of Music in the National University, and spoke to <Col N="2011" /> him about what I wanted done, he at once suggested a committee of musicians to deal with the matter.  I said: &ldquo;I would not have time to handle a committee of musicians, but if you are satisfied to be a committee of one we will get on with the work.&rdquo;  He did act as a committee of one, and the work was brought to the pretty successful preliminary stage which it has reached. I think it is absurd to suggest that because certain Irish musicians would criticise certain other Irish musicians you must leave the development of your Army School of Music untouched by any Irish influences of any kind except haphazard influences.</P>

      <P>It is my experience, and I think the experience of other Deputies, that dependents' allowances, when claimed, are only awarded from the date on which the claim is made and are not granted for the full period of service.  If there is justification for an allowance being paid, there is the same justification for paying it for the full period of service as for part of the period.  That attitude on the part of the Army Authorities ought to be reconsidered, because it does not seem just.</P>

      <P>That is a regulation which has been in force, and it would entail endless confusion, complications, delays, etc., if it were to be altered now.  Whatever may be said about the time it was introduced, I take it, it must have been introduced for particular reasons.  I do not know whether the Deputy has had much experience of this sort of thing, but I have had some experience of it in connection with another army, and it was open to a considerable amount of abuse.  I admit that there may have been cases of hardship, but it is a regulation which was known and which has been in force.  Now that there is a different state of affairs, I do not think it would be wise to revise that.  A great number of those in respect of whom claims <Col N="2012" /> might be made in that connection have now left the Army.  The regulations are now different.  There is no dependents' allowance now.  It is purely a marriage allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the formation of the National Army a large number of men joined up with the respective companies that they belonged to prior to the formation of the Army.  Some of these men at that time got the rank of captain or lieutenant, and served for eighteen months in the Army, receiving pay only at the rate of £1 4s. 6d. per week.  The matter has been raised in the Dáil on several occasions.  In fact, the number of questions I have asked the Minister for Defence in regard to this are beyond counting, but I have never yet received a satisfactory answer as to why those men were not paid the salary of their rank.  Some time ago, when I raised a question concerning ex-service men of the National Army, I mentioned one specific case in Athlone. I stated that I sent a full statement of the case to the Minister for Defence, and did not even get an acknowledgment of my letter.  The particular man concerned was a captain, and something like £70 was due to him for pay. When he was demobilised from the Army his life was threatened, and the Government would not even pay him the £70 that they owed him, which would have enabled him to leave the country.  These officers whom I refer to were recognised by G.H.Q. at the time. They were authorised to supervise men and to carry out raids.  Practically every one of them had at one time or another acted under orders in raiding some particular house.  I was told last week by the Minister for Defence that the positions which these men held were irregular.  If the positions they held were irregular, were the raids which they carried out under orders irregular, and were the men acting illegally?  If they were, I will not go any further in asking the Government to pay these men.  But, to my mind they were acting under orders, and were recognised as officers by their superior officers. Consequently they should be entitled to the pay of officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to ridicule any high <Col N="2013" /> officers of the National Army.  I am sure they tried to do their best, but, prior to the demobilisation, hundreds of officers were sent to the Curragh for training, and received the regular rate of pay for twelve months.  At the end of that time they were demobilised and thrown on the scrap-heap.  It mattered not what service they had given to the State.  It would have been much better if these men had got the twelve months' pay in advance, as it would have enabled them to do something for themselves. Now you have some of them going about without their supper or the price of their beds.</P>
    <P>The Government have given a grant for the relief of distress and have specified that ex-service men shall get preference. But the wages the men are to get are also specified under that grant. At the present time men who were clerks, carpenters, painters, decorators, printers, solicitors' clerks or shop assistants prior to joining the army, have to take a hammer in their hands and go and break stones.  There is no other work offering for such men, and the result is that if they take that work they deprive others, who probably rendered equally good service to the State, of employment at which they made their living.  In the majority of cases the grants are now exhausted, and numbers of men have been suspended or dismissed.  I want to know from the Minister if it is his intention to give any further grant for the relief of distress in the different counties amongst ex-members of the National Army.  I also want to know from the Minister what his intentions are concerning those officers, now demobilised, who were only paid 24/6 a week.  Will these men get the back pay that is due to them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, the case made by the Deputy is in respect of persons who took rank that was not properly authorised.  In cases where the rank was properly authorised payment was made.  The Army Council settled a proportion of those so entitled to be paid in commissioned rank.  In the case of the rest, they appointed them non-commissioned officers or paid them as men.  It must be established that the rank was properly authorised <Col N="2014" /> before the officer would be entitled to pay as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that these particular officers, who were paid as men, wore officers' uniform, and, on instructions received from their superiors, carried out raids.  I want to know will these men be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unless the rank was properly authorised.  If the rank was properly authorised, yes, but we could not possibly entertain a proposal to pay because a man put on officers' uniform and had no other authorisation for doing so than his own will.</P>

      <P>On sub-head E, Deputy Sir James Craig wished to raise a point, and as I am in possession of his views I would trouble the Committee for a few moments.  This is a vote for medical services, and I think the amount voted under this head is somewhat excessive.  It is one of the items that in the revision of the Army have not been reduced but have been slightly increased.  It is a fact that we are equipping our Army with a medical service in a more costly way than that of any other army.  A medical service, of course, must always be costly, and if you want men of professional qualifications obviously you must pay them well.  In many other respects this vote is also very costly.  We have a hundred officers in the medical service, for an army establishment of 18,000 men, that is, one officer to every 180 men.  Now, in the British army, there is one officer to every 300 men.  In time of war, taking base hospitals, lines of communication, field hospitals, and so on, there is but one officer to every 300 men, whereas we have one officer for every 180 men here in times of peace.  I think that that would bear a little further investigation.  I know it will very probably be said that our units are scattered about and split up, and that we must have a large number of medical officers because the forces are so subdivided. I think it would be more economical to engage the services of some local medical men, dispensary medical officers or otherwise, for a post in which there are but few men stationed. <Col N="2015" /> You could pay him by fees at so much per day without incurring any responsibility to him afterwards for the work he has done.  Such a number of whole-time medical officers for such a small number of troops is rather wasteful.</P>
      <P>I see there is an item for consultants and emergency fees at St. Bricin's, Curragh, and Cork, amounting to £3,000.  That means that one-sixth of a pound, 3/4, is spent for every man in the Army, and we hope that every man in the Army is not going to go sick or to want special skill in the coming year.  The average specialist does not charge a very large sum for consultations without any accompanying operations. About £3 3s. is the average. The figure here for specialists shows that one thousand men, or one-eighteenth of our whole strength, is going to have the need of specialists in the coming year.  I really think there is room for economising here.  No one would suggest that the soldier must not get the best of treatment, but this provision for consultants wants watching, because it might be possible to call in consultants on the smallest ground whatever.  The senior medical officers are paid £1,500 and £1,200 a year, more than a Parliamentary Secretary receives. They should be able to deal with cases without calling in a consultant except in very unusual cases indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to continue the pay at that rate.  I do admit, from my own point of view, that this is certainly an expensive service in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that admission made from the point of view of the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Both as to one and the other, and also from the point of view of the President.  There is unanimity among the various officers in regard to this, but it would be well to recollect that we have passed through a period, and that particular period has saddled us with a considerable number of persons.  In addition to them, we are now using St. Bricin's, or intend to use it, exclusively for those <Col N="2016" /> who are no longer in the Army, or for men who have had pre-truce service.  I think if it was possible to segregate the charges those in respect of casualties both for the two years through which we have passed and the previous period that this item could be considerably reduced, but even at the present exorbitant and extravagant price it does compare, on the whole, rather favourably with the cost per head of the medical service of the British army, which is something like £8 per head as compared with our £5 here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That includes, I think, the overseas and the unhealthy places in India, and so on in connection with the British Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it does. In my opinion there is no justification for such a charge as this, and as soon as we have disposed of our obligations to those who suffered in the last few years, we hope that, though on the face of it this service looks very costly, it will be possible to reduce it in next year's estimates.  In addition to what I have said about persons in St. Bricin's Hospital, there are cases also to be considered for wounds pensions.  The medical officers have a responsibility on them, and we have increased the number of Boards.  I think there are now three Boards to deal with these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean to correct the statement he made a while ago, that in any change in the Army organisation it will not be found necessary to demobilise or remove the commissions of those at present holding office?  Does that apply, apart from the rate of pay to the number of medical officers?  Or does he now suggest that the possibility is that a number of those on the list of medical officers may be removed from the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hope so, and that it would not be necessary to maintain that very big staff there at present.  They are in a somewhat different pocket to ordinary demobilised. Ordinary demobilisation involves a great number of men with pre-truce service.  I think, with few exceptions, these men have been brought in since the National Army was formed.  In <Col N="2017" /> that respect we have not got the same liability towards them or their careers because they have been paid professional fees or have got professional salaries and are not in the same position as ordinary soldiers and their profession is still available for them outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we contended for in the Army Pensions Bill, but I desired to give the Minister an opportunity to make that explanation, because inevitably if there is to be any demobilisation of officers in the future, attention would be drawn to that promise made about an hour ago that there will be no such demobilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly should admit of that qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that last year's estimate was less accurate when issued than the estimate of this year. In addition to that, I think some of the persons concerned have taken upon themselves responsibilities which, perhaps, they did not bear last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know is there no accommodation in the Barracks, or are officers entitled to 4/3 per day, as stated in the estimate, when they have no quarters in the Barracks?  Are they entitled to 4/3 per day when living out?  Is there not ample accommodation in the Barracks at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-head G, will the Minister consider in future that it is undesirable to have married junior officers from a military point of view? The young officer who is married is much more distracted in his work than the officer who lives in the regimental mess and devotes his life entirely to the service.  That cannot be done now, but when the Army Authorities are admitting officers in the future would it be possible to make some regulation by which lodging and marriage allowance would not be issued until after a <Col N="2018" /> minimum service, say that an officer should have at least three years' service, or that he should have attained the age of twenty-one years?  If he marries at an earlier age than that the service gets no chance of putting a mark on him.  He lives in his own home and he never gets the true military tone that he would get if he lived in the regimental mess and associated in his off-duty hours with his brother officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to bring that matter to the notice of the next Minister for Defence.  I think it is a very good point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of providing accommodation in barracks for married officers, I know a married officer at present who has obtained a decree in the courts to get possession of a house occupied by a tenant in a town in a part of Offaly.  This officer is a married man with six children, and he is evicting a tenant out of a house that he recently purchased.  The case put up by the officer is that he cannot get married quarters in barracks, but I suggest that there must be ample accommodation for married officers in most of the barracks.  This particular officer is at present in Kildare, and he maintains that he cannot get married quarters there.  He is evicting a woman with five or six children.  They are to be put out on the street and to be left homeless.</P>
      <P>Sub-head G agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>On Sub-head K I desire to ask what has been done as regards settling claims for motor cars that were commandeered.  Payments have been made in some cases, but the amount allowed was not an adequate settlement. Time after time I have asked questions with regard to cars that were commandeered. In some cases the business of people who owned these cars that were commandeered two years ago has been destroyed.  They received some portion of the payment claimed, but the amount was not anything like enough to compensate them for the losses they sustained by the commandeering of their cars.  Where it can be proved that a person's business was destroyed by the commandeering of that person's <Col N="2019" /> motor car, I think that adequate compensation should be paid.  There is a very large number of these cases still to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The number is 1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>That speaks well for constant employment for the people who are dealing with these claims.  I admit that a very large number of these cases have been settled in a satisfactory way, but others are not satisfactory. The Minister, I suppose, will say that a lot of claims sent in are bogus ones, or that they have been very much exaggerated.  Take the case of a car costing £140, which was taken away from the owner and kept for six or eight months, and then returned to him.  When the car was returned he had to pay, perhaps, £30 for the repairs to it.  That person, perhaps, was granted a payment of £25 or £30, but he was given nothing at all for the time the car was out of his possession, and as a result that individual suffered a loss by reason of the car being commandeered. As regards allowances for mileage, a man puts in a claim for ninepence or tenpence a mile, but the amount is reduced by ten per cent.  I think it is only right that people who lost money by reason of their cars being commandeered should be paid adequate compensation.  I want to ask the Minister when he expects these 1,500 claims that he has referred to will be gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope before next March.  This number that I mentioned comprises the whole list of cases, but fresh cases are coming in daily.  The charges that are made in some cases are really very elaborate. I am sure the Deputy would be quite satisfied if provision were made not alone for consequential loss, but for all losses that have been sustained&mdash;the other losses that are anticipated during the lifetime of the person making the charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-head L, <Col N="2020" /> I desire to ask the Minister why it is we have not a schedule of items under this sub-head, the same as we have under the other sub-heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This embodies such a large number of items&mdash;tea, sugar, bacon, eggs and so forth&mdash;that it would not be possible to do more than to estimate so much per head of the standing Army, or the full strength of the Army for the time being, and it would scarcely be a correct estimate. It could only be an estimate, and at that it might be out very considerably in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked the Minister that question was to ascertain whether it was under this sub-head I should raise the matter of soldiers who did not use the Army rations for any period, and who did not get an allowance instead.  I have had several of these cases brought to my notice and have sent them on to the Ministry. They could not, for certain reasons, use the rations they were entitled to get from the Army, and what I want to know is if they will be paid any allowance instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Where soldiers are entitled to rations in barracks, and do not take them, they are not entitled to an allowance in respect of them. This particular estimate is made up on the total number of men in the Army at so much per day, and that is totted up for the year.  That is how the figure is arrived at, and it follows that in the event of a small number of men not drawing these particular allowances, it is unlikely there would be a saving corresponding to the saving on the estimate. While in some cases an allowance is made for the non-drawing of rations, it would be a bad principle to allow it generally.  It would be a bad principle, I say, to allow a man or an officer who did not wish to draw his rations, to demand whatever sum he would be ordinarily assessed for in the case of provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>During the recent troubles, some men did not get any rations in barracks for perhaps eighteen months or close on two years.  Do I understand the Minister to say that <Col N="2021" /> they will get no allowance in lieu of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I will undertake to look into the case.  There are a large number of billeting cases of which the same thing might be said as I mentioned to Deputy Lyons a few minutes ago in the case of cars.  I could have told him, in respect of some of these cars, that I have got bills for three times the price of a car new.  In the billeting cases, I have one case before me in which the accommodation available in the house was occupied by the family of the man who owned it. It consisted of four rooms, and there is a bill in for billeting and accommodating seventeen soldiers in that particular house.  The Deputy will understand that I have to exercise a very nice discretion with regard to those cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Your hands were not tied when you authorised people to go and get the stuff.  I see that there is a decrease in Vote N.  About a fortnight ago I was going through Phoenix Park and saw outside Collins Barracks what looked like a reek of uniforms stacked together.  They were apparently clothes handed in by men who were demobilised and to my mind there were there about 30,000 uniforms. They were packed like hay in a haggard. Are they to remain there to rot or will the Minister arrange to have them disposed of by jumble sale?  Will as little attention be given in the future as was given in the past by the ex-Minister for Defence to the question of giving large orders outside <Col N="2022" /> the Saorstát for the manufacture of military uniform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is fair for the Deputy to put the question in that way.  The late Minister for Defence was as anxious as I am to give employment here for the purchase of anything for the Army. The late Minister is, and was for years, concerned in the manufacture of Irish goods.  In cases where orders were given I do not know that he had any option.  The same principle is being adopted.  Some time ago when articles were wanted we did not send away for them but we waited until we got them made at home.  I hope that the Deputy does not drag that out of me for the benefit of any lazy manufacturers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention that it is a well-known fact that huge orders were placed in the hands of Jewish or English manufacturers last year.  We have in Ireland manufacturers capable of manufacturing the material worn in the National Army.  I agree that there is a percentage allowed to the Irish manufacturer.  It was contended that thousands of pounds were saved by placing orders outside, but I do not think that it is real economy, even if you save £200,000, when you have thousands of people unemployed at home.  I think it would be better economy to pay even more for the material made at home as it would help to give much needed employment. Owing to the amount of clothes which I have seen near Collins Barracks, I think it will be necessary to place orders for the extra men you are taking on in the Army.  You will have an Army of 18,968.  At present I think you are 5,000 short of that.  I ask the President to see, when placing such orders in the future, that they will be given to manufacturers in Ireland even though the price may be a little dearer.</P>

      <P>In reference to sub-head (P), there is a case to which, I think, I should refer.  About two years ago a very valuable horse was seized from Mr. Fawsitt, in the County Kildare, for military purposes; at least, I understand it was taken by officers of the National Army.  He applied for a return of the horse, or for compensation. I put a question on the subject three months ago, and I was assured that the matter would be looked into and would be settled.  Nothing has, however, been done, and I got a letter yesterday saying that he got neither compensation nor the horse.  I should say that he was written to and told that if he went to the Curragh his horse would be returned, but when he went there he found that the animal which he was shown was of different sex from the animal that was taken.</P>

That is one of the reasons for this increase, together with the extra cost of maintaining the horses that will be purchased.</P>

I would like first of all to have from him an explanation whether his statement of last night, with regard to old outstanding accounts, is to be taken as having reference to all the old Army outstanding <Col N="2024" /> accounts, or whether it refers to accounts of general stores or to motor and other accounts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this head one or two very peculiar cases have been brought to my notice.  I understand that the Army accounts incurred before February, 1922, have not been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>They are under the Indemnity Act, and they are not our responsibility.  A committee is to deal with them under that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but what I want to bring under the notice of the President is, that in February, 1922, stores were procured by the Army which then existed.  When the Army was organised under the Provisional Government, these stores, bedding, and other materials passed from the then existing Army into the custody of the Free State Army.  Such accounts are still unpaid, although the facts are that this property is in the possession of the Free State Army, was in the barracks at the time that they passed into the possession of the Free State Army, and these stores and materials are probably being used today. Up to the present the Free State Government have denied any liability for such stores.  I think it is very unjust that such accounts should be outstanding, taking into account the fact that the National Army is using these stores.  I think such a matter desires the attention of the Minister, and that such accounts should be cleared off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better if the Deputy gives me privately that information with regard to the particular places in question, and the accounts.  They are probably <Col N="2025" /> mixed up with all the other accounts. Sixteen hundred is the total number, of which something like 400 can be certified.  In the case of twelve hundred we are making arrangements whereby on receipt of information, sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths, prompt consideration would be given to those cases.  Cases are coming in daily, and to a very large extent the fault lies with persons who allowed two years to elapse before making applications. Of course, the disturbed times may have something to do with that, but the Department is grappling very well with the work, having regard to the enormous number of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The fault does not lie with those people.  My experience is that, time and again, applications have been made.  Sometimes acknowledgments are received, and sometimes they are not.  What I would like to get from the Minister on this point is a definite statement as to whether or not the Ministry undertake liabilities for payment of any property that passed over from the Republican Army to the National Army, and is still being used by the National Army.  I would like a definite statement to the effect that the Ministry think they have a liability to be discharged in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure I could give an answer to that.  I was informed when the Damage to Property Act was passed that receipts were freely and liberally furnished by men who had been in arms against the State to people in business to enable them to make claims which would come before the courts and which would be given against the State. Offhand I could not undertake to give an answer which would satisfy the Deputy. The <i>bona fides</i> of the persons enters into it.  Suppose we do pay for them, to whom do the payments go? Does it go to the contractor, the business man or somebody else, who hold it in trust for those persons who were in arms against the State?  I am reliably informed that certain Irregulars who have been engaged against the State for a couple of years past have plenty of money and are able to bid <Col N="2026" /> high for farms that are up for sale although they have not been at work for the last two years.  There is something more than a suspicion as to where the money came from.  I do not intend, and I do not suppose the Deputy intends, to let people like that have another fling for twelve or eighteen months.  The sooner they settle down to work honestly the better. In cases of genuine debt, and the Deputy will admit it is rather difficult to establish genuine debts in such instances, we are prepared to consider favourably any claims put in, in respect of property into the possession of which we have entered, but we are not going to enrich those people.</P>

      <P>Whilst I am willing to accept the Minister's statement that he is endeavouring to work off the debt, I will give him an example which will explain to him how they are being paid off.  When I was about a month in the Dáil, I put down a question, relative to a debt in my constitutency. The person who supplied the goods had already sent in a Bill half a dozen times.  When the matter was raised, the reply I got was that the case should have been re-presented.  I presented the bill three times myself and the trader got a further letter to re-present a bill again, which he did. This morning I got a letter to say that the debt was unpaid.  That is a state of affairs which should not exist, and the sooner there is a tightening up of the settlement of those debts, the better it will be for the Ministry, and for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the Minister clear on a point.  In a couple of barracks in my county&mdash;these barracks were never occupied by anybody but the troops presently in them &mdash;bedding was secured from local merchants and put in there.  When the National Army came into possession of those barracks, the bedding was used by them.  This means that some of the merchants are owed up to £100.  The debt is still outstanding, because the bedding was procured some time previous to February, 1922.  It is still being used by the National Army.</P>

It is the case of an account for the use of a boat and personal services about which I received a letter this morning.  &ldquo;Since the landing of troops in Valentia on 24th August, 1922, and up to the present, my boat and services have been at the disposal of the military authorities.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding that he has travelled to Dublin for the purpose of furthering his application for payment, there is no sign of it yet.  &ldquo;On a visit to Dublin last October, I was informed that all my accounts were certified and passed for payment, but I am still waiting for an acknowledgment.&rdquo;  The account is £230, and only that he got credit for oil and petrol he would not have been able to carry on.  This is more or less confirmatory.  This is going back to October, 1922.  I will let the Minster have the facts more fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to give the Dáil and the country some explanation for the big increase in the sub-head dealing with warlike stores of from £115,000 to £136,519.  I take it that it is not at the discretion of any subordinate officer of the Army, or even of the Commander-in-Chief, <Col N="2028" /> to assume responsibility for increasing a charge like that for warlike stores in the way that it has been increased; and some explanation must be forthcoming as to the reasons why this big increase is put down in the Estimate, seeing that we have arrived at a more or less normal period.  One would imagine, on looking at it at first glance, that there was reason to expect&mdash;I will not say hope &mdash;that there was to be an outbreak of hostilities again, either from the Six Counties Boundary or something similar to what we have been going through for the last two or three years. It is not encouraging, and some explanation of it should be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, relatively, the amount is very small. Dividing 136 by 18 gives you £7 or £8 per man.  In this case there was a considerable stock, I take it, on hands on the 31st of March, and the amount that is down in the Estimate was in consequence of the existence of these supplies at that particular period.  But ordinary replacements and a more careful overhauling of existing arms are necessary now that we have got into a peace period.  The Deputy would be surprised if he knew how many defective weapons there were that were used during the war period or during the period of disturbance.  In addition to that, there are certain articles utilised in time of war which, unlike wine, do not improve with age.  And, to avoid greater complications, they are used at stated periods.  In this particular instance, some articles that we have, such as shells, would require to be used &mdash;it would be very much more expensive if they were not&mdash;and they have got to be replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, a certain amount of ammunition is required even in peace times.  The men have to go in for rifle practice, and so on, and the amount that is put down in the Estimate would amount to very little more than 10s. per month per man in the Army.  Having regard to these facts, I think the amount is not unreasonable and the fact that it is a little more than it was last year does not indicate that we have the slightest apprehension of any desire for war on our side <Col N="2029" /> of the Border or on the other side of the Border, nor do we anticipate any internal disturbances.  This is an item that I think will appear in the Estimates for years to come.  It is the normal sum.</P>

It is in Mullingar, and the contention is&mdash;shall I say, rather, for the sake of impressing the Minister, that the request is&mdash;that this work should be done by the civilian population.  It may be said to be in connection with the barracks, but it is a long way from the barracks, a considerable distance.  Soldiers are sent to do this work on the plea that it is work in connection with the barracks, and it is a matter of considerable importance to the unemployed men in the town.  I think it is reasonable to say that once the military get outside the barracks, even for work in connection with their own supplies, that some consideration should be given to the requirements <Col N="2033" /> of the local people.  I cannot advocate this as a matter of principle, but I do put it forward as a matter worthy of favourable consideration from the Government that work outside the barracks in such a connection as this should be given to the local people.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the entirely inadequate compensation that is paid to the parents of people who lose their lives because of the negligence of soldiers.  I know of one instance quite recently.  It was a case of a youngster of five or six years who was shot dead inside a military barracks, not by one of the military, but by another youngster who was allowed <Col N="2035" /> to pick up a rifle, put a charge into the breach, and fire it, blowing the top off the head of the other child.  In that case the Minister gave the parents £12. Surely that is not adequate compensation, and to my mind there should be a total revision.  It is entirely inadequate to offer £12 compensation to the parents of a child for the expense they have been at in bringing the child up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember that case.  I have given very careful and very generous consideration to those cases that have come before me. In cases where it appeared to me that there was a loss, I tried to take the point of view that at least we should do as the law prescribes an employer should do for an employee.  The number of cases is very considerable.  The amounts demanded, apart from deaths, are usually very high.  In the case of a child, while I admit that no money can pay for the loss, it must also be admitted that it is hard to establish a case for compensation.  For damages, yes, you can establish a case, but for compensation it is very difficult to draw up a certain schedule which will meet the case.  Compensation is all that we have undertaken to pay in respect of personal injury, and compensation, accordingly, is all that we could undertake to pay in the case of such incidents as the very sad and tragic one mentioned by the Deputy.  Under the Army Pensions Act, in the case of partial dependency on soldiers, the maximum sum is £100.  I can quite understand that that is neither compensation nor damages, nor anything else, but still it sets a standard, and it is rather hard to justify a departure from that.  Generally speaking, as far as it is possible to give fair consideration in the light of Personal Injuries Commission, and in the case of dependents on army pensions we have endeavoured to do what is fair in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a case that has come to my notice, where apparently no satisfaction can be obtained by the party concerned.  It was a case where a man and a woman, with two horses and cars, were going along a narrow road home from town.  An armoured car came along with a lorry <Col N="2036" /> behind it, driving at about 40 miles an hour, and rushed into the two cars. One car was smashed and the horse was killed.  A complaint was made, as a matter of fact a sworn statement was put in, and the case was put to the local military authorities by the solicitor acting on behalf of the people who had the grievance.  In this case the person has lost a horse and the loss was serious because she was a poor woman. What happened?  The officer who was responsible for the reckless driving of the armoured car was the person who was sent to investigate the complaint. Naturally, he tried to justify or to clear himself of the trouble in which he was involved, and he made a report against the case.  I submitted the matter to the Ministry of Defence, and a statement was made that nothing could be done.  The justification for that statement was that the decision of the Minister was based upon the report made by the officer who was responsible. In a case of that kind an officer other than the officer who was responsible for the local barracks, or the officer responsible for the accident, should be asked to inquire into the circumstances which led up to the accident. I think it is not fair, and certainly the report of that officer, made in these circumstances, should not be taken to be final when a complaint of this kind which, to my knowledge, in this case is justified, is being dealt with. Perhaps the Minister in a case of that kind, where the property of a citizen of the State is destroyed by the reckless driving of a military officer, would see that some compensation should be given to the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have heard of an officer who was responsible for an accident being sent to investigate it.  Usually what happens is this, that when the accident is reported a Court of Inquiry sits, hears evidence, pronounces an opinion, and the papers are forwarded.  In most cases that I have come across, even in cases which occurred a long time ago, a Court of Inquiry has been held, and a report submitted.  The files are very considerable.  I should say that they approach to something very nearly the size of the Estimates Book, <Col N="2037" /> and in some cases this Court of Inquiry actually suggested a certain sum for compensation.  But I did not come across a case in which the officer responsible for the accident was sent to investigate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-head V deals with messes, and what I want to speak about is analogous in some ways to messes.  It is harking back to wet and dry canteens, in respect of which I put a question to the President some days ago.  The matter is one of very great importance.  Facilities for recreation inside of barracks, and their extent and nature is a matter of very great importance for the rank and file of the soldiers, and the dry canteen where soldiers can get a cup of tea or coffee, or supper at night, is very important in connection with the recreative side of their work in barracks.  It will be remembered that the President gave as a reason why competitive tenders for wet and dry canteens in barracks were referred exclusively to licensed traders that in certain <Col N="2038" /> barracks, owing to the conditions of accommodation and the number of traders it was necessary to combine dry and wet canteens in the same room, and in every case it is convenient from an administrative point of view to have both canteens run by the same trader, who, obviously, must be licensed.  On the date on which that answer was given a further application for tenders appeared in the Press in respect of Boyle, Galway, Longford and Youghal, in respect of wet and dry canteens combined.  I do want to press on the President that it is absurd that a wet and a dry canteen should be run in the same room in any of our barracks, and where the conditions are such that no other arrangements can be made I would suggest that there should be no wet canteen, because otherwise it means that any young soldier, or a soldier of any kind, who wants to sit down over a cup of coffee or tea with his pals, sits down with an array of porter or whiskey bottles in front of him.  It is not fair to the men, and it is not fair to the whole tone of barrack life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where separate rooms are available the argument is put up that from an administrative point of view it is desirable that both canteens should go to the one person.  Now, administration in that matter means that you want a tender for a wet canteen, say. The person tendering says that he will set up a wet canteen, he will pay so much for rent, and he will give back so much per cent. of his gross takings into the soldiers' fund.  When you want a wet canteen and a dry canteen why could you not get a licensed trader to make an arrangement that he will return a percentage in respect of the wet canteen, and get a local confectioner who will run the dry canteen, and who will also return a certain percentage out of the profits?  Where the administrative difficulty arises I do not know.  We all know what a cup of tea or a cup of coffee can be when made, even with the best of good-will, in certain places, and if you have a person who is running a wet canteen as well as a dry canteen you will not have an attractive dry canteen, you will not have good tea or coffee, and you will not have an attractive <Col N="2039" /> place in which men can have their tea or coffee.  The matter is very important from the point of view of what tone and what atmosphere are to be around a certain side of the men's recreation in barracks, and I would urge the President to have the matter further gone into and considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy General Mulcahy in his remarks as to the advisability of keeping dry and wet canteens separate and at a considerable distance from each other.  As far as the Curragh Camp is concerned, there is no difficulty in separating them.  There is a dry canteen and a wet canteen, each built on its own site.  In other places it is advisable for the sake of our young soldiers to keep these places separate, so that soldiers will not be drawn into drinking habits.  I would like to enter a plea for the local traders in considering the question of supplies to these canteens.  Local traders give local employment, and I think they should be supported.  It is not merely a question of saying &ldquo;We will ask for tenders for these services.&rdquo;  I say that the Ministry is bound, or should be bound, to give preference to local traders. Hitherto it has been the practice to give the contract for supplies to almost all the Army commands to a man in Dublin.  We do not know how many firms are behind him.  That is constituting a ring and keeping out all those who are paying for the maintenance of the Army and keeping them from earning an honest shilling.  There are great complaints through the country that the local traders are not getting a fair chance of competing for the supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the contract as far as supplies to the canteen are concerned, is advertised publicly.  I do not know whether from the present prices which the local traders charge to an ordinary person, they would be in a position to supply in the way that a big merchant might be able to supply. What I am concerned with is that there is nothing in the Estimate as presented, to show who is in charge of the Canteen Board if there is a board, and how the funds are administered or dealt with.  I heard something about <Col N="2040" /> this canteen business and I am led to believe that the person who has the contract at present has paid a huge sum of money to the fund which Deputy Mulcahy refers to as the Canteen Fund.  If £20,000 or £30,000 is paid into the fund and if other money is available one would like to know, if it has anything to do with the Army, what are the receipts and how the money received has been expended, or, whether this Army canteen fund is simply and solely for the benefit of whoever is in charge of it.  I think some report should be put into the hands of Deputies to show how this particular fund is conducted, what money is available and into whose hands the money eventually finds its way.  What I do rise to refer to particularly is a matter to which I have already referred in the Dáil and a matter that has not been given the amount of attention and consideration it should get.  It is the general administration of the barrack services of the National Army.  We have in this Estimate a figure of £36,360 for furniture, £25,000 for utensils and chandlery, £10,550 for messes, and £5,848 for laundry.  I have had placed in my hand written statements, a number of written statements to support the statement&mdash;the charge, if you like&mdash;I make here that the barracks services are not on a proper footing.  I would like to know whether there is at the disposal of the Army Authorities or at the disposal of the Executive Council or whoever is responsible, documents to show the amount of furniture that was taken over from the British, where that furniture at present lies and whether there is any check on the furniture when it is removed from one building to another or from one building within the barracks to another, or whether it is possible for the furniture to be removed from barracks to the house of a private individual without any check on that furniture.  We all know that as a result of the trouble which broke out in the country in 1922, barracks were destroyed but previous to the destruction of these barracks&mdash;I have one or two barracks in mind; one of them is in my own area&mdash;I know 40 or 50 carts came along and took the furniture <Col N="2041" /> and other stores out of the barracks into the houses of farmers and others throughout the country.  I raised the question here before and I was assured by the ex-Minister for Defence or by somebody at any rate, that steps were being taken to discover the whereabouts of that furniture because that furniture and the stores which were taken out of these barracks are the property of the State.  It is not right that the furniture, the property of the citizens of the State, taken out of barracks in instances like that, should be allowed to remain in the houses to which it was taken without any attempt being made to recover it.  It is well known in certain districts in my area that silver spoons and officers' silver used by the British are in the houses of certain individuals. It is common property and if it is common property, if there is any secret service work being done or any attempt at all being made to recover such property, I think that property should be recovered and the people who have taken it should be punished.  The main argument I want to make is this, and I put it seriously to the Minister for Defence&mdash;and I have documentary evidence to support it&mdash;that there is no check at present with regard to the amount of furniture in these barracks. There is a check upon the amount of furniture that is handed over by the Board of Works to the military authorities but once it gets into the hands of the military there is no check, good or bad, until quite recently, as far as I know, as to where that furniture is to go in the future.  As a matter of fact it can go out the gates of the barracks without anybody having a check upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious position, and I say that if that is the position the saving shown here does not represent in reality the actual saving effected in the working of the barrack services.  Last year the figure shown was £230,000, and this year it is £77,000.  If what I say is the actual position, one cannot exactly say at the moment what the saving is, if any.  Some day or other, I take it, stock-taking will have to take place if we are to have a financial settlement with the British Government.  This is one of the things that must be gone <Col N="2042" /> into very thoroughly, and some statement will have to be made either now or in the future with regard to the form and general organisation and administration of the Barrack Services Department.  I feel that the position is so serious from the documents put in my possession that the Minister would be quite justified in demanding an inquiry and appointing some body of officers or others on the civil side to go very carefully into the position. I shall probably be asked by the President why I have not placed these documents in his hands.  I have not done so, because I know that if I placed these documents in the hands of the Minister for Defence, they would eventually find their way into the hands of some high officer of the Army, and perhaps the person who made the complaints and furnished me with the information would have the stripes taken off his arms and find himself somewhere else.  I do demand an exhaustive inquiry into the whole position of the Barracks Service administration of the Army, and particularly in regard to the furniture taken from the barracks, which found its way into the hands of people who should not have it; likewise to the check that there is upon the removal of furniture from one barracks to another, or from one part of a building to another, or whether there is any check upon furniture which may find its way out of the barracks under the existing system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question is as regards canteens.  Deputy Mulcahy objected to having a dry canteen and a wet canteen in the same room. I understood that those two canteens were thus in operation only in barracks where there was not sufficient accommodation for separate canteens, and I made the answer he referred to in good faith.  If that is not correct, I will reconsider the matter and see if some more perfect system can be adopted where there is accommodation. I would be also prepared to consider, in the event of accommodation for one canteen only being available, whether it would not serve the Army and discipline generally better if only a dry canteen was used.  As regards the question raised by Deputy Davin, Deputy Mulcahy will bear me out when I say that <Col N="2043" /> during the time he was Minister for Defence, I brought quite a number of matters to his notice without disclosing the name of my informant.  Any Deputy like Deputy Davin who may have information, can come to me and there will be no disclosure as to the source from which the information was received. These things are very important. If there be looseness in any service in the State, Deputies might well utilise their time in coming to my office and giving me personally particulars of these cases.  Otherwise, it will take a much longer time to reach that state of discipline and efficiency that we are aiming at.  I believe that directly an abuse of that sort is brought to notice and dealt with, its effect would be felt in any service.  I do not know whether the Deputy was misled in connection with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I could very soon deal with a case of that kind if it were brought to my notice.  Deputy Mulcahy will bear me out when I say that I brought cases to his notice without giving the name of my informant and put him in the way of dealing with them.  I have in my hands Defence Order 18, signed by Deputy Mulcahy and dated 14th April, 1923, which sets out the requirements of Army Finance and the manner of accounting for Army stores, and states that all articles and supplies purchased out of Army funds should be correctly brought into account in the ledgers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently this matter came under my own personal notice in connection with stocktaking.  There were nine commands until somewhere about last March or April, and they are now reduced down to four.  In that case different accounts have got to be kept for the new organisation and stocktaking had to take place.  It was delayed, I know, for some time by reason of the re-organisation, but I anticipated being able to get particulars from the Board of Works in respect of the furniture <Col N="2044" /> they have bought and of having correct accounts kept in the store and accountancy books in future, so as to see how far we can trace any matters that should have been included in the ledgers in the past.  I would be very glad to get any information which would enable us to trace goods that have been taken out of barracks.  I think it would have a very wholesome effect if it were known that we were on the track of any property that had gone belonging to the State.  Apart altogether from its disciplinary advantage, we can never get down to normal conditions until it is known that no man has a right to any property but his own.  If any Deputy will give me particulars or information regarding that or any other abuse that is going on, I will undertake to preserve his confidence in the matter.</P>

      <P>If it were definitely found that certain officers made their views quite plainly known in that matter, and if it became known that certain officers had conveyed information to him, would the President give an assurance that in that case the officers will not be victimised?</P>

      <P>I can give an undertaking that those officers will not be victimised.  But what does victimisation mean?  To some people it will mean that every time there is an opening for promotion and that that officer is not promoted he is victimised.  Suppose I give an undertaking, perhaps in 12 months of 6 months or a month I will be out of office and will my undertaking run?  The Deputy need not give me any information with regard to the officers.  I do not want that.  But I will undertake that while I am in office &mdash;and I believe I will be able to speak in that respect for the Minister who may come after me&mdash;there will not be any victimisation of such officers. But you will certainly have to understand what is meant by victimisation and how hard it is to give what you might call a blank cheque in regard to it.</P>

The profits from the canteens are, I believe, the property of the soldiers.  They are used for regimental purposes&mdash;recreation and things like that.  There must have been abuses where goods were supplied to canteens and traders not paid.  I think those traders must be very foolish.  Usually when a trader does business he wants a reference to know whom he is dealing with, and when he does not get a satisfactory reference he gets a cheque on delivery of <Col N="2046" /> the goods.  I do not know whether the traders in the Deputy's constituency are less hard-headed than traders in other parts of the country, but if they are I would advise the Deputy to address them and advise them not to give goods to people they do not know.</P>

      <P>On sub-head Z (Office of Ministry of Defence, Army Finance Office) I wish to point out the difficulty that traders in the country and persons whose goods have been commandeered find in getting compensation. This is not a new subject to the President.  It has been brought up here time and again.  I <Col N="2047" /> looked up the records and I found that up to last week 332 questions had been put in the Dáil as to payment for goods commandeered, motor cars commandeered and goods supplied, and so on. That is an average of more than three questions a day for every day that the Dáil has sat since last September.  In two or three of these cases the facts may have been contested, but not in more than two or three cases.  In the majority of cases the facts were admitted, and a statement made that payment would be made as soon as possible.  I admit frankly that both in the time of the late Minister for Defence and the present Minister once the notice of the Minister has been called to an account a settlement was arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But surely it is wrong that an ordinary trader should be obliged to communicate with a Deputy and get a question put down here before a State Department pays its debts.  There obviously must be great difficulty in certifying some of these accounts.  I admit that.  Officers who contracted them left the service or were transferred to some other part of the country and could not be traced, and the State very rightly safeguarded themselves and would not pay until it was clear that the debt had been contracted. I think, however, that the precautions taken were excessive in some cases, at least, where tradesmen&mdash;men of good reputation&mdash;were able to support their claims by the names of well-known officers, some of them Deputies in this Dáil.  Yet, they sent in their accounts again and again, and got no redress, until they got the matter taken up in the Dáil.  Knowing the difficulties as I do, I hope that that state of affairs has come to an end, because it has done more harm to the Government and more harm to the stability of the State than almost anything that has happened in the last eighteen months. Wherever you go through the country you have to stand a succession of grumbles and you hear the question, &ldquo;Why don't the Government pay their debts?  This account is now due twelve months or eighteen months, and I never would have supplied the troops if I thought it would be like this.&rdquo;  All this <Col N="2048" /> has not made people feel that there was a well-established, regularly-functioning Ministry of Defence.  Then, there are constant repetitions of the request to furnish accounts sent in already three or four times in detail.  I know that has done much harm.  I know the President has far too much to do already.  He has to attend to Foreign Relations, and to the Ministry of Finance, and to the Ministry of Defence as well.  I do not want to ask him to do impossibilities.  But I do hope that the first thing that the new Minister for Defence will do when appointed will be to set up simple, quickly-working machinery whereby these debts will be settled.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor-General manages to deal with the Army Vote for the year 1922-1923 without the slightest reference to the fact that there was a war on, and without reference to the circumstances in which the country had to provide from the different parts an Army to deal with a very intricate military situation.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has managed in his report on the accounts for 1922-1923 to deal with the accounts of the Army and to deal with criticism of the Army without putting in one word to show that there was anything but peace conditions and anything but a long-established Army.  When Deputy Cooper rises to deal with the Army Finance Office and makes a complaint that the debts are not being paid, I feel that he makes it without reference, not perhaps to the fact that 1922 and 1923 was a war period, but without reference to what was the embryo from which the Army itself came, or who was the embryo from which Army control came in that particular period.</P>

I want to say, with regard to the Army Finance <Col N="2049" /> Officer personally, and his staff, that I do not know how they managed to do their work and how persons not brought up in the very hard and philosophic school in which the Army Authorities during the past two or three years were brought up, could have met the situation, with the difficulties that had grown up around us and that they, as cold, thinking, financial-minded men, had to try and solve.  Nobody will ever know what were the difficulties of the Army Finance Officer and his staff, and nobody will ever realise the circumstances in which their difficulties arose and the widespread nature of their difficulties generally.  I feel that it is due to me to make these remarks as against the implied criticism of the work of the Army Finance Office.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to a practice which appears to be general in dealing with Army accounts.  In every Army account I have seen that has come back from the Ministry there has been ten per cent. deducted.  I have never yet seen an explanation of what the ten per cent. is for.  Ten per cent. is not a usual deduction in business accounts, especially when the account is running for two years.  The only conclusion that I can arrive at is that it is for overcharges. If I am right in that, it means that the Ministry has a suspicion that every trader in the country is a rogue.</P>

      <P>That is the impression that is created throughout the country.  I would like very much to endorse Deputy Cooper's remarks as to the very bad effect that the nonpayment of these accounts is having on the credit of this country.  I think every Deputy will back me up when I say that the universal cry is, &ldquo;Why do the Government not pay their debts?&rdquo; I quite agree with Deputy General Mulcahy when he refers to the difficulties, but the difficulties do not cover 50 per cent. of cases.  For months there have been Claims Officers in every Command, but I have not yet seen the result of their work.  I do not say that they have not done their work; I believe they have.  I believe <Col N="2050" /> that these officers have inquired into every individual case, but still the money is not forthcoming.  I wish to bring the matter of the ten per cent. discount very strongly to the Minister's notice.  I will give an instance of an account which I saw.  When the document came back from the Ministry the 10 per cent. was deducted first, and then other deductions began, with the result that the deductions amounted to over 50 per cent. of the total account.</P>

It was not his duty to justify or excuse any faults in accounts. But undoubtedly running through the memoranda there is the inference that things were overlooked by him, after reference to the Minister for Finance, which would not have been overlooked but for the circumstances. Deputy Cooper has said something about reputable firms having made claims.  I do not want to defend the Army Accounts Department for having delayed payment, but inasmuch as Deputy Cooper asked for the report of the Public Accounts Committee, I may not be overstepping my duty if I say that the Public Accounts Committee has had its attention drawn to certain reputable firms having grossly overcharged, and it is the view of the Committee that the names of those reputable firms shall be published in the Committee's Report.</P>

      <P>Something like 50,000 or 60,000 accounts altogether have passed through the Army Finance Office.  Naturally, with such a large number, covering such a multitude of various and complicated items&mdash;because they were both various and complicated&mdash;I think it is not a bad result to have to say that only 1,600 now remain out.  Even with that 1,600 there <Col N="2051" /> are cases coming in every other day of old accounts, etc.  In certain cases very much larger purchases were made than are made by the ordinary man in the street.  That will be admitted.  Ten per cent. is not an exorbitant reduction to make in such cases.  I have heard of one case in which certain articles of clothing figured very largely in the items, which, I think, no one with a smaller purse than Deputy Cooper would have in his wardrobe.  In that case huge quantities were ordered. After the account had been paid this matter was brought to the notice of some of the officials, and they put in a claim for ten per cent. reduction, and got back something like £500.  The ten per cent. reduction, I think, was made at a time when a schedule of prices was not in operation.  Now that a schedule of prices is in operation&mdash;and a great many people object to it&mdash;there is no deduction of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of cases occurred in which one could scarcely rely upon the certification of officers.  I do not mean to make any imputations or to deal unjustly with officers, but it is well known that certain people are not business-like people and they will offhandedly put their name to a document, not realising the importance of it or what it means.  I am positively certain that a large number of such certificates must have been obtained.  When that became known in the Army Finance Office extra precautions had to be taken.  The unfortunate thing about these accounts is that, supposing 50, 60 or 70 per cent. of the claimants were honest, the other 30 per cent., or whatever proportion it would be, put the onus on the Army Finance Office of applying the same principle to all, and, in consequence, delay, confusion and dissatisfaction were bound to accrue. I quite admit that when I was going round the country last year the principal cause of complaint was the Army accounts, and I would have been inclined off-hand to say, &ldquo;Pay them and get them out of the way, some way or other.&rdquo;  Then, when one has to deal with the Comptroller and Auditor-General, it was a question whether it was better to suffer the particular sort of trouble involved in explaining why <Col N="2052" /> payment could not be made, or being impeached in the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Report.  On the whole, I think that I can subscribe to what Deputy General Mulcahy says, that this office has worked very well in the circumstances. I think it started a little late at the work, and it must have started not suitably mobilised for this particular class of work; but I think that within the next few months, at any rate, we ought to be entirely free from all those claims, even from those that are going to come in.</P>

May we expect when there is a revision in the method of presenting Army Estimates that the Dáil will be supplied with some information as to how the revenue of the Army Canteens is disposed of?

I understand before the canteens were put on a proper working basis some costs were incurred in respect of that particular service, and some of the profits earned in respect of rebates went to discharge that particular liability.  The Army does not enter into possession of any of these moneys which are exclusively devoted to the benefit of the soldiers.  I think the Quartermaster-General is the officer who would have charge of that Department, but only as a sort of trustee, not as a beneficiary trustee.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring before the Dáil the policy of the Department in respect of the amounts paid in gratuities to the dependents of soldiers who were in the National Army, and who were killed during the last two years.  To my mind, the amounts that have been paid can only be described as disgraceful.  A number of cases have been brought to my notice within the last few months, and I am sure to the notice of other Deputies also, in which fathers or mothers of soldiers who were killed in the fighting that took place within the last few years were offered as compensation for the loss of their sons&mdash;and in some cases they were only sons&mdash;anything from £10 upwards.  I have a case in mind where a poor old woman, whose only son was killed while serving in the National Army, was awarded the munificent sum of £30.  That was what she was offered for a son who she expected would support her in her old age.  I think that is something we should be ashamed of.  I would appeal <Col N="2055" /> to the Minister to look into the matter himself, so that the dependents of men who lost their lives in the service of the State will receive better treatment. The case where a woman was offered £30 for the loss of her only son was typical of a number of other cases that I could mention here, where £30, £40 and £50, and in some cases less, was offered.  I think the President will admit that such offers are unworthy of the State.</P>

He had been working in Dublin, in the Anglo-American Oil Company, and after he was killed his people got a pension of 7/- a week.  That pension was afterwards stopped.  Before he joined the Army he was contributing 35/- per week to the support of the house.  The only answer I got from the Minister for Defence when I raised the question was that the matter had been investigated and that there was not a sufficient amount of evidence to support the claim that he was supporting the household.  I think in a case like that there should be a little elasticity. This man joined up and was killed at the very beginning of the fight, and I think that the Government should not be so penurious as they are in cases like that.</P>

      <P>I want to support the view expressed by Deputy Morrissey. It seems to me the method adopted for judging the amount to be granted and the basing of that amount upon the sum contributed by the soldier before his death to the family is not satisfactory.  I think the circumstances of life under which these men had been living is forgotten, and the circumstances of their family is not taken into account.  The father and mother bring up a young fellow until he is 19 or 20 years of age.  He is only just beginning to earn money to help his parents.  He may be the eldest son. They have been looking forward to a time at least a few years hence when he would be of some assistance to the house and when he would help in bringing <Col N="2056" /> the younger children forward.  He joins the Army and is killed, and the estimate taken seems to be the amount that he was contributing to the family at the time of his death.  I know it may seem difficult to estimate what he would have contributed, but there does not seem to be sufficient account taken of the practice, or shall I say the usages, in working-class households when you come to the time when young men begin to contribute something to keep the home going and to be of some assistance to their parents. When the young man is killed the hopes and expectations are vanished and the whole family suffers, not merely the parents but the younger children also, and it seems to me there has been a failure on the part of the Ministry to realise the circumstances in which the people of the working classes who joined the Army in such large numbers live.</P>
      <P>There are very great grievances and very many complaints about the manner in which this matter has been dealt with.  We are reminded of the position in other circumstances.  We are reminded of the pensions granted and the positions of the British soldiers and so on and so on.  But it seems to me that there are altogether too many complaints of niggardliness in regard to the gratuities to parents who have suffered.  To make an estimate on the amount the young man would contribute, when he was only a few years out of school, and to say there has been no loss, or that the loss has been small, is not the way to deal with this matter. I think it is absolutely necessary if one wants to be fair and equitable that the circumstances and reasonable expectations of that young man should be taken into account and the position of the parents and the family as a whole should be noted.  I think the complaints are justified, and I hope that there will be some change in policy and a review of those cases already decided to the detriment of the dependents and relatives, in contrast with what ought to have been done.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the protest made regarding the treatment meted out to the dependents of those who have died for their country.  I put <Col N="2057" /> questions and probably have drawn attention to at least twenty or thirty cases within the last twelve months, and have received the usual answer one is becoming accustomed to now in this House, and reminding me of the answers I was in the habit of getting in another place&mdash;answers prepared by officials who evidently have no sympathy whatever with the dependents or with the complaints in the cases mentioned. When Ministers stand up they read these replies in a way that shows they have not read the questions at all. I wish to draw attention to one or two cases where eldest sons, at a time when it was not fashionable, gave their valuable lives to their country.  I will mention one case where a young man was killed in the Custom House fire, and when his parents made application for a pension they were told the case was carefully considered, but simply because the father had a wage of £3 or £4 a week he was told there was no dependency proved in the case, and, therefore, it was one in which no award could be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Pension Committee, with their niggardly policy and narrowminded way examined this case, they forgot that this was an eldest son upon whom the father had spent a considerable sum of money in educating him and making him fit for life, and hoping that he would get such employment, as his education entitled him to, and that he would be in a position to help to rear the rest of the children and fit them to earn their own livelihood.  But because the father had a wage of £3 or £4 a week, when this gallant young man was shot down by Black and Tans he is told it is not a case in which an award could be made.  I hold that this is a case anyway for reconsideration and more sympathetic treatment than has been given to it by the Pensions Committee.  I drew attention by question a few days ago to what I consider to be the most dastardly treatment that was meted out to anybody by the Government in the case of a Mrs. Lowe, of Liverpool.  She had three sons working in Liverpool, and she was herself caretaker of a well-known warehouse, where she had a wage of 30/- per week and a house free.  The youngest boys in Liverpool <Col N="2058" /> joined the Fianna Scouts; the eldest boy was in the Volunteers, and on instructions from Dublin the policy was announced that it was time to have retaliation for the burnings that were taking place in Ireland, and volunteers were called for in Liverpool to burn farms and houses of some well-known persons near Liverpool so as to draw attention to what was going on here at home.  This woman's three sons, with some other young fellows from Liverpool volunteered to do any work that Ireland demanded them to do.</P>
    <P>They succeeded in one case, in what was afterwards described in the newspapers as &ldquo;the farm fires.&rdquo;  They went out the next night to do the same thing, but they forgot that forewarned is forearmed.  The owners of the adjoining farm lay in wait armed to see who was going to trespass on their property.  Five of the young men who had torches and the usual equipment to do the work they were asked to do escaped, but the owner of the place&mdash;a farmer&mdash;shot this woman's son in the knee.  He was compelled to surrender and was arrested.  He was brought before the courts later and was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude. He served twelve months in Dartmoor prison, and was then released under a general amnesty.  While he was away in Dartmoor&mdash;or rather immediately after his arrest&mdash;his mother was dismissed from her employment.  She lost not only her wage of thirty shillings a week but her home as well, while her other two boys, who were in the Fianna, were dismissed from their employment, and the result was that the family was left practically penniless on the streets of Liverpool.  The family proceeded to Dublin, and, at the call to arms here, her two boys, who were under age, and the other son, a grown young man, although wounded in Liverpool by English guns, joined the National Army, In the streets of Dublin, in an ambush in Capel Street, this young man was killed.  It took nearly two years to consider the case of this poor woman, who at this time was living in a tenement slum in a back kitchen in Dublin. After two years' consideration of her case she was awarded the magnificent sum of £100, and they would not even <Col N="2059" /> give her that amount in one payment. The award was to be paid in four quarterly instalments.</P>

I ask the Minister if he thinks that is a worthy case to have exposed in this Dáil?  I asked him on another occasion to consider this lady's claim to proper treatment for the loss of her son who was killed, for the loss of her own employment and the loss of her home, and for the loss of employment on the part of her two other boys.  I will leave that case now and take up one in connection with the Custom House fire.  I desire to ask the Minister now when he intends to fulfil his promise with regard to tubercular and neurasthenic cases.  The cases of men who are suffering from these diseases have not yet been settled by Act of Parliament, but the Minister promised some time ago that he would give some consideration to them.  There are not more than one hundred of them in Ireland&mdash;I mean cases of young men who lay out on the hillsides and who contracted diseases from sleeping on wet haystacks.</P>

I have one more case to draw attention to.  It is a case in which a young man&mdash;I do not know whether it was in an ambush or not&mdash; was shot in the streets of Dublin.  He eventually joined the Army.  He was discharged as medically unfit.  He applied for a pension, but was told that he is not entitled to get one.  He applied for compensation for personal injuries, and was told that there was no disability proved in his case.  By one Committee he is told that he is a fit man; and by another Committee he is told that he is an unfit man.  Surgeon Barniville certified that the man was &ldquo;20 per cent. disability,&rdquo; and his certificate is in the hands of the Committee. At the same time the man gets nothing, because some other medical men say that he is not suffering from any sort of physical disability.  I ask the President to afford an opportunity for a review of the cases that I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw attention to the great delay that takes place in paying compensation to men suffering from wounds.</P>
      <P>I have put before the Dáil on a few occasions, by way of question, the cases of wounded men, and they were dealt with in a most expeditious manner afterwards.  It should not, however, be necessary to bring these matters before the Dáil, as whoever is responsible should see that when claims from wounded men come in they should be dealt with immediately, especially as these men are not in a financial position to maintain themselves without help from the State in the service of which they lost the use of their limbs, or were in other ways prevented from earning their livelihood.  The pensions or <i>ex gratia</i> amounts given to wounded men are not sufficient in a number of cases.  I know one case in which a man lost his right hand, and he was awarded a sum of £40 a year for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2062" /> Under the Workmen's Compensation Act he would be entitled to something like £200.  I hope the matter of wounded men will receive more prompt attention in the future, and that they will be looked after in a more expeditious manner than heretofore.  There is a good deal to be said as regards subhead B, but as the Minister is, no doubt, anxious to get this Vote through to-night it is not my intention to delay the Dáil.  I will mention one case, however, in which a boy of fourteen years of age was taken into the National Army as a soldier and was accidentally shot.  The father, by way of compensation, received £15.  There is another case, that of John Moore, of Ballinacardy, Westmeath.  I asked for an inquiry to be held into this case to find out the circumstances under which this man received the wounds which caused his death.  I have been told by the ex-Minister for Defence that an inquiry would be held.  I further asked him whether the father of the deceased soldier would get an opportunity of giving evidence, and I was told that he would be notified.  The boy was wounded in Castlebar on the 12th August, 1922, and died on the 19th August of that year.  The remains were taken home by six soldiers, who left the coffin on the floor without giving any explanation as to whether the man had been murdered or shot, accidentally or intentionally.  Three weeks later Major-General McKeown was asked by the father for an explanation.  His letter was not acknowledged, and I went to Athlone myself, and Major-General McKeown took me through the different offices, and I found that that young man's death was not registered in any books in the barracks.</P>
    <P>Things went on, and about twelve months afterwards the father was told that the boy was accidentally wounded and died from the results of the wound. The son was the only support the father had.  The father is an old man. I appeal to the Minister, in view of the circumstances of the case, to have it reconsidered with a view to giving some help or compensation to the father.  I am told that there is much dissatisfaction over the way some parents have been treated under the <Col N="2063" /> Army Pensions Act.  The maximum given in the case of a private is £100, and in that of an officer £150.  In the case of Brigadier Adamson, of Athlone, his parents have been granted £100.  Surely that is an insufficient award in such a case as that.  There are other cases where a son was not employed prior to joining the National Army, and when he was killed in an engagement or ambush his parents got no compensation because he had not contributed to the upkeep of the home.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will take into account these very deserving cases, and will see that some compensation will be granted to parents who have suffered their children as a sacrifice to the peace and freedom of this country.</P>

      <P>I would like to impeach the general administration of the Act.  I would like to impeach the Act itself, but I suppose, if I did so, I would be ruled out of order.  I will follow much on the lines already sketched by most of the Deputies who have spoken.  The pensions have not been based upon what one might call a reasonable standard.  The awards have been based on a particularly low standard, and, as a matter of fact, there does not seem to be a settled standard at all.  Then there is the slowness with which awards have been made.  Other Deputies and I have heard of cases in which those who are seeking pensions made application months, possibly close on two years, ago, and their claims have not yet been considered.</P>

      <P>Well, perhaps it is very close on the full limit. I have some cases in which there has been a delay of six months, at least. There is one case which will be more or less typical, and I think we should give typical cases to the Minister.  I submitted it recently to the Ministry, but it was turned down as being a case in which the dependents are entitled to nothing.  It is a case of a young man who was employed in a bank and who left the bank and joined an active service unit previous to the Truce.  On the <Col N="2064" /> outbreak of the unfortunate civil war he joined the National Army.  He travelled from his native Clare to Donegal, where he was killed.  Repeated applications were made for some allowances for his parents, and it was stated that they were not entitled to any allowances because dependency could not be proved.  It was hinted, not in writing, but orally, that because they could afford to give him an education that fitted him to be a bank clerk, the parents were perhaps sufficiently well off as not to need anything in the way of compensation.  The only reason why he acquired a secondary education was because there was a good secondary school in the district which he attended and at which the tuition was practically free.  He left his position in the bank, fought in the Anglo-Irish War, and then was killed in the Civil War.  There are letters from him to his mother, in which something like this occurs:&mdash; Enclosed herewith a postal order for £5, £3, or 30s.  There is a certain amount of pride in the Irish people, and they do not always say &ldquo;my mother is dependent on me,&rdquo; and the mother does not always say &ldquo;my son is dependent on me,&rdquo; Those letters should be taken as sufficient proof.  I think nothing can prove it as well as the letters.  If a son sent a money order for 30s, or anything else, it does not mean that the mother is dependent on that amount, but there is an implication that it goes to support her.  He may not have said &ldquo;my mother is dependent on me,&rdquo; and possibly the mother might not have said to the officer, &ldquo;my son, who is an officer in the National Army, is supporting me.&rdquo; Those are cases that require investigation. I give that as a typical case; yet that was turned down by the Minister, and I was told that nothing could be done in the case as dependency was not proved.  I have cases very much on similar lines to the one I quoted, and I think the Government has interpreted the Act&mdash;I might say infringed the provisions of the Act&mdash;by enforcing it too much in the letter and too little in the spirit.</P>

If you were to take these figures as what would be paid in the following three-quarters of a year, the estimate should not exceed £68,000.

No application was made to me that the four instalments should be paid in one.  If the Deputy chooses to get up here, and let his constituents know what a great man he is, it is no affair of mine.  I was in Geneva last year where something like 52 nations were assembled, and in the Department of Labour, which is one of the most important institutions in that place, this Act was cited as a model, and a great Act.  It does not come up to Deputy Byrne's expectations.  When he is President he can produce a better Act, perhaps the greatest Act that will ever be passed.</P>
      <P>And if he can find money for it when he is President I will say that Deputy Byrne is a great man.  With regard to these officials who are complained of in this case, I may say that I have examined the cases that have come before me, and I have a little knowledge of this particular Act, and I do not think that there is any more painful duty than dealing with those cases.  The officials who deal with them cannot exercise their wish in the matter; they must exercise their functions according to the Act, and not according to Deputy Byrne's wishes in the matter. They cannot regard a case which is only a case of dependency as a case for a pension, and if Deputy Byrne does not know that up to to-night, I think that it is only fair, in the interests of his constituents and of himself, that I should give him that particular instruction under the Act.</P>

    <P>Dependency must be proven.  If a man has £3 or £4 a week, and his eldest son is killed, and he cannot prove dependency upon that eldest son, I should like to know whether the Deputy's contention is that the Committee or the body or the tribunal dealing with this particular Act has a right to say: &ldquo;We will drive a coach and four through the Act.&rdquo;  They must take the cases as they are, and they must deal with the facts as they are before them.  And if <Col N="2068" /> Deputy Byrne will only denounce the Ministry, and will not assist the Ministry by helping his constituents to make up their cases before they go before the tribunal, then it is, perhaps, because those constituents are not properly represented. Just as bad a case as that mentioned by Deputy Byrne has come before me, but I did not bring it here to the House and complain about it.  I saw the friends of the person in question and advised them as to the best way of dealing with the matter, but I told them at the same time that I was not sure whether or not they would be successful.  I was not looking for an advertisement.  Deputies may complain about the amounts.  I admit that the amounts are small, but they are not at the option of the Committee.  The Committee simply regards £100 as the maximum allowance for dependency in the case of a soldier, and they have to graduate below that according to a certain percentage.  Recently I have not sanctioned any case at a lesser sum than £50.  There were some sums lower than that some time ago, but recently there has been no lower sum awarded, I think, than £50.  The Committee is bound to establish some sort of scale of dependency.  When you get out of the dependency scale into the other scale there is only a particular pension to be awarded.  In the case of a mother or a wife, and, in some cases, of a sister the sum is set down.  I think it is 17s. 6d. for a widow and 15s. for a mother in the case of soldiers; and in cases of officers £90 for a widow and £50 or £52 a year in the case of a mother.  Within those terms the Committee are bound.</P>
    <P>A case was raised here by a Deputy who, I think, is not now in the House. He asked why it was, in a particular instance, that a person only got paid from the 1st January, 1924, and why it was that owing her £104 we did not discharge that debt.  Now, we did not owe it.  It was a line-ball case in which there was a difficulty in seeing whether or not she was a dependent, but they decided to give her a pension, and that the pension should start from the 1st April, 1924.</P>
    <P>That is one of the few cases where, properly speaking, it was probably a <Col N="2069" /> dependency case, and more than likely the Auditor-General would be entitled to challenge that particular payment. I read every single one of these cases from the beginning to the end.  The Civic Guard or the D.M.P. make reports in the cases in the area under our jurisdiction.  In other cases we get reports from the police in England and Scotland, or from some charitable organisation which can be dependent on. All the facts are there, and it is not a question of the whim of an official.  He has no more right to act on his whim than Deputy Byrne has.  He is bound by the circumstances and facts of the case, and has to give his decision accordingly.  There might possibly be a miscalculation to the extent of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. as to whether or not there was partial dependency to the full extent, or whether it was only semi-partial dependency. Deputies will understand that when there were two sons in the Army and two sons at home, it is a fair case for saying that it should be distributed broadly among the four.  In that case, they would not be entitled to make a case of absolute dependency.  It should be only partial.  Deputy Byrne is wrong in his figures with regard to tuberculosis.  It is one of those cases where every possible attempt is made to discount the Government, and to say the Government has money in its pocket and will not pay it out.</P>

      <P>No, I cannot say the number; but I can say, in answer to Deputy Wilson's point, that we have dealt with possibly two-thirds of the cases, and certainly one-third has yet to come on.  If I said we had dealt with about seven-twelfths of the cases it might be nearer the mark.  We have now, I think, three Army Boards dealing with these cases, and we have got sittings of each Board dealing with these cases, and we have also sitting on the Board that assesses compensation one representative of four Dublin Hospitals, so that there can be no doubt that every precaution is taken to see that no cases mentioned by Deputy Byrne can slip <Col N="2070" /> through.  It is possible one case might, but every effort is made by us that can be made to secure that a man gets a fair hunt for his pension.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand from what the Minister has said that if I put a case, such as the case I mentioned, where an only son was killed, and, say, that he entered the Army at 18 or 19 years of age, and at the time of entering the Army his mother might not have been actually dependent upon him, that no consideration would be given to the fact that if he had not been killed he would possibly be in a position to support his mother?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am afraid not.  That is one of the things I intended to embody in the new Act. That is a potential dependency.  In the case mentioned by Deputy Hogan, Clare, the answer is unfortunately no. I think I know the case.  A very distinguished gentleman from the Deputy's constituency brought it under my notice.  I do not think it would be possible to establish dependency, but if there are witnesses other than what have come before me I would be glad to hear them.  I do not think it would be possible in that case to establish dependency.  I showed this distinguished gentleman from Clare the facts regarding this case, and he was satisfied on the facts presented that it would not be possible to establish dependency.</P>

      <P>No.  I am afraid, as far as that is concerned, that we have not been able to do anything: but we are open to suggestions that may be made by the officers or men themselves, and to give them very fair consideration.</P>
