      <P>The President has asked me to reply as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The announcement made by Mr. Justice Feetham is to the following effect:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Since my arrival from South Africa I have seen President Cosgrave and Sir James Craig, and they have both agreed to my acting during the interval referred to on the lines of the suggestion made in Mr. Ramsay MacDonald's letters, and are giving me opportunities of informal discussion for the purpose of seeing whether an agreed settlement can be reached.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is, of course, understood that any such discussion is entirely without prejudice to the position taken by either Government in reference to the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I saw Mr. Justice Feetham on two occasions, and agreed to his proposal that he should make a tour of the Border, and I promised him, on behalf of the Authorities of the Saorstát, all facilities for the purpose of the tour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever Mr. Justice Feetham wishes to see me, for the purpose of informal discussion, with a view to seeing whether an agreed settlement <Col N="786" /> can be reached; or for any other purpose in connection with the settlement of the Boundary Question, I shall be prepared to see him.  No agreement or arrangement has been arrived at, in any way inconsistent with the claim of the Executive Council, that full effect should be given to Article 12 of the Treaty, and that, for that purpose, the Boundary should be determined by the Commission, in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants.</P>
    <P>If any informal discussion, such as is referred to by Mr. Justice Feetham, should hereafter take place between the Judge and me, and as a result thereof any definite step were proposed which would in any way conflict with the policy of the Executive Council, as disclosed in the published correspondence and statements in the Dáil, it would, of course, be my duty to put the Dáil at once in possession of the facts and information in connection with such proposal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he can state whether Michael O'Sullivan, Knocknacolan, Kanturk, is entitled to dependent's allowance in respect of either, or both, of his sons, Denis and George, who are at present serving in the National Army; and, if so, when it is intended to pay same, as the claimant is very badly off, and has been served with notice to quit his cottage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The claims made by Mr. O'Sullivan in respect of his sons, Denis and George, were disallowed, after due investigation, on the ground that the net amount contributed towards the upkeep of the home by each of the sons for a reasonable period prior to enlistment was less than the minimum required by the regulations, namely, 12/- per week, before an allowance might be issued.  Notifications to this effect were sent to the parents on 19th June, 1923, and 13th May, 1924.</P>
      <P>I may add that the regulations governing the matter were based on an obligation on the part of a solidier to contribute to his home a reasonable portion&mdash;about a third&mdash;of his Army pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be possible, if the claim be re-considered in the light of taking the joint contributions to find out if the necessary amount of 12/- a week had been contributed by the two sons instead of by each son?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to look into that.  It would appear from the particulars before me that even the joint contributions would scarcely make up the sum sufficient to qualify for the allowance, but I will undertake to look into it.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first query is nil, to the second 296, to the third 5, to the fourth nil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The hours stated by the Deputy for the opening and closing of the Botanic Gardens are correct and have been in existence since the year 1895.  The proposal to have an earlier opening on Sundays and later closing on both Sundays and week-days, which would, of course, entail increased expenditure, will be carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, the proposal to keep the Gardens open a little later seems to be reasonable, and it is getting consideration from that point of view.  Both suggestions, made by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Cooper, will be considered.  I understand Deputy Cooper's suggestion is to close for one day entirely, and to open later the other days.  There is another possibility: that is to open for three months in the summer till later hours.  Both of these are being considered.</P>

      <P>The Joint Committee on Standing Orders relative to Private Business report that in the case of the application for leave to introduce the Dublin United Tramways Bill, 1924, they have received an appeal, lodged by the Promoters of the Bill, against the decision of the Examiner, that the Standing Orders had not been complied with; that they have dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Examiner; that they recommend that compliance with Standing Order No. 8 be dispensed with in this case, and that leave be given to introduce the Bill.</P>

      <P>Standing Orders relative to Private Bills provide that the main object of the Bill should be advertised.  The Examiner held that one of the main objects had not been advertised.

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can relieve Deputy Johnson's mind without referring to the report at a later stage.  The Examiner of Private Bills ruled that Standing Orders had not been complied <Col N="794" /> with, one of the principal objects not having been set forth&mdash;that being to enable the Dublin Tramways Company to acquire shares in other transport companies.  The Committee decided that such was a principal object, and it had not been inserted in the advertisements.  Inasmuch as the section was included in the Articles of Association of the Tramway Company, no private individual was prejudiced by the fact that it did not appear in the advertisements, and the Committee recommended that the Standing Orders should be dispensed with.  It was purely a matter for the shareholders of the company, and was already covered by the Articles of Association. The company cannot acquire shares by compulsion.  They can only acquire them by consent, so no undertaking was prejudiced, and the shareholders were already safeguarded.  No one is a bit the worse for it.  It was purely a technical matter, and the Committee decided unanimously that compliance with the Standing Orders should be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>If this Report is not accepted, presumably the Bill will cease to be, as the Standing Orders have not been complied with.  If the recommendation that they be dispensed with is rejected by the Dáil the Bill can go no further.  Incidentally, you put your Standing Orders Committee in an awkward position.</P>

      <P>With regard to Estimate 44, before we take up the Education Bill in Committee I should explain that Estimate.  A technical point was raised here before, I think, as to this coming under the Minister for Agriculture.  These Estimates were printed before the Ministers and Secretaries Bill came into operation, but it is the Minister for Education will answer for the greater part of it, and he desires it should not be taken to-day.</P>

    <P>The third item proposes to delete Section 2 of the Intermediate Education Act, Ireland, 1914, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From and after the commencement of this Act, there shall be paid to the Board each year out of moneys provided by Parliament a sum not exceeding forty thousand pounds, provided by Parliament, and an amount equivalent to the sum so paid (in this Act referred to as the Teachers Salaries Act) shall be applied by the Board in manner provided by rules made by the Lord Lieutenant under the Act, and approved by the Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Seeing that this matter was debated fully on the occasion of the Second Reading of this measure, and that the whole debate centred around the deletion of this paragraph, I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the matter again at great length.  The opinion was held then that if this paragraph were deleted the rules governing the distribution of the Teachers' Salaries Grant, which were framed in pursuance of this section, would, as a matter of course, fall if the section were repealed.  That was the case which we made, and we object to that because these rules are very important so far as the position of secondary teachers is concerned.</P>
    <P>The rules provided that a minimum salary would be paid, that a contract of agreement would be entered into in each case, and further that a certain definite number of lay teachers would be employed in the schools.  The Minister expressed some doubt on that occasion <Col N="797" /> with regard to the contention which was then made to the effect that the rules would go if the section went.  I am now in a position to say that the opinion which we then expressed has been reinforced by the very definite opinion of a leading lawyer who was consulted in the matter, and who has given it as his opinion pretty definitely that if this section is repealed the rules will go along with it; and not only that, but that, as a matter of fact, it wipes out the £40,000 grant altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister was rather unfortunate, I think, in his first Bill in putting into that Bill this provision, which created a very considerable amount of suspicion, if I may use the word, although, perhaps, the word may be too strong&mdash; a considerable amount of uneasiness in the minds of the secondary teachers. His announcement yesterday, of course, will have gone some way to remove that uneasiness, but undoubtedly there was very considerable ground for uneasiness in the fact that his first measure was a proposal which, in fact, took away from the secondary teachers what they had fought for so strenuously in 1914.  But the principal point to which I wish to direct attention is that for the main purpose for which the Bill is intended it is not necessary to make this repeal.  The main purpose for which the Bill is intended is to give permission to the Department to alter the basis on which grants are distributed to Intermediate schools.  It is necessary to secure that alteration in order to effect the first two repeals mentioned in the Schedule; but I maintain that it is not necessary for that purpose to have the third item inserted in the Bill, for the reason that the Department has full freedom to alter the Rules, if an alteration is necessary, on which the distribution of this particular grant is based.  I, therefore, move the amendment.  I think that the Minister must know from the Debate which took place on the Second Reading what the case is, and how strong the case for the abolition of this particular item is.</P>

      <P>I accept the amendment moved by Deputy O'Connell. <Col N="798" /> As I am accepting the amendment I think the less I argue the question the better.  I did hold the view that even if it were held to be a technical legal result of the repeal of that section that the rules based on that section also went along with it, no responsible Minister could in such a manner allow rules to lapse which had an important bearing on the status of a large body of teachers, and that if that were the legal result of repealing the section, it would be necessary to find other means to secure that regulations of that kind were not allowed to lapse. However, as I have said, as I am accepting the amendment, it is unnecessary for me to argue the subject further.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £34,999, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1925, to pay the salaries, and expenses of the Ministry of External Affairs.</P>
      <P>It will be seen that this Vote covers activities under three heads:&mdash;Head-quarters' External Affairs; Representatives abroad, and Publicity Department. It will be seen also that this Vote represents a considerable reduction on last year, particularly when you notice that it now includes sums of money which last year were put under the heading &ldquo;Home Affairs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Public Works and Buildings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I had better say a few words, beginning with Publicity and ending with Headquarters' External Affairs.  The Publicity Department has decreased its expenditure by, roughly, one-half.  This work falls into two classes.  One activity of it might be described as a Public Record Office.  It is necessary for this Government, as for every other Government, to be informed as to what is happening in the world, what is being stated in the Press of the world, and in other periodical publications; and for that reason, instead of each Department in the Government having such a Record Office it is found more efficient and more economical to concentrate that matter in one office.  The work there, then, is to note the Press and other publications of various countries in the world, and to call the attention of each Ministry to such information as may be likely to interest them, and to keep a record and to keep files of any cases of important publications, and to keep a general record of all such matters as may either now or at any time in the future be required to be referred to. Apart from that we require to have some machinery for conveying information or for rectifying misinformation. <Col N="800" /> It must be remembered that practically every country does this; and most countries are much better situated for doing it than we are.  To begin with, we are a new country and an unknown quantity in the world.  Ireland is not only an unknown quantity in a neutral form, but in a negative form. We have a definitely anti-Irish Press, particularly in the greatest news distribution centre in the world, namely, London; and we have recognised the fact that for the sake of our commercial relations, and for the sake of our general good name in the world we do require not to be misled.  Every country has such a Department, but other countries have an advantage that we have not got, and it is this: that the Press of other countries is usually supplied with a certain number of representatives in foreign countries; and the usual system is that the foreign representatives of newspapers who are away from their own country usually get in touch with the political representation in that country, and those journalists act as a channel for information and for correct information concerning their own country in the foreign countries in which they are living.  Our Irish Press does not indulge in such a foreign news service. I think it has to be generally recognised that our Irish Press depends almost to an exclusive degree upon the London News Agencies.  Therefore it is necessary to maintain this Department for some time to come at any rate.</P>
    <P>In the early days of our existence this Department had another activity, namely, what we may call pro-State propaganda in this country.  That was a very difficult situation to be faced with, because there was always the question as to whether the information which we put out could be considered as pro-State, or whether it might not be regarded as pro any one shade of opinion in the country.  As far as I was concerned, I endeavoured, when we were doing such work, to confine the activities of that Department to the narrowest limits of pro-State propaganda; but I admit that there was very often considerable doubt as to where the pro-State began or ended and where the pro-Party began.  Apart from that, <Col N="801" /> there are certain forms of advertisements which every Government has to indulge in.  For instance, during the last year we had to advertise the National Loan.  The publicity work of that was done by this Department.  We had also to conduct a certain amount of publicity work for recruitment for the army.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the representatives abroad.  You will see here that we have a certain number of representatives abroad.  One office has been closed during the period of last year.  It was closed owing to resignation and owing to the fact that at the time the resignation took place we were considering whether that office was well situated in Berlin or whether, with the view of promoting trade between Ireland and Germany, it would not be better situated in another city.  The re-establishment of the German office is being considered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and by our Ministry, but so far we have not re-established that office.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, these foreign offices must be considered as preparing the ground rather than doing anything particular, although they have succeeded in doing very good work.  They procure and have procured a very considerable amount of valuable information concerning markets in districts for things produced in the Saorstát, and that information has led to a decided improvement in our exports to these countries.  During the first four months of this year, approximately, the value of the direct exports from this country &mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo;&mdash;to the United States of America was £87,549; to Belgium, £48,985; to France, £18,425; to Holland, £6,314. These representatives provide our manufacturers with information which has enabled them to procure materials from these countries at lower costs than might otherwise have been incurred. But, actually, the work of these representatives is to prepare the ground.  It is very difficult to procure trade at the present moment owing to the instability of the foreign exchanges. I do not need to repeat again here that there is one big industry here; I will not mention the percentage <Col N="802" /> it represents.  It is certainly the overwhelming industry in this country.</P>
    <P>There is that fact.  And then we have the other fact, that we have not only one overwhelming industry, but we have practically only one market. For the future well-being of this country it is undoubtedly necessary that we should be looking round and endeavouring to find new markets for our goods and endeavouring to build up trade with a more general distribution than it has at present.  I need only point out, or suggest to the imagination of Deputies, what would have been the position of this country, for instance, if foot-and-mouth disease took a serious hold here, or if that disease took such a serious hold in England as to cut off our cattle trade with England. There is no doubt about it that it is necessary for us to do what we can to explore possible new markets for our trade.  These representatives abroad are doing that.  They have succeeded to a certain extent, and I recognise myself that we cannot expect, for the time being, to build up any large new trade until such time as the world is generally more stabilished than it is at present.</P>
    <P>Apart from that work, we have two offices in America.  We have an office in Washington and an office in New York.  I pointed out that we had a considerable trade with America.  Most of our communications with America are with the city of New York.  We have a large Irish population there, and, unfortunately, it has happened so far, and, I am afraid, it will continue for some time, that a large number of our people emigrate to the United States.  We have considerable interests as a State, and our nationals have considerable interests in the United States.  We have, therefore, as I say, two offices there.  I calculate that within this next year our American representation will possibly be a source of revenue to the Government.</P>
    <P>We have also taken a step which has not hitherto been taken by any State in the British Commonwealth, other than by Great Britain.  That is to say, we have advanced to a large extent towards having a fully accredited Minister Plenipotentiary representing us in Washington.  He is not actually established <Col N="803" /> there, but the American Government have officially notified us that they will gladly receive a Minister Plenipotentiary from us.  We have now gone to the next stage of asking them for what is known as the <i>agrément</i> for the individual.  When that <i>agrément</i> is received the Minister Plenipotentiary will be established in Washington.  That, as Deputies are aware, will be the first case of any State in the British Commonwealth, other than Great Britain, having a direct representative fully accredited. It is a tangible interpretation of the meaning of our present status.  It means that we, as a sovereign State, speak directly to other sovereign States through our own fully-accredited Plenipotentiary.</P>
    <P>From Monday next our office in New York shall issue <i>visas</i> to travellers coming from the port of New York whose first port on disembarkation will be in the Saorstát.  It is impossible for me to say exactly what revenue that will mean, but when Deputies realise that the cost of a <i>visa</i> for each visitor is 10 dollars, roughly something like £2 5s., it is only a matter of multiplying £2 5s. by the number of people who will come direct from New York to see that the probability is that it will be a source of fairly considerable revenue, and, as I hope, will more than pay for the cost of our representation in America.  Also during the last year we have begun to issue Irish passports, which will also be a source of revenue. We calculate we will make something from £10,000 to £12,000 in revenue out of passports.</P>
    <P>The last year has seen a good deal of development with regard to this Department.  After the signing of the Treaty, owing to the conditions of things here, it seemed almost inevitable that the status that we received under the Treaty must be diminished to some extent owing to our own internal trouble.  At the present day that status is not diminished.  If not enlarged, its ambit has been made clear.  That is due to the fact that we have become members of the League of Nations; that the American Government has agreed to accept a Minister Plenipotentiary <Col N="804" /> from us; that our people in travelling abroad now travel on Irish passports; that American citizens travelling to the Saorstát from Monday next shall get their <i>visas</i> from the Irish representative&mdash;the Irish <i>visa</i>&mdash;and a number of other things which possibly will transpire during the criticism of this Estimate.</P>

      <P>The subject I wish to refer to concerns both.  However, you can stop me if I go beyond the rules of order.  I want to refer to the question of agricultural information. I notice the Minister referred to agriculture indirectly, although he did not mention it by name. My idea is that the representatives abroad should devote more time and attention to the acquisition of agricultural information, and that the information acquired should be spread through this country in a way that will make it available to the ordinary man in the street.  As far as I am aware&mdash; and I have probably an opportunity of being more closely in touch with the Minister than the average man in the street&mdash;we know practically nothing about what is happening abroad, or what information the Ministry is getting. In a State like this the attention of the Ministry should be given rather to economic, industrial and agricultural affairs than to questions of policy between nations.  There are many matters.  I would suggest to the Minister, on which information could be acquired, and handed down to those interested with beneficial results.  There is the case of agricultural fertilizers. A considerable quantity of fertilizing <Col N="805" /> material is imported into Ireland, and I find it is very difficult to get accurate information as to what foreign countries these materials can be secured from, and at what price they can be got.  I think the Minister would be doing useful work if he would see that his representatives devoted some attention to that matter&mdash;for instance, the representative in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to alternative markets for Irish produce, with special reference, I think, to agricultural produce. While I agree with the Minister that our main market is in Great Britain, and probably must remain in Great Britain, still I think it is important that alternative markets should be provided if possible, or that inquiries should be made and routes opened up. Special attention should be given to the question of a market in the United States.  I believe there is the possibility of an alternative market there for agricultural produce, particularly for dairy produce.  I would suggest that our representative there should get busy, obtain all the necessary information, and see that the information is conveyed to the people who are looking for it.  I understand the Americans are also anxious to get Irish products of a certain type&mdash;cloths, linens, and many things of that kind&mdash;that the market is there and available if it is opened up.  There is a great deal of wealth in the United States, and a great deal of money available for spending on luxuries and such things as cloths, linens, etc., which are beyond the ordinary purse.  Possibly there is a big market there for Irish produce if it were opened up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I want to raise I think comes under the sub-head A (1).  It more or less concerns the question of policy and therefore would come under the Minister's salary.  I want to refer to the fact that we have been told on all possible occasions, and some impossible occasions, that we are co-equal partners in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  To my mind a privilege of that kind connotes responsibility, and if we are partners in the privilege, doubtful though that be, of belonging to the <Col N="806" /> British Commonwealth, do we share in the responsibility of that Commonwealth in the course of its dealing with other nations?  What is our responsibility for the dragooning of India and Egypt?  If we have the privilege of belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations which at present is dragooning India and Egypt are we responsible for that dragooning?  What is our share of the responsibility? Have we protested, or are we in a position to protest?  During our struggle here it was common talk that the self-governing colonies, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, did not make their protest when this country was being dragooned.  Now we are in a similar position to these Dominions, or whatever their proper title is, and we are standing idly by while other places are being dragooned into subjection.  It is a well known fact that the roads of India are swept at night by cavalry with nets drawn between them for the capture of alleged rebels.  Has anything been said about that at any of these conferences? I read about two months ago in an obscure corner of that paragon of excellence, &ldquo;The Daily Mail,&rdquo; that there were three executions in India for complicity in a riot.  I do not know what the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; calls a riot, but when reading that obscure paragraph I could not help remembering that I read some time in summer of 1921, in a similar obscure corner of that paper, that two men were executed in Mitchelstown for complicity in a riot. I could not help asking myself if the riot in India had the same complexion as the riot in Mitchelstown, and whether India is in the same position to-day as we were in 1921, and also whether this Free State is in any way responsible, and whether the privilege of belonging to the British Commonwealth connotes responsibility for the acts which the step-mother country across the water is doing in India and Egypt.  Going round Dublin one is struck by the way the representatives of the different foreign countries exhibit the one great badge of their nationality, namely, their language. How do we stand in foreign countries in regard to that, and have <Col N="807" /> our representatives there that qualification? Is it as clear to the foreigners that we possess that one great badge of nationality, and is it emblazoned as clearly as the representatives of other countries blazon their badge here?  I hope that the Minister will give us the reply to these points which they deserve, and tell us whether our responsibility to the British Commonwealth connotes responsibility for the Commonwealth's action, and also whether our representatives abroad display the badge of our distinctive nationality before the world.</P>

      <P>The main matter that would arise in this Vote would arise under two ordinary heads, one dealing with what I may call chancery work, and the other dealing with consular work.  I do not know whether this form of taking the Estimates enables one to cover both, but I take it that your ruling is, that discussion under (A) would enable both these matters to be covered.  I notice that the Minister, in his introductory statement, I think not altogether wisely, avoided that close, detailed exposition of his Vote, of which such an excellent example was given by the Minister for Justice when presenting the two Votes connected with his Department. I think he could, with advantage, have adopted that course.  He dealt with one section, that which I have called the consular work, but he clearly avoided in his opening comments any reference to the chancery work of his Department, which I take to be not less important than the other, and which many would hold to be of even greater importance than the other. Under that definition I am referring to the activities of his Department in so far as they define our relations with outside nations, external affairs in regard to politics, as distinct from external affairs in regard to trade.  The question asked already by Deputy Hogan touched upon that, and we know that powers lie in his Department to make it perfectly clear that the status achieved under the Treaty is one of very considerable importance, and would give us as large expression of our desires to let our will be known <Col N="808" /> abroad in regard to important matters, as any other status given before in practical politics in the last few years.  If the Department of what is called External Affairs were properly executed it might become one of the most forcible Departments for our internal affairs.  Deputy Hogan asks how we stood in regard to the other parts of this Commonwealth where things are being done, the kind and colour of which we have had intimate experience with in the immediate past. I would like the Minister to have stated here quite clearly what I take to be the truth, and that is, that our commitments extend no further than they are stated to be in this House, that if any acts are done or commitments are made by any member of the Commonwealth they do not affect this member of the Commonwealth, except in so far as we express our endorsement of them.  This morning I received a copy of the debates of the House of Commons of Canada.  The whole debate there is concerned with the Estimates of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and it constitutes a very long document containing very important matters. The House will be relieved to hear that I had an opportunity of only reading the first few pages, otherwise my excerpts from it would be more numberous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy put forward that.  I intended to do so myself at an earlier stage in deference to Deputy Cooper as well as other Deputies.  I would like to read one or two statements from this document.  The Premier, Mr. Mackenzie King, states in regard to the Lausanne Treaty: &ldquo;We have never at any time understood that Lord Curzon&rdquo;&mdash;let me substitute for the words &ldquo;Lord Curzon&rdquo; the words &ldquo;British Foreign Secretary&rdquo; and then the meaning of this question will become evident.  &ldquo;We have never at any time understood that the British Foreign Secretary in any sense of the word was representing this Dominion and, as I have already said, we had <Col N="809" /> very special grounds for knowing that, so far as the Dominions were concerned they were not being represented at Lausanne.&rdquo;  I will read another quotation from another part of the Premier's speech.  &ldquo;Were we to hold the view that a Minister at London, without any conference with, or the consent of the Dominion of Canada, without being in any way a representative of Canada in connection with the proceedings of a conference which he might attend, could bind this country, then we would enjoy simply a Colonial status, but if, on the other hand, we take as we do the position the Government took in this matter, and, as Sir Robert Borden has taken, that since the war there has been a fuller recognition of the rights of the Dominion, namely, that there is equality of status between the self-governing Dominions and the British Government in matters which are of like concern to all, then there is a getting away from the Colonial status into a status of partnership within the Empire, which is an entirely different thing.&rdquo;  If that is an accurate statement of the state of affairs in regard to Canada, much more forcibly are those words to be applied to this member of the Commonwealth which did not grow up into Dominion status, but which started by being a nation, and which is now still a nation, with this addition, that the recognition of its independence has been attained. I emphasise these things here, because of a question I put at an earlier stage in to-day's business, in which I asked the Minister if he had received any invitation to be present at a conference in which nations in Europe are to be represented, and where important matters are to be discussed of the greatest moment to the peace of Europe.  The Minister replied that he did not receive any such invitation, and that there were to be discussions on Friday of this week at which the High Commissioner in London of this State will be present.  I think the Ministry should take this opportunity, or a very early opportunity, to make it clear that if in these proposed conversations that are about to occur there are matters coming under discussion that may lead to treaties or protocols in which the assent of this <Col N="810" /> State may be required, that this State at a later date will take the view that it has no concern in these matters, not having been present by its representative in the discussions from the very first day they started.  That is a point of view taken by Premier Mackenzie King.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Canada has asserted that point of view as a British Dominion having grown into that status, and if it is a right point of view for a Dominion, having once been a colony, it must be much more true of a country that is now a nation within the fullest meaning of the word.  That is one aspect of the Vote to which I desire to draw attention, and I had expected that the Minister would have taken the opportunity, when presenting this Vote, to have made such a statement in respect of this State on these matters as was made by the Canadian Prime Minister in the Ottawa House of Commons.  The other aspect of the question refers, not to the chancery relations but to the consular arrangements, not the arrangements and relations of this country with other countries in matters affecting its political position and its consequences, but directly as between this country's trade and other countries' trade.  I think the Minister has made it clear that he is altogether satisfied with the progress made in these matters.  I do not think he has good reason to be satisfied with that progress. The last figures published for April of the trade and shipping statis tics show that our export to other countries is a very small matter indeed, hardly amounting to much more than about five per cent. of the whole of our import trade.  That is a state of affairs which ought to be rectified, and which could be rectified.  The Minister stated that the greater part of our industry consisted of the manufacture of one product.  That one product is not very largely taken by any other country than Great Britain.  Its consumption in other countries is apparently not encouraged.  The form in which these trade and shipping statistics are published, month by month, only enforces the facts that they do go to prove whether these various representatives that have been established in other countries are or are not proving <Col N="811" /> their worth.  In regard to the first matter I mentioned, our political relations, we could never estimate the value received in terms of hard cash in that connection.  I think any expenditure incurred for the establishment of political relations of an independent or semi-independent sort with other nations is expenditure very well incurred indeed.</P>
    <P>When you leave that and come down to these other offices, the office at New York, the office at Brussels, the office at Rotterdam, what we do want to know, and what it is right that the Minister should inform us, is by checking over the figures in the statistics of trade and shipping it is very easy to discover how far these offices established in these various countries, with which we are doing practically no business, have justified their existence, and if they do not justify their existence in a case of that kind, where there is no national dignity concerned, where it is purely a matter of business, then it is good business to consider the cutting off of such representatives or their transfer to somewhere else, where good business can be proved in the usual terms of good business.  I want to make it quite clear in bringing forward that argument that I am only dealing with persons whose work as consuls must be justified by the return of business.  I am not dealing with any Ministers Plenipotentiary who may be established in any capitals where the same business could not be brought forward.  Finally, in regard to publicity&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under Sub-head A 4 there is £750 estimated for the cost of entertaining distinguished foreigners.  I would like to hear some general particulars from the Minister as to what is his Department's outlook on that particular type of matter. Some weeks ago the Premier of Queens-land, I think, was here for a day or two, and I have a slight suspicion that if he found out the Ministry of External Affairs at all he found it out by chance. I have a slight suspicion, too, that he <Col N="812" /> and his wife hired a motor car and went off by themselves to visit Glendalough. I am not quite sure if that is so, but I have very strong suspicions that it is so.  I do feel, until things generally get more established here, that it is the very peculiar responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs to see that visitors of a type like that, who come to Ireland, are looked after, and that the hospitality of the State is shown to them in the way, I am sure, every Deputy here would like that it would be.  £750 is a very small margin, I think, considering the stage of development that we have arrived at at the present time, and that a larger amount of this type of entertainment would fall on a purely State Department at present than might under circumstances that might obtain in three or four or five years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head (b) I feel that there is somewhat of the same stinginess in regard to our establishments abroad. I see no elasticity provided for in any, way for what I will roughly call entertaining. If we are having representatives of this country abroad it is not in accordance with the dignity that we would like to have associated with our country that they should be tied down to so many shillings a week or so many pounds a year, a typist, a secretary and a messenger.  I think, too, that a more systematic explanation is desirable than the Minister has given us as to why, particularly, Geneva, Brussels, Rotterdam, Paris and Chili should have fallen on to the map of the world, from the Irish point of view, in the way that is suggested here, and why only these places should have turned up in such an unexpected way. The third point is, the explanation with regard to our discontinuing the office in Berlin, I think must be regarded as most unsatisfactory.  Personally, I feel that if there is any country where a consul would be of use to us at the present time, Germany stands out above any other country.  It has been a big industrial country; its industrial fabric has to a large extent been shattered. There must be many persons and many ideas to be got in touch with in Germany that would be of the greatest possible <Col N="813" /> assistance to us in setting about the organisation of our industrial State here.  There is a certain amount of promise and hope in the statement of the Minister that this matter is receiving the special consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. But there is very little time to be lost, I feel, and even the hope that is held out to us for the future, I hope for the immediate future, does not satisfactorily explain why, having had a Consul established in Berlin, because some one man resigned we should shut down our Consulate and clear out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this item for official entertainment, I would like the Minister to give us a little more information as to what it means.  Does it mean that an open house is kept where we have a Consul or agency, where food and drink are served ad lib to everyone that calls?  £750 is a large item under the heading of &ldquo;official entertainment,&rdquo; especially in view of the present condition of affairs in Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry, and other parts of the country, where people are eating Indian meal stirabout. £750 is estimated for 1924-25, while the sum for 1923-24 was £150.  That is an increase of £600 under the heading of &ldquo;official entertainment.&rdquo;  The Minister should be in a position to give the House detailed information as to how this £750 is to be spent and where it is to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would associate myself with Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy White in wishing for a little more information about this official entertainment. I assume that the increase of 500 per cent. to which Deputy White refers, is due to the Tailteann Games. The Minister is taking time by the forelock. He realises that we shall have to fulfil our reputation for hospitality and he has been hoarding money until it is needed.  White I have a slight idea of what is being done, and that it is desirable, I would like to be reassured on one point.  I have been informed that some of this money is spent on entertaining the representative of foreign Powers at the annual St. Patrick's Day banquet.  If so, I think that the St. Patrick's Day banquet should not be <Col N="814" /> associated with a Party organisation. If it is an official banquet, at which foreign Powers are represented, all parties should take part in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn from that to the question of our representatives abroad.  I should like to know from the Minister if there is any particular scale on which their remuneration is fixed, because it varies very much, and it does not always seem to vary in accordance with fixed principles. Our representative at Washington, who will now, I suppose, be a Minister Plenipotentiary, receives £2,370.  He also gets £475 for a house. That is, he gets over £2,800, or £300 more than the President.  The representative in New York gets £1,800, £50 more than a Minister.  I have no doubt the Minister will account for these rather large salaries by telling us, as is quite true, that the cost of living in the United States is very high and, as Deputy Milroy is not here, he may add it is due to Protection.  How does that principle work out with regard to other places?  For instance, we pay our representative in Brussels on a higher scale than our representative in Paris.  I have always understood that the cost of living is lower in Brussels than in Paris, relatively speaking, and, most certainly, the rate of exchange is more favourable to us in Belgium than in France.  The representative in Brussels gets £750 and the French representative gets only £700. The Brussels assistant gets £550, and there is no assistant in France, only a clerk who gets £250.  It seems to me there is no system in arranging these things.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate the principle on which this remuneration is fixed.  We may, of course, hold that it is due to the volume of our trade; that our export trade to Belgium is bigger than our export trade to France.  That is so, on the latest figures of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  But our trade to Belgium is very largely a trade in raw materials, which ought to be made up here, instead of being exported to provide labour elsewhere.  There is one remarkable item; we sent over £1,000 worth of waste paper to each of these countries in four months.  I suppose these are resolutions passed by district councils.  We should probably <Col N="815" /> be able to promote an export trade in that matter.  The figures for Belgium show a sum of £28,000 for horses.  We ought to have a good export trade in horses, but I think the horses that we export ought to have an average value of more than £15.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not dead horses.  I believe they are exported alive, but I agree that they are exported for meat.  They are not exported to keep up the credit of Irish blood stock, but to improve the flavour of the Belgian sausage.  That is the principal item of trade with Belgium, and without that our trade with Belgium is worse than our trade with France.  We seem to be doing better in places where we have no trade representatives than where we have them.  The Straits Settlements take more than Holland.  I would like to call attention to sub-heads, rents, fuel, light, and cleaning.  There seems to be an enormous reduction there, but the reduction must have been due to the fact that the original figures were fixed without any regard to economy at all. The idea that the High Commissioner's office would cost £13,000, which was the figure in last year's Estimate, for rent, fuel, light and cleaning is absurd. The reduction to £4,680 for 1924-25 is not due to economy, but to the preposterous figure put down in the Estimates last year.  I hope the Minister will tell us whether these amounts were spent or not.  General Mulcahy referred to Chile.  We appear to have an honorary representative in Chile. He has no salary, but in the Estimates he has small sums for rent, travelling, postage, stationery, newspapers, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not very large sums; altogether they do not come to £100, but is there any necessity for them at all? Does this honorary representative perform any useful function?  Is he performing what Deputy Figgis called a chancery function, or is he performing a political or trade function?  If he performs a trade function both in export and import, Chile is an also ran, and it appears with Hong Kong, Irak, and the Falkland Islands.  I do not <Col N="816" /> think the Minister has explained that an honorary representative justifies even these small sums unless he is fulfilling a useful purpose.  If we want to have our influence felt in the Southern Hemisphere we ought to have a representative in the West Indies.  There we have a satisfactory trade.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Mexico is an also ran.  I hope the Chairman will not pull me up when I use the word &ldquo;publicity.&rdquo; I am not referring to the Publicity Department of the Ministry here; I am referring to the publicity work performed by those representatives abroad.  To what extent do they correct misrepresentations and innuendoes about the position of the Saorstát and the doings here, and so on?  It is common knowledge that many of the foreign journalists are grossly misinformed. We saw yesterday where a telegram from Brussels appeared in the Press stating that a memorial had been unveiled in memory of the Ulster soldiers. As a matter of fact, the Minister knows the memorial was raised in memory of Munster soldiers, and was unveiled by a member of the Seanad, and the only paper that has had intelligence to correct that was a Belfast newspaper which said that the memorial must be to the Munsters. Surely our representative at Brussels should have informed the journalist that this was a pilgrimage of 200 Irishmen who fought side by side with the French in Belgium, and had revisited the battlefields to honour the dead.  It would help to dispel the impression that prevails in England and in the Continent of Europe that all the fighting was done by Ulster.  Our representative apparently had not informed the Press in any way so that they could get an accurate knowledge of the facts.  I read the Continental Press occasionally, and I see no evidence of any publicity work done by our representatives at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will remind them that that is the one direction in which they can give value for the money voted for them, which though not enormous, is rather more than we can afford.  I emphasise that fact because there are constant rumours of an increase <Col N="817" /> in the number of foreign representatives and of starting new missions in fresh places.  Without prejudice to the question of Berlin, I think it would be a great mistake to support new representatives in other places unless we are absolutely certain we are going to get value for the money in an extension of trade.  We have to look at this matter, not in a sentimental, but in a practical spirit.  I hope the Minister would be able to re-assure those who are afraid that we are going to launch out in a matter of this kind while we have an unbalanced budget and an almost empty exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very kind of Deputy Figgis to take it that I was referring to him.  I had no notion of what he said in this matter, and I am very sorry that I appear to have been misrepresenting him.  The view I have, and I think it is the view of the majority in the Dáil, is that we have entered into the community of nations&mdash; not the British Community of Nations &mdash;in the hope of playing at least our little part in the formation of world opinion in regard to human progress. I think that it is not in keeping with <Col N="818" /> that idea, or the idea of Ireland a nation, that we should discuss the question of increased representation abroad merely from the point of view of whether it is going to add to the trading facilities, or to the probability of trading in those particular countries.  I do not regret to hear that there are rumours which I have not heard before, but I am glad to hear there are rumours, and I hope they are well founded, that there are proposals on foot to have representatives in other capitals.  I would suggest to the Ministry that they should look to small European nations, particularly Northern nations&mdash;Sweden, Finland, Denmark; and Norway&mdash;and endeavour to have representation there. It would help to keep this country well-informed on the development in matters industrial and agricultural, and everything else that would be of help, and in addition, to keep in touch with political opinion there.  One of the trends of thought in the last year or two has been in favour of the union, or, shall I say, the fraternity, of the small nations for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of small nations against possible combinations of the Great Powers.  I think it would be well if our views changed towards associating with that idea, not necessarily in conflict with any of the greater Powers, but rather to show that there was a community of interest, and a desire which should be put into practical effect if necessary, for the continuity of peace and progress on the part of the small nations.  I suggest that it is quite worthy of the ideals of human development internationally that we should associate ourselves, and be clearly associated, with those small nations of Europe and the world in general.  We have recently heard of one of the small nations proposing disarmament. That is a very good beginning; it is probably a kind of gesture, to use a common word, that may extend its influence over very wide areas.  We have met for the last two or three years in international conference in Geneva. I think it has been shown in regard to the international Labour Conference that there is a clear and sympathetic bond between the representatives of the small nations and Ireland, and I believe that it would be beneficial that <Col N="819" /> we should take steps to strengthen that bond, and let those people feel that there was a direct intercourse between representatives of Ireland in those countries and the publicists of those countries.  The ulterior benefits, I think, of that fraternity would be considerable, but I am not pressing this idea forward with a view to the material benefits.  I believe that they would be secondary but that they would be substantial.  And when one learns from Deputy Heffernan how far from perfection we are in regard to our knowledge of affairs&mdash;agricultural, cooperative, and the like&mdash;in these countries, that is an added reason why we should be in the way of a constant stream of information from these countries in regard to these developments.</P>
      <P>Then again I think we ought to have a representative in Ottawa and perhaps also one in Capetown.  But certainly we ought to have one in Ottawa.  We are bound in many ways to keep ourselves informed of the state of opinion in that city and it seems to me to be very obvious that we could have a representative there.  The Minister did say some little time ago that the matter was under consideration.  I was hopeful that he would have been able to tell us that that consideration had resulted in a decision, that decision being to have a representative appointed in Ottowa.  Deputy Bryan Cooper again has gone.  He could not help saying that the increased cost of the maintenance of representatives in America, in the United States, is no doubt due to Protection.  He would perhaps, if he were here, be able to tell us whether the expected influx of visitors to Ireland from that country&mdash;the influx of men and women who are able to come and spend months in Europe out of their earnings and savings in America, was also due to Protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter of more delicacy and difficulty perhaps, but a matter of great importance about which I would like to have heard something from the Minister.  He may think it judicious not to say much. When Deputy Cooper suggested that the representatives of Ireland abroad should be in a position to place Ireland's <Col N="820" /> point of view of policy in international matters before the public of those countries one was tempted to ask: What is Ireland's policy?  What is the position held by the Irish Government in regard to the Irish attitude in international affairs?  The question has been raised as to the Conference of the Allied Nations, the Nations which were allied during the War in regard to German Reparations; and the Minister has said that the Government has been invited to be represented at a preliminary Conference to be held in London, that it is possible, that it is likely that that invitation will be accepted, and that the High Commissioner will represent this country at that preliminary Conference. Now there is the question as to whether we ought not to take advantage of the closeness of Dublin to London and if we are going to be represented at such a Conference of the Nations forming the British Commonwealth, whether we should not be represented at such a Conference by the Minister responsible as well as by the High Commissioner.  If this were done, it is suggested, I think with some force, that these other nations&mdash;Canada, Australia, and South Africa&mdash;might be inclined to take advantage of the fact that our Minister for External Affairs is able to be there with the strength of his position as responsible Minister, and that the Commissioners who will be also present representing these other countries would be able to collaborate with our Minister who is in a stronger position because of his higher status, and that that might be a very good method of taking advantage of our contiguity to London.</P>
    <P>But in connection with the immediate matter under consideration at the coming Conference where do we stand?  What attitude does the Government take in regard to the responsibilities arising out of the European War? It is proposed that we shall accept the invitation to attend the preliminary Conference of the Nations forming the British Commonwealth.  Can the Minister indicate whether it is proposed to accept the invitation to attend the Inter-Allied Conference or whether it is proposed to intimate that we do not <Col N="821" /> feel ourselves inclined to take any responsibilities in regard to European complications?  I do not want to probe this matter too closely.  I realise that it is a matter requiring a great deal of care and consideration.  But I want to urge that until there has been some public discussion, until there has been a well-understood decision taken by this country, that there should be no commitments.  And before the Vote is passed I should like that we should have from the Ministry some indication at least of their attitude towards these very grave international matters closely associated with the possibilities of future war and, of course, very closely associated with and bound up with the possibilities of a revival of European prosperity.  I do not think that our Government ought to be represented at any conference of the kind unless something has been stated on behalf of the Government of this country to indicate their attitude in these matters.  If that is done we can see to what extent it may be said that the Government is representing Irish opinion, and how far their policy in these matters is likely to commend itself and&mdash;may I say&mdash; be persisted in from one year to another.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I may touch upon a matter which was suggested, I think, in the Seanad some months ago as to the possibilities of having a Committee representative of the Oireachtas as a whole to confer with the Minister for External Affairs in respect to international relationships.  I do not know whether the Minister has any views on that question.  I think he was entirely non-committal in the Seanad and I think no opportunity has been given him in the Dáil to express his views upon that question.  But it seems to me to be worthy of consideration, particularly in connection with such a matter as this Inter-Allied Conference, that responsible public opinion in this country should be ascertained before any commitments of any kind are entered into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to have some information from the Minister.  I find here, that roughly speaking there is £21,000 spent in the <Col N="822" /> maintenance of representatives abroad &mdash;Consuls abroad.  I should like to know whether these Consuls do £21,000 worth of good.  Did they perform the ordinary functions performed by Consuls, that is, issue Consular Reports at stated intervals?  And if so, where can these Consular Reports be found?  I am quite in agreement with Deputy Mulcahy when he says that a Consul should be maintained in Germany. But I do not think Berlin is the proper place; I think the Consul ought to be at Hamburg.  I should like to be assured of the influence that the Irish race in America have in the policy of the United States.  That is where influence counts.  I do not think they have any influence at all.  Or if they have any, I think it is very little.  I am aware that when I say this I am speaking heretically.  But that is my opinion. We are going to have a Minister at Washington.  A Minister cannot be maintained at Washington for £2,370. That is out of the question.  If you are going to send a Minister to Washington you must provide him with funds sufficient to uphold the dignity of this country, and you must give him an adequate salary.  And £2,370 is nothing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not all all so confident of the good the League of Nations is going to promote.  I have no faith in the League of Nations.  The League of Nations has turned out to consist of three nations, and when you turn on another screw one nation is paramount, its influence and its opinions are paramount, and its ideas are carried through when it wishes to carry them through.  Consuls are simply trade agents, and they ought to do their best to extend the trade of the country.  Thinking over those trade statistics that Deputy Bryan Cooper read out, I wish to be assured that all that trade, or the greater portion of that trade, does not go through England.  How much of it is carried in bottoms, Irish or otherwise, from Ireland direct to any of those nations?  Very little.  I have answered my own question.  There is one thing of which I must assure the Minister, and that is, my admiration of the adroitness with which he has proceeded to dig in this Ministry.  The great majority of the members of the <Col N="823" /> Dáil were quite opposed to the establishment of this Ministry; and the Minister has given proof of his ability to fill the position that he does fill by the excellent manner in which he has dug in the Ministry, so that it will be impossible to rout them out for another year or two.</P>

      <P>With regard to the cost of a <i>visa</i> for emigrants leaving Ireland for the United States, I presume the cost of the passports here is extra.  I think the Minister said that the cost of the <i>visa</i> in the United States was £2 5s.  I presume the cost here is about the same and that the cost of the passport is additional.  There is complaint about that, as the cost is very hard on the emigrants.  It adds a considerable amount to the sum which they have to pay for their passage and other things. I would suggest to the Minister that some arrangement should be made whereby the cost could be lowered. There is another matter which I wish to raise but which hardly comes under this Vote.  It is with regard to the representation of labour at the International Labour Organisation, and I wish to refer to the suggested representation on the agricultural organisation.</P>

      <P>That is how I wish to refer to it.  I only referred to the labour representation as an example of what might be done for agriculture.  I have no objection to the labour representation at the International Labour Conference.  But I understand that the Institute of Agriculture meets this year in Rome.  It met last year also, but as far as I know organised agriculture was not represented. I would suggest, in view of the importance of agriculture in this country, and the importance of this conference, that it is only right that agriculture should be represented at any international conference of this kind. As the question of general policy, Deputy McBride, I think, suggested that the Ministry of External Affairs is not necessary at all.  I raised that matter at a previous stage, but I do not intend to raise it now for a personal reason. Knowing that the President has very many other preoccupations, I could not suggest, at this stage of the affairs of the nation, that he should take over the Ministry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise with a good deal of diffidence to speak in connection with matters that have been raised on this Vote.  A question has been raised as to the value of the Ministry of External Affairs.  We must, I think, recognise and appreciate that Rome was not built in a day, and that the period since self-government was established has been very short to enable people to formulate their ideas in connection with the development of the country. <Col N="825" /> Deputy Johnson has raised the question of extending the Consular system to small nations and other countries. Personally I think that would be very desirable, but it is a question of gradual growth rather than of plunging into a large expenditure without a clear idea as to what value you are going to get for your money.  It must be recognised that in the past there has been a close and intimate connection, both in trade and in every other respect, with our sister country, and that this departure which has been made under the auspices of the Ministry of External Affairs, is one that under the present order of things, must be fostered.  In the past there has been rather a feeling that we could very suddenly jump to the end of things without going through the ordinary growth that is necessary both in connection with human beings and with business.</P>
      <P>We are rather inclined to be impatient of the baby stage.  We are rather inclined to run before we have learned to walk.  That is rather a dangerous frame of mind in which to approach important questions such as the development of trade or the operations of the Ministry of External Affairs.  It is quite noticeable that the change has been in operation.  To-day, in the port of Dublin, overseas shipping is of increasing importance, and cross-Channel trade, as far as imports are concerned, is less important now than it was some years ago.  Any idea formulated in the minds of people that we can do without the British markets for our produce, or that we can get other markets equally as good, is an argument that, I think, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will not be very favourably impressed with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of the appointment of representatives, I think that we should recognise the aspiration of all these countries politically.  Nowadays the political outlook is very much bound up with the trade outlook, and, if I might say so, these international conferences are gatherings at which the representatives of every individual country have one centralised idea.  It is not the community of nations; it is rather the defensive operation of looking after themselves.  That is quite <Col N="826" /> good.  Humanly speaking, every man looks after himself.  We see that in the Dáil and in various other places.  We see it in all organisations.  People are not out to help somebody else.  They are there primarily to help themselves. That very thing that makes organisation so vocal in this country is more pronounced even when you come to international affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I would be very glad to sit down and leave Deputy O'Sullivan in possession, because even on this subject I think he can extend the scope of the argument that I have been trying to develop much better than I could myself.  Looking at the Vote as a whole, the amount that the Minister wants for the Ministry this year shows <Col N="827" /> a decrease of £24,814, and looking at the total amount spent one must keep in mind the present position of the country and what it can afford to pay. I say that at present, and without any desire to curtail the reasonable expenditure in the direction of the expansion of the representations of this country in other countries, with income tax and other charges as they are, the extension of the payment beyond the amount put down by the Minister for the present year would be unwise. At the same time I am not wishing to curtail the opportunities of the extension of the influence of this country by any niggardliness so far as this particular Ministry is concerned.  What I do say is, that if the Minister and the Ministry can help to get us out of our insular ideas and broaden the outlook of the country as regards foreign relations, they will be doing a good work and a work that will benefit the future of the country in every way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better if I spoke on the two sub-heads with which we have been deal-in. In my opening statement I only wanted to speak about matters in the Estimate which people might misunderstand. I did not really mean it to be a general statement on the policy or work of the department.  Deputy Heffernan, in his first statement, asked about getting agricultural information from foreign countries.  We have got together a great deal of information on all aspects of agriculture from foreign countries, particularly with regard to certain northern countries, which we have in many cases translated and passed on to the Department of Agriculture, which I believe was very satisfied with the value and volume of the information we got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any definite matter, such as the best place to get visas, and so on, such matters can be raised with our representatives or with the Department of <Col N="828" /> Agriculture or with my own Department. Deputy Hogan, I think it was, who asked about our responsibilities for what he called the work, or the misdeeds, of the British Commonwealth. He spoke about India and Egypt.  The British Commonwealth of Nations is composed of various constituent members.  One is Great Britain, another Canada, another Ireland.  The Deputy may remember that some time ago Deputy Johnson asked a question about the phrase &ldquo;British Empire,&rdquo; which was used with regard to some matter in connection with the League of Nations.  I explained that the word &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; in that instance referred to that part of the Commonwealth which was not Canada, South Africa, Ireland, New Zealand or Australia. We have no responsibility whatever for any act done by the British Government or by any other individual member of the British Community of Nations.  I am perfectly clear about that.  There is, however, what is known as the Indian Government, and I cannot say how far the acts done in India, whether good or bad, are the responsibilities of what is known as the Indian Government or of the British Government.  They may be the responsibilities of one or of both, but there is no responsibility on any other member of the British Community of Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, before protesting, obtain a more reliable statement than one appearing in the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  In the Imperial Conference the Indian representatives laboured under great grievances about the treatment of their people in other parts of the British Commonwealth outside India.  It seems to me to be perfectly ridiculous for <Col N="829" /> them to bring such matters before the Imperial Conference, because that Conference had no power to dictate to any members of the British Community of Nations as to what they should or should not do within the territory of their own jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>We can protest and pass resolutions if we like about what is being done in India or other places, but we have just as much right to dictate to the English Government as to what they do in India or in England as they have to dictate to us about what we do in our own country.  The Deputy also said that he heard foreign representatives in Dublin speaking their own language. Some of them, of course, do, but I do not think that the Deputy has often heard the Dutch Consul speaking Dutch for the reason that very few people here are able to speak Dutch.  Some of our representatives abroad speak and read Irish quite well, and some do not. We naturally attempt to get men who fulfil a whole different variety of qualifications. For these posts it requires a certain concatenation of qualities in one person.  You want a man able to speak the language of the country he represents. He must have some knowledge of business and trade.  You want him to have a good knowledge of the general situation in Ireland.  You want him to have an Irish outlook.  You want him to have a good presentation and a certain level of culture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly, yes.  In the case of consular agents, it often happens that they do not speak the language of the country they represent. For instance, Czecho-Slovakia has appointed a consular agent in Dublin and he is, I understand, a Dublin business man.  The Czecho-Slovakian Government would certainly have a very limited number of people to choose from if they had stipulated that their representative must be a Czech or a Slovak.</P>

So far as my Ministry is concerned, we cannot undertake any real commitments without submitting them to this House.  We cannot append our name to anything, or ratify anything, without notifying this House. That is the general line by which I guide myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that this Department is the main channel of communication with foreign Governments. The Deputy asks about what may have happened last year, but I can only speak of this Estimate for my own Department.  I may say that such a thing was, or was not, done, and it might transpire that a Minister, who may, perhaps, not be a Minister of the Government now, in an irregular way negotiated with a foreign Government. I think that Deputy Figgis asked that we should make it clear that any protocols signed at any conference at which we were not directly represented, cannot be binding on us.  That is entirely my point of view.  Deputy Mulcahy asked about £750 entertainment allowance.  I may as well tell the history of that.  Last year it appears that there was £150 voted for that, but I failed to realise it, and I paid for a certain amount of entertainment out of my own pocket until I found that I was getting quite beyond my means altogether.  I found that that £150 last year was quite useful to me for the later stage of the period.  Now we have £750 put down.  Only a certain limited amount can be done with that sum.  For instance, if a foreign visitor, with a claim for distinction, should come to Ireland, it might be considered my duty to hire a motor car to drive that visitor around the country.  It would not last anything like twelve months, or even twelve weeks.  We feel that we have a certain duty of courtesy to visitors of certain distinction who come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about one particular visitor.  I cannot remember clearly at the moment, but I certainly saw that visitor.  I did my best to assist him in anything he wanted done here, and I am not sure that I did not map out his trip to County Wicklow, although it may well be that I did not actually supply the motor car.  The sum provided for would be even smaller but for the fact that the Tailteann Games are coming on.  It is pretty clear that there will be a great number of distinguished visitors here, and we must be prepared to go at least <Col N="832" /> some length to deal with them in a way that ordinary international or governmental policy demands.  There is the possibility of various other distinguished visitors coming over individually, or in numbers, large or small. For instance, I believe there is an Advertising Congress, or something of that nature, to be held here shortly. All these visitors do require a certain amount of courteous reception, and the £750 is a minimum to enable us to do what is barely necessary.  We cannot do anything on a large scale.  We cannot, as I say, entertain every distinguished visitor who comes, neither can we take over the complete entertainment of any distinguished visitor who comes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the representatives abroad, when a representative abroad is purely a trade representative I think that entertainment by him should really be on a very limited scale.  I was asked why certain of these countries are chosen, particularly Chile. What happened was, when we took over, there were a certain number of representatives abroad, and we retained those whom we thought to be the most useful.  We retained, for instance, the representative in Chile who is an honorary representative.  I think it will be desirable that we should extend the number of honorary representatives, because there is diplomatic representation to foreign Governments, and there is trade representation, which is in the interests of Irish producers. There is another matter.  In any country where there is what I may call a homogeneous body of Irish people, a body of people of Irish birth or Irish descent, it is important, and it is our duty, I think, to recognise that we have a certain duty towards those people.</P>

It has achieved as much as one could reasonably expect to achieve in that space of time.  I think, as a principle, we should recognise that we have a degree of responsibility for our nationals abroad.  We should also recognise that we should assist these homogeneous Irish Colonies, and assist them to assist Ireland by giving them a centre to rally round, and a centre of information, and by giving them an official representative in their midst.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper asked if this sum for entertainment was used for entertaining foreigners at the St. Patrick's Day banquet.  It was not used for that purpose.  I agree with the Deputy that a national banquet like that should not be confined to any one Party.  He also said that we estimated rather wildly last year, when we had a very much larger estimate for the High Commissioner's office than this year. We did not estimate wildly.  We recognised a fact, that had to be recognised, when the office started last year. The Deputy may know that when you take an office it has to be furnished, and furniture costs quite a good deal. The rent of the office is roughly about £5,000, and a sum rather larger than that had, I think, to be estimated for the furnishing of that office.  Not only have you to furnish an office when you take it, but you have not to refurnish it every year.  Therefore, the second year <Col N="834" /> of the High Commissioner's office costs less than the first year.</P>

      <P>On a general principle some Deputies have recommended that we should have a much wider foreign representation, and others a much smaller representation. I will try to explain my own attitude of mind towards that.  I think that our trade representation at the present moment is, as I said, on the lines of exploration. Economically we must recognise that it is impossible for this country to go on indefinitely with practically only one market.  Therefore, although a representation in a country may cost £2,000 in a year, and the amount of trade with that country in the next couple of years may not seem to justify it, we have to recognise that we have to search out new markets, because this country cannot continue indefinitely to be entirely dependent on the one market.  We cannot ask a representative abroad what amount of trade he brought to this country.  We must recognise that the amount of direct trade between this country and countries other than Great Britain has increased during the last couple of years, and has increased as a result of our foreign representation; has increased, I might say, to some extent during the operations of this department. The mere fact that it has increased I think does justify us in hoping that we will be able to continue that increase.  Although we cannot possibly in our time get markets able to supplant the British markets&mdash;markets in lieu of the British markets&mdash; I think we should aim at and hope to obtain a variety of markets for our goods which will be a very considerable supplementary market to Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the export trade.  On the other hand, with regard to the non-trade representation <Col N="835" />&mdash;that is to say, with regard to the diplomatic representation&mdash;for some years we had unaccredited diplomatic representatives abroad.  I may say in the days of the first and second Dáil, I considered that a great deal of money was wasted&mdash;not that I considered it was waste to have representatives abroad, but I think it was done on too expensive a scale.  When we came into being I considered it was better, from the point of view of establishing our status and making clear to the whole world where we stood, to have a fully-accredited Minister Plenipotentiary than to have 54 or 73 unaccredited representatives. We shall have in a week or two a Minister Plenipotentiary accredited at Washington.  The fact that he is there conveys more to the people of Sweden, or Finland or any other country, exactly what status we have attained than would the sending of unaccredited representatives to these countries.  I do not say that we should be content with one accredited representative. I think we should watch and see where, or whether, our interests demand similar representatives in other places.  But I think to have one or two or three fully-accredited representatives is far more important than scattering the globe with unaccredited representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson spoke about the importance of maintaining relations with the small nations.  I quite agree. It is, of course, not feasible for the time being for us to send representatives to all small nations.  From the point of view of agriculture, I think that the Minister for Agriculture may consider it advisable during the coming year to send a delegation of agricultural experts to certain Northern countries, where agricultural organisation is brought to a very high pitch, to report on their methods up there. But we have the machinery for keeping in personal touch with many of these small nations; that is, the League of Nations.  Deputy Johnson himself, I think, is well aware that at the League of Nations gathering in Geneva, and elsewhere, the small nations make it perfectly clear that they welcome us into their ranks.  I think we make it <Col N="836" /> equally perfectly clear that we recognise a community of interest amongst all the small nations in the world.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I suggest that the Deputy should bring the matter before the Minister for Agriculture and make other proposals for the next meeting of that body.  Deputy Johnson recommended a representative at Ottawa.  That, as I said before, is a thing that has been considered and that one recognises is to a large extent desirable.  Things during the last couple of months have moved very quickly, and, I think, as it is possible that we may be in very close contact with Canada during the next few months, the consideration as to whether or not we should appoint a representative at Ottawa would depend upon how things go when we are next closely in touch with Canada.</P>

      <P>What I said was that I consider that the question as to whether or not you should have a representative at Ottawa should arise out of and depend exactly on how things turned out in a few months time.  Deputy Johnson asked about this preliminary conference which may be held this week prior to the Inter-Allied Conference, which seems to be due to be held next week. As I said, we have not been invited to take part in the Inter-Allied Conference next week, and if we are not invited, I presume that means that we have no responsibility in any matter or any protocol which may arise out of the Inter-Allied Conference.  If we are not invited, very well; we are not there and we are not responsible for what takes place.  Really, it is bad to discuss what you will do or not do if you are invited.  I think you might consider what you will or will not do, at least publicly, when you receive the invitation.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister for consideration that there is more danger in being invited to consider the question of the British Empire, or Commonwealth, representation at the International Conference, if he is attending that preliminary Conference, in view of the possibility even that he will not be invited to send a representative to the full Conference.</P>

      <P>I thought I made it clear, in reply to Deputy Figgis, that I did not consider it is possible to have such a thing as British Empire or Commonwealth representation. There is a representation of the various Governments with full powers. Therefore, presumably, at such a preliminary Conference, if any form of representation was proposed other than direct representation, obviously we would have to say that we could not recognise any such thing, or be bound by any protocol arrived at by anybody other than the body which contained a representative of this country, and invested with full powers. Deputy Johnson asked about arranging a Foreign Affairs Committee.  I have no objection.  I might say I would welcome it to a large extent, but of course it will be recognised that we could only co-operate and put the material of our Department at the disposal of such a Committee to a limited extent. If Deputy Johnson or other Deputies wish to nominate men who would confer with me and the Government on general matters arising out of policy I for one would be very glad.</P>

Generally, the international regulation on this matter is, I think, 10 gold francs, but the American <Col N="839" /> Government for their own purpose, because they are not too anxious to encourage emigration or to make it easy for people to emigrate to the United States, fix their visas at 10 dollars, and automatically we did the same.

Those I think are most of the questions that were asked.  I think I have made it fairly clear exactly what our attitude is. Our attitude is that nobody can speak for this country unless he has a direct appointment from this country. This country I consider sovereign externally and internally, and not only well able to talk to any country that wants us to talk to it, but certainly we are well able to see to it that it accepts no responsibility for anything to which its own Government has not assented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point and on one or two others to which I referred at an earlier stage and which the Minister did not deal with as fully as I expected him to do, I desire to say a few words.  In regard to the forthcoming Conference I appreciate fully the delicacy of the situation from the Minister's point of view, and I do not want to do anything that might embarrass him in <Col N="840" /> these difficulties.  He has said that if this State is not represented at the forthcoming Inter-Allied Conference we will not be committed, or held thereafter to be committed, to anything either done, or resulting from what is done there.  I think he has made that case, and so far so good.  I move one further stage, and I ask is he willing to assert a claim that the Free State shall be represented at that Inter-Allied Conference?  There is a precedent for it.  It was a precedent established by the State to which we are likened so frequently in our Constitution, Canada. Sir Robert Borden&mdash;and I do not think any person is going to raise the question of what may be described in the accepted term as loyalty in the matter &mdash;made that claim for Canada, in the negotiations that led to the Versailles Treaty.  The first of the conditions precedent that were claimed by Sir Robert Borden on behalf of Canada was that in respect of negotiations the Government of Canada should be consulted before preliminary arrangements were finally concluded, and the second was that Canada should be directly represented at any conference of the kind.  We do know that on other matters conferences have been held quite recently on the continent.  The forthcoming Inter-Allied Conference at London is a continuity of these conferences. Independent nations, known as Dominions, were asked if they desired to be represented, and at each of these two conferences they were represented. Mr. McKenzie King stated they had been so invited, and had taken advantage of that undertaking, and were there represented.  Therefore, I say there would be a precedent and a point in any representation made by him that the Free State as one of the States of Europe in a conference so closely and vitally affecting peace in the continent in which we as an independent State and independent community with Great Britain, should be represented.  The second matter is in regard to these Consular reports to which Mr. McBride has called attention.  The Minister was invited by myself and Deputy Cooper to give particular attention to one or two <Col N="841" /> of these places.  Geneva explains itself. Representation there is mainly diplomatic representation.</P>

      <P>Whatever it is, it is diplomatic representation, and the size of it does not affect the issue.  Take Rotterdam, the trade with Holland consists mainly of agricultural raw material and the total amount of that business extends to about £6,000. That business consists of raw materials and wants very little encouragement. We can only test the value received if we receive or have access to the Consular reports published at regular intervals by these various representatives of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to ask the Minister a question.  It is in relation to passports.  A great many people in this country have had passports viséd.  It costs £2 10s. under the new regulations.  It appears that they are called upon to have these passports re-viséd and to pay the same fee over again.  I do not think that that is fair or just.  There must be something wrong about it; and it requires surely some investigation by the Minister so as to see that these people who were prevented from sailing are not called upon to pay again the fee already paid.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the Dáil.  I think this Estimate is an insult.  I do not see why it should be continued.  I have been converted by Deputy Gorey to his opinions as to the value of representatives abroad.  For a long time I believed that something could be done by them, that they could be of some use.  But I am now satisfied that they can be of no use as they exist at present, and that the money that is being asked for to-day for their upkeep is just money wasted.  The Minister spoke about finding alternative <Col N="842" /> markets.  That is talking as if the representatives whom he has at present in Europe were engaged in finding alternative markets, whereas in reality they have no power, they have no status, they have no position, they have no means of obtaining alternative markets, and they are not backed up by the Government which sent them out for that ostensible purpose. I had hoped that some day the Government would have taken a serious view as to the object of these services and the object of these representatives, and that they would have considered whether they should not be recruited from men with some expert training for the purposes of the job they are sent out to do.  The Minister has apparently decided that no steps will be taken in that direction.  At the present time, in the United States every year, over 1,000 men are leaving the Universities, having gone through a course in foreign service, involving, if not expert knowledge, at least a general grounding in the principles of modern Commercial Law, private and public International Law, Maritime Insurance, Markets and Exchange.  And these men are generally fitted for the position of representatives either of a firm or of the Government in a foreign country.  At the present time we have in Dublin a School of Commerce which is anything but satisfactory, and I doubt that the Deputies in this House can say very much in favour of its operations or of any result that has been received from this School of Commerce. If there was a definite programme or a definite object in view, then it would be possible to organise a small and efficient service for the purpose of promoting the trade of this country.  At the present time there is no such intention, there is no such will in the Government.  Some day, when we have got a National Government, when we have a Government which is willing to stand up for the rights of our people wherever they may be; some day when we have a Government which is willing to take opinions on administration and on the methods of administration, a Government which is really interested in economy, really interested in efficiency, and really interested in <Col N="843" /> producing an administration of this country which will be in accordance with the wishes of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some day it will be necessary to have representatives abroad, but at the present time it is unnecessary, and is waste of money. They are not backed up by the Government and there is no will on the part of the Government to back them up.  They have no powers or functions and they have no money to carry out the duties which are required of them; and I have, therefore, been absolutely converted to the outlook and to the opinion which was expressed on former occasions by Deputy Gorey, that this expenditure on these representatives abroad is at the present time an absolute waste of money.  The time will come, later on possibly, when they will be necessary and valuable.  A time will come when we shall be anxious to get the latest ideas in administration and the latest methods of administration from every country in the world.  At the present time all ideas, all suggestions, are rejected which are not English suggestions or which are not in accordance with the tradition of the British Treasury.  A time may come when we in this country will be interested in the study and the possibilities of State enterprise; and in order to carry out that idea it would be necessary to have men abroad who would have the advantage of seeing these State enterprises in operation.  At the present time there is no such desire on the part of the Government, and for that reason I see no cause whatever why these representatives should be kept on.  The Government has deliberately turned down the Irish race; they have deliberately decided that they will have nothing to do with the Irish race throughout the world.  I am not talking about the remarks in this Dáil, but about their actions.  They have deliberately decided that the Irish race, which produced something like over <Col N="844" /> 10,000,000 dollars in order to create this State, are not to be invited to assist us, to give us what expert assistance they could give in building up the State.

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy did not know what he said.  If the Ministry of External Affairs or any other Ministry is able to get a market in any country for Irish produce where all the Foreign Ministries, the Ministries of every other country have failed, if it is able to get a market for our agricultural produce in any other part of the world where the Argentine, and New Zealand and America have failed I do think that it will deserve a great deal of credit, and I am sure that this country will have no hesitation in giving it that credit.  When Deputies stand up in this Dáil and talk a lot of smoke they act as if they thought that this Dáil is really a school room, and that they were talking to a lot of junior boys.  It is degrading to the Dáil to listen to some of the piffle that has been spoken here for the last 15 or 20 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking on this Vote last night when we adjourned. It is described as an advance to the Londonderry and Lough <Col N="846" /> Swilly Railway in respect of the working of the Letterkenny, Burtonport, Buncrana and Carndonagh Railway of £5,430, which appears to be part of a sum of about £7,000.  I find there was a Vote in March this year of £510, which was additional to an anticipated saving on other sub-heads of £1,000, making a total of £1,510.  The estimate was brought forward in March as something to be going on with and did not receive very much consideration, though the matter was raised by Deputy Wilson.  In the absence of the Minister directly responsible the only explanation that was given was that there had been an agreement to pay a sum of money to meet certain losses.  It was also pointed out during the discussion that we were on the eve of the introduction of the Railway Bill and it was assumed that all things would be made straight in regard to such concerns as this by the introduction of that Bill.  But, lo and behold! when we got the Railway Bill we found that it had nothing at all to do with the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  So that whatever was in the minds of Deputies to say in regard to the Lough Swilly Railway ought to have been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expectation that the Railway Bill would remove the danger that might arise from such a loan as this has not been realised.  I would like to know a little more definitely the conditions under which this sum has been agreed upon to be paid over by the Government on account of the losses on this line for this particular period.  It is true to say that that part of the railway has been, in the main, profitable, certainly the most remunerative from the point of view of revenue. This loan was advanced because of a threat to close down.  We want to be informed what conditions have been imposed upon the company for the use of this money.  We ought also to be told whether in fact there has been any connection between the granting of this loan and the activities of the company in seeking powers from the British Parliament to increase their capital. I do not want to raise again the question of the right of the British Parliament to legislate in connection with this railway company.  I believe it is <Col N="847" /> outside the international agreement, and I believe that the Ministry have given away something substantial, or allowed something substantial to be taken away by the process of legislation in railway matters in the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>Leaving that for the moment, perhaps leaving it altogether on this occasion, I want to point out that the company has its headquarters in Derry city.  It has a mile or two of its line in Derry city.  It is believed that it loses money in respect of portion of the line and generally recoups from that portion of the line which is, in fact, the property of the Government here. The Minister, I thought, rather suggested that there was not very much expectation in his mind of getting repayment of this loan.  What then is to be the security?  Are we getting anything from the company in respect of the other portions of the line?  Have there been any commitments beyond the lending of this £7,000?  I have a suspicion that the company has been one too many for the Ministry, that they have lent this money without much expectation of getting repaid.  They could have perhaps got something substantial in exchange before they lent it. I hope there are some Deputies from Tirconnail who know something about this undertaking from personal knowledge and that they will probe the matter a little bit more deeply than I am able to do.  I hope the twenty-four hours that the Minister has had since will have enabled him to find out all about this transaction.  I am quite sure he has been delving and diving into accounts and books and documents, and that he will be able to enlighten the Committee on this transaction.  Then I have no doubt that Deputies from that part of the country will be ready to take up the running.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly say very much on this subject.  The railway people may contend they are in a very bad way; that they are losing money heavily, and unable to keep the line running.  Whether there is anything at the back of that or not, I do not know.  We have to take the statement <Col N="848" /> of the railway manager.  I do not know anything about the auditing of the accounts, whether an auditor has been sent down from the Department that is associated with the control of the railways to check the figures.  But I do know that if the railway closed down it would be a very serious matter for the districts concerned.  They allege that it is impossible for them to keep running unless they get the subsidy, and a deputation approached the Department with reference to it.  I listened to the statements of Deputy Johnson, Deputy Davin, and Deputy McGoldrick with the utmost interest, but I am in the position that I cannot throw very much light on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular sub-head of the Estimate to which reference has been made, sub-head (d), is as described, an advance to a particular railway company, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company, in order to meet the loss on three other lines&mdash;the Letterkenny and Burtonport line, and the Carndonagh and Buncrana extensions.  The story about these lines is one that must be familiar to Deputies who attended the various stages of the Railway Bill.  This is a question of an old working agreement which, under present conditions, is inequitable, and an advance had to be made to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly line to get them to continue working these three lines, which were being worked at a loss.  The basis on which the worked lines were paid was somewhat different in the three cases. In the Letterkenny line the arrangement was a percentage of the profits, and in the other two it was on a basis of £3 10s. per mile per week.  Previously, when Deputy McBride raised a question with regard to a Mayo line, I pointed out that there was a working arrangement to work that line at £4 a week per mile, and I argued that it was quite inequitable under the circumstances. I say now that £3 10s. is unjustifiable as a working arrangement. With regard to the percentage of the receipts upon the line on which this was the arrangement, its expenditure has in recent years exceeded all receipts. <Col N="849" /> The position the Government was faced with was that unless some other arrangement could be made, the three lines would cease to operate. These are Saorstát lines, but they are worked under an Act which says that they shall be worked under the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. There had to be an interim solution, and that solution was by way of an interim advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I think, a suspicion that all Government Departments are foolish and apt to be guilty of tremendous folly, and there is a suspicion here, I think, that the railway company was one too many for the Department which allowed the advance to be made without investigation.  That is not the case. The accounts were examined.  Someone was sent north to examine the accounts of the three lines, and they were brought down here and again scrutinised, and, as a result of that scrutiny, an agreement was made to advance the amount in four instalments equal to half the loss in 1923.  The benefit of that was this: that none of that money went in compensation to the shareholders, but the directors, with this money, were enabled to go to the bank and negotiate a further advance.  On one occasion they had to get an overdraft to meet the wages bill for one week.  The advance has been made, and it is simply an advance.  There is no further commitment in the payment of this money, and there is this safeguard, that the accounts are kept separate and are subject to examination, and they will be examined and, if it is clear that the advance, or any portion of the advance, is not reasonable, the advance can be withheld or arrangements made for its repayment.  The entire position is safeguarded.  There is no relation between this advance and the Bill which is now being promoted in the British House of Commons, and which has to do with the raising of further capital expenditure on the working line for the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway.  The advance which we made has only to do with the three worked lines and has nothing to do with the working line.  With regard to that Bill in the British House of Commons, the Saorstát position is definitely safeguarded. Special provision is made for <Col N="850" /> that portion of the expenditure on the line within the 26 counties.  Nothing has been given away under the terms of that Bill.  The main argument to have this advance made was, as I said last night, that without it Donegal would have been left entirely without railways, because not merely would the three worked lines have gone out of operation, but even the working line, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly undertaking, would also have ceased to operate.  That line did pay a good dividend, about 7 per cent., before the war, but at that time its wages bill was one of the lowest in Ireland, and the employees were badly paid.  That is not the case now, and after the period of control the sum which the railway got under the Settlement of Claims Act was received and paid out, and there was actually no money in the coffers of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly line. We are not in the position of having paid money to replenish empty coffers. The causes of the loss in working which have brought these railways to this position may be briefly stated.  Two of them are peculiar to Donegal.  One, which I hope will not unduly excite Deputy White, is the failure of the fishing industry in Donegal, and the second is the cessation of the travels of migratory labourers to Scotland.  The third cause is due to trade depression.  These three factors put the lines in this position. I hope the House is satisfied with the explanation.</P>

      <P>This advance, I take it, is equal to half the loss of these worked lines.  Has the Minister estimated what is the loss in connection with the capital expenditure?  These lines have, I presume, been built out of national monies and are the property of the State.  This item of £5,430 of subsidy makes no account of the amount of money which would be received on the capital expenditure.  Am I right in assuming that?</P>

      <P>Vote 43 includes some items for technical instruction, and as these items are very few, with a view to saving possible confusion I had better tick off those items for the benefit of Deputies. There are only six items altogether. Under sub-head (a), £25,950 for technical instruction, was out of a sum of £144,000 mentioned.  £25,950 is for technical instruction.  That is page 143. Under sub-head (b) £4,500 should be appropriated to technical instruction. Under sub-head (d) £215.  Under sub-head (d) (1) £320.  Under sub-head (f) (1) there is a pretty substantial amount of £73,420.  The whole sub-head (f) (2), towards scholarships, is £900.  That is a total of £105,305.  If Deputies will subtract £105,000 from £380,470, they will get the gross figure for agriculture, which is £275,470. Deputies will remember when considering this Estimate that the total of £380,775, set out on page 144, includes £105,305 for technical instruction, and that the real gross figure for agriculture is £275,470.  Appropriations in Aid are £30,932, or rather the amount is £31,032, of which £100 should be properly appropriated to technical instruction. So far as agriculture is concerned, the proper appropriation is £30,132.  £244,532 is the net figure for agriculture.  Deputies will note that there are really only six items, and only two substantial items, namely, (a) and (f) (1), which may be appropriated to technical instruction, and these can be discussed on Vote 44, Science and Art.</P>

      <P>There is an item on Vote 44, £10,215 for the Botanic Gardens. That is the total amount.  It comes from very few sub-heads&mdash;(a) (1) £9,260, (a) (2) Travelling £40, (a) (3) £25 and (a) (9) £890.  The total is £10,215.  That is the cost of the Botanic Gardens.  I hope it will be included by the next Minister for Agriculture in the Agricultural Vote.  There are a few items on which I wish to comment.  One is (h) (4).  Deputies will notice that the amount voted for 1924-25 is £12,906 as against £13,440 in 1923-24. I wish to explain at this stage that the Vote is to be supplemented by £2,000 payable from the Endowment Fund.  From that there will be £14,906, practically £15,000 spent this year and that does not include any of the cost of the Dairy Bill I also wish to comment on (h) (1) live stock.  The Grant in aid of the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account of the General Cattle Diseases Fund was £500.  That is the total vote.  That will pay for the first few cattle that will get foot and mouth disease in this country, and as the law stands at present if £5,000,000 worth of cattle were slaughtered in this country because they suffered from foot and mouth disease the Treasury should pay. I want to make that clear that that is the position until the law is changed, and moreover that is the intention. Under (g) (1) Agricultural Education Research is £30,400 as against £36,700 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That £36,700 is, in effect, really a book-keeping entry, because at the very beginning of the year it was clear that £5,000 would be deducted from it.  The £36,700 was made up as follows:&mdash; Grants to County Committees of Agriculture, <Col N="853" /> £25,000; salaries of itinerant instructors, £9,700; grants to Universities for teaching agriculture, £2,000. The County Committees of Agriculture get their grants from us on a most involved basis.  First of all, a certain sum is set aside for each county.  That is its quota, after making an elaborate calculation on the basis of population, poor law valuation, the number of milch cows, and so on.  That sum was reduced last year to £20,000, so that there was a reduction of £5,000.  There was also a reduction last year in item No. 2, which is £9,700, of £800.  The item, Grants to Universities for teaching agriculture, £2,000, is the same as last year.  If you deduct those two sums, £5,000 plus £800, you practically reduce last year's figures to £30,700. as against £30,400.  It is proposed to pay a certain amount from the Endowment Fund, leaving the item this year under sub-head (i) the same as last year.  I said this was for agricultural education and research, so that Deputies will note our ideas of agricultural education and research.  Money spent in that way on instructors and grants to Universities, could be discussed only in connection with the Science and Art Vote.  Properly speaking, that is not research, and we are well aware that more money must be spent on agricultural education, and spent in other directions, particularly in the Universities.  Deputies can discuss the merits of this question of agricultural education and research, and can only discuss it intelligently, by having full cognisance of our proposals in connection with the College of Science. These proposals will come up under Vote 44.  That is all I propose to say in explanation of this item at this stage.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the disparity in the amounts, £160,000 spent on technical education, while only £2,568 is spent on the Royal Veterinary College. That £2,568 represents an increase of £90 over what was spent in 1923-24. The disparity between the two sums seems a big one.  £2,568 seems a very small amount to spend on the Veterinary College, in a country like Ireland, where the industry is so important. Under sub-head 46, for the Veterinary Research Laboratory, there is £1,400 for 1924-25, and in 1923-24 there was £3,000 spent.  These are items that I would bring under the notice of the Minister, not exactly in a critical manner, but more in the way of having an interchange of views on the subject.  I look on the Veterinary College and the Veterinary Research Laboratory as two most important matters in connection with the administration of his Department, and these sums that are spent on them, look very small as compared with almost £160,000 spent on technical education.  I hope that the Minister will give us a satisfactory explanation as to why these small sums are given for such important matters, while £160,000 is spent on this matter of technical education.

      <P>Lest the Minister might be alarmed I want to assure him that I am not going to follow the steps of Deputy White in moving a reduction of either his salary or of the general Vote, because if £1,700 a year is a fit and proper salary for a Minister I believe that the Minister for Agriculture is deserving of that amount because I believe he works hard and earns it as well as any other Minister.  I want to draw the attention of Deputies, and of the Minister in particular, to a matter which I endeavoured to get satisfaction upon during the discussions of the Estimates for the last couple of years, and that is the huge amount of barley and malt that is imported to the detriment of the people who are engaged in the agricultural industry, and particularly those in certain counties who have to rely upon the growing of barley for the principal source of their revenue.  I have not got at my disposal, nor have I been able to get, although I tried, all the figures I would like to give the Dáil, but in 1923, the amount of raw barley imported into the Saorstát represented 105,920 barrels, or equal to an acreage, taking the average yield of barley for the past couple of seasons, of 7,100 Irish acres.  That is barley imported from foreign countries.  The number of barrels imported from cross-Channel was 11,840 barrels, equal to the yield of 720 Irish acres.  In regard to malt the imports represented 134,970 barrels from foreign countries, equal to a yield of 9,000 Irish acres, and from cross-Channel in 1922, 433,320 barrels of malt were imported, equal to 29,000 Irish acres.  In the case of oats the position is not quite so serious, I presume.  The number of barrels imported in 1923 was 75,000, equal to the produce, on an average <Col N="856" /> year's yield, of 5,000 Irish acres.  Now I claim in this matter to express the views of the people of a constituency which is a barley-growing one, and this is a matter in which agricultural labourers are deeply concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I claim to express the views of the majority of people affected in that constituency who have to rely almost entirely on the revenue that they derive from the growing of barley.  I have received deputations both from farmers and brewers in the area, and the brewers are as much affected as the barley growers themselves.  I am assured, for instance, in the case of one small brewery that is in the area that I represent in the County Leix, that three years ago they were asked to buy 30,000 barrels by Guinness &amp; Co.  This year, I am told from the same source, they only expect to purchase 12,000. I make that point to show that the increase in the number of barrels imported is the cause of the decrease in the amount which these people are asked to buy from the local farmers to supply Messrs.  Guinness &amp; Co.  I am not sure whether the Minister will admit this point or not, but it was expected that last year a higher price would have been paid by Guinness &amp; Co., who controlled the market in this matter, for barley that they bought from the Irish farmer than they actually did pay.  I am told that even though the price was low last year, there is a likelihood that the price this year will be much lower.  I say that if any attempt is to be made by the Government and by the Minister for Agriculture, who in this matter is primarily responsible for the policy of the Government, to put the agricultural industry on its feet, some steps must be taken immediately to see that something is done to help the farmers who are in the position that I have put before him.  Counties like Leix, Offaly and Wexford are mostly affected.  I know that the farmers of these areas are in a very bad way, and that another bad year will be the last through which they can carry on.  In other words, I can see quite plainly that a number of farmers who, in some cases have increased their acreage under barley this year to the extent of 15 per cent., if they do not get a better <Col N="857" /> price for the barley this year, will be absolutely driven out of the business.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions here I have advocated a tariff on imported barley as the only remedy for the situation. I know that the Minister will tell me that the effect of that will be to increase the price of bacon to the Irish farmers themselves As far as I know, and I am not quite certain that the situation has altered in the last five or six years, the average Irish farmer and the labourers whom he employs are not fed upon Irish bacon, but mostly on American bacon, and I think that the figures of the imports in regard to that particular commodity will bear out what I say.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the farmers themselves and those whom they employ are fed on American bacon as against Irish bacon, I fail to see what bad effect a tariff on imported barley would have on the price of bacon in this country.  The Minister may have good reasons to advance against the remedy which I think is the only one to stop the import of barley to the extent that it is being imported, and being imported in an increasing degree for the past number of years.  Guinness and Co.&mdash;and this is acknowledged&mdash;both in the malting industry and in the production of beer and stout are making profits that could not be justified in any country in the world, and I think that the least that might be expected from those who control the barley industry, or who control the prices, is a fair and reasonable profit to the people who produced the barley.  If they are not prepared to do that, and by doing so to keep on their feet the people who have to rely on this as the only source of their revenue, it is the duty of the Government, as a last resort, to take the matter in hands themselves, to face it courageously and say that the only remedy is a tariff on barley.  I would like to hear the views of those who claim to represent the farmers.  I am sorry that Deputy Gorey is absent.  Although he does not represent a barley-growing county, if he claims to be the leader of the Farmers' Party in the Dáil, it is up to him to say what is his remedy for the situation that exists.  If he is not in favour of a protective tariff against <Col N="858" /> imported barley, then he should tell the Minister what his remedy for the situation is.  Unfortunately, there is no direct representative of the farmers from the constituency of Leix and Offaly.  I do not know what the cause of that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I claimed in the last election&mdash;I dare say that Deputy Heffernan will not contradict it, but at least he can make inquiries, if he has any doubts&mdash;that the vast majority of the small farmers in Leix, and those were all I asked, supported me.  This is not a matter that affects the small farmers particularly.  It also affects agricultural labourers, who in a great many cases are dependent on the farmer getting a good price for his produce. If the small farmer is not able to survive then he cannot employ labour, or if he does he cannot give them a living wage.  This is not a matter that may be looked upon purely from a farmer's or a labourer's point of view, and I put it in all seriousness to the substitute leader of the Farmers' Party while the leader is absent, that he should take the place of the leader in this matter and state definitely and frankly to the Dáil what his view of the situation is, what the remedy to be applied should be, and if he is not in favour of a protective tariff to tell the Minister on this occasion quite frankly <Col N="859" /> what is the farmers' remedy for the situation that undoubtedly exists to-day and which, if allowed to go on in the way I have stated, will undoubtedly bring ruin to the people engaged in the production of barley in this country.</P>

      <P>I am quite in agreement with a good deal of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Davin.  If the markets for barley are to go on the way they have been going on for the past year, they will drive the people engaged in that industry out of business altogether.  In the county which I represent there is a considerable quantity of barley grown.  It is one of the staple products they have, and I know from experience that if these men do not get a price sufficient to pay them for the growing of that crop, they will have to cease growing it.  Deputy Davin has touched upon one point, and that is the profits this combine in Dublin is making.  If they can make excessive profits, I think at least some of these profits should go to the people who produce the raw material for that industry.  I do not know whether it would be a good thing to put a protective duty on barley, but, at the same time, if the people who are making excessive profits out of the farmers of the country generally do not give them a fair price for their produce, the Government will have, in the end, to put on a duty that will save the people of the country from ruin.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I am not going to wade into the question of Free Trade and Protection.  I think that is a matter which will be debated at its proper time.  I am going to refer generally to the Vote for Agriculture.  We are spending this year, according to the Estimates, £32,000,000 on services, and the Minister is satisfied with £275,000 out of this £32,000,000 as the <Col N="860" /> amount of money which is needed for the development of agriculture.  Now, on the face of it, there is something wrong.  He places all his cards on the development of milk production, and his Estimates to-day are £500 less than last year, and they are half of the amount which the Government of Northern Ireland can afford to develop cow-testing in the Six Counties.  We will say the Minister of Finance is not omnipotent and that he has not the power.  Has he come down here to the Dáil, to which he is directly responsible, and asked them if they are willing to increase that amount or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not in agreement, then, with the development of that line.  I heard him specifying on several occasions that if there is to be any development it must be development of the milch cow, and yet out of £32,000,000 his estimate is only £275,000, and the dairy cow is cut to the extent of £500.  £30,000 is allocated for research.  It means that that money will be spent by the various bodies, £9,000 of which is for itinerant instruction. How they are passing their time I do not know, but results there are not.  I believe that the reorganisation of the Department of Agriculture, which was promised two years ago, and which is still being reorganised, should be effected by now.  I believe that in the Governor-General's speech it was stated that various schemes and various Bills were to be brought forward, post haste, and here we are, at the end of the session, and not one of the Bills necessary for the development of agriculture has been passed. We are only in the Committee Stage of the Dairy Produce Bill.  We have heard nothing about the registration of cattle this year, and the Eggs Bill has been merely introduced.  There is the quota of legislation for this country, which is an agricultural country, and that is all that our Department of Agriculture has been able to put before us.  I am inclined, with Deputy White, to move a reduction of this Vote.  I am inclined to point out the necessity for a reduction of it, and that is the only way we can make a protest. <Col N="861" /> We have been too long waiting for results. We are getting no results. Sufficient attention is not being paid to agriculture.  I do not quite follow Deputy Davin on the question of the barley tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could give a subsidy for barley.  He could make a price for barley.  The State is big enough to say to these men: &ldquo;Fix a price for your barley.&rdquo;  We know the extent the country is dependent upon Guinness.  We know that Guinness's profits are made not in Ireland, but that their market is abroad. We know that the profits they receive are derived largely from abroad, and that if the price is increased these profits will diminish, and they will be beaten out of the foreign markets.  I may say that I am not in agreement with some of my confreres on this point.  It is a very knotty point.  The barley counties want a tax, and the people who do not grow barley do not want a tax.  That is the position, and the result is we are getting nothing.  I believe help, in the way of a subsidy can be given, and my opinion is we cannot do so much in the way of taxation as we would do by giving a fixed price&mdash;if we could fix the price&mdash;of barley.</P>

      <P>May I ask Deputies if they have further points of order to raise them now, before I go on with my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, barley growing is a great tillage crop in parts of the country and if the growing of it becomes profitless the area under tillage will go out of cultivation.  The farmers will be ruined, and as a consequence the labourers.  The farmers will be put into such a state that no Land Commission annuities will be derivable from them.  The present position is, that for the last two years farmers have been growing barley at a dead loss.  They have been paying certain wages to their labourers.  I do not say that they have been paying them too much.  In fact a good many farmers wish they were in the position to pay the men more.  At the other end of this situation you have the monopolist making a profit of £13,000,000 a year on the manufacture of beer from barley. He charges the consumer an exorbitant rate for the drink he manufactures.  The position then is that the farmer is producing barley at a loss, the labourer is barely paid a sufficient wage and the middleman is making a huge profit.  I may say that several of my colleagues do not share my view on this subject.  The reason for that is that they are living in parts of the country where barley growing is of no importance.  Apart from that, I think their point of view must have <Col N="865" /> changed recently because we had the Government bringing in and passing a measure for protecting certain articles without giving the farmer any corresponding advantage.  I think it is only fair that we should claim now that one of the most important branches of our industry should get some protection or some subsidy from the Government.  I therefore support Deputy Wilson's amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Wilson in having this Vote referred back, and I intend to vote against it.  If we require good and efficient service it is necesary that we should pay the people who possess the qualifications to render the service.  I do not agree with the idea that we should not pay a man a salary of £1,000 a year.  I am certain that Deputy Wilson's amendment is not moved for the purpose of increasing the salary of the Minister or of anybody else, but with a view to decreasing their salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I desire to point out that Deputy Wilson, in moving the amendment, did not draw attention to the salary of the Minister at all.  His arguments were directed at the policy of the Government, and I suggest that Deputy Lyons ought to confine himself to that question and not be dragging something into the amendment that is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise Deputy Gorey's point.  It is a well-known fact, however, that there has been circulated throughout the Saorstát by all classes of people that, to repeat the phrase used, &ldquo;the people in big jobs up here in Dublin do nothing at all for the salaries they receive.&rdquo;  I feel certain that the amendment is put down only <Col N="866" /> for one purpose, and that is to reduce salaries and wages.  I am in agreement with Deputy Wilson to this extent, that some of the work done under the Ministry is not at all satisfactory.  In some directions they have not given the necessary protection at all.  I suggest that if it is necessary to protect barley, it is equally necessary to protect wheat.  To give protection to one particular commodity results in increasing the cost of living on some other section of the community.  If protection is to be given to barley, I think the Farmers' Party should seek protection for wheat.  I agree with protection if it helps to bring down the cost of living, but I do not agree with the protection that we had some time ago, because it was only given to two or three articles and resulted in raising the cost of living on those who did not come directly under the protection that was then given.  The same thing, I fear, will result if protection is given to barley. Deputy Wilson referred to Guinness as the only person who was making huge profits.  I would ask the Deputy to remember that Guinness employs a huge number of workers, and perhaps some day soon the Dáil may be considering a Bill in order to knock some of these people out of employment.  If protection for barley means a reduction in the price paid for the liquor made from the barley, then I am for protection. The only nourishment that a working man can get at the end of a hard week is a bottle of stout or a pint of porter, and I am certainly not in favour of anything that would tend to increase the price of that.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Conlan say that the wages the farmers were paying the labourers were not sufficient.</P>

I am sure that if they did pay more to the labourers they would be able to make more profit for themselves.  I am against this amendment, and if a division is challenged <Col N="867" /> on it I will vote against it.  I desire to say, in conclusion, that I hope the Minister for Agriculture will soon be able to do something with regard to a division of the ranches that we have in the country, so that the position of the uneconomic holder may be rendered economic.</P>

      <P>On the question that that £2,500 be referred back for consideration it comes in, because the chances are that he did not pay enough to the owners of the slaughtered cattle. I consider that there should be a higher valuation for the cattle that will be slaughtered in the coming year.  That comes under the amendment.  I think I have already drawn the attention of the Minister to the starving of the Royal Veterinary College.  That college is a most important factor in a country like ours, where agriculture is the staple industry, the industry that everybody is living on.  Even Guinness is living and making profits on agriculture.  There is a sum of £160,000 for technical education, and £2,568 is appropriated for the Veterinary College.  It is almost a scandal, that only £2,568 should be spent in one year on the Veterinary College.</P>
      <P>It is one of the most important colleges, and veterinary science is one of the most important professions at present in this or any other agricultural country.  I would specially draw attention of the Minister to that and suggest that at least £10,000 should be spent on the equipment of the college and payment of the professors and other matters connected with veterinary research.  Even that would not be sufficient.  I would go farther and ask that as much as £20,000 or £25,000 should be spent on the veterinary college, because it is the most important subject in the country, and more attention should be devoted to it.  As a matter of fact, I maintain that a Co. Council scholarship in every county should be earmarked for a boy intended for the veterinary profession, so as to enable boys of humble parents to get a chance of joining this great profession.</P>

      <P>When I looked at this Vote first, and when I saw money for the service of the <Col N="869" /> Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, I thought it was a misnomer.  But on second thoughts, which are always best, I understood at once it was a vote really for the salary of the Minister and for the &ldquo;Department of Agriculture,&rdquo; as heretofore known.  It was not in the main inaccurate, and this money is really for the service of the Department of Agriculture.  In it, I think it is right to criticise both.  At the outset, I realise perfectly well that the Ministry of Agriculture can do very great things for agriculture.  But, at the same time, I must say that I feel very strongly that agriculture must be saved by the persons engaged in the industry in the primary sense, and that it is only in a remote and secondary sense it can be assisted by the Ministry. All that the Ministry can do is to provide educational facilities for the agrarian community.  That is the great work and chief function of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Unfortunately, owing to the very low state of primary education, notwithstanding the very great efforts and the wholehearted earnestness of the agricultural instructors down the country, I am afraid only very poor results have been produced.  That is not, I repeat, due to any want of effort on their part, but it is mainly and chiefly due to the low standard of education, and to the apathy of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agrarian community, I regret to say, have not taken to heart the need for improving their business.  It is a regrettable thing to say, but it is undoubtedly true.  I for one do not believe in shirking the truth.  They have not adopted business methods, and while they remain so, and while they are content with that position, they can only expect to remain in poverty. It has been put up here that protection might be of some service to the farming community.  Speaking in the abstract, personally I favour Protection, but it must be complete Protection.  It must not be a one-sided measure, same as we were favoured with recently. I am wondering what would the effect of Protection on barley be. I can see very well that it would be a temporary advantage to those people engaged in barley growing.  But, then, when you consider the implications, <Col N="870" /> what will the results and the reactions of the measure be?</P>

      <P>At first the barley growers will get an increased price for their barley.  But the question is&mdash;Will they retain their markets? It is true, if you put 15 per cent. duty on imported barley in the country, it will raise the price of Irish barley, but what will the effect of such a measure be on the maltsters here? They may have to buy for a season in the home market.  But might it just not happen that the malsters might shut down business?  Remember that Guinness is the chief buyer of barley. What the distillers and the others buy is relatively negligible.  He buys nearly all the barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it not better at his own price than to have it left on your hands?  Remember the bulk of Guinness's trade is with Great Britain.  I do not know that there is 20 per cent. of his business in Ireland. Probably not more than 12 or 15 per cent. of the porter brewed by Guinness is consumed in the Free State.  He has, therefore, an export trade of about 80 per cent.  If the cost of production is raised, what will Guinness do?  He will migrate to some other land with his plant and capital, and what will happen then?  Protection will be of no use to the barley growers then, because malted barley will be unsaleable and the growers of barley will be obliged to sell it for pig feeding.  On this question of Protection, it is not fair to single out one industry, even the agricultural industry, as has been done in the Dáil, and seek to make capital out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the amendment to refer this Vote back, because I believe that sufficient money has not been voted for agricultural education.  That is my main reason for supporting this amendment. Deputy Wilson pointed out that 32 million pounds are to be spent up to the 31st March next, and out of that sum it is no exaggeration to say that <Col N="871" /> two-thirds must come from the farming community in the natural course of events.  Is a sum of £275,000 a sufficient sum to give as a stimulus to the agricultural industry?  I do not think so.  What are we in this country?  If I wanted to be downright cynical, I would say that we are only furtive creatures behind our cows.  If our agricultural prosperity declines, where are we?  Have the people, I wonder, ever looked upon the implications and the results of decay in agricultural prosperity?  I doubt it.  As a matter of fact, it is agriculture that is maintaining the exchange in respect of all the imports here.  That fact must not be forgotten.  If your exports are lower in quality, quantity or value, where are you?  I consider that it is by agricultural education rather than by legislation that the agricultural community will be saved.  I am, perhaps, at variance with some of my colleagues of the Farmers Party on this point. They favour certain Bills going through the House at present &mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would also say that I would be quite in agreement with Deputy Connor Hogan that a great deal of the work outlined here as being done by the Ministry of Agriculture might be better done by the farmers themselves. In respect of the extension of education that we have heard about, I suggest that it might proceed on the lines of relieving the State of some of the money paid in connection with the Ministry of Agriculture.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to bring the discussion to the general policy of the Department and to try to draw from the Minister a statement as to whether the Department is aiming at the development of a dairy industry through the country, with the addition of an export trade in live cattle, or whether there has been any change in the outlook of the Department regarding the character which they would wish to give to Irish agriculture in the future.  It has been charged against the policy of the Department of recent years that it has concentrated too much upon the production of beef cattle and that as a consequence there has been a decline in the milking qualities, and that the advantage has all been with the exportation of stores.  I would like to have some general statement from the Ministry in regard to their present line of policy.  What is the attitude of the Ministry in the way of encouraging tillage for the feeding of live stock? What is the attitude of the Ministry regarding dairying generally?  Whether dairying is to be supplemental or subsidiary to a live stock trade, and generally the view of the Ministry regarding the two lines of policy, so far as they were divergent, dealt with in the Majority or the Minority Reports of the Agricultural Commission.  We have had before us a Dairy Produce Bill that indicates the intentions of the Ministry regarding the butter trade.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether he has considered the future <Col N="875" /> of that dairy industry and the direction which he thinks it ought to take. Is he laying all stress upon butter production? Does he think that the best advantage for agriculture in Ireland will be derived from a concentration upon the exportation of butter, as contrasted, say, with cheese, cream, or whole milk?</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out in the minority Report that by relying upon the butter market in England, we are voluntarily entering into competition in that great market for butter with Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Siberia and possibly Canada, and we do not know what other countries will develop the butter-making industry. With modern transportation facilities, cooling chambers and the like, it is evident that the butter trade in England is going to be well supplied from overseas and it is suggested, I think with force, that the advantages which Ireland might have from her closeness to that great market, if we are going to lay stress upon butter, is to a great extent lost.  We get butter into the market in forty-eight hours.  Denmark also can get its butter into the market in forty-eight or sixty hours and the two makes are in competition on equal terms as regards freshness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit it is very well worth considering whether more attention should not be paid to the possibilities of developing trade in fresh cream or in whole milk in that English market, taking advantage of our closeness to that market which no other country has.  I do not know how far examination has been given to the question of the transportation of whole milk, but I think that it is quite within reasonable possibility that milk could be delivered in the North of England cities as fresh from Ireland as it is delivered in London from many of the distant sending stations.  I think if milk were prepared in Ireland with care, cooled and sent in proper vessels, for a great part of the year at any rate, if not for the whole year, you could get a much higher price, a much better return, even though it were a little lower to the consumer for whole milk in the British market than you could get by any <Col N="876" /> other method of sale of milk or milk products.  But apart from milk, there ought, I think, to be within the range of possibility, and I would ask the Minister if his Department has dealt with it, the question of the sale and the method of transportation of cream. It seems to me, if we are going to rely upon butter, we are practically cutting off some of our advantages. There is a question that has more than once had the attention of the House and which I think is a question on which we would desire to obtain some information from the Minister; that is the trade in beef.  Is he prepared to press upon the agricultural community the desirability from a departmental point of view, taking in view the general national well-being of developing trade in dressed meat?</P>
    <P>The question of the cost of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease was touched upon slightly by the Minister.  He pointed out that if there were such an outbreak of any contagious disease it would mean slaughter of many cattle, and that the cost of compensation would have to come out of the central fund, or that it would have to come out of voted monies or out of the general Exchequer; and he spoke of thousands of cattle, and the possibilities of many thousands, perhaps millions, of pounds.  I think it is well that he should talk in big figures, because we are in the position now, being self-dependent, that if there were a wide outbreak in Ireland the cattle-raising industry would be crippled, if not killed.  We are relying upon that export trade in live cattle.  If there was even a very light outbreak, the position in England now is such, they have had such an experience, that I believe there would be very stringent measures taken against importation of cattle from Ireland for quite a long time.  If there were a virulent outbreak there would be no hope for the Irish cattle trade.  If it were merely as a matter of insurance there seems to me to be a very urgent measure that should be taken, and that is to set moving at once the machinery for a dressed meat industry, not in one place alone but in several.  I say that the very sense of the need for self-preservation <Col N="877" /> should impel the agricultural community, led by, assisted by, and pressed forward by the Ministry. Otherwise there could be no conception, I think, of what would happen to the country and the general agricultural industry.  We had a little while ago some references to Continental trade.  No doubt direct contact with the Continent in many respects is desirable but that will lead to certain increased risks to the cattle trade&mdash;the risk of contagion.  That added risk seems to me again to call for urgent steps being taken to establish an additional outlet rather than the live stock export trade.  The only additional outlet that it is reasonable to think about is the dressed meat trade, with all the advantages that such a trade will bring.</P>
    <P>Then again I would like to have from the Minister a general statement regarding his attitude in respect to pork and bacon curing, as far as the production side is concerned.  There is, I think, good grounds for contending that one of the troubles in the pork production and pig rearing industry is the variability in prices.  That being so, with greater stability, even if it were on a lower level, people would know where they were and there would be less gambling.  Unfortunately, in the pig trade, it is very largely a gamble.  I believe with organisation and understanding between the various elements comprising that industry, some of the elements of the gamble could be removed and greater stability attained.  With that greater stability of prices, there would be more general satisfaction, more general prosperity and greater pig production.</P>
    <P>There is a very great range that one might touch upon, but these three items are of great importance, and I do not think that at any point, either in introducing this Vote or in any previous discussion, we have had stated the policy of the Department respecting these things.  If the proper administration of such departments of the agricultural industry, as I have spoken of, involves a greater outlay, then I think there should be a greater outlay agreed to by the Dáil.  Unless there is a reassuring statement from the Minister I am inclined, and I am <Col N="878" /> quite prepared, to vote for the reference back of this Vote with a view to reconsideration for the purpose of getting a larger Vote, with the assistance and support of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKENNA Mr. McKENNA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few items in this Vote which I wish to refer to.  One is the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act.  Whilst I must congratulate the Veterinary Branch of the Department of Agriculture on their vigilance, since the advent of foot and mouth disease into England, in keeping the disease out of this country, I must say that there are other branches under that Department that could be better administered. Take the matter of swine fever.  Swine fever has not been coped with properly, although the Department are dealing with it since the Local Government Act was passed in 1898.  Even the city of Dublin is at present, and has always been, reeking with this disease. The rural districts, I may say, are practically immune from it.  Some years ago the late Vice-President of the Department of Agriculture obtained a grant for research purposes.  It was merely a grant which was spent by the Department, and they did not go any further.  This is one matter that the Veterinary Branch should pay some heed to.  The present system is altogether wrong.  It encourages people to cloak the disease.  Suppose the disease breaks out in a place, and it is reported to the police.  They wire to the Department and a Veterinary Inspector is sent down.  Compensation is only allowed for the pigs that he orders to be destroyed.  No compensation is allowed for those that are already dead.  The premises affected are closed up for a period of 56 days, I think, and a lot of restrictions are placed on the owner before he can replace his stock. Owing to that system, many people cloak the disease instead of reporting it, and the consequence is that the disease is spreading.  There is another item I wish to refer to.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if I am in order, because I wish to discuss, not so much the Minister's policy as the alternative policy which Deputy Johnson suggested as a reason why we should vote for the amendment.  Deputy Johnson is so convincing that I am filled with fear that the Farmers' Party will go home to their creameries, where they have creameries, and decide to scrap all their machinery and embark on the whole milk and cream trade instead.</P>
      <P>Now, I think that if there was a great future for a whole milk and cream trade in the British market the Danes, who are active and enterprising farmers, would have discovered and captured it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is <Col N="880" /> another factor which affects both them and ourselves, and which Deputy Johnson seems to have forgotten, and that is that both in their case and in ours there is a sea passage, and you cannot guarantee that the sea will be smooth at any season of the year.  I venture to think that a wholesaler in England hoping to buy whole milk or cream from this country or Denmark would be disappointed if, when opening his cans, he found butter.  That is what would happen very often if we embarked on this trade.  It is a precarious enterprise, and not even Deputy Johnson can command the movements of the sea.  I think he suggested that we would need a special apparatus, but unless you had a special arrangement, like the hanging gardens of Babylon, which would hang in the ship and not be susceptible to motion, it could not be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite gather whether Deputy Johnson asked whether I had drawn such a cart to a creamery, or whether I had seen one. The answer to the second part of the question is in the affirmative.  Undoubtedly milk does get bumped about before it arrives at the creamery, but there it is pasteurised and made into butter and the evil effects removed.  I do not think that we could supply milk to Manchester or Birmingham when out of eight months of the year the sea passage would cause deterioration.  I think this is not the first time that Deputy Johnson is unduly pessimistic. If we cannot, with all the advantages of our position, equal the Danes and beat the Australians, New Zealanders and Canadians in the British market the sooner we ask for admission to homes for imbeciles the better.  We have as good pasture as any other country, and we have as good breeding stock and cattle, and if we do not make the most of the advantages we possess, and if we are not in a position to do so, then the sooner we get out of business the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a few remarks on the general policy of the <Col N="881" /> Department of Agriculture, and, first of all, I want to draw attention to the small amount of money spent on the key industry of the country.  The amount of money put aside for this Vote, as compared with that given by other agricultural countries of anything like our size is altogether inadequate. Some Deputies object to this amount of money being devoted to the development of the industry, but when it is remembered that goes to a country dependent on this industry it will be seen that it is not at all adequate for its purpose.  Every other country which has a system like we have, recognises this and does its best to foster and develop this particular industry.  We have not got on the road to doing as much for agriculture in this country as other countries are doing. We have not, as we should have, a Faculty of Agriculture in our Universities. We have no Research Departments. We have no means of meeting the cattle diseases, which cost almost a million a year in this country.  We depend on the research work of other countries in this respect, and the only thing we have is that the heads of our Departments take advantage of the experiments and knowledge derived from other countries in this respect. That might be said to have been all right in the past, when we were part and parcel of another country which had it own research departments in Universities dealing with these problems, and which could be utilised also for this country.  We have, however, passed that stage, and it is up to us to put our agriculture on a proper basis. As Deputy Hogan said, it is a matter of education.  This is the beginning of education and there is need for a Faculty of Agriculture.  Deputies refer here to the barley question.  Some Deputies are in favour of a tariff, some in favour of a subsidy, but everyone, I think, is agreed that the people who are growing barley are, like other elements in the community, in a very bad way.  I do not believe in subsidies, because if you start a subsidy in one particular commodity you have to follow it down the whole gamut and the whole scale of our agricultural produce accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would mean that barley, in a year <Col N="882" /> or two, would have to subsidise the growers of other produce.  Some other method will have to be arrived at, whether it is in the form of protection or in the form of putting on&mdash;I do not know what word to use&mdash;a penalty to the buyer of foreign corn and distribute that penalty to the grower of Irish barley.  Some Deputies here seem to have very nervous qualms about what would happen the brewers in this country, especially one big industry in this city, but anybody who knows the history of this big concern must remember that they started with small capital, and they never called in new capital, but the capital is much more now.  We have had, I do not know how many, redistribution schemes in that firm within the last twenty years.  If I said that there were four or five of such schemes, I do not think that I would be exaggerating, for I myself have seen two or three in my time&mdash;redistribution after redistribution out of revenue and drawn from reserves.</P>
    <P>Some people must be getting more than a fair deal out of this concern, and they are not the people who grow the barley or the people who drink the finished article.  Somebody is getting a very unfair share of the profits of this industry, and that does not require much telling or proving.  Anyone who takes up the balance sheets year after year, and reads the history of this firm for the last forty years, knows that these reserves have been growing after paying dividends.  They have paid their taxes and super-taxes, the bonuses and the rest, but still the reserves have been growing.  I think this is a matter for the State.  These people have not been treating those who grow the raw material in anything like a fashion according to the ideas of fair play.  A Deputy said that if we had not this particular industry here we would have to sell our barley for pig feeding.  We had to do that, and the difference of the price of the barley, between that for pig feeding and for malt, is practically nothing.  Men have had to buy barley, for pig feeding, and I did it myself, and the price was 12/- or 13/- a barrel, and even 10/- and 8/-.  These people are not the wonderful saviours some people think <Col N="883" /> they are.  I think it was Deputy Hewat referred to the amount of money that has been expended on the agricultural industry, and he asked if it would not be better if the farmers themselves developed agriculture, and not have it a State matter at all.  I think if Deputy Hewat would read the budgets of Denmark, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the Argentine, he would get a lot of information, and would get to know what is at the back of the minds of the people who are at the head of these companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here as a distributor of literature to Deputy Hewat. If Deputy Hewat wants literature, the least he can do is to make himself wise at his own expense.  Deputy Johnson has asked for a good deal of information with regard to our agricultural policy, and with regard to cattle and by-products, and he instanced the case of dairying and the live stock trade. If we have dairying we must have a live stock trade, or kill the young animal at its birth.  I leave the Minister to deal with that.  The English market is the market for milk.  There is a very extensive market there for milk, but you are rather faced with two or three aspects of the case you have to think about.  The milk has to be transported in large quantities, and the cost of that transport has to be taken into consideration. That is not an important matter.  The important matter is, in what condition will the milk arrive, and, more important still, let me start a purely milk trade and I will have no milk to rear calves.  The milkman raises no calves.  He has not the milk to do so.  Where you have cattle you must have a butter or a cream trade. Anyone in the trade knows and understands, and most Deputies know enough to understand, that that is a cardinal principle which you cannot get away from.  We cannot have an exclusively, or even a fifty per cent. milk trade here.  I am not prepared to quarrel with the Ministry of Agriculture. I think they have done reasonably well with the amount of public money at their disposal.  What I do <Col N="884" /> quarrel with is the attitude of the Executive Council and the Government in not putting anything like enough money at the disposal of agriculture. It is a plain proposition that this country is dependent on agriculture, and can scarcely do enough for its agriculture. There is a very old maxim about killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  My idea is to preserve the goose that laid the golden egg and make her lay two golden eggs, because agriculture is not the property of the people in the State, it is the property of the nation, and until you develop it properly you are not on the right track.  I suggest to the Dáil and also to the Minister for Agriculture, if he is so inclined, as I believe he is, to increase this Vote, which is necessary if agriculture is to be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect of this I would like to call attention to. At the outset I would say that the amount of money set aside for this particular Vote is not in my opinion what it ought to be.  Deputy Hewat, I think it was, objected to this money being devoted to this particular industry, and hinted that it was the duty of the farmers themselves to find this money.  I think that Deputy Hewat&mdash; and I am afraid some other Deputies on the farmers' benches&mdash;are looking at this from a wrong angle.  This particular Vote we are considering is really a question of education.  It all, I think, amounts to that in the end. Comparisons have been made on the farmers' benches on the amount devoted to technical education, and the amount devoted to agriculture, but I look at this Vote as being in the nature of an expenditure on technical education in this particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, therefore, say to Deputy Hewat that the position, to my mind, is that we had to spend a certain amount on technical education as a whole, and this Vote is for agriculture, and the £160,000&mdash;or whatever it is&mdash;on technical education is for the benefit of the other industries of the country. That is the way I look at it, and, in this connection, I point out to Deputy Gorey, who spoke of the small amount expended on the key industry of the country, that it is not expended exactly on the industry, but is really spent by <Col N="885" /> the country as an extension of its educational activities.  I look on this Vote as part and parcel of the educational activities of the country.  I must express surprise at the statement made by Deputy Wilson at the very beginning of the discussion, because he seemed to me to rather deprecate the expenditure of money on agricultural instructors.  He said: &ldquo;They were passing their time, I do not know how.&rdquo;  If that is the way Deputy Wilson looks at this particular Vote, I am afraid he is looking at it from a rather wrong angle.  If this Vote, or any money which is expended under it, is to be made effective, it must be done through the medium of instructors appointed by the Department to carry on the educational work for which the money is made available.  I believe with Deputy Gorey, that it is the duty of the State to educate the people, and to provide for the technical education of the people engaged in these industries. I say that the amount set out in this Vote for that particular purpose, seeing that our agricultural industry is the mainstay of the nation, is a comparatively small amount.  For that reason I am prepared to support Deputy Wilson's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have supported the motion of Deputy Wilson, largely from the point of view of having a discussion on the general principles of this Vote on agriculture.  I would say that it is not meant in my case as a vote of censure on the Minister's policy or on him individually. From my point of view, it was a vote of censure largely on the administration of the Department of Agriculture. If I am within my rights in speaking on that, I would like to let that govern my remarks.  Deputy Wilson referred to the reorganisation of the Department. I would say, as a matter of policy, that the question of the reorganisation of the Department of Agriculture ought to be taken up.  I am not satisfied that we are getting the value from the Department that we ought to get.  I am not satisfied that the Department, as conducted under the past regime, is the best organisation to carry on the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> With regard to this Vote, it is difficult for us to criticise it adequately. The Vote is not self-explanatory, and we cannot tell from it the exact state of things.  We cannot tell what the administrative departments are costing at headquarters, apart from the expenditure in the counties.  Before we are in a position to discuss the policy of the Department in a general manner, we ought to have placed in our hands a statement showing the full cost of the Department of Agriculture. It should include the cost of everything connected with agricultural education and technical education, under the heads of the Department, and also the counties.  Then we will be in a position to tell the exact amount devoted to agriculture throughout the country, and we would be in a position to criticise this Vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I would like to know separately the exact amount spent on the different colleges at Ballyhaise, Clonakilty, and Glasnevin.  As far as I can see, the Vote only contains the salaries of the instructors and the teachers in the colleges. There is nothing to show what is the total cost of the maintenance of those colleges.  Perhaps the colleges pay for themselves.  I hope they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  I am not justified in any close criticism, because I confess I do not know my facts as I should like to know them.  At any rate, the idea is that the Department is top heavy.  There is too much money spent at Headquarters, and too little in the counties. The main object of the Department is education.  The greater part of its activities can be regarded, in one measure or another, as educational.  I am sorry to say I cannot agree with my colleague, Deputy Wilson, in his statement regarding the instructors in the counties.  I would rather reverse <Col N="887" /> the idea that appears to be in Deputy Wilson's head.  I am inclined to think that the work done by agricultural instructors in the country, considering the circumstances under which they have to work, is very good in most cases. Certainly, it is in any case that has come to my knowledge.  I believe those instructors are hampered by lack of funds and by having large areas, too large to cover, and also by wrong methods imposed on them by Headquarters.  On that account they are not able to do themselves justice. I would like to see a complete change in the present system, and I would advocate decentralisation.  The money voted here is not sufficient, but I certainly think it could be devoted to better purpose if more were given through the country and less in connection with the big Headquarters staff.  We would then get more efficient work.  The areas covered by the instructors are all too large.  It is impossible for the instructors to attend to their duties adequately.</P>
      <P>My constituency corresponds with the area of the agricultural instructor in my county.  I come in close contact with him.  It is physically impossible for him to carry on that work, to lecture, and to carry out his experiments. The result is that his work cannot be adequately done, and the results are ineffective.  Now, I do not know that the matter of barley growing really comes into this matter.  I think it does not, except that it has been already discussed.  It does not affect the policy of the Minister.  The Minister has nothing to do with the giving of a bounty on the production of barley.  If the Ceann Comhairle allows me to talk on this matter I will.</P>

      <P>Apparently it has been discussed before, so I had better say a few words on it.  I come from a county which is the second or third largest barley-growing county in Ireland. I have not advocated, up to the <Col N="888" /> present, the granting of protection to barley.  My reason was that I did not believe in the policy of Protection at all, and I did not believe in inserting the thin end of the wedge by favouring the giving of protection to barley.</P>

      <P>I was hoping at that time that the Government would not introduce protective tariffs.  Since then the Government have introduced protective tariffs.  The Government say it is only at an experimental stage.  I believe that is all eyewash.  There is no such thing as an experimental stage in protective tariffs.  Once protection is started one is committed definitely to it and cannot get away from it. That being the case, when industries that only comprise 25 per cent. of the wealth of this country get a protective tariff, I think the least we could claim for one of our industries, which is perishing, is that it should get protection. I am a Protectionist as far as barley is concerned now, but if the Government say, &ldquo;We will withdraw the protective tariff next year,&rdquo; I withdraw my claim for protection for barley.  That is the stand I take.  I represent farmers.  Deputy Davin says that we claim to represent them.  I know that I represent them.  We have many claims made here to represent the farming industry, and some of the Deputies on the Labour Benches claim that they represent them.  I think they do represent, at least, some farmers.</P>

      <P>To a certain extent I am in agreement with points that were raised by Deputy Johnson. I think it is advisable that we should have alternative markets for our agricultural products.  We should not have all our eggs in the one basket.  If there is a possibility of conveying whole milk to the English consumer, I would be in favour of having it, as part of the policy of the Department. I do not think it is feasible, to a certain extent, principally from the point of view of conveyance.  I think the experiment was tried, and was not found successful.  At one time, I believe, milk was shipped from Rosslare to England, but I believe the project fell through, and could not be, I think, considered as a successful proposition.  I want to remind Deputies who compare this country with Denmark, that we are not in the same position.  We have a different climate, a different soil, and different conditions.  We have many other industries besides the dairy industry. In Denmark the dairy industry is the basic industry, with its subsidiary industries of bacon and poultry.  In this country, although the dairy industry is an important one, it is not by any means the most important.  We have several other important subsidiary industries, such as bacon, butter, cheese, poultry, eggs, cattle&mdash;which is still the most important industry&mdash;sheep and horses.  Although I consider the dairying industry very important, and that it should be included in the Minister's policy, he should not overlook the <Col N="890" /> other industries.  I am strongly of opinion that the dairy industry is the one that promises most in the future. I agree with Deputy Johnson that the energies of the Minister and his Department ought to be concentrated on the improvement of that industry.</P>
      <P>As to the general policy of the Department, it is considered that the amount of money contributed by the Department towards cow-testing associations is not adequate.  These associations are starved, and the results are not what they ought to be.  I wish to support Deputy Wilson's amendment proposing to refer the Vote back for reconsideration with a view to increasing the amount.  I regard the proposal to refer the Vote back as a vote of censure on the Department.  I believe that the Department is not all that it ought to be, and that it will not be until we have a committee of inquiry set up.  The Department deals with the most important industry in the country, the basic, preponderating one.  We are not satisfied that it is doing all that it should do, and the the people of the country are not satisfied. In order that they might be satisfied it is time that there was some reorganisation, and before we can have reorganisation the proper method is to have an inquiry, not into agriculture, but into the methods of the Department.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the members of the party to which I belong in not having shown their interest in agriculture by copying some of the contributions that were made to that subject to-night.  This motion raises the question of the policy of the Department, and, in addition, we have to consider the general policy.  I am afraid I will have to deal with this question of barley and the particular policy of the Department in that respect.  First of all, I want to remind Deputy Wilson that the total Vote under 43 asked for is £240,000.  In respect of the Land Commission there is practically £700,000, and there are some other items in connection with agriculture in Vote 44, which bring the total for agriculture up to £1,000,000. We are not exactly discussing a recurrent <Col N="891" /> expenditure of £240,000, but a recurrent expenditure to the tune of about £1,000,000.  I merely state that in the interests of accuracy, as the motion is based on the alleged inadequacy of a sum like £240,000 for agricultural purposes.</P>
      <P>In addition, and as the Vote did appear, this sum of £1,000,000 is the total expenditure for the year.  A considerable amount of it is non-recurrent. It is proposed to spend close on £30,000,000 within the next five years on agriculture.  These figures are merely for the purpose of giving a certain amount of perspective to the subject.  Deputy Johnson raised the general policy of the Department under five or six different headings.  I do not propose to spend any time discussing criticism on the lines simply that more money should be spent.  That is no good and leaves us nowhere.  I may, or I may not, agree with the contention that more money should be spent, but I certainly am not going to waste time discussing it when there is no suggestion made as to how the money should be spent.</P>

      <P>Further, when the general statement is made that more money should be spent it is made on the assumption that the amount that is being spent is £240,000 whereas in actual fact £1,000,000 is being spent.  Deputies raised specific questions, questions of policy, and I would like to deal with them at some length.  Deputy Johnson asked me what is the attitude and policy of the Department in regard to dairies, in regard to livestock, in regard to tillage, in regard to the production of food at home, for consumption by the live stock and so on.  He has asked me to say what exactly should be the relationship between the butter industry and the livestock industry and with regard to the dairy industry itself whether we have any scheme for the development of the whole milk, cheese and agriculture.  He pointed out, rightly enough, that he was raising a very big question and that we have never had a full dress debate and have never been able to arrive at a definite decision on these questions <Col N="892" /> in the Dáil.  I agree, and I must remind Deputy Johnson, however, that in a very big question of policy, the question as to whether we should concentrate on our livestock or on our dairy products, whether we should have butter or beef, has not been raised here.  Probably that is the most important of the matters at present at issue in connection with agriculture, and although it has never been raised here before, it was put very specifically by me to the Agricultural Commission, but I cannot promise to give any definite decisions in the matter to the Dáil this evening.  I can only justify myself by saying I have both reports of the Agricultural Commission, extending over twenty-eight or twenty-nine pages, and they have not found themselves able&mdash; at least in detail&mdash;to give anything like very definite decisions or any definite leading on that question.  They have confined themselves to making observations on the issue, and I intend to confine myself to that procedure also, because the fact is, and every farmer knows it, it is an issue on which nobody at this stage could be dogmatic. You cannot attempt to pretend to have a cut-and-dried policy in respect of the exact weight that you are going to give to dairying, live stock and tillage, and the various heads and sub-heads of these three aspects of agriculture.  You cannot be dogmatic; you cannot give decisions at this stage on these questions.  Of course, dairying is undoubtedly the foundation of our agriculture.  It is the dairy farmer who produces not only butter, not only bacon, as a side line, but produces the beef of the country as well; and, in that sense, dairying is, of course, the foundation of Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dairying is also the foundation of Danish agriculture, and they have not found very much difficulty in deciding what exactly they should concentrate on.  They have dairying, and nothing else except a side line, such as pigs and poultry.  They have not the big problem we have.  They have not the misfortune of having the problem that we have the misfortune of having&mdash;a very important livestock industry, and having a country that is suitable not only <Col N="893" /> for dairying, but suitable also for breeding livestock.  They could never produce livestock as we do.  The land and the climate are not suitable. I was going to say the breeding stock is not suitable.  But, of course, that is something they could alter.  Their climate is not suitable, and they could not produce livestock against us.  They have concentrated on butter and our problem as against Denmark has the tremendous disadvantage that we must produce butter and beef&mdash;butter and livestock, butter to compete with Denmark, produce and beef to compete against the best beef that Scotland produces, and produce them from the same cow, if you like, while Denmark, through the misfortune of its bad climate and its bad land can concentrate on producing butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, there is a specific problem&mdash;how can it be done? This problem Deputy Johnson very lightly asked me to solve; how can that be done?  We sell butter in England. The buyer has Danish butter on offer as well; he says, &ldquo;this Danish butter is better.&rdquo;  It is no answer to say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, but we produce good beef as well.&rdquo;  He will buy Danish butter.  On the other hand we produce beef at a certain price.  We will not produce beef as cheaply as if we were breeding beef and nothing else; we must get a certain price for that beef in England in order that it will pay, and if a purchaser of beef in England can buy Scotch beef cheaper it is no use for us saying to the buyer: &ldquo;That is all right, but we produce good butter from the same cow.&rdquo;  That was the problem which I have already stated to the Agricultural Commission and which has been stated hundreds of times in this country and it is a problem upon which you could not be dogmatic in any fashion and you could not afford to be dogmatic as to its solution.  My policy in the matter is quite simple.  You have areas in this country, very large areas and areas where a very large proportion of the population live, where the land and climate combined are not good enough <Col N="894" /> to produce beef and the problem is simplified there.  There you can concentrate on the breeding of stock from which you can get the best butter and there you will have to concentrate on the breeding of that stock.  To put it in another way, there you have the choice of keeping a Kerry cow, a Shorthorn cow, an Aberdeen Angus or a Hereford.  It is extremely easy, given any one particular district, to decide what sort of live stock you can foster there and do it.</P>
      <P>You have other areas in the country like Meath where you have the problem simplified in the exact opposite direction.  The duty of the Department of Agriculture is simplified there. It is a simple problem, and it is easily carried out.  They are endeavouring in the way of subsidising the right class of breeding stock in these districts to solve the problem in these particular districts.  Between these two districts you have various stages.  I could not say at this stage, nobody could say, looking at the country as a whole, that you are going to concentrate on dairying at the expense of beef, or vice versa.  I have only one thing more to say.  Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Gorey and Deputy Hogan all agreed, that the essential purpose of the Department should be education. I dare say Deputy Johnson would agree with them on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I specifically disagreed with the majority of the Agricultural Commission that that was the only policy that the State should follow with regard to agriculture.  The Minister seems to be repeating the argument of the Majority Report that the State policy regarding agriculture should be confined mainly to education.  I specifically disagree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was not thinking of the Report of the Agricultural Commission.  I spoke of Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Hogan and Deputy Gorey, who stated that the functions of the Department of Agriculture were education, and nobody, I take it, will disagree with that.  Certainly I do not.  Before we can get any great distance in the development of our policy in the solution of the problem <Col N="895" /> which I tried to put before the Dáil now, we must have educated farmers who will co-operate with us.  It is a very difficult problem to solve which I have put before you.  It must be solved in a different way in every district. It is a problem which must be solved in a different way not only in every district, but by every farmer in every district, and unless farmers are organised and better educated, we cannot possibly develop our live stock or our dairying policy side by side. It would be much easier to develop one by itself.  We possibly could do that, but if we are to succeed in developing our butter industry on the other hand, to compete with New Zealand or Denmark, or our beef industry on the other, to compete with Scotland, we must have very intelligent co-operation not only from farmers, but from organisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson asked me were we to concentrate on butter and whether the Department has thought of the question of finding another outlet for farmers' milk than dairy produce by turning it into butter or cheese.  That subject has been considered not only recently in the Department but by a great many committees and commissions set up during the last five or six years.  The first thing that occurs to one in connection with it is this, that if the farmers of the Twenty-Six Counties who do sadly need an alternative market for their milk, are not able to capture the limited market here in Dublin, a market which they ought to capture because the conditions are most favourable to them, there is very little chance that anything we could do to organise a market for them on the other side of the water, where there is very much keener competition and where prices are lower, would succeed. That is the first point.  I hope the Trade Facilities Act will be passed soon.  There we have the power at least, if a water-tight scheme is to be put up by the farmers, by farmers anywhere, around Dublin or elsewhere, of reducing the financial difficulties that may confront them in such a scheme to a minimum.  We are anxious to discuss that scheme, to give advice on such a scheme, and to go <Col N="896" /> more than half way to meet farmers who will put up such a scheme.  But we cannot go into trade, and we cannot do any more than what we have offered to do without going into trade. If the farmers did succeed in putting up such a scheme for Dublin, I would regard it not so much as valuable for the little gain it would amount to but as a precedent for much more ambitious schemes in England and elsewhere. If we could get such a scheme for Dublin where everything is in our favour we would gain valuable knowledge, and we certainly ought to be able to tackle the other question of finding an alternative market for our milk in England, with more optimism and with better chances of success.  There is no doubt whatever, both in this milk question and in this question of beef, alternative markets are urgent. I know that the English market is the best market we have, and is likely to be the best market that we will have for a great many years.  But things happen; they may be non-recurrent; that market may be closed by fortuitous circumstances for a short period, but quite long enough to throw the whole industry out of gear, and this question of alternative markets and alternative methods of dealing with our raw material is a real live question from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to get reliable figures for the consumption of milk in Dublin.  I have got approximate figures, and I have been able to compare them with the amount of milk that is supplied by the southern farmers to their creameries, and it is perfectly obvious to me that even if the farming community proper succeeded in getting the milk trade of the whole city of Dublin it would amount to a very small proportion of their total trade.  From that point of view it is interesting to consider whether, taking long views, farmers should not begin to think as to what would be the advantages of having not one Dublin in the country, but two or three or four or five, as alternative markets.  It is when considering that question of milk and butter, with the question of the necessity that looms in the distance, and not so far away from us, the necessity <Col N="897" /> of getting alternative markets, that one begins to think that it would be worth while, even from the agricultural point of view, to make some sacrifices to provide an alternative market.  I think it is quite clear, and nobody suggests that the whole milk trade should be in substitution for the beef trade; it could never be more than complementary.  In spite of the fact that Denmark, for all purposes connected with the butter trade, is as near to England as we are, nevertheless we should always be able to hold the English market against all comers.  The milk trade can never be more than supplementary in view of the fact, as some farming Deputy pointed out, that a considerable amount of whole milk and separated milk is required in Ireland for live stock.  Now I come to tillage for feeding.  I wish I was as clear on the policy of the Department as regards tillage for feeding, as I am of my own views as an individual farmer on the conditions of producing food at home for feeding.  I believe that we must change our policy in regard to tillage.  I think that is being realised more and more as the years pass.  We are tilling in Ireland as if we were living in the East of England or in the South of England with a different climate and totally different conditions. To come to the point, apart from cash crops like potatoes and barley and other cash crops of that sort&mdash;I said cash crops, not catch crops&mdash;the policy of the Department, as far as I can control it, is to turn away from roots for feeding and experiment with a policy of silage instead.  For that purpose silos have been erected in two of the agricultural colleges, and experiments have been going on in connection with the question whether silage is not an efficient substitute for roots for all purposes.</P>
    <P>Coming to deal with trade in dressed meat.  I observe that Deputy Johnson has been too pessimistic in thinking that if foot-and-mouth disease occurred in Ireland in the future, the restrictions in regard to the export of cattle to England would be much more stringent than in the past.  They would be something more stringent, but I do not think the difference would <Col N="898" /> be quite as much as Deputy Johnson appears to think they would be.  In any event, it is a good bit more than a problematical contingency that in two or three years, or perhaps sooner, there would be an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country; it happened before; it might happen again, and it might last for months. Everybody who realises, and I suppose every farmer realises it, realises also that from that point of view alone the development of a dressed-meat trade in this country is necessary.  On the other hand, we have the failure of the attempts that have been made already, but we have the Waterford Scheme under way at the moment.  What is the policy of the Department in the matter of this?  We will co-operate in regard to any scheme put up&mdash;we will give any technical knowledge we have, and we will make any researches and investigations, that we can, into this particular question that very few people know very much about.  But again we cannot do it ourselves.  We cannot go into trade.  I hope that the Waterford people who have brought their scheme, I understand, a step further within the last few days, will come to us with a scheme that the Department of Agriculture can support and can guarantee to the Ministry of Finance under the Trades Facilities Bill.</P>
    <P>My own view on that question, if that is what Deputy Johnson is looking for, is that there is very little chance of the development of the dressed meat trade in this country except on the lines of the killing of the meat on ships specially prepared for that purpose&mdash;a new development in the matter.  In that way we would get over the transport difficulties, and be able to change our past.  Deputy Heffernan said that generally the farmers were discontented with the organisation of the Department of Agriculture, and with the amount of money that was being spent on it, and generally, that the farmers did not believe they were getting value for that money.  Well, farmers have the same doubt about everything.  But he went so far as to say that he himself thought more money should be spent on the counties.  That is hardly enough <Col N="899" /> to justify the sweeping statement that he made.  I am quite sure that farmers are not contented with the Department of Agriculture.  I would be quite surprised if they were.  No Department is perfect.</P>
    <P>But as the discontent of the Deputy has not been concentrated on a particular item, with the exception of that one item I mentioned, and which will be discussed on another occasion, I do not propose to say any more on that question.  He asked me how much of the Department's Estimate was spent on Headquarters and how much in the counties.  Well, it would be easy to answer that question approximately, but it would be extremely difficult to answer it in detail.  If he will look at the Estimate he will find that the total is £245,538; salaries, wages and allowance, £118,000; hence the difference between salaries, wages and allowances, that is the first item, and the total, namely, £245,000, makes over £100,000, and that is spent in the country; and that portion of £118,000, which represents the staffs at present working in the country, is also spent in the country.  That will give him an idea as to how much of the Estimate is spent at headquarters and how much in the counties.  He asked another question, which I think I will answer, as it is a question of policy.  He wants to know do the Farm Institutes pay. Of course, they do not pay, and I hope they will not pay.  Department farms should not be run on commercial lines. They should be run for experimental purposes, and they are run on these lines, and not to make money.  They are run to gain knowledge and to disseminate knowledge, and that costs money.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point, namely, this question of barley, and so as to avoid its having to be dealt with again I will deal with it now.  Deputy Davin suggested a tariff on barley, and some Farmer Deputies supported him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>And I supported it last year and no legislation was brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out, <Col N="900" /> first, that last year there was about one million acres under corn in Ireland, and only about one hundred and fifty thousand acres of that was barley.  I give these figures just to get the perspective. There are close on four million acres of tillage entirely; that is to say, corn and roots, and only one hundred and fifty-one thousand acres under barley.  Now, barley is extremely important to the farmers in Leix, Offaly, and Wexford, where it is grown as a cash crop.  But it is not a national question of such tremendous importance as Deputy Davin seems to think. Now, it is grown as a cash crop; that is, for immediate sale, and it is grown in large quantities in these counties.  I agree with Deputies Gorey and Hughes that the price which farmers have been getting for their barley for the last few years is a starvation price, in the circumstances.  I am not going to answer the question.  I could go into it at length.  But I ask the Deputies will their suggestion of a protective tariff get a better price, and, if so, why?  I prefer not to go into that question now, but I suggest that the Deputy should think about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a very simple principle of economics that if you want to sell, and if you have only one customer to sell to, that you must take whatever price that customer offers.  Until you get another customer which may be yourself, you will be in that position, tariff or no tariff.  That is my view, and I have given it considerable consideration.  You know that this fact of there being only one customer for barley is taken full advantage of.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is an extremely bad price at the present <Col N="901" /> moment for pigs, and yet barley is worth nearly 20s. a barrel for pigs as pork at this moment.  In the year 1922 barley was worth 7s. 6d. to 10s. per barrel as pork more than as raw material for the making of stout.  There is no question whatever about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister taking into account in making that calculation what it would cost to get the barley from where it is grown to where it is turned into pork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into that.  Certainly in 1922 barley was worth 7s. 6d. per barrel more as pork than as raw material for malting.  I agree with Deputy Baxter that it is quite easy to say that.  You cannot change people's methods of farming in a year or in a day.  These people grow barley as a cash crop, because their fathers did it before them.  They are going on doing what their fathers did, and they never make other arrangements. If they continue in that way they cannot help being in the hands of their only customer for barley.  There is no way out of it.  Most of the farmers have agreed that a tariff is no good.  I do not want the names. There is no other alternative.  If a tariff will do no good, the farmer must himself find an alternative market.  I am indicating the alternative market.  The market was there in 1922, and it is there at present. I agree with Deputy Baxter that farmers cannot suddenly change their methods of farming.  There would have to be some delay.  They would have to put up pigsties and make other arrangements. That may be coming down from high politics, but at the same time that is a thing the farmer will have to face himself when dealing with a question like this.  But if on the one hand, a protective tariff is not going to increase prices, and on the other hand there is only one customer who rules the market, the farmers ought to find an alternative market and ought to find it in the way I indicate.</P>

They have bred pigs, and 50 per cent. of the pigs bred in Ireland are of the wrong character.  The Department are twenty-four years telling the people how to breed pigs.  That is it.

      <P>It is £500 less this year than last year, and the whole amount is only half the amount which is spent in Northern Ireland for six counties.  I was told that these itinerant instructors were very valuable. I would refer the Dáil to the fact that this country is stocked with schoolmasters, and that we are the worst educated people in the world, and that the itinerant instructors are there, and that they are doing nothing. Schoolmasters do not give you education. Neither do these itinerant instructors. The Minister said that £700,000 is spent on the Land Commission. Now every penny advanced to the farmer by the use of State credit is paid back again.  £700,000 for what?  To restore the ownership of the land to the people who should have it.  Now you are in competition with people in Canada, who have virgin soil and no indebtedness.  That is the point that he has neglected.  He has no right to put that £700,000 on our shoulders. We pay our advances.  The transfer has taken place from people who stole the land, and it is going back to the owners again.  I contend that that money is not spent for advancing agriculture, and that the only money spent is this £240,000, and that is mis-spent.</P>
