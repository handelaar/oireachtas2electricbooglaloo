      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what is the contract price for the repair of the old R.I.C.  Barracks, Newcastle West; whether there are any tenders other than that accepted, and, if so, what was the amount in each case; also, if he will state what was the contract price agreed on before the authority of the Board of Works to give away a contract without asking for competitive tenders was challenged, and whether subsequently a change was made in the specification.</P>

      <P>The contract price for the repairs of the police barrack at Newcastle West is £188 15s. 0d.  One other tender was received, amounting to £195 1s. 2d.  The amount of the tender obtained without competition was £223 6s. 0d., this tender being obtained without competition, was obtained without a specification, but in the specification drawn up for the competitive tenders the same works were included as in the non-competitive tender.  The amount of the first tender £223 6s. 0d., was much in excess of the amount which it is usual to contract for without competition, but it was sanctioned by the Board of Works because it was thought that there was great urgency to get the work done, and this was the quickest way.  On representations <Col N="1240" /> made by the Deputy further enquiries were made, and it was ascertained that the urgency was not so great as had been supposed.  Competitive tenders were then called for.  The Deputy has, therefore, been instrumental in saving the State some money (£35 less £9 for two months rent).</P>

      <P>Enquiry has been made at the Office of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, and it has been ascertained that a claim in respect of the damage to property referred to has been lodged on behalf of the person named by the Deputy. The claim will, it is believed, be the subject of investigation by a War Compensation Court or similar body at a later date.  The application of Miss Parr on behalf of her brother, James Parr, for compensation in respect of injury to his health, has been fully and carefuly investigated by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who have recommended that no compensation should be paid.  I have no confirmation of the Deputy's statement that James Parr has since died.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was firstly in the interests of economy, and secondly, in the interests of making better provision for those who had to wait that arrangements were made to transfer this work to the local post offices.  The Cavan Post Office seems to be not a good case for experiment of the sort, because the accommodation is not very great.  There may be discomfort, and there may be also delay, owing to claimants applying at the counter, in the ordinary way, on pay day, when their claims did not receive special consideration.  The whole question of transfer of Unemployment Exchanges to Post Offices, and the particular question of Cavan is being considered, and if the Deputy will assist me by giving specific instances of discomfort or delay.  I will be very much obliged to him.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that John Clarke, of 63 Emmet Road, Inchicore, applied for an old age pension on 28th January, 1924; that his claim was rejected on the grounds of insufficient evidence of age; that he was born on the 2nd March, 1849, in Stradbally, Leix; that records of birth are only available as from 1864 in the Unions of Athy and Mountmellick, and whether he will favourably consider the granting of the old age pension to Mr. Clarke <Col N="1249" /> and accept the evidence of age of that of his sister, Eleanor, who was six years younger, and who has obtained her baptismal certificate, dated for 21st October, 1855, and whether he is aware that the Great Southern and Western Railway's record, where Clarke was last employed, show that he attained the age of 70 on the 2nd March, 1919.</P>

      <P>The claim in this case was disallowed on the 11th ultimo by the local Pensions Committee.  An appeal was then lodged by the claimant. The evidence of age put forward has since been examined and considered satisfactory, and it has now been decided to allow the full pension as from date of receipt of the claim.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Margaret Driscoll, Butlersgift, Drimo-league, who has been in receipt of a blind pension for over three years, has now been deprived of same; whether he is aware that this woman has been practically blind for thirty-five years; and totally blind for four or five years; that she is now destitute, and whether her case will be re-opened with a view to restoring her pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. As regards the second part, the Medical Inspector made a detailed examination of the claimant's eyesight on the 11th ultimo.  His report showed that she has useful vision in one eye and that suitable glasses should further improve it.  Her standard of sight debars her from the blind pension, and it is regretted that in the circumstances the pension cannot be restored or the decision reconsidered.</P>
      <P>It appeared from the official papers in 1921 that Miss Driscoll was then supported by a brother, but I have no information at present on this point.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the case could be met by application to the local home assistance officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before proceeding with the Order Paper, may we obtain some information from the President <Col N="1252" /> as to his intentions regarding this list of proposed legislation.  The List contains 39 Bills, six or seven of which are already partly through the Dáil.  As it seems to be dependent upon the chances of adjourning early in July, I think the Dáil generally would like to know whether the President proposes that these Bills should be discussed or read or whether they should simply be passed through because they are introduced. It appears from the titles, at any rate, that many of them are of a very important character, and if it is expected that the Deputies should read them, let alone consider them, frame amendments to them and discuss them, it is obviously impossible for more than one-fifth of them to be passed.  And would it not be desirable to refrain from presenting them or pretending at least to get more than a first reading, so that we shall know exactly what we have to do between now and the middle of July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed to say, whether Deputy Johnson asked the question or not, having regard to the extent of this legislative programme and the length of time that the Railway Bill is taking, that with very great regret I will have to ask the Dáil to sit late every night next week.  With regard to the importance of these Bills, I do understand from the various Ministers who introduced them, that they are very important measures.  I am not in a position to enter into the relative merits of their importance, but I am given to understand that a number of them are of a non-contentious character. I think, when read a first time, it will be seen that they do not lend themselves to very great discussion, nor will they occupy, I think, much time.  Take the Companies (Reconstitution of Records) Bill.  Everybody will realise the necessity for a measure of that sort.  I think they will also realise it is not a measure which will demand a very great amount of time on the part of Deputies to read, discuss, or consider. It is possible that two or three of those Bills will be introduced in the Seanad.  It is also possible that we may not be able to get through the final stages of some of the other measures. The Road Fund (Advances) Bill, although <Col N="1253" /> it occupies the same space as the Railways Bill in the programme, will be a Bill that, I think, will pass through automatically.  I am not in a position to say what length of time or what amount of consideration will be necessary in the case of each individual Bill.  We can only see that as they pass through.  But as regards the entire programme, I do say from the representations that have been made to me by the various Ministers that it is most desirable that these Bills should get through. I do not think it is altogether wise to mention particular Bills, but in the absence of the Minister for Agriculture I should say in his opinion his Bills are the most important.  As the Minister for Finance is here, I should say that his view is that his Bills&mdash;the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill&mdash;are of prime importance.  I am not yet in a position to say whether after sitting late every night next week it might not lie also necessary to make a further inroad upon the physique of Deputies on the following week.  Taking the programme as it stands, I should say that it is most desirable that we should get through almost every Bill that is on the programme before the adjournment. I think that I was interpreting the wishes of the Dáil when we put it down that the adjournment should take place on the 4th July.  Even if the adjournment took place on that date it would be necessary for us to reassemble within the following fortnight to consider any amendments or recommendations that might come from the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not think that.  Bills like the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, the Dairy Produce Bill, the Marketing and Grading of Eggs Bill, the Improvement of Dairy and Stock Breeding Bill, the Retail Prices Bill (which is now, I notice, not likely to be introduced), the Local Government Bill, the Finance Bill, the Trade Facilities Bill, the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Bill, in addition to the Estimates, are likely to be very far advanced even by the middle of July.  In such circumstances would it not be more conducive to the proper conduct of business to decide upon which are absolutely essential and to confine attention to these?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President tell us when we are to find time to read all these Bills if we are to sit late next week?  Does he realise that in three days next week he is going to introduce thirteen Bills&mdash;a most unlucky number&mdash;and that among them are Bills like the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Bill.  That is a very technical Bill on which we should wish to consult people with technical qualifications. It is an immensely important Bill, because there are people in the Saorstát who cannot recover money that is due to them in England.  Then there is the Trade Facilities Bill.  That is a Bill which we should wish to compare with similar legislation elsewhere, if we could get the time.  The Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Bill is, I think, a patent and copyright Bill.  That, again, is a technical and a highly important measure, on the nature on which many of our constituents have views.  How are we to get time to consider those views and draft amendments?  The Defence Forces Bill, if it is a serious Bill, would itself take a month.  The Intoxicating Liquor Bill and the Public Meetings Bill are also to be introduced in three days next week.  We have got to try and sit down and read them, draft amendments, and consult people about them.  It really is preposterous when I think of the weeks we wasted in the autumn&mdash;because the Government were not ready with their programme&mdash;when we used to adjourn on a Friday until the Wednesday week following&mdash;happy days now gone for ever!  I think it is unfair for the Government to ask us to rush through legislation in this way.  It is reducing the Dáil to a farce.  I have not even referred to the Finance Bill or the Appropriation Bill, which must be got through, and the Estimates, which ought to be considered without the Closure.  If the President is seriously intending to get through this programme there is only one thing to be done, that is, to ask the Dáil to meet on Mondays and sit every day from 10 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night.  That is the only way we have got the faintest hope of discussing these Bills.  If the President wishes to get through the whole of his business he had better drop the Railway Bill as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking down this list, it is difficult to determine which Bills are likely to confer the greatest amount of advantage upon the people.  There is one Bill that the President promised before the Easter adjournment to introduce. I take it that the Retail Prices Bill is, one to control prices and deal with the profiteering that is so rampant. In view of the President's promise this Bill will be looked upon by the people, irrespective of what Ministers may think, as being a Bill which, if properly drafted, will deal with a very urgent question affecting every individual.  Perhaps if Deputy O'Mara were here he might give his opinion upon the likely good effects of a Bill of this kind.  People like Deputy O'Mara or Deputy Egan, who are in the confidence of the Government, would know something about the rough outline of this Bill.  At any rate, I suggest that, instead of being 38th on the list and included amongst the Bills that are not likely to be introduced, it should be No. 1 on the list, so as to carry out the promise given by the President. As a matter of fact, Deputy O'Mara won his election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the President is going to consider all the Bills which Deputies want introduced he may, I think, add a few more to the list.  I must congratulate the President on his machinery.  It seems to me that it must be an incubator that has turned out all those Bills.  Perhaps it would be better <Col N="1256" /> if they were kept in the incubator until they became Acts, because if the Bills contained in this list are to be passed before the adjournment they certainly cannot be adequately discussed and will not get the attention they deserve.  As a matter of fact, the Estimates, if properly discussed and given the attention they deserve, would occupy almost all the time up to the adjournment. I suggest that the President should make a careful selection from these Bills, and only bring forward the most urgent of them.</P>

      <P>I think the President ought to appoint a Committee, on which every interest in the Dáil will be represented, to select the Bills, so that the Bills which any particular party want will not be thrown out.  I think it is impossible to deal with this list of Bills and also with the Estimates in the time allotted.  We would be sitting not alone every day, Sunday included, but day and night.  You would want relays of Deputies to get through the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one Bill <Col N="1257" /> on the list which takes up as much space as the Railway Bill and which will practically be only a one-clause Bill&mdash;the Damage to Property (Compensation Amendment) Bill.  Although the list of Bills looks very formidable, I think it will be found in practice that quite a number of them will not put much strain upon Deputies.  That Bill simply gives the Minister for Finance certain authority in respect of report cases which he has already in other cases, that of issuing bonds in respect of furniture.  Deputies will remember that there was to be £500 in cash for the first £500 granted, and then 50 per cent. of any subsequent amount, up to £2,000 in cash altogether. That is a very simple measure. In this matter the Government are in the hands of the Dáil.  We can only hope that due consideration will be given to measures of first class importance. I am afraid that I will have to disagree with Deputy Cooper and Deputy Gorey so far as the Estimates are concerned.  I think Deputies will have to be satisfied with a shorter discussion of the Estimates if we are to get away on the 4th or the 18th July.  Practically every Department which has anything to do with the Dáil really requires an adjournment for a couple of months in the summer, and while we may get through the programme if we sit later, the result will not be very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There must be a little give and take in this matter with such a large programme. Deputy Cooper has mentioned the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Bill.  We have been promising for something, like two years to bring in that Bill.  If the Deputies look up the legislation enacted since we first sat here I think it can scarcely be denied that it was a very considerable programme.  It was necessary.  The importance and necessity of it will be admitted.  If Deputies were in our position they would appreciate it.  I do not think it is possible to sit from 10 in the morning until 10 at night.  There is a good deal of administrative work to be done in the various Departments. and Deputies will notice that, during the discussions on very important Bills, Ministers have not been able to attend here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has not realised that we have not time to find out what Bills are important, and what Bills are not.  We have not time to read or go into them.  Some of these Bills have been under discussion by the Executive Council and the Government Departments for six months.  I know that the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Bill has been in draft for more than six months.  The Executive Council take six months to consider it and then put it up to us and expect us to pass it in less than six weeks.  That is really not treating the Dáil fairly.  Would the President consider the question of carrying over the Estimates until the autumn?  I know it is not usual, but I think it is the only way we can have a satisfactory discussion on them.  That is one of the primary duties we are sent here for.  If it is not possible to discuss them adequately now, why not carry some of them over to the autumn so that they can be properly discussed?</P>

      <P>That raises a question as to what are really the important measures.  I realise the importance of that particular measure as much as another, but I cannot see that it is possible to get agreement on the matters concerned in that Bill in time.  As to the statement that a Bill has been before the Executive Council for six months, that is an exaggeration, as I suppose in the whole of that time the Bill was not before it for two hours. The Executive Council has a pretty considerable programme.</P>

There are going to be, not only 13 but 16 Bills introduced because the Pilotage Orders and Trades Facilities Bills were not introduced yet, although both are on the list for this week.  The Dáil will not be able I think to judge adequately which is important and which is not until these have at least been introduced and circulated. At the moment the Dáil has simply to accept the statement of the President. If the Bills were ready and could be introduced and circulated to Deputies in one day, Deputies would then know if they were important or not or whether particular Bills would take a particularly long time.  If they cannot be introduced and circulated the Dáil cannot make up its mind and neither can a Committee.  There is no use discussing the matter here or in Committee until the Bills are actually in the hands of the Deputies.  If the Bills are ready something could be done.

We have the Local Government Bill, which is a very contentious measure that requires, and is worthy of, considerable attention.  If it is to get the attention that it is worthy of, it cannot be rushed through. We cannot sit down and study every new measure day by day and at the same time find time to consider amendments that should be put up to a Bill like the Local Government Bill.  There are agricultural measures promised for the last twelve months, and they are at the bottom of the list.  I consider that the Executive Council will have to consider the whole list again.</P>

    <P>To insert after sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think this amendment was very fully discussed when we adjourned yesterday.  We had come to the point, I think, that having failed to extract agreement from the Minister we were about to take a division.  Perhaps he would deal leniently with the amendment now and agree to accept it.</P>
      <P>I do not in any way hold out the threat of a division, but at the same time I think our friends on the Labour Benches have indicated that a division is necessary if we cannot come to an agreement.  I suggest that if the Minister agreed, the progress of the Bill would be greatly facilitated.</P>

      <P>I suggest that some of the objections to the amendment would be removed if the last three words were deleted.  That would mean that the decision as to whether a particular route was a natural route would be finally decided by the Tribunal.  It is suggested that the definition might cause more trouble than it would be worth, and that it is better to leave that definition to the Tribunal.  Inasmuch as the Minister has agreed to the previous amendment, minus these three words, he might also agree to this amendment minus the same three words.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that this definition is a rather clumsy one.  In dealing with this we have to refer to the further amendment 44, in which the natural route is defined as: &ldquo;the shortest route, unless there is a more expeditious route, when the natural route shall mean the most expeditious route.&rdquo;  If that is the case, what is the objection to changing that definition, and saying that the natural route is the most expeditious?  In any case, whether the route be the shortest or longest, it must be the most expeditious in order to be the natural route. It strikes me the definition is a clumsy one, and for that reason I think it might lead to all kinds of complications. The first two lines are unnecessary.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3) to insert in line 33, after the word &ldquo;commissions&rdquo; the words &ldquo;services preferential treatment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, the basis of this amendment is to secure in the same way as no rebates or commissions or other allowance shall be given, that there shall also be no special services or preferential treatment, which are things designed to divert traffic from its natural course.  I do not think the words will be in any way objectionable to the sense of the amendment, which adds a little more protection and which is, I submit, a reasonable one.</P>

      <P>The Minister will remember that I had an amendment to that particular clause 2, in which I suggested the insertion of the words &ldquo;or by unfair diversion of traffic,&rdquo; but that was not accepted.  In the same way I presume the Minister hardens his heart against the alteration in this section, but the fact that he does so does not make the alteration unreasonable. I think it is an improvement. I think the Minister has asked me what is the additional protection that I propose by this amendment.  He expected to hear from me what additional protection I expected to secure.  I think it is obvious from the amendment what I am attempting to secure.  I do not think the Minister ought to turn down the amendment.</P>

      <P>If, as the Minister has assumed, as he assumed before, there is no anxiety in the minds of the people who will control the amalgamated company to give more reasonable facilities by one route than by another, then I do not see why he should object to the insertion of words of this kind which give direction according to law that they cannot or will not be allowed to do these things.  If, on the other hand he declines to insert words of this kind or some other words which may more clearly explain the meaning to the average reader of the faultily-worded clause, I cannot see where the objection comes in.  If they do not provide the facilities then it will be for some public body or body of traders at considerable expense to come before the Tribunal and plead their case.  My idea in supporting this amendment is to save expense to the trading community or public bodies who may have to bring cases before this Tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question on the first paragraph, and I am quite seriously anxious to know from the Minister what is the reason that he deems it necessary that statutory agreements would be protected by this Bill.  An Irish company made an agreement with a company not now under the control of the Irish Government. Is that agreement binding on the company, or is it not binding unless it is brought into this Bill?  Is it necessary before it is binding that it should be made so by an Act of the Oireachtas? If it is necessary before such an agreement can be made binding upon the Irish company, what is going to be the position of the other party to the agreement?  Both parties to the agreement entered such agreement because of certain reciprocal advantages, and those advantages carried with them corresponding responsibilities and submissions. Presumably by the very fact that this sub-section designs to make all such agreements binding by statute, it is the Minister's mind that they would not be binding without a statute. Then in such a case what is the position of the other party to the agreement?  If it is essential to make those agreements binding, that they should be embodied in this Bill and made statutory by the Oireachtas, inasmuch as the Oireachtas has not authority over the other party to the agreement, it follows that the other party to the agreement need not be bound by the agreement.  We cannot make it obligatory on them by statute.  The Minister may turn to the British Act of which this is somewhat complementary, but that Act does not cover Irish railway companies.  When it deals with agreements it quite obviously deals with agreements that are <Col N="1267" /> brought within the scope of that British Railways Act.  As far as I can understand that, without being a lawyer or having any lawyer's assistance, it seems to me that what we are trying to do in this sub-section is to make it obligatory upon the new Irish amalgamated company to burden itself with obligations which were entered into with one of the constituent companies and were part of an agreement presumably giving reciprocal duties and advantages between two companies, only one of which is subject to the authority of the Oireachtas.  As it seems to me, the position we are leading ourselves into is that we are imposing an obligation upon the new company to carry out the terms of an agreement made by one of the constituent elements of that new company, but without ensuring to the new company any of the reciprocal advantages which, it is presumed, the old company obtained.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to make that position clear.  I may be quite wrong.  He may be able to persuade the House that if we passed this Bill in those terms, if we impose upon the new company certain obligations with regard to the carrying out of old agreements, that that necessarily compels the British company to continue to carry out those agreements.  I have however, been under the impression up to now that the new constitutional position of Ireland in relation to England, and England in relation to Ireland, meant that the British Parliament had no authority over the Irish railways, and that the Irish Parliament had no authority over the British railways; that agreements entered into years ago by railway companies, which on both sides of the Channel have entered into new combinations, will have to be remade to be re-binding upon the new combination, and that if we impose an obligation upon the new company we are simply imposing an obligation upon the company without any reciprocal advantages, and the other party to the agreement may at any time disclaim those agreements and have no responsibility thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has put to me certain very definite <Col N="1268" /> constitutional points, but he proceeds on a false assumption.  We are not binding the amalgamated undertaking over its whole extent with regard to these statutory agreements.  Sub-section (1) shows that.  That narrows the issue.  That brings it definitely that we are seeking to bind that portion of the amalgamated undertaking which was previously bound by enactments which were considered to be very much to the advantage of Saorstát Eireann and which, if cancelled, would re-act definitely against Saorstát Eireann. The phrase has been used with regard to burthening the undertaking.  So far from doing that we are seeking, and we believe we are securing, for the undertaking certain very definite advantages on foot of these agreements and no disadvantages whatever.  It is being put that the other party to the contract may say inasmuch as there is a new body this obligation lapses. If they do so, then a new situation arises and it will have to be taken cognizance of and further action can be taken.  At the moment we are anxious to preserve for Saorstát Eireann those particular agreements and to show our willingness and our enthusiasm, almost, for those agreements, we are taking the first step.  But we do not preclude ourselves from later action.  We are limiting the situation to the area, traffic and lines to which it previously applied, and in our anxiety not to deprive the agricultural community of an alternative route we are proposing to take over this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first of all to assure one or two Deputies, who apparently insinuate that our criticism and attitude to this clause is in the nature of obstruction, that is definitely not the case.  If Deputies belonging to other parties have no reasonable contribution to make on this vital clause that is due to their own failure to appreciate the seriousness of it or to realise the importance of attempting to improve it.  The Minister says that he is very anxious to preserve existing agreements. The agreement to which such an amount of exception has been taken from these Benches, was entered into and embodied in the British Act passed in the House of Commons when they were in control of the railways in Ireland <Col N="1269" /> and those in England that are parties to the agreement.  They cease to have any control over this country and over the railway which is going to become part of the amalgamated company, but they are exercising that control under the Act of 1921 over the Great Western Railway of England, which is party to this particular agreement. You are in a position, perhaps, to a certain extent, to see that the amalgamated undertaking carry out, as far as they can carry out, their portion of the agreement made in the British House of Commons in 1899.  Let us assume, and it would not be wrong to assume, that the Great Western Company cancelled their portion of the agreement with the Great Southern and Western Co., and as a result they declined to have any further negotiations with the Great Southern Company on the question of through rates.  The people who have unconsigned traffic to the amalgamated company will not get the benefit of through rates, because the Great Western have declined to put through rates in operation or carry out any portion of their bargain with the Great Southern Company.  The traders who would have ordinarily the benefit of through rates will have the pleasure of handing over their traffic unconsigned to the Great Southern Co., and will have the pleasure of knowing that it will be booked at local rates and at a greater cost than if the agreement were carried out by the Great Southern under the new circumstances.  That is not a reasonable state of affairs to expect, provided the Great Western have the right, and the Minister has no right, to stop that or cancel part of the agreement embodied in the British Act of 1899.  These are circumstances which the Minister should consider.  These are things which are likely to happen, and, if they do, where is the protection to traders under such circumstances in any sub-section of Clause 29?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of discussion has taken place upon the amendments that have been moved to this section.  I hope the discussions will not be lost upon the Minister, and that between now and the Report Stage he will consider everything that has been said in regard to suggestions for improving this section, <Col N="1270" /> so far as they would be likely to be a benefit to the trading community.  As regards the suggestions and amendments that have been put forward by us I must say that some of them have been received in a very reasonable spirit by the Minister.  We can say this of the Minister, that he has treated the discussion on them in a very gentlemanly way.  He has not shown any anxiety to score at the expense of some personal remark.  Contrasting his attitude with that of other Ministers when dealing with other Bills, I can pay that tribute to the Minister who is in charge of this measure.  His patience has perhaps been a little exhausted in dealing with this measure, but yet we have not succeeded in carrying him beyond the stage that he wished to go.  He recognised that it was his duty to deal first of all with the arguments put up against the measure and not so much with the individuals who put up these arguments.  The Minister did not attempt to score off Deputies at the expense of some personal remarks.  That is a new feature that has entered into these discussions which has not been quite the practice here when dealing with the Committee Stage by other Ministers.  It is a very welcome change, and I think it is due to the Minister to say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee, I am sure, will recognise the new order of things.  We have now entered on a position that I have been advocating for some time: a coalition between the Labour Party and the Cabinet; and I have much pleasure in supporting my colleagues on the Labour benches. Deputy Johnson has asked what is the need for the insertion, in connection with this section, of protection for the Great Western Railway.  I hope the Committee will not consider from any of the amendments I have put down, or from anything I have said, that there was any hostility on my part either to the Great Western Railway or to any other railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that there are a great many amendments on Section 29, all tending in the one direction, and that there has been no corresponding amendments on the other side.  The absence of amendments on the other <Col N="1271" /> side has been criticised.  The amendments are only put there with the object of improving the Bill in the light of the advocacy of certain principles. The absence of amendments from the other side has been used to make the claim that there is no reason for amendments, but the section as it stands, is so entirely in favour of the other side that there is no need for amendments at all.  These companies are all proposed to be amalgamated under this Bill to form one company.  The object of the amalgamation is, as far as I am concerned, of doubtful utility, and is a decided risk to the business community as a whole.  In the ordinary business the amalgamation of three or four companies is generally done by uniting their operations together.  If there is an obligation on one of the contracting parties there is no need to burden the Bill with a recognition of that obligation, because it stands on its own.  The Minister, in connection with a good many of the amendments standing in my name, resisted the addition of words, very few in number generally, on the ground that he did not wish to extend the burden of the Bill with unnecessary words.  However, I can now retort that he is burdening this section with an unnecessary provision altogether.  There is no need for saying that agreements that are already there have got to be recognised in this Bill.  I would say that these are unnecessary words as far as the principle of the Bill is concerned. The principle of the Bill is to amalgamate a number of companies, and, of course, it will be for the Amalgamated Company in the ordinary way to take cognisance of everything that is already there.  It is unnecessary to put it into a Bill that there is any such legal obligation at all.  I support what Deputy Johnson has said in opposition to this section, and I hold that that part of the provision is quite unnecessary, and has led to all this argument in connection with the different ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Davin, who thinks that Deputies on these benches have contributed nothing to the debate on this measure, and that because they did not do so he assumed <Col N="1272" /> they were neglecting their public duty, I want to assure him that we are interested in the course of the Bill, particularly from the point of view of that section of the people who send great quantities of produce out of this country, but we are not interested in this section from the point of view of people who prefer one particular port to another.  The agreement that has been referred to, and that has been under discussion since yesterday, gives us an alternative to the port of Dublin, an alternative that perhaps we would not have had as an outlet but for the existence of the agreement that has been so much discussed.  The Minister stated yesterday that if there was any inclination on the part of the people here to go back on that agreement there might probably be a disposition on the part of people on the other side to go back on the agreement also.  If the agreement were not in existence it is questionable whether it would be sufficient that the traffic passing through the port of Rosslare would pay for the keeping open of that port.  I did not hear any of the Deputies on the benches near me contradict that statement of the Minister.  If that is really the case, and if the keeping open of that port is consequential on the existence of that agreement, it is absolutely essential for the farmers of the country at least that the port at Rosslare should be kept open.  It is not very long since we realised how much it meant to the farmers of Ireland that the port at Rosslare was kept open.  We do not want to see any change brought about in the section of the Bill that would leave us in the hands of those too much interested in the port of Dublin or of those engaged working at the port of Dublin.  We want alternative ports, and the more we have the better it will be for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to disabuse the minds of Deputies who may have been led to think that I for one had any notion at all of speaking on behalf of any specific port or against any other port.  I am just as much interested in the port at Rosslare, if it is going to serve the public interest, as I am in the port of Dublin.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister and of the <Col N="1273" /> Dáil to the fact that this sub-section does not deal with any agreement between the Great Southern Railway and the Great Western of England.  It does not deal with the Port of Rosslare, but if you want to bind the company to that particular agreement then set it out and put it in the Schedule. Refer to it specifically in the section, for that is not what you do here.  The section says: &ldquo;All the terms, conditions and provisions of any agreement or statutory enactment,&rdquo; and so on. Now, we are supposed to go through the British statutes and find out whether there have been any British statutes dealing with the Midland and Great Western Railway, the Dublin and South Eastern, or any other company, and if we cannot find any statutes or any agreement under statute as regards any of these companies which are to become amalgamated, and which we disagree with, then we are supposed to have nothing to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are supposed in passing this Bill to have cognisance of any agrement that may have been entered into and called a statutory agreement.  We say we may be aware of it or not; we do not know whether it is of interest to the Irish people or not.  We say any such agreement has to be embodied in this enactment whether for the purpose of affecting the forwarding of the traffic or for any other purpose.  I say this is asking us to sign a blank cheque or else to look through all the accounts to see whether in some undiscovered bank balance they had still something to draw upon.  We do not know what these agreements are.  If the Minister wants to appoint a new company with provisions or agreements not specified in the enactment let him state it specifically and refer to it in the Schedule; then we shall know where we are, but do not let him ask us to agree to carrying over any statutory agreements with any of the companies no matter what they may be without knowing what their provisions are and without knowing what they impose upon the new company.  It is the general question I am raising, not a question as affecting any specific company or agreement. In this we are practically asked to approve and impose upon the new company, <Col N="1274" /> obligations to maintain any and every agreement of a statutory kind that any of these companies bound themselves to in the past.  Discussion has centred round very largely an agreement drawn to our attention. There may be others that the Minister may know of but we do not.  If he has in mind that particular agreement let him state so, and let him note it in the Schedule, but in the present form I say we are asked to carry over an agreement and to insist that certain agreements or any agreement of a statutory kind, which may have been entered into with any of the companies in the past shall be maintained by enactment in the Saorstát without being able to insist that the other party to the agreement shall conform to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to secure the assistance of the Committee to get this section through before the end of the sitting to-day, and I do not propose to be very long on this point.  Deputy Davin has raised a few points; he outlined a state of affairs in which the Great Western of England would break through their agreement, and he held that we would be bound to carry on.  He said that this was not an unreasonable state of affairs to expect. It is very unreasonable, and it is not going to be rendered any more reasonable by our action in passing this section and showing our bona fides and goodwill in this matter.  He spoke also of through rates.  I think we had general agreement yesterday that through rates are a matter of voluntary agreement.  If we take the first step, are we not taking a great step to secure the goodwill of the Great Western, so that they will carry out whatever lies in them to do in the matter of through rates? There again the danger is a figment of Deputy Davin's imagination&mdash;that the Great Western may break their part of the bargain, and that we are bound to carry on.  We are not bound in any such way.  Let him read the clause: &ldquo;All the terms, conditions and provisions of any agreement or statutory enactment,&rdquo; and so on.  Now, if the terms of the enactment are broken by the other party to it, the amalgamated company is not bound.  It is for the <Col N="1275" /> amalgamated company to see that the other party does keep to the terms.</P>

      <P>No, we have no authority in this Bill to bind any English company to do anything, but we say we would like to secure their goodwill towards this voluntary bargain. We take a first step here.  We have ourselves protected, and if they break any of the terms or conditions then we are absolved from abiding by them. Deputy Hewat raised objection to this section, because he says the object of the Bill was only to amalgamate and all this could be left out.  The object of the Bill is not merely to amalgamate, but it is for the purpose of better organisation and more efficient and economical working of the undertaking and bound up with that and part and parcel of it, as Deputy Davin would acknowledge, is the question of through rates.  And through rates mean the question of ports, and when you bring in ports the main thing is not to give undue preference to one port over another, and the Act of 1899 does not give any undue preference, and therefore we take that over.  Deputy Johnson raised a point of greater substance, that this not only confirms the 1899 Act and others, but that it is in effect signing a blank cheque.  The discussion turned to the 1899 Act, with its attachment, the 1905 Act, and that <Col N="1276" /> was brought before the House as the worst one from the point of view of the promoters of this Bill, and the best one from the point of view of those who objected to the Bill.  We may be sure that all the advisers of the various parties proposing amendments to this Bill had these arguments scanned, and if they had them scanned their views coincide with my own that the Rosslare agreement was the best the objectors to the Bill could have taken.</P>

      <P>It was an easy matter to discover.  It would not be easy with Clause 29 as framed, but now it is possible to discover all of them; and they have been examined, and Rosslare is the worst from the point of view of my opponents, and we have discussed that in detail.  It is not a question of signing a blank cheque.  The other main point dealt with statutory enactments, which are really protection clauses for different ports of the Saorstát.  The main point that was raised in the debate on this section, was the fear that we might be entering into what was, in effect, a unilateral compact, and were binding ourselves without having any hold upon other people; that we were putting it beyond the possibility of our taking contrarient action if the other people did not carry out their part of the bargain.  We cannot compel, but we have our ordinary remedy.  If they do not carry out the terms of this bargain, we do not carry them out on our side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to ask the Dáil to grant a Second Reading to what is known as the Town Tenants Bill.  It is with a considerable amount of diffidence that I, as a private member, venture to bring a Private Member's Bill before this House.  I have seen in other places private members endeavouring to effect public reforms by means of Private Members Bills, and we here have had the experience already of seeing a similar procedure in regard to a Bill that was introduced last Session.  But we have seen also the fate that was bestowed upon it. But, at the same time, that does not prevent me, as a private member, from doing what I consider to be my duty as a public representative.  The Bill, which I venture to ask the Dáil to give a Second Reading to, is a measure which undoubtedly affects the daily life and welfare of a great bulk of the people in this country.  At the very outset, I would desire, if it is in my power, to disabuse the minds and, perhaps, dissipate the fears of both Deputies and the general public as to the objects and also the contents of this Bill.  It is a Bill, as it is entitled, to improve the position of certain tenants of certain houses, shops and other buildings in Saorstát Eireann.  If I may be permitted to say so, I think that is a very candid explanation of the objects of the Bill.  But it is not, as in certain quarters it would seem to be presumed, a compulsory-purchase Bill.  Neither is it a State-purchase Bill.  In fact, there is only one compulsory feature about this Bill: that is, that so long as the tenant pays his rent and behaves himself in a proper manner as a citizen of Saorstát Eireann he shall not be disturbed from his tenancy. The Bill does not go so far as to tear up existing contracts or interfere with existing leases.  It is expressly provided that not until the expiration of all existing leases will this Bill affect the leaseholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it in no way provides <Col N="1279" /> that anyone who in the past or in the future&mdash;certainly not in the past&mdash;has refused to perform his part of a contract of tenancy by paying his rent, whether from political or from merely private motives, shall in any way be indemnified by this Bill.  In other words, there is no Compounded Arrears Section in this measure.  What I do desire to plead for the Bill is that it will give the tenants that sense of security which is sadly lacking at the moment, and which must make for peace and prosperity in the country. The present conditions in the towns and urban areas in Ireland are known to all of us, and call for legislative action.  As in the past, with country landlords, so to-day with town ones. The cruel and the rapacious, the grabbing and the profiteering landlord of the town is, I am glad to say, in a minority.  But the fact remains that he is there.  I would like to add that the class I have mentioned do not by any means belong to what used to be styled the landlord class in Ireland. It is protection against that sort of man that I am seeking for the Irish town-dweller in introducing this Bill.  Everyone knows the powers of the town landlord of to-day&mdash;notwithstanding the various Acts that are in force&mdash;and how those powers can be and have been abused.  There are innumerable cases occurring daily of strictly legal, though thoroughly inequitable blackmail on the part of certain landlords. I only discovered quite recently that the ground landlords in many districts were of the class that I have described. The question I want answered, if an answer is put forward to my plea, is this: Why should this state of affairs be allowed to continue in the Saorstát? We know what is called the short lease system.  We ought to know it at any rate in Dublin and its suburbs.  We know that it is a by-word in profiteering. This Bill, therefore, is not proposed in any way to deal with landlords who up to this have not abused their powers.  It will not inflict hardships on reasonable landlords, but it will afford protection against unreasonable ones.  Therefore, I would describe this Bill in one sentence, as an anti-house profiteering Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> I do not like to have to weary the Dáil, but as I am afraid, judging from the comments that have appeared upon this Bill both in the Press and elsewhere, that very few people have read it, I think it might be well to explain, as briefly as possible, without going into very great detail, what is proposed in the measure.  Before doing that, I think it will be necessary for me to recall to the Deputies minds the position of affairs in regard to dwellers in Irish towns previous to the present date and at the present moment.  An Act was passed in the year 1860, known as Deasy's Act, which provided that in future all tenancies in Ireland were to be founded upon contract.  That Act applied to all tenancies.  It was found in a very short time that in regard to agricultural holdings landlords evaded that Act and that grave grievances grew up on the part of tenants.  The result was that another Act was passed in the year 1870 to deal with these conditions. That Act applied only to agricultural holdings and was the first of a series of what are commonly called the Irish Land Acts.  It was only after vigorous opposition and fierce agitation that that Act was passed.  What did that Act provide?  It provided that tenants should be given compensation for improvements and for disturbance, but, mark you, only in regard to agricultural holdings.</P>
    <P>I happened the other day to be looking up a well known treatise on this matter, and I discovered there a couple of phrases so trite and so expressive that I would like to repeat them here as indicating the conditions which obtained before the Act of 1870, and which the Act of 1870 was brought in and passed to remedy.  The first condition was: &ldquo;That enterprise was repressed and its fruits fell a windfall into others' laps.&rdquo;  Therefore, compensation was given for improvements. The second expression was: &ldquo;That a condition existed of capricious eviction or malevolent refusal to renew leases.&rdquo; That was provided for by compensation for disturbance.  That was all in regard to the land.  Nothing was done in regard to the dwellers in the town until the year 1906, when a Town Tenants Act was passed in the British Parliament, fiercely opposed at the time <Col N="1281" /> and after a considerable agitation in this country.  That Town Tenants Act of 1906 purported to do precisely for the town tenants what the Act of 1870 purported to do for the tenants on the land.  The position in regard to the agricultural tenants has not remained where it was in 1870.  On the contrary, several Land Acts and Purchase Acts have since been passed culminating in the Act of 1923, which the Dáil passed last year.  But nothing has been done since the corresponding Act of 1906 in regard to the tenants in the towns.</P>
    <P>What I propose to do in this Bill is to apply the Land Act of 1881 to the Town Tenants Act of 1906, and thus place the town tenants in, at least, as fair a position as the agricultural tenants were placed in by the Act of 1881. It really comes to this, that the same principles have been embodied in the legislation in regard to the two classes of tenants, but the agricultural tenants have precedence in time.  They were larger in numbers and their case perhaps was more pressing.  I bring out these facts to show that there is nothing novel in the principle of applying the Land Acts to towns.  The Act of 1906, corresponding to the Land Act of 1870, had many, and has many shortcomings, and they soon became apparent and were availed of by certain landlords.  There were exclusions from that Act.  In the first place, the Act itself only applied to tenancies for a year.  Immediately various landlords who had previously let from year to year, when the time came for renewal of tenancies, insisted that they must be for less than that period.  In that way they evaded the Act.  The various compensations that were given both for improvements and for disturbance, especially for disturbance, applied only to certain classes of business houses.  There was one thing that was not provided for in the Act of 1906 and that was fixity of tenure.  The Act of 1906 is not the last of the Acts applying to Irish towns.  In the year 1915, during the period of the great war, a Bill was introduced, and afterwards became an Act, in the Imperial Parliament which is since known as the Rent Restrictions Act.  That Act was originally passed as a British war measure. It was proposed as such, and was <Col N="1282" /> meant merely to provide for certain profiteering that it was feared would take place in large industrial centres in England, by the inrush of munition workers there during the war.  That Act provided to a certain extent for fixity of tenure.  At the time of its passage that Act was also applied to Ireland, where no such conditions existed. Though regarded originally as a war measure that Act has subsequently been renewed with certain slight modifications and is still in existence in England. It has been renewed here, and only last year the Dáil, during a time of peace, at any rate, not during a time of international war, proposed and passed, and there is now on our Statute Book the Rent Restrictions Act.  As it applies to-day in Ireland that Act provides for a sort of fixity of tenure for certain classes of tenants.</P>
    <P>It would probably be useless and unprofitable for me to go into the details of what the classes are to which that Act applies.  At any rate, it is distinctly limited in scope.  It is limited to the dwellinghouses it applies to, and also to the business houses.  Its application is limited both in regard to increasing the rent which is permitted in certain cases, and also in regard to improvements and repairs.  The great outstanding fact remains that that Act which we passed here last year does set up the principle of fixity of tenure.  Of course, it is perfectly true that when the tenant gets notice to quit he is no longer the absolute tenant.  He is what is known as a statutory tenant. It is that very position of statutory tenancy I want to avoid and do away with, and which I propose to abolish by this Bill.  The principles embodied in this Bill are plain and simple.  They are the principles of fixity of tenure, free sale, and fair rent.  I think I may claim that I have shown that these principles, even including fair rent, to a certain extent have been recognised in the existing legislation and law, not only that which was inherited and taken from the Imperial Parliament, but which we ourselves here have brought about by fresh enactments.  In effect, therefore, what this Bill proposes is, to apply to all holdings situate in the urban districts, towns or villages of Ireland the principles <Col N="1283" /> I have mentioned.  It is really an extension of the application of existing principles rather than an application of new ones.  I come now to the actual proposals in the Bill. The Bill is divided into three parts. The first part deals with fixity of tenure, free sale, and fair rent.  In Section 1 the tenant is given fixity of tenure, but that fixity of tenure is not absolute.  It is conditional on the tenant paying his rent at the appointed time, and upon observing the various other rules and regulations which every decent Irish citizen should observe.</P>
    <P>That is not a very far-fetched proposal in regard to the existing law.  It means, it is true, that under no circumstances, except those which appear later in the Bill, such as repairs done by the landlord, can there be an increase of rent.  Above all things, it means that the landlord cannot at his own caprice turn out a tenant, provided the tenant has paid his rent and behaved himself properly.  The second section deals with the right of a tenant to sell his interest, and the landlord to purchase it.</P>
    <P>Certain people will say tenants have not, and should not be allowed to have any interest.  I think the time has gone for arguing against such people.  The proposal I put forward in this section is in no way compulsory.  The landlord need never sell his interest if he does not choose to do so, nor need the tenant sell his interest.  The same thing applies to purchase on both sides, but I would like to make an explanation in regard to sub-section 4.  As this sub-section reads, I must candidly admit the conclusion one would draw from it would be bordering on the grotesque. It would seem from the text of the Bill that it was proposed where the landlord desired, and was empowered to purchase the tenant's interest, and where the tenant desired to sell, and they failed to come to an agreement as regards price, that then either party could go to the court, which is to be set up by this Bill, and that the price to be fixed by that court would be not less than 10, nor more than 15 years' purchase of the rent which is lawfully paid by the tenant. I must confess that such a proposal was never my intention, and if the Bill <Col N="1284" /> passes the Second Reading Stage, I certainly intend to propose an amendment to that sub-section, which shall determine that the price to be paid by the landlord to the tenant for the tenant's interest shall not be figures such as appeared in the sub-section, but shall be entirely at the discretion of the court and, as the remaining portion of the section says: &ldquo;The court, in fixing the price shall have regard to the state of the holding, the interest of both landlord and tenant in the premises, and all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo; If the court is to have regard to all the circumstances, no court in any country would dream of giving from 10 to 15 years' purchase of the rent of a tenant who had been in occupation for only, say, three months, or perhaps even three years.  Therefore, I want to make it perfectly clear that in the Bill that I hope may eventually emanate from the Dáil, as far as I am concerned, the clause as it stands will not appear.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that where the tenant desires to purchase, and the landlord desires to sell, then the price to be fixed, if they fail to come to an agreement, is to be within the figures I have mentioned.  That is a horse of a different colour, because undoubtedly the landlord has, and had, a previous and probably a greater interest in the holding than the tenant ever would have or ever had.  I am in no way tied down to these figures.  I had to place some figures for discussion, and if it is decided in Committee that these figures are not right, well, then it is for the Dáil to mend them, but as regards the principle therein expressed, I think that it is a fair and just one. As far as the figures are concerned, I arrived at the figure 15 because I took it from the Land Act which was passed last year.  One point I would like to stress is that purchase in any shape or form is entirely optional, and in no sense compulsory.  Section 4 deals with the fixing of fair rents, and these fair rents can be fixed according to the Bill in regard to all holdings with certain exceptions, and exceptions of very great importance.  The first exception is, as I have already mentioned, the existing lease-holders.  The second is where the landlord has let for merely <Col N="1285" />&ldquo;temporary convenience&rdquo;&mdash;which is a legal term pretty well defined; the third, where there was someone in possession, who is in the landlord's employment; the 4th in the matter of a caretaker's agreement; and the fifth applies to such Acts as the Labourers' Acts, etc.  So much, roughly speaking, for the actual proposals of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 2 deals with the machinery whereby the Bill is to be put into operation.  I have seen it stated that the cost of this Commission would be very large.  Well, of course, I am not in the position to set up this Commission. If the Government do not decide to adopt this Bill, or a similar one, I cannot, as a private member, be the means of raising any money out of public funds to provide for this Commission. A criticism has been passed as to the necessity for this Commission, and it has been asked why could not the existing judges have done it.  That occurred to me at the time, but I must confess, from my little knowledge, that I think the future judges under our judiciary will have their time pretty fully occupied, and I do not think myself that it would be feasible to expect them to be able to do this work.  At any rate, that whole question is entirely a matter of machinery detail for the Committee.  If it was decided to throw this burden of work on to the existing judges.  I certainly would have no objection, and, therefore, this whole Part 2 is merely a tentative suggestion on my part as to how the machinery of this Bill could be brought about.  I think it is well that we should keep clearly before our minds that this Bill proposes to apply to all holdings, and, therefore, does away with the extraordinary position we are in to-day of finding it very difficult to determine whether this Act or that Act does apply to this holding or that holding.</P>
    <P>It will simplify the administration of the law, and it will, in every respect, be more practicable and more suitable for the ordinary man in the street. Now, there have been many apprehensions in regard to the Bill, and some of them have been natural ones; some of them have been legitimate ones; but a good many of them, I fear, have been otherwise.  To one like myself proposing <Col N="1286" /> such a measure as this, I must confess I was not surprised at either the legitimate or illegitimate apprehensions. In the first place, in regard to what I term the unfair or illegitimate ones, I have seen it stated that this is a Bolshevist proposal.  I have been dubbed a Bolshevist.</P>

      <P>I do not know much Russian, but I am informed that the word Bolshevik means majority, and if that is so, at any rate I have the consolation of knowing this Bill will have the support of the majority of the people.  I would like to dwell a little further upon that point.  I wonder was the word Bolshevik in existence in the year 1881?  I do not think it was, because I am certain if it had been in existence at that date, and if I turned up the files of certain newspapers, I would find that certain people, with whom I was, or would have been, associated at that time, would have been termed Bolshevists, too, for daring to propose and introduce the Land Act of 1881.</P>

It is said, too, that this Bill means confiscation.  People are holding up their hands in holy horror and saying that this is a purely confiscatory measure, and that it will be the end of all things.  One young man said that to me the other day, and I asked him if he had read the Bill.  He said he had not, but that was a mere detail.  What are the arguments deduced to bring them to that conclusion?  It is said that this is a measure of confiscation.  I admit it is a measure of confiscation.  It is a Bill to bring about the confiscation of abuses, and that is the confiscation that I stand for.  Every reform is confiscatory. Every measure that was ever introduced confiscates something.  We are all supposed to come into this world equally free, but every step we take is bound by some condition or another. <Col N="1287" /> Every Bill that is introduced places its limitations upon somebody or upon something, and in that sense it is confiscatory. But if what is meant is that it is taking away the property of individuals without rhyme or reason, taking away their legitimate property and taking away the legitimate use of that property, I say the word is not confiscation, but that it is a reform that is badly needed.</P>
      <P>We are also told&mdash;I am told&mdash;that this is going to stop all building. Really I do not know that anything can be stopped if it is not going on, and I cannot see where building is going on. It certainly has not been going on up to the present.  I hope and trust the Housing Bill we recently passed will do something to make building progress, but I have not seen much signs of its progress up to the present.  The same thing was said about the Rent Restrictions Act in England.  It was stated that that Act was going to stop all building there.  The same thing was said about the Rent Restrictions Act here.  It may be that the Rent Restrictions Act has stopped all building here, but that is not in my Bill.  The Rent Restrictions Act is there, and blame that if you like, but do not blame this Bill.  The Rent Restrictions Act is a temporary measure.  Does anyone mean to tell me that it is going to remain temporary?  The Rent Restrictions Act is there; you passed it yourselves last session, and it will be there for all time&mdash;at least, in principle.</P>

      <P>Is it for philanthropy or for themselves?  They can still build houses for themselves under this Bill and live in those houses, and <Col N="1288" /> they will not be disturbed; but if they build houses in order to secure unfair profits out of them, then this Bill will stop that building and I am very pleased if it will.  We are told it will prevent speculation in house building. Who is there in his senses to-day, would put his money into bricks and mortar?  I am glad that my friends behind me support me in that contention. That is the state of affairs now, before this Bill is passed.  How is this Bill going to make it, if that is so? How is this Bill going to bring about a state of affairs which my friends behind me admit is already in existence? We have heard these arguments so often against every measure of reform that they are almost nauseating.  When Income Tax was first introduced.  I imagine the forefathers of our friends held up their hands in horror and said: &ldquo;This is going to stop all manufacture. Everything will come to an end.  The idea of a man's profits being taxed&mdash; the idea of a tax being put on the income he has earned by the sweat of his brow&mdash;is intolerable.  England will be ruined, and Ireland will be done for. There will be no more enterprise and no more energy will be put into anything.&rdquo; What is the result?  It is perfectly true there is a breaking point, but this Bill any more than Income Tax, does not reach the breaking point in regard to the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Sir, I am told also that the analogy in regard to land is not applicable. In fact, I saw one epistle written, I think, by a reverend gentleman who did not sign his name, in which he said God made the land. Therefore I suppose we are entitled to bring in Land Acts in regard to the land.  I wonder would the same gentleman agree with me when I say God made the people?  I suppose he would not.  I suppose he is not a very good logician either, because if the Deity made the people and the people made the houses I suppose we might conclude that the houses came from above. That is, however, only trifling with the matter.  All that talk about God making the land and that therefore you must not touch the houses is all balderdash. I wonder would he say that the Deity made the improvements on the land?  What right was there to give the <Col N="1289" /> tenant compensation for improvements on the land, and what right had the tenant to get houses under the various Land Acts?  If the Almighty made the land and that is to be the distinction between dealing with the land and dealing with houses, I say that most of these criticisms are merely thoughtless ones.  They are made by a people who have not considered for a moment the effect of what they are saying.  This Bill will not do these various things which these people are predicting.  It is perfectly natural that all the vested interests or those who have interest in house property should resent any interference in house property, but that does not say that we have got no right to touch houses or interfere in any way with the various forms or conditions of the tenancies of those houses.  I propose this, as I have said, as an anti-profiteering Bill.  What more right have we to legislate for any of the essentials of life than we have for houses, and surely there is no one here who will deny that a roof and a shelter are an essential of life.  Surely there is no one who will deny that we are as entitled to legislate for proper conditions of tenancies, whether they be houses or lands, as we are for proper prices and conditions of food.</P>
    <P>The Government have expressed their intention on several occasions to bring in a food anti-profiteering Bill.  I do not see why they could not, and I hope they will support a housing anti-profiteering Bill.  The position of a private Member is particularly difficult in a matter such as this, but I deemed it my duty, and I still deem it, to bring this Bill before this House in order, in the first place, to focus public attention on the just needs of existing town dwellers in Ireland, and in the second place to give the House an opportunity, including the Government, if they so desire, of discussing this matter fully, and perhaps adopting, if not the details, at least the principles embodied in this Bill.  I know perfectly well that it is impossible for a private Member to carry a public Bill of this nature through without the support of the Government and that being so I would ask the Government whether they would consider&mdash;if they <Col N="1290" /> would not take this Bill in its entirety; as I said before I am not bound to the details of this Bill; it is the principle I want&mdash;the possibility of giving an assurance to the public that at some time, let us hope at any rate within a reasonable time after due consideration, they will introduce a Bill, if not altogether, at least somewhat, on these lines.  That is if they do not propose to adopt the Bill as it stands.  I do not see why they could not do so, and the various arguments put forward against it are, I think, very shallow and very flimsy.  The Bill forces no new principles upon the conditions of tenancies in Irish towns to-day.  It merely brings up to date, simplifies, and to a certain extent enlarges the scope of the existing Act.  In that sense it is Bolshevik, because existing Acts may be Bolshevik.  But some Bill of this nature will have to come at some time in the history of this country because the way has already been prepared for it by legislation which is now in existence, and I trust that neither Deputies nor the Government will be responsible for preventing such a Bill as this being placed on the Statute Book while they are in this Assembly.  I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House, as I am sure it is the intention of the Government and of most of the Deputies to fulfill the promises they made during the last election that they would support any measure which would enable town tenants to get some relief from their landlords. I would like to ask the Government if they really considered the necessity of trying to fit in with the wishes of at least two-thirds of the people of the Free State who are anxious that this Bill should go through.  I do not see why the landlords and house-owners should be crying out with hands raised to heaven to every member to vote against this Bill.  They think that the Bill prevents progress.  I am of the opinion that the Bill will do far more for the landlords by getting the tenants to pay any fair rents fixed by the courts, and will serve landlords far better <Col N="1291" /> than the present Rent Restrictions Act which was passed by the Dáil. That Act was passed for the landlords' benefit.  I have explained all that before. Now, Deputy Redmond comes and tries to give them a better measure of freedom by introducing a Bill in which the tenants will be bound to pay fair rents fixed by Fair Rent Courts. A large number of landlords who tried to raise rents did not, I am happy to say, succeed in getting the increase they demanded, but under this Bill the people cannot interfere and the landlord must get his rent.  I hear some Deputy saying &ldquo;shame,&rdquo; but it is not a shame to give the landlord his rent. Every tenant wishes to pay his landlord his rent, provided he does his duty to his tenants, keeps the house in repair, and does not charge a rent which the tenant cannot afford to pay.  I see it stated in the papers that it is the intention of the Government to vote against the Bill, as they themselves intend to introduce a Bill in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some landlords say that this Bill is too drastic but to my mind it is too smooth.  If I had my way every tenant living in a house for twenty-five or thirty years, having paid more than the value of the house, should have that house given to him free as a gratuity by the landlord.  Deputy Redmond would not agree to this when I put it forward in the Town Tenants' League.  He said that the landlord was entitled to compensation.  I see the President is not here, and if he were he might make me an answer like the one he made me the other evening, which was a most gentlemanly one, coming as it did from the head of the State, who should be anxious to show a good example to this House.  I want to ask the Government to have the official Whips withdrawn when there is a division called for upon this Bill.  I am more than pleased to see the large number of Deputies who are on the Government benches.  One would imagine that one was present at a very bad performance in a theatre.  This Bill must not be of real interest to such Deputies, who I am sure are not carrying out the wishes of their constituents when they are not present here to voice their opinions.  I hope that the Government <Col N="1292" /> will withdraw the Whips in order to give Deputies an opportunity of voting as they like upon this Bill.  They promised their constituents before they were elected that they would support the claims of the town tenants and the Minister for Justice has recently stated in the country that he would support the tenants and see that they did get the same facilities as the tenants under the Land Act.</P>

      <P>I think it was down in Kilkenny.  Deputy Nolan, who is also absent, addressed a meeting in a part of Limerick a Sunday or two ago, and said that he was also interested on behalf of the town tenants, but it was a mere chance that they had got the town left at all on account of the burning and other destruction.  I am very pleased that Deputy Nolan has expressed himself as interested in this Bill.  He was speaking, I suppose, on behalf of the Government during the Limerick election, and surely when a Deputy speaks on behalf of the Government the people, if they do not believe all that the Deputy says, at least believe some of it.  I believe that Deputy Nolan was voicing the opinion of the Government on this question of town tenants.  That is the usual propaganda by which, as with an electric magnet, they try to attract votes.  It has been said throughout the country by the house-owners that if this Bill passes it will prevent any people from either building or purchasing houses.  To my mind, it will, in fact, encourage landlords to invest their money in building.  They will be encouraged in a way they have not yet been by any Acts of the late Government or the present Government.  This Act, if passed, will enable them to get fair rents fixed for the houses, and it will enable them to charge a rent in accordance with the price the house cost.  But, of course, they cannot evict a tenant as long as he pays his rent. Some landlords do not believe in any measure of freedom for their tenants. Some want to have their tenants in the hollow of their hands; others want to be able to clutch their tenants by the neck, as they can do under the present Acts.  When a landlord wants a house that is occupied by his tenant, <Col N="1293" /> for someone else, all he has to do is to apply to the court and say he wants a house for his son or daughter, and it lies with the judge to say whether the landlord is hampered if he does not get possession.  In a good many cases of this kind possession is given to the landlord.  The landlord's son or daughter goes in to live in the house for a week or so.  Then the house is sold, and the landlord gets four or five hundred pounds more than he otherwise would. Under this Bill the landlord will not have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the opposition to this Bill there never was a measure brought into any legislature on behalf of any portion of the community to which there was not a certain amount of opposition. We heard the landlords cry out against the Land Act of 1923.  They declared they could not send their bullocks to England, and they could not live in this country for the simple reason that they could not continue with 1,200 or 1,400 acres of land to feed bullocks for the English market.  But there is no change to-day.  The landlord is looked upon now as a kind of Christian, and it was the passing of the Land Act and other similar Acts that made the people look upon the landlord as a kind of Christian.  If that Act had not been passed the landlord would be looked upon to-day, as he was 70 years ago, as a person not fit to live amongst decent people.  Of course every landlord is not tarred with the same brush.  We have some very decent landlords&mdash;men who have not increased their rents and men who sympathised with their tenants and do their best for their tenants.  Such landlords do not increase rents or apply to the courts to evict their tenants. On the other hand, I have personal acquaintance with harsh cases. I know a case of a weekly tenant who used to pay 1s. 3d. per week rent, and who is at the present time paying 5s. a week.  I know another case where a tenant was paying £6 18s. a year in 1914 and at the present time that tenant is paying £42 5s.  Somebody may say the tenants have the courts of law to go to.  I admit the tenants have power to go to the courts, but what good would that be.  If the tenant succeeded the landlord would watch the <Col N="1294" /> tenant like a cat would watch a mouse until he left him helpless in the street. That is why the tenants did not avail of the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill is the one in which I am greatly interested.  A tenant or tenant's father or grandfather might have been living in a house and the landlord could sell that house over the tenant's head.  Under this section the landlord must give notice to the tenant that he intends to sell, and the tenant will have the option to purchase the landlord's interest in the holding.  Not later than last week it was brought to my notice that a tenant who lived in a house for twenty-four years found that the landlord sold that house over his head and the new landlord came along and demanded 25 per cent. increase in rent.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) of Clause 3 provides &ldquo;where a landlord of any holding to which this Act applies desires to sell his interest in the holding he shall serve upon the tenant a notice of his intention to sell in the prescribed form, giving full particulars of the landlord's interest in the premises, whereupon the tenant shall have the option within 14 days from the service of said notice to purchase the landlord's interest in the said holding.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That gives the tenant, if he is in a position to pay as good a price for that house as any other tenant the opportunity of buying it.  I do not believe in giving the landlord key-money, and I sincerely hope that amendments will be carried when this Bill is in Committee so as to improve it from the workers' point of view, and to prevent employers where his workers are living in houses belonging to him evicting them in case of strikes or trade disputes. Furthermore, when the worker is sick or out of employment it is more than a disgrace that any landlord should try to evict such a man when he knows he is not in the position to pay rent. When the worker is able to resume work he might be charged so much per week over the standard rent for a limited period.  Neither do I believe in the landlord having the right to purchase <Col N="1295" /> the tenant's interest.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Redmond say sub-section (4) of Section 2 will want to be improved.  As the President has now come into the Dáil and did not hear what I said a few moments ago it might be well for me to repeat it.</P>

      <P>Very well, I will not repeat them, and all I will say to the President is that I want him to withdraw the Government whips for the purpose of giving every member in the Dáil an opportunity of voting freely on this Bill.  I am sure all the Deputies here are anxious to look after the interests of the tenants, and have their interests at heart.  At least they say they have, and now is the time to prove it.  If the Government whips are withdrawn they can fulfil the promises they made to their constituents, so that when the time comes they will have the chance of being reelected again.  I warn the Government in all seriousness that if they reject this Bill, in my opinion, it will go hard with them to secure half the number of supporters they have at present at the next election.  They will get every town tenant up against them if they oppose this Bill.  I am sure Deputies have received letters and telegrams from every part of the Saorstát asking them to support this Bill.  They should not be prejudiced against the Bill because it was introduced by a private member.  Let them not say this was introduced by Deputy so-and-so, whereas it should have been introduced by the Government, and let them not reject the Bill because it was not introduced by Deputy so-and-so.  If a Bill were introduced by the Government it would be more satisfactory to the landlords. The Railway Bill introduced by the Labour Party into this House was rejected because it would do some good to the workers, and in its place a Railway Bill is now introduced by the Government for the purpose of improving the finances of the companies.  I ask the Government to think seriously about their own followers, and to enable <Col N="1296" /> them to say that they had fulfilled their promises.  They would then be able to say to their constituents: We have agreed to this Town Tenants Bill becoming an Act, so as to secure you in your homes and to give you an opportunity of purchasing your homes, and also to see that repairs shall be carried out, and that you are not compelled to remove your bed from one part of the house to another in order to avoid the rain coming through the roof.</P>

      <P>One had scarcely suspected in Deputy Redmond hitherto an advance agent of Bolshevism.  He has explained, he says, that Bolshevism to his mind represents the majority, and that for a majority he is prepared to be Bolshevistic to the bitter end. That gives the key note of the Bill. On the Second Reading the House is asked to approve or disapprove of the general principle of the Bill, and the Deputy is quite clear and frank as to what the general principle of this Bill is.  It is a principle of confiscation. The Bill is based on a fallacy, it is based on the thesis that there is an analogy between house property and land.  The Deputy went back and quoted the principles of the Land Act in defence of his Bill.  Now, no one knows probably quite so well as the Deputy that there is no such analogy, that it is utterly unreal and utterly fictitious to attempt to apply to house property the principles that we apply to agricultural land.  I do not know whether the Deputy's point of view would be that there was no better case for the Land Act than there is for his Bill.  I do not know whether he would contend that land which was historically, at any rate, taken by violence and taken by plunder and handed around in large quantities as a reward for military or political services, had no greater claim for division and distribution, no greater claim for legislative treatment, than house property under modern conditions.  Land is in a sense the gift of nature: it is nature's capital.  It has very little utility unless its value is exploited by the labour of the occupying tenants. That principle has been recognised in legislation, and it is not denied that it <Col N="1297" /> was unfair that land should be given in large quantities to adventurers, many of them foreign adventurers. That was the historical problem that had to be met in the Land Act.  The landlords enjoyed big rents drawn, in many cases, from over-burdened tenants. Their rents, in a vast majority of cases at the time, were not even spent within the country.  The principle of fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale enshrined in the Land Act were obvious principles applied to that problem.  Take the property to which the Deputy attempts to apply the same principles.  Houses were the creation of man's labour and enterprise, and the capital involved represents purely his savings.  To apply to such a form of property a principle evolved from the land problem is an utter fallacy, and the Bill is based on that fallacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find it difficult to believe that the promoters of the Bill themselves really believe in the principle which they ask the Dáil to approve and to accept. The Bill, as before us, is amended by the promoters on Second Reading.  We were entitled to take it that the Deputy meant what he said, that he had given serious consideration to the sections and the subsections of the Bill, and that he was putting it forward for endorsement here.  But speaking to the Bill the Deputy explained with regard to the most important sections that he was not committed to them, that he was not standing for them, and that even there was one very important section of which he utterly disapproved.  What happened? Did one of his supporters; did Deputy Byrne or Deputy Seamus Cosgrave slip behind the back of the draughtsman and secure a change?  Otherwise it is a little hard to understand why what is practically the most important section of the Bill is not stood over by the promoter of the Bill in its Second Stage. As regards fixity of tenure, free sale, and so on, let us take the case of a thrifty man who by hard work and enterprise manages to accumulate £500 or £600, and by way of investment, just as the Deputy might put his money into Mexican Eagles, he builds a house with that money, and that is for him an investment.  In the course of time let us suppose that the house in which he himself is living goes out of repair. <Col N="1298" /> Perhaps it is burned by Irregulars or Black and Tans, and his mind turns to the house which he built.  What is the position under the Deputy's Bill?  If he wants to occupy this house which is his property, built out of his own savings, the fruit of his own enterprise, he must buy it back from the tenant. Under the Bill as it stood before the Deputy took fright at it, he would have to buy it back on ten years' purchase from the tenant, who had gone into it perhaps six months or a year before.</P>
    <P>Measures embodying principles like that may or may not represent majorities for Deputies, but Deputies ought not to introduce in an utterly reckless and irresponsible spirit measures purporting to deal with important phases of our national life and important interests in the community.  The Deputy has attempted to defend the Bill by reference to an Act which was passed last year, the Rent Restrictions Act. He has attempted to make the point that really there is no principle contained in his Bill which is not already enshrined in existing legislation.  That is the Deputy's point I take it.  He makes the point that we have recognised the principle of fixity of tenure in the statutory tenancy of the Rent Restrictions Act.  Houses built prior to April, 1919, are controlled.  Why are they controlled?  Because of an utterly abnormal situation, because of an utterly abnormal scarcity and not as a permanent principle of the future as the Deputy's Bill provides.  In face of a housing shortage and because scarcity gives an opportunity of exploitation, these provisions were inserted in the Rent Restrictions Act of last year. Simultaneously we are encouraging building, as the Deputy admitted, and the Rent Restrictions Act does not aply to new houses.  There is all the difference in the world between such restrictions under the Act of last year brought in in face of an acute housing shortage, and the definite full-blooded confiscation embodied in the Deputy's measure.  The reason houses are controlled and not other forms of wealth is because of the very nature and circumstances of the case.  It was hopeless to expect a removal of the scarcity in the near future, certainly within a decade or five or six years time.  There were no real grounds for hope that <Col N="1299" /> that scarcity would disappear, and in recognition of that fact a modified form of control was introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputies here found fault with the Bill, but even Deputies finding fault with the Bill were prepared to admit that it was a better Bill than the corresponding measure introduced in England, a better Bill and a fairer Bill. That Bill was based upon the unanimous report of a Committee which went very carefully into evidence from all the interests affected.  It was able to make, as I say, a unanimous recommendation to the department which had the responsibility for producing the Bill.  I wonder just with what care the Deputy prepared the measure which we are now considering, what steps he took to consult the various interests concerned in the housing trade, whom he consulted as to its re-actions on individual enterprise in building, and what consideration, if any, he gave to the practical interests and the real rights of house-owners.  The false analogy of the land is introduced. Land improves by use, by cultivation; in fact, if not used and cultivated, it will deteriorate.  House property, on the other hand, I suppose the Deputy will agree, deteriorates by use and occupation.</P>

      <P>In any case, it can scarcely be said to improve in that way.  The person paying for the usufruct does not year by year in that way improve the property.  We are not accepting the Bill; we are opposing it, and asking all Deputies whom we can influence to oppose it.  If a measure has to be introduced dealing with a matter so important it can only be introduced after the fullest and fairest investigation of the whole question and the fullest and fairest audience to all those who have views to put forward with regard to it; after just such an examination of the question as took place before the Bill of last year was introduced.  This Bill is brought in, I believe, with no <Col N="1300" /> real view to its becoming law.  It is brought in in an utterly reckless, irresponsible spirit.  The Deputy himself found the utmost difficulty in defending, or standing over, certain of its provisions.  I would be sorry to think that there is established by this Bill a precedent that Deputies in the future, having time on their hands, would simply bring in a window-dressing measure of this kind to appeal to one particular interest and one particular section, and say: &ldquo;I do not care; it means a majority for me, and I am prepared to be utterly reckless, utterly irresponsible, and utterly Bolshevistic to that end.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I admit that it would require a good deal of time to explain all the implications and effects of this Bill&mdash;even more time than Deputy Redmond devoted to it.  But is not that an argument against bringing forward a Bill of this kind in these circumstances?  It is a far-reaching Bill which, according to Deputy Lyons, affects two-thirds of the population of <Col N="1301" /> the Saorstát.  It affects not only the houses in the towns, but it affects every house not an agricultural tenancy. Is this Bill a suitable Bill to be discussed in private members' time when under Standing Order 76 it goes without &ldquo;question put&rdquo; to a Committee, so that it passes out of the direct cognisance of the Dáil, and only those Deputies who happen to be members of the Committee have a chance of putting forward their views upon it?</P>
      <P>It is pleasant, particularly on a Friday afternoon, to drift backwards along the stream of time with Deputy Redmond, consider what happened in 1870 and 1881, and listen to a speech which might have been made at any time between 1900 and 1914&mdash;which might almost, if the Deputy had been alive, have been delivered in 1881, but which has no relation to the present state of affairs whatever.  A very great change in conditions of building and tenancy has arisen since 1914.  Now the landlord is superseded.  House ownership is not a very profitable form of investment, compared with other investments. I am glad to see that Deputy Wilson and Deputy Sir James Craig are in their places.  They will remember the figures which were put before the Commission on Prices by the Dublin Licensed Vintners.  They showed that since 1914 their wages had increased 185 per cent., coal by 150 per cent., lighting by 100 per cent., rates by 100 per cent., and their rent had not changed.  While the licensed vintner had to pay everybody else more, in proportions varying from 200 per cent. to 100 per cent., the landlord alone was getting no more than he did in 1914.</P>

      <P>The landlord realises that there are things he cannot do.  The average landlord&mdash;he is generally a good landlord&mdash;realises that it is not fair to take advantage of the Rent Restrictions Act, in those circumstances, and increase the rents.  Deputy Redmond called this an anti-profiteering Bill.  I am as much opposed to profiteering as anybody, but before you bring in an anti-profiteering measure, you ought to prove profiteering. That Deputy Redmond did not do.  He referred to the discouragement of building, and I think I am not misrepresenting him when I say that he drew the conclusion that things were so bad already they could not be made much worse by this Bill.  That is not, perhaps, a very cheerful conclusion.  I agree that the building industry, in spite of the august appearance of Deputy Good, is sick.  It requires revival. The patient needs to be stimulated by oxygen.  But this Bill is not oxygen for the building industry; this Bill is nitrogen.  Instead of the patient sitting up and kicking, the only thing he will kick will be the bucket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister touched on the circumstances under which this Bill is introduced. I say&mdash;and I say it in no offensive sense&mdash;that it is a partisan Bill.  It is a Bill drawn up from the view of one particular interest, and a Bill that particularly merits the careful scrutiny of every party in the Dáil. It does a thing the Land Act of 1881 did&mdash;it revives dual ownership.  Surely the verdict of observers&mdash;of all impartial observers&mdash;was that dual ownership was a mistake, and that the Land Act of 1881, while it removed certain evils, created other very serious evils.  It is one of the greatest titles to the honour of Deputy Redmond's father, that he had the courage and statesmanship to take part in the Land Conference of 1902, and bring in the Land Act of 1903, which terminated, by successive stages, we may say, dual ownership.  The Deputy is now anxious to establish dual ownership in houses. A Land Court&mdash;we are to have under this Bill what I suppose will be called a House Court&mdash;is not a medium without disadvantages.  It may put a landlord <Col N="1303" /> or tenant to an enormous amount of unnecessary expense.  It is advantageous to lawyers, but, I think, to nobody else.  Nobody is satisfied with the fair rents that are fixed.  Both sides think they are unfair, and there is always the danger that it may be believed that political pressure has been used and that in certain conditions, rents may be fixed at figures that the circumstances and facts before the Court did not warrant.  There are unreasonable tenants as well as unreasonable landlords, and under this Court the retention of an unreasonable tenant may inflict on the landlord an enormous amount of unnecessary expense, even though he does not get his rent reduced at all, because he has no case.  Then, it is not the same thing to have rents fixed as to get rents paid.  You cannot always get the tenant to pay the rent.  The Land Court is a dice loaded in favour of the tenant and against the landlord.  Deputy Redmond says there is no compulsory purchase.  There is not.  But there are circumstances which make it necessary for the landlord to sell, not under the compulsion of this Bill of Deputy Redmond, but under the compulsion of the Minister for Finance.  There are things like death duties which, when an estate changes hands, must be paid and they may make it necessary to sell in order to raise ready money. I am afraid I will be excommunicated by Deputy Lyons.  I am on a small scale a town landlord myself, and, therefore, no sort of Christian.</P>

      <P>I have many houses let at a total rental of £3 per year. Under this Bill, if those houses are for sale, the tenant has a right to buy them at a sum varying from £30 to £45, which is the maximum.  These are houses which cost £120 to build, and now would not be built for £600.  Deputy Redmond talks about a windfall into other people's laps.  The whole of this Bill is a windfall into the laps of the existing tenants, at the expense not only of the landlord, but of anybody else who wants houses.  The existing tenant, having paid for his house £45, <Col N="1304" /> can easily sell it for £100.  That is exactly my idea of a windfall.  I have very little time to speak, but I want to say in conclusion that tenants have grievances and legitimate grievances. I hope the Government will&mdash;not this session, because they have no time, but in the autumn&mdash;if this Bill is defeated, take steps to remedy those grievances. I think the tenant is entitled to protection against arbitrary increase in rent or extortionate rent.  He can best be protected in that matter by giving him an appeal to a court outside certain zones.  The zones should be fixed in relation to the poor law valuation.  If the rent is 33 per cent. over the valuation, the tenant should have a right of appeal to the court, and if it is below that, the landlord should be able to appeal to the court.  That would get away from the excessive expense of the court and the excessively large number of revising barristers or commissioners who may be required.  That would protect the tenant against arbitrary increases. The tenant is also entitled to have security against arbitrary eviction. It is unfair, if a man builds up a business by personal qualities&mdash;it may be a little newspaper shop or a dairy or anything of that kind&mdash;that the landlord should suddenly come down and give him six months' or a year's notice and destroy all the business and all the connection he built up. If the Government will bring in a Bill of that kind, I hope Deputy Redmond will withdraw his.  If they do not, I should be prepared to allow Deputy Redmond's Bill, in spite of all, what I may call, its abominable features, a Second Reading, in the hope that it might be amended by the removal of the objectionable clauses and the modification of other clauses in Committee.</P>

      <P>I just want to make a few remarks as to what effect this Bill will have, in my opinion, on housing.  I really think, if anybody had a scheme, or thought about a scheme by which they could injure tenants and householders, he could not have struck upon a better scheme than this one.  I certainly think a very bad day's work has been done for housing in the Saorstát by the introduction of this measure.  We all know that if there is a crying demand for one thing <Col N="1305" /> more than another, it is for houses in Ireland.  I ask what effect will this Bill will have upon housing.  Even the very introduction of it has been a setback to housing.  I am a speculative house builder.  If this Bill were to become law I would not dream of building houses.  There are a great many things in it that are very objectionable. If a builder spends his time and money on building houses, and lets them to tenants, in the course of time the tenants claim a right to the houses and the man who owns them cannot sell without their consent.  I think that is going very far.  In fact, it is nothing short of confiscation.  I am deeply interested in housing, and I know of the great scarcity of houses there is at the present time.  There is not a day that people do not come to me to know if I could let them a house, or give them some information by which they could procure a house.  It grieves me to think that anybody should introduce a Bill of this kind, having regard to the existing housing position.  The scare <Col N="1306" /> created by the introduction of the Bill has been such that nobody will let a house to a tenant at the present time. They will keep houses on the market until they get purchasers for them.  Nobody can get a house who has not the money to buy a house.  The landlord does not want to let.  He simply wants to sell.</P>
