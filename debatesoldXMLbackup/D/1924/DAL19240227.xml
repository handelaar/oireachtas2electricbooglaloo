      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether, having regard to the large numbers of men demobilised and about to be demobilised from the Army, he will consider the advisability of suspending recruitment for the Civic Guard, the Dublin Metropolitan Police and Civil Service, so as to provide an opportunity for ex-National Soldiers to compete for those posts; and, if so, if he will undertake that when the physical and educational standards of those men are being inquired into, allowance will be made for the fact that they, while on service, had not the opportunities available for men not in the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided that in filling vacancies in the Public Service every possible opportunity is to be taken to reserve employment for men who have served in the Army and are now demobilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In filling vacancies in the Gárd Síochána and Dublin Metropolitan Police preference is given to men who have served in the Army, Criminal Investigation Department and Protective Force, and the great majority of such vacancies which occurred during the past year have been filled by men who served in these forces.  Of the 200 recruits who have been admitted to the Dublin Metropolitan Police since last August, 160 were accepted from the Army or the Criminal Investigation Department. About 600 ex-soldiers have <Col N="1416" /> been admitted to the Gárda Siochána, and twelve Army officers have been appointed to officer rank therein.  Preference will continue to be given to ex-Army men in the recruitment of these forces, but having regard to the importance of these qualifications for the efficiency of the forces, it is not proposed to lower the present reasonable physical and educational qualifications demanded from candidates.</P>
    <P>As regards the Civil Service, instructions have been issued that a preference is to be given in all cases to ex-Army candidates, and, in particular, all temporary clerical and subordinate posts in the service are reserved exclusively for ex-Army men.  In addition, the Civil Service Commission has given preferential treatment to men who served in the Army by holding one examination confined to Army candidates and giving a special advantage to Army candidates in an examination now pending.  A further Civil Service examination confined to Army candidates is at present under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that answer, I would like to ask the President if the reference to temporary appointments is meant to refer to purely temporary appointments, or temporary appointments in the technical sense&mdash; that is to say, people who are not on the Establishment&mdash;and has any change taken place with regard to the proportion of temporary appointments in the technical sense to regular appointments?</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <P>John Kavanagh, of Skirteen, Monasterevan, made claims to Unemployment Benefit on five occasions since the beginning of January, 1922.  In respect of the first four of those claims he has been paid benefit at the appropriate rate for 417 days.  It has not been possible to allow benefit on the fifth claim made on the 18th October last, because the applicant is disqualified by Sub-Section 4 of Section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, inasmuch as no contribution was paid for him in the 1922-23 insurance year, or since.  That disqualification will last until not less than 12 contributions have been paid for the applicant under the Acts, exclusive of those paid for him prior to the 1922-23 insurance year.</P>

      <NameTxt>PEADAR O hAODHA</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been called to the fact that in the County of Louth, and generally in the Saorstát, landlords are carrying out sales of land with a view to evading some of the provisions of the Land Act, <Col N="1420" /> 1923; and whether the new tenancies created by these sales will be sanctioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, to the detriment of evicted tenants and uneconomic holders, whose greater claims have been admitted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGRATH (replying for Minister for Agriculture) Mr. McGRATH (replying for Minister for Agriculture)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH (replying for Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of land by landowners will not in any way prejudice the operations of the Land Act, 1923.  There is no power to interfere with any owner's right to sell his land, but the sale of land or the creation of freeholds or tenancies now does not in any way interfere with or modify the right of the Land Commission under the Land Act, 1923, to acquire land compulsorily for the purposes of the Act where it is required.  The fact that &ldquo;A&rdquo; has sold his land within the last year, and that &ldquo;B,&rdquo;&ldquo;C,&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo; are now the legal owners, makes no difference whatever to the position.  If the Land Commission require the land they can acquire it compulsorily from &ldquo;B,&rdquo;&ldquo;C,&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo; as readily as they acquire it from &ldquo;A.&rdquo;  The transfer of ownership alters in no way the provisions of the Act either as to acquisition or price.</P>
      <P>Under the Land Act of 1923 the Land Commission may acquire land compulsorily not only from a landlord who holds in fee, but also from a tenant or a tenant purchaser.  Any attempt to prevent the sale of land, pending the operations of the Land Act, would not increase in any way the powers of the Land Commission, but would merely have the effect of decreasing the value of all the land of the country, and farmers, large and small, since they own far the greatest area, would be the principal sufferers by such a policy.</P>

      <P>Dependents' allowance has been duly paid in respect of the children, of whom one became 16 years of age in August last.  The claim in respect of Miss Bridget Guilfoyle was disallowed on the ground that the extent of her financial dependence on her brother was less than the minimum required by regulations before an allowance might be issued.

It is an economy Measure really, and, to some extent, the matter with which it deals has been dealt with in anticipation by departmental action, and the legalising and validating of that action will be covered by the Bill. I do not think it necessary, at this stage, to explain the measure at length. It provides a more economical method of adding to the electors lists a jurors column showing whether each elector is an ordinary juror, a special juror, or not a juror at all.  If the considerable sum that could be saved by that process was to be saved this year, it was necessary to anticipate by departmental action the provisions of this Bill, and I think when the Bill is in the hands of Deputies it will be found to meet with general agreement.  Some other matters of minor importance are dealt with in the Bill, but it is not attempted at <Col N="1427" /> present, and will not be attempted until after the passing of the Courts of Justice Bill, to introduce a comprehensive measure dealing with the Jury system generally.</P>

      <P>I ask leave to have printed and circulated to Deputies a Bill entitled the &ldquo;Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Bill, 1924.&rdquo;  This Bill bears a striking resemblance to the Bill of the same name introduced last year.  It provides for an increase in the number of under-sheriffs by means of temporary additional appointments in the larger and more troublesome counties, such as Galway and Cork, and for an increase in the number, and an improvement in the quality, of bailiffs by authorising under-sheriffs to take on additional bailiffs, to whom the State will pay small salaries in addition to fees; for the removal of certain limitations and checks which the ordinary law places on the operations of the under-sheriff, and the effect of which at present is to make it difficult or almost impossible for the under-sheriff to perform his duties; it also provides for an inquiry at District Courts into the accounts of judgement debtors who have no seizable chattels, but who have or who are able to have assets or sources of income which the under-sheriff cannot seize.  It provides also for a speedier inquiry into the merits of claims made by third parties, for instance, a debtor's wife, to goods seized on the debtor's premises by the under-sheriff.  I recognise that this is a Bill for which a substantial case ought to be made, even before it receives a First Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill that was introduced last year had a very salutary effect, but was too short-lived to prove a real remedy for the situation that existed. It had a lifetime of only six months. I propose to read to Deputies the situation with regard to the execution of Court Judgments as it was on the <Col N="1428" /> 1st February of the present year.  I have returns here for almost all counties showing the number of decrees in the hands of under-sheriffs, and the amount of money represented by these decrees.  In Carlow there are 134 decrees in the hands of the sheriff, representing £1,600; Cavan, 51 decrees, £400; Clare, 191 decrees, £5,400; Cork, 12 decrees, £400; Cork County, 589 decrees, representing £12,800; Dublin City, 58 decrees, £1,950; Dublin County 52 decrees; I have not got the sum of money in that case; Galway, 357 decrees, representing £3,600; Kerry, 203 decrees, representing £11,778.  Kildare and Kilkenny are missing.  I can say from my own knowledge that Kildare is practically normal, but Kilkenny is extremely bad.  In Leitrim there are 95 decrees in the hands of the under-sheriff, but I cannot say at the moment the amount of money they represent. Leitrim, in this respect, but in no other, is almost normal.  In Leix the number of decrees in the hands of the under-sheriff is 331, representing £9,700; Limerick, 270 decrees, £12,400; Limerick City, 86 decrees, £1,300; Longford, 18 decrees, £488; Louth, 151 decrees, £800; Mayo, 272 decrees, £6,700; Meath, 12 decrees, £600; Monaghan, 49 decrees, £550; Offaly, 215 decrees, £4,500; Roscommon, 258 decrees, £4,200; Sligo, 105 decrees, £800; Tipperary, 615 decrees, £27,600; Tirconaill, 962 decrees, £13,000; Waterford, 146 decrees, £2,500; Waterford City, 41 decrees, £1,800; Westmeath, 161 decrees, £8,000; Wexford, 334 decrees, £4,400; Wicklow, 114 decrees, £400.</P>
    <P>That was the situation on the 1st February, and we find that over a period of two or three months back that the under-Sheriffs are barely keeping pace with the decrees, without making substantial inroads on the arrears of their work.  For instance, on the 1st December over a particular 25 bailiwicks&mdash;there are altogether 35 bailiwicks in the Free State&mdash;but over a particular 25 bailiwicks for which full returns are available, the position on the 1st December was that there were 5,803 decrees in the hands of the under-Sheriffs, representing a total sum of money of £137,050, whereas for the <Col N="1429" /> same 25 bailiwicks on the 1st February you have in the hands of the under-Sheriff 5,724 decrees, representing £127,266, which is only a money reduction of £10,000.  Reports from all the under-Sheriffs go to show the need for the changes which are proposed in the Bill that will be circulated.  They also show that the mere fact that they have the powers which were given by the Bill of last year was in itself salutary, and that good results were secured without the necessity of resorting to these powers in practice at all.  It would be, in the face of the situation revealed by these statistics I have read, little short of criminal negligence on my part not to introduce a Bill which is so urgently needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Committee Stage of this Bill Deputy Johnson raised a question as to the power given to impose a fine in addition to a sentence <Col N="1430" /> of imprisonment, and contended that in some way that provision militated, or might militate, against the poor man, against the man without money, and in favour of the person who had money and who, in that way, could, as it were, buy off a term of imprisonment. It is not contemplated that the provision could or would have any such effect.  I take it that the judge or justice hearing a case, and deciding to make use of this permissive provision, would have regard to the circumstances of the accused person and to his ability to pay a fine in addition to a period of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>In consultation with officials of my Department I have decided that there is really no case for a change in the provision as it stands.  I consider that it is a useful power, that these cases vary very much in the degree of guilt and in all the attendant circumstances. You can have under this particular Act offences ranging from the merest technical breach in the law to offences of a very serious nature.  Much would depend on the motive for which a person might be supposed to have improperly and illegally a lethal weapon without the knowledge or the consent of the proper authorities, and judging each case in that way in its perspective and in its attendant circumstances, it was thought wise to enable the magistrate to inflict a fine, in addition to a period of imprisonment, if he thought that the circumstances warranted it.  I could understand the objection to this provision if it were mandatory, if it were a hard and fast or binding provision, but I must say that I cannot understand or appreciate the objections when it is purely a permissive section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not met the question as to why a £20 fine in paragraph (a) of Section 6, should be equal to two months' imprisonment without hard labour, and then in paragraph (b) £100 should be equal to six months' imprisonment without hard labour. The method of calculation has escaped me, and perhaps it would be of assistance to the Dáil in coming to a judgement if we could have the Minister's explanation of the difference in value per month in money of imprisonment without hard labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, not exceeding two months and not exceeding £20. That is to say, £10 a month&mdash;£2 10s. 0d., or a little less, per week.  In the second case the fine in addition to the imprisonment may be up to £100, but in default of payment of that £100, or lesser sum, a further imprisonment of not exceeding six months may be imposed. What I want to know is the relation between £20 equalling two months, and £100 equalling six months, and how is the difference arrived at.</P>

I would have wished further not merely that all the documents would be published, but also that, being published, they should be released from privilege in order that any person or persons who might feel so disposed might be free to take any action they wished in the matter, either in regard to the documents themselves or in regard to any comments upon them.

      <P>I must say that was not my interpretation of the discussion, but if it is the feeling of the Dáil I do not wish to be the exception, though I do think that because of the peculiar turn of affairs regarding this whole subject it is an inadvisable decision.  I readily concede that it is wrong to publish all Departmental files in a matter of this kind, for the great majority of them have no interest whatever for the public, that apart from that interest or non-interest it is essential that subordinates should be kept outside the public view.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the retention of all documents, no matter how trivial in this instance, is necessary, and because, as I say, of the peculiar circumstances of the case&mdash;not that it should be made a precedent&mdash;I consider it an ill-advised course to withhold one single document.  I do not want to move a motion on the subject, and if the citizens outside could see it from the point of view I see it, I would be entirely in favour of falling in with the majority view of the Dáil, but I again say, it is a rather unfortunate decision.

      <P>There are only two points I wish to deal with.  One has been referred to by Deputy Figgis.  Before I do so, I should like to remind the Postmaster-General that when I accepted the final words, &ldquo;except such Departmental Minutes as, in the opinion of the Committee, are not necessary to be published,&rdquo; I did so acting on the suggestion of the Minister for Finance. He suggested these words, and I think the balance of opinion of the Dáil was in favour of their acceptance, for I think we all realise how essential it is that our public departments, if they are to work at all, should be kept outside the arena of politics, and not have their opinions drawn in and canvassed.  On the point Deputy Figgis raised&mdash;the question of privilege&mdash;there is a good deal of misunderstanding.  Personally, I do not think that what Deputy Figgis asks can be done.  If a man gives evidence on a privileged occasion, he cannot be sued for it, and you cannot remove the privilege except by consent. You would have to ask every person who appeared before the Committee, and every member of the Committee, to remove the privilege.  Only by general consent could it be done.  If one person objected you would not be able to do it. Therefore I do not think that it is a practical proposition.  I think the public <Col N="1435" /> outside have not entirely understood the pains that have been taken to include in this evidence when it is published a statement from everybody who may be affected, and I think that is because the public, and even the Press, are not perhaps so familiar with the Constitution as they might be.</P>
      <P>Article 19 of the Constitution says&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof shall be privileged and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that Article I take it, and I hope the Attorney-General will correct me if I am wrong, if a newspaper publishes extracts from this evidence when printed and circulated, it will be liable to an action for libel by any person who is unfavourably commented on, although I think the Constitutional practice in other countries extends privilege to any Parliamentary publication even when re-produced in the Press.  Leaving that out altogether, when the Blue Book or White Book which contains this evidence is privileged it is a publication of the Dáil. That Book, containing statements which may reflect on the character of individuals&mdash;from what I have heard it is almost bound to reflect on the character of individuals&mdash;will be on sale in every bookshop in the City of Dublin, and every person who wishes can have hawkers selling it in the streets.  It would be grossly unfair that in a work of that character under the shelter of privilege statements should be made against individuals which they have had no opportunity of answering.  This motion gives them <Col N="1436" /> the opportunity of submitting documents to the Committee, even at this late stage, and having them published, so that as well as the charges against an individual being published, there will be the answer of the individual. I venture to think that is only fair. There is one last point: I have seen it stated by a speaker outside the Dáil that in the course of the discussion my motion was torpedoed by Deputy Johnson.  I take it that the shock of a torpedo is sharp and sudden, and that it comes on you unaware.  Most certainly there was nothing of that in this case.  Deputy Johnson told me before I proposed the motion the course that he proposed to recommend.  He was absolutely frank and open with me, and I say that the course he wished to recommend was not inconsistent with my Motion but was supplementary to it. Had it commended itself to the Dáil it could have been combined with my motion.  It did not so commend itself, but if it did there was nothing in the world unfair or underhand about Deputy Johnson's motion.  It is unnecessary to say that, because we all know Deputy Johnson.  We know he can be sometimes obstinate and sometimes unreasonable, but he is never unfair. As the statement has been made outside I think that a contradiction should go out.  As a matter of fact, nobody has torpedoed my motion. It is sailing safely into port, possibly delayed on the voyage, but that is compensated for by the fact that it is sailing into port with, I think, the good wishes, or at any rate with the acceptance, of every side.  I do not know if anything has been torpedoed, but most certainly my motion has not.</P>

With regard to this matter, which was the occasion for the appointment of the Committee, I think the decision reached by the Committee will simplify the question which arose in connection with this amendment, and as the President, unfortunately, had not been informed, the matter can be left open until to-morrow, when he can discuss it with knowledge.

      <P>I must say that I deprecate dealing with this matter as a matter of technical law.  I think it is a mistake when you hear people generally, but most of all Deputies, refer to some matters that may be concerned with law as having some mystery about them.  The law ought not to be a mystery.  It ought to be within the intelligence, certainly, of Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>To try and convert this matter into a dispute between two persons who happen to have some connection with law is, in my opinion, a great mistake.  When the amendment of the Seanad came here in the first instance, I suggested, in the course of the debate, that the Seanad amendment was not an amendment in the nature of an amendment of law, but was in the nature of cutting down the position of the Executive with regard to the remission of penalties and punishment.  That observation is very plain and simple and, I think, correctly represents the position appearing in the Official Reports of this House and now enshrined in the Official Reports of the other House.  We hear the Seanad sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;cooling chamber,&rdquo; but there is not much of the icicle in the framework of my observation as it appears in the Reports in the other House.  I do say that if anybody reads the piece of masterly advocacy, as one might expect masterly advocacy of a certain position in that Report, he will realise, after calm consideration of the particular subject and a comparison of the amendment as it was first sent down by the Seanad, and as it has now been returned to us, that my observation here was absolutely correct and justified in all respects and confirmed and corroborated by all that was said about it in the other House.  I said that that amendment was not directed to amending the law, as regards the Fishery Laws in particular, and anyone who refers to it will find that the matter, which was first introduced as a matter of advocacy, and really as an afterthought, in the other House, was proposed originally by people who had not in mind any amendment of the Remission of Penalties Acts or of the <Col N="1443" /> Fisheries Acts, but who had in mind a clipping of the position of the Executive as regards advising the remission of penalties in this particular case.  One has observed in various Acts that recently left this House a tendency to deal in that manner with the position of the Executive responsible to this House.  One is inclined to call to mind the observations made with reference to the Doctor&mdash;how much he was prized in the case of illness, and how, in a more normal condition of the patient he was not subject to quite so much admiration.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this amendment was originally directed to cutting down the authority of the Executive responsible to this House, and depriving it of power to advise the remission of penalties in relation to the cases that were dealt with in this particular statute. I said then, and I say now, that in an Act of this kind which has minimum penalties, it is important that that power should be preserved, more unimpared than it might be in an Act of another kind.  There is really very little more to say.  I take it that in the general Act which the Minister proposes to introduce later in the year he will have had the benefit in the meantime of this Act if it should be allowed to pass, and he will consider the question of minimum penalties as regards the general law.  He may also reconsider the decision as regards persons who institute prosecutions and get portion of the fine, but there was a doubt many years ago as to whether in such cases the prerogative of mercy could be extended to deprive the prosecutor of the profit which he gained under the prosecution. Though we have heard it asserted that the other House contains guardians of the Constitution and of the people's charter of liberty, I venture to say that in this case the position of the responsibility of the Executive to this House has been impaired by this amendment, and I therefore submit that this amendment should not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment from the Seanad was before the House for the first time, I stood in defence of it for the reasons I then <Col N="1444" /> gave.  Now that it is returned to us, somewhat softened in form, I would like to say that I still stand in defence of this amendment, and for the same reasons that I gave on that occasion.  In dealing with certain arguments I brought forward then, both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs raised the argument as to the prerogative of the Executive to dispense with certain sentences that might be imposed in courts of law, and as the result of which hardship might be done.  That, I take it, is the essence of the case put forward now by the Attorney-General and by the Minister for Fisheries in urging this amendment to be refused. Therefore I would just like briefly to address myself to that one point.  Whatever may be the truth in other places&mdash; and I am not wholly disposed to accept the Attorney-General as the fullest interpreter of those arguments put forward in those other places&mdash;so far as I personally am concerned, I do feel that there is no attempt made in at least the form of this amendment, whatever the intention may be of those who move it, to impair the prerogative of the Executive, to dispense with any sentence that has given hardship or the result of which may lead to injustice.  It merely means this: that the prerogative of the Executive to change a sentence or to dispense with that sentence altogether is a right that ought not to be exercised except in the last resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ought not to be allowed to intervene in the very lowest form of Courts.  If there is to be an appeal from the lowest ring of Courts it should be to a higher Court and the Executive should not be appealed to until the last argument has been carried to a higher stage than the District Justice's Court. In the Courts of Justice Bill, which is now before the Oireachtas, it is made evident that cases of injustice may occur, that a District Justice may give some sentence which might not be a correct sentence.  Later, facts may come to light that may require some change or revision of that sentence.  I would say that the right place for these new facts or new conditions to be investigated is not the Executive offices of any Minister but another Court of <Col N="1445" /> Law.  Either the facts are facts or they are not facts.  Either the arguments brought forward are sound or are not sound.  The substantiation of the alleged new facts and the correctness of the alleged new arguments are matters that should be investigated in a Court of Law.  If it be the case, as the Minister for Home Affairs seemed to reveal when he spoke on this amendment when it was last before the Dáil, that a District Justice would be apt to give heavy fines and penalties in respect of offences under this Bill merely as a matter of display, as a kind of public discipline and corrective, without intending that they should be operative, then I think that is a course to be deprecated.  I stood then in defence of this amendment and I stand in defence of it again.  I think it is right that the prerogative of the Executive should be exercised, but that it should not be exercised on an appeal from the lowest ring of Courts until the procedure of justice has gone further.</P>

Unfortunately, as we are placed at present, we have some of our own nationals against us.  I think the President can tell us what the cost of that has been and the Minister for Home Affairs can tell us the difficulties of our Defence Forces in trying to save our position.

      <P>I do not want to stand between Deputy Doherty and the light that radiates from the Attorney-General.  I rather want to transfer the discussion from a question of law to a question of fact, or even a question of expediency.  Sitting here it was not easy to hear the Minister for Fisheries, as Ministers who speak from that corner rather tend to address the Press.  I should like to know his opinion as to what the effect will be on the Bill and on the fisheries of the country if the Seanad continue to adhere to this amendment, and the Bill is held up for 270 days.  We gather, as far as we have any means of judging, that the Seanad attach importance to this amendment.  We did return it to them once, and they have washed its face and dressed it in a new dress and sent it down again.  I have no means of knowing what the Seanad may do, but I meet a number of Senators on Joint Committees and in other places, and I find they are tolerably obstinate. It is quite conceivable that they will continue to adhere to the amendment and will hold up the Bill, as they have a Statutory and Constitutional power to do, for a period of nearly nine months.  This Bill, even though it has not become law, has already done good. The knowledge that such a Bill was on the stocks has checked poaching during the last spawning season.  If the Bill is held up it will be held up until virtually the middle of the next spawning season, even over the middle of the spawning season on some of the earlier rivers.</P>

      <P>It does not seem to me in the ordinary way that this amendment is of very great importance, but it acquires a very considerable importance in our eyes, I take it, owing to the attitude of the Seanad in returning it to us again for further consideration. It appears to me that this Dáil must maintain the position it has already taken up in connection with this matter. Deputy Figgis says that before the Minister comes to a decision as to a certain case an appeal should be taken to a higher Court of Justice.  It seems to me that the decision of a Justice when a case comes before his Court is really not helped by extending the legal process. In other words, I take it that the meaning of the Section to which this is an amendment is, that the District Justice comes to a decision that the imposition of a certain fine is necessary in connection with an offence which has been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The District Justice may look at it from the legal point of view, and the local point of view.  The Executive, when it comes to them, may look at it from the general view of the situation as far as the whole country is concerned. I think it is desirable that they should be in that position.  If they consider the case would be sufficiently met by a remission of the fine, they should be in a position to do that without casting any reflection on the decision given by the Justice.  It would, therefore, seem to me to create a very awkward position if this amendment were carried. If the Executive wanted to alter a decision they would have to get the recommendation of the Justice who had given that decision.  It would be extremely awkward for the Executive to demand from a Justice that he should eat his own words and remit a fine he has imposed.  I see no reasonable objection to the Executive being empowered in this case to deal with the matter themselves.  I presume in the future we are going to have confidence in the acts of the Executive.  To imagine that they are going to misuse the powers they get under the Bill is, I think, to question the whole work the Dáil is going to accomplish in the future, <Col N="1448" /> and throw the whole Executive under suspicion, not only in this small matter, but in many other ways.  I think it is a power the Executive should have in their own hands, and I say emphatically that the matter in dispute between the Dáil and the Seanad does not justify the Seanad in persisting in an amendment which has been thrown out by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear a statement such as that from Deputy Hewat.  I was not altogether surprised with the statement made by Deputy Figgis.  Deputy Figgis reminded me during his statement of a man to whom you would say: &ldquo;It is a fine day,&rdquo; but he, having a headache, and probably thinking of the night before, will tell you he had not made up his mind yet about to-day, that last night was not as fine as he wished it to be; always nervous, always looking with suspicion on everybody else, and thinking he was suffering from an injustice from somebody or other.  This amendment would be sustainable if there was evidence to warrant its inclusion in the Bill.  There is no such evidence, none whatever.  The Deputy, when speaking of facts, should tell us what he means by them.  They are rather stubborn things, they are not what somebody told you they were.  They are the things that are actually in existence. The actual facts in this case are, that there were 188 convictions in the fishery year.  There were 87 appeals from the convictions, and of these 87 cases, 14 would not be recommended by the District Justices, and of those recommended a lesser number were remitted. Does that, on the face of it, make a case for the inclusion of this amendment?  Does that, on the face of it, give any justification for the holding up of this measure at its most important stage?  The Bill did not come into operation during the period of the year when it would have been most useful. We have all these dissertations upon the Constitution, on fine days, and hard cases, and so on, but nothing at all about the business end.  If there is a case for the inclusion of this amendment we will not stand against it, but until that case is made for inclusion we must stand against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have really very little to say on this matter.  The President has summarised the facts.  Out of 188 convictions there were 87 appeals. Appeals and petitions of that kind are forwarded, as a matter of routine, to the Judge or magistrate who tries the case.  In 73 of these cases the Justice who was actually responsible for imposing the penalty recommended a reduction, and only in 64 of the 73 cases was a reduction actually made. So that there is here no question of abuse, no question of excessive use of a particular power.  So far from over-riding the Justice or the magistrate who imposed the sentence we actually reduced sentences only in 64 cases, whereas 73 reductions were recommended.  I hope that is clear.  The only other point I wish to make is this.  A side-issue was raised&mdash;the question of the right of the Minister for Home Affairs to reduce these penalties at all without reference to the Governor-General.  I think Section 11 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act answers that.  Certain powers were conferred by statute in the past upon the Lord Lieutenant.  Section 11 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act provides that the powers conferred by statute on the Lord Lieutenant should, as from the date of the passing of that Act, be exercised by the particular Minister or member of the Government who seemed most directly concerned, and in the event of any doubt arising as to what Minister should exercise the particular power, the matter should be decided by reference to the President. This power conferred by statute in the past does not, as some people seem to think, descend in any way to the Governor-General. It is not transmitted in any way to the Governor-General.  By Section 11 of the Act it is conferred on the particular Minister who seems most directly concerned, in this case the Minister for Home Affairs.  These two points are, I hope, rather clear.  There was no over-riding of any justice, or any judge, in reducing fines or remitting penalties.  So far from that being the case, fines were in fact reduced in a lesser number of cases than was recommended by the District Justices themselves.  The other point was that there was no question of any encroachment on anyone's powers under the <Col N="1450" /> Constitution.  The powers that were exercised in this matter by me, acting on the advice of my officials, were duly and properly exercised under Section 11 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Home Affairs has hinted at the real matter that is raised on this amendment, and I think we may as well face it.  That is, whether the Executive for the time being&mdash;and essentially and necessarily a political Executive&mdash; should have the right to review, on their own initiative, the decisions of the Courts.  I think that is really the issue that is being raised by the second amendment sent down from the Seanad. I find myself torn between two or three conflicting principles.  One is a very earnest desire to protect the Courts from interference by the Executive, and to prevent the risk of the Executive, at any time, unduly interfering with the decisions of the courts.  Now I see that while claiming that that is the purpose of the Seanad in sending down this amendment a second time, there is something more involved, and I am going to take the risk of saying that they want to raise the position of the Governor-General to that of an Officer of State who has in his keeping the prerogative of mercy.  Well, I am not going to do anything to enhance that Officer's position, and in the circumstances of the country and the time, and in view of the general constitutional position that we have attained, and are hoping to attain, I prefer we should clearly recognise that that prerogative is exercised by the Executive for the time being, and that in so far as any other Officer of State nominally exercises that prerogative, it is done on the advice of the Executive Council. If in this Bill, read in conjunction with previous enactments, the Minister for the time being has that prerogative, then I am prepared to take the risk and leave it with him rather than enhance the position, in the State, of the Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the amendment in itself raises the question&mdash;and the Attorney-General touched upon it&mdash;of the folly of imposing upon magistrates and justices the obligation to impose a minimum sentence. <Col N="1451" /> The Seanad, while readily and enthusiastically endorsing that proposal, desires to suggest that any recommendation for the remission of the sentence, which they have been obliged to impose, shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.  I have never been able to understand the course of justice when reading reports of Excise cases and smuggling cases, in which I read that a fine of £100 is imposed and remitted to 15s., and a fine of £200 imposed, of which £199 is remitted, and similar follies.  Apparently, that view of legal procedure commended itself to the Dáil when they sent this Bill forward to the Seanad, and it also commended itself to the Seanad.  But having approved of that method of imposing penalties, they desire to insert an amendment which suggests that recommendations for the reduction of the penalty must be made at the time the sentence is imposed.  I am not going to insist in maintaining such a foolish statute, or in re-enacting such a statute, especially when we are led to understand that any value that was expected to be obtained from the passing of this Bill has been lost.  We were told on the introduction of the Bill that it was preliminary to a recasting of the code in respect of fishery laws, and that it was required to meet the then existing spawning season, and must be made law before January was out.  Well, we are in March now, and I take it that the value of the Bill, such as it was, is passed, and, therefore, not much will be lost by returning the Bill to the Seanad with the intimation that we do not agree with their amendment.  Under the circumstances I intend to support the motion of the Minister for Fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The first amendment to the Civil Service Regulation (No.2) <Col N="1452" /> Bill, 1923, which was passed in the Seanad, is one to Section 4, sub-section 4.  A similar amendment was passed to a later clause.  The Bill, as it went up to the Seanad, provided that special regulations should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before the Examination, and that that regulation might be annulled by a resolution of both Houses.  The Seanad amendment provides that such regulations may be annulled by resolution of one House.  I do not know exactly what position would be taken up by the Seanad in this matter if it were to be discussed at length.  In the amount of discussion that took place, the Seanad seemed to object to such a provision on the grounds that the provision in the Bill appeared to give the Seanad and the Dáil equal power in the matter, and in reality did not give them equal power.</P>
      <P>In regard to the later clause in the Bill, there was a motion proposed or suggested by a Senator that the provision for annulment should be deleted altogether.  It is possible that such an amendment as I propose might meet with the approval of the Seanad.  I think it is desirable, when we can meet the Seanad in any particular matter that arises, that we should, as seldom as possible, simply throw back their amendments as rejected.  I think it is undesirable that the Seanad amendment, as it comes down to us, should be accepted.  The position with regard to Section 4 of the Bill is that it was put in in order to establish the principle of competitive examination.  In Great Britain at the present time the Order in Council under which the Civil Service Commission operates, is practically in the terms of Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners have power in Great Britain to make regulations prescribing the manner in which, and the conditions under which, persons are to be admitted either temporarily or permanently. In Great Britain the matter is entirely at the discretion of the Civil Service Commissioners, with the consent of the Treasury.  It was thought necessary here to put in the clause which was in the old British Order in Council prescribing open competitive examination as the normal means by which entry could be made into the <Col N="1453" /> Civil Service.  That is put in to establish a principle and allay fears that may have arisen, or may have been aroused, by any sort of propaganda that has taken place.  It is undesirable, however, that we should be in a position in which there might be a dispute about special regulations.  For instance, they might be annulled by the Seanad and might be supported by the Dáil. In that particular case, if there were to be any strong feeling over it, I fear there might be a danger of an abusive use of the special powers given in Section 6 of the Bill, which prescribes that in certain cases the Commissioners may, if they think fit, grant their certificate of qualification in respect of such situation, upon any evidence which is satisfactory to them that the person proposed to be appointed to such situation is fully qualified therefore in respect of age, health, character, knowledge and ability.  I think we should not leave ourselves in a position whereby the Dáil and the Executive for the time being would desire a special regulation as regards, for instance, providing that certain appointments should be exclusively reserved for ex-soldiers.  I do not anticipate that the Seanad would annul any such special regulation at the present time.  I am simply suggesting this as an example.  Suppose that the Executive and the Dáil should be strongly in favour of such a regulation, and that the Seanad should annul it, then there might probably be a considerable danger of the abuse of the powers given under Section 6, and that is not intended.</P>
    <P>I think the whole case for preserving the principle of open competitive examination as a general rule in regard to the Service would be made by the amendment which I suggest to the Seanad amendment. It provides that all regulations made by the Commissioners under this Section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before any examination is held thereunder. That means that if it is intended in the case of examinations to confine the appointments to any particular class of persons, regulations will be laid on the Table, and it will be possible for the Dáil or Seanad to express an opinion or to ask that the examinations <Col N="1454" /> should not be held, or to pass any resolution which would, in this House, be quite sufficient to cause an examination not to be held.  I suggest this as a compromise which might be accepted in the Seanad.  I am sure, from the discussion in the Seanad, it would be. There is really no Civil Service Commission at the moment.  The temporary Bill has lapsed, and it is desirable that this Bill should become law as soon as possible, so that the work that is necessary for the Commission to do may be done.  I move the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  That the Dáil do not agree with the Seanad in Amendment No. 1, but make the following amendment in lieu thereof, viz., to delete Section 4 (4) and to substitute therefor the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>All regulations made by the Commissioners under this Section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before any examination is held thereunder.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point of order of some importance. There are several amendments from the Seanad.  Only two are referred to on the Order Paper.  I do not know what the intention of the Minister is in regard to the other amendments.  The motion that is before the Dáil is that we do not agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1.  I submit we have a right to decide that question before proceeding any further.  I raise the question, as a matter of order, whether, if we do not agree with the Seanad amendment, we are at liberty to take the Bill and amend it on the motion of any Deputy.  It means dealing with the Bill anew, if we have not agreed with the Seanad amendments.  It means that we have passed the Bill in a way that we thought perfect, and sent it to the Seanad.  They suggest amendments and we do not agree with them, and can we then reconsider the Bill and make new amendments?  I submit we cannot, and that the utmost we can do is to make suggestions to the Seanad as to what we might be willing to accept. I put it forward without arguing, and purely as a matter of order, as to whether we are at liberty, if we refuse <Col N="1455" /> the Seanad amendments, to propose a new amendment on our own initiative.</P>

      <P>On the first point it is desired to change this motion of the Minister for Finance and to make the beginning &ldquo;That the Dáil do not agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1&rdquo; into a separate motion.  I agree that that would have to be put separately.  The other point is that if we disagreed with the Seanad amendment we are then in the position that we cannot amend the Bill any more.  It seems to me that we can, if we choose, insert not a wholly new amendment, but an amendment that would be an alternative to the Seanad amendment, in order to see whether the Bill, as now amended, would suit the Seanad point of view. I do not think we could start to reamend the Bill in parts which had not been touched by the Seanad when the Seanad amendment had been rejected. So far this is my interpretation with regard to our powers.</P>
      <P>We have not decided whether it may not be the better procedure to suggest to the Seanad that if they made an amendment in a particular form we would be prepared to agree with it.  I know that is done in some places, but we have no decision as to what we would do in such a matter.  I would not be inclined to rule that any amendment could not be made after disagreement with the Seanad amendment if the new amendment proposed was, in my judgment, one relative to the Seanad amendment which had been rejected and one which would be deemed possible of acceptance in the Seanad and which would therefore lead to agreement between the two Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On that motion, I want to oppose the Minister for Finance, and to ask the Dáil to accept the <Col N="1457" /> amendment of the Seanad, for the reason that it does maintain to the Houses the right to approve or to veto any regulation which had been laid upon the Table, and it places the Seanad, in regard to this matter, which is tantamount to legislation, in a position of having the same authority, and it leaves the Dáil with the power which originally it was intended the Dáil should have, of passing resolutions disapproving of any item in the regulation, and with that power to disapprove as explicitly stated in the Bill. The Minister has suggested that the form of the amendment which he would have accepted, would be one which would allow the Dáil to initiate a motion on some item in the regulations, and if the Dáil disapproved then the Minister would have to take notice of it.  But I think that the form that has been embodied in other measures is more desirable, and that there should be specifically set forth a statement that if a resolution was passed by the Dáil within so many days, that the regulation shall be null and void.  I think that form is better than the one proposed, although I admit that if even the form suggested is likely to be acceptable, the Dáil could not be deprived of the right to move in the matter, but I think in the Seanad amendment either House might take action in this matter, and that if either House does not within 21 days pass a resolution disapproving that the regulation shall then be, in the language of the local authorities, referred back for reconsideration.  I think that form is better than the one proposed and is likely to be acceptable, and that we should, in consequence, accept the Seanad amendment in this respect. Would a formal resolution be required?</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister for Finance will jump to the conclusion that, because I am standing in defence of the amendment put forward by the Seanad, that therefore I am moved by some singular and extraordinary pertinacity or recalcitrancy in the matter.  That is <Col N="1458" /> obvious, because in it the Seanad have made out a very important matter that is going to affect the future of the Constitution very deeply.  The Constitution has placed the final responsibility in regard to legislation on one of the two Houses.  In the end, the Dáil can have its will to prevail in regard to any question of legislation.  It is also true that the Executive is responsible to this Dáil, but in regard to matters that deal with administration, the matter is not quite so clearly put in the Constitution, and there, I take it, each of the two Houses has its own function in what I may call&mdash;I believe the Minister for Home Affairs used this phrase in this or in an earlier Dáil&mdash;sub-legislative functions, functions that are not wholly legislative but that are partly legislative and partly executive.  Supposing now that the original clause were to stand, as it was in the Bill as it left this House, it was there stated that it required a joint resolution of both Houses to turn down any matter of regulation that was adopted by the Commission or that was suggested by the Commission&mdash;regulations that have been put upon the tables of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing, in that case, that both Houses did not join, in such a resolution but that only one did, and supposing that that one House happened to be the Dáil, obviously whatever the form of the words in the Act might happen to be, the Executive could not afford to proceed in the face of a hostile vote of the Dáil even though the Act stated that both were required. Supposing, however, that the one House was not the Dáil but the Seanad, in that case, although the Act stated that both were required and that only one House did join and that the one House to pass such a resolution were the Seanad, the Executive could afford and would readily feel that it was responsible to the Dáil and not to the Seanad, and it could afford to neglect such a resolution so passed.  Clearly an anomaly occurred there which the Seanad was quite right to remove.  One has heard the argument&mdash;I believe it has been actually used in this House from Benches representative of all parties in this House&mdash;that this is the House of the two Houses that holds the <Col N="1459" /> democratic sanction.  Well, whatever the Seanad may or may not be at the present moment, and I am not going to go into that point at all, the time will arise when the precedents we establish here will affect the Seanad which, in twelve years' time, will be influenced by the precedents now established, although the Seanad of that time will have been drawn from a representation in which all the electorate of the Free State has voted equally with the Deputies who will be returned to this Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with that slight difference that I had forgotten, the representation in both Houses will be substantially the same.  Therefore, in putting forward any amendment to a Bill, or in adopting any draft of a Bill that would seem to place one House in a peculiar position of advantage that the other had not got in regard to these sub-legislative, semi-Executive functions such as are contemplated in this amendment, it is very desirable that we should at this stage keep the position of the Seanad in respect of the Dáil perfectly clear and on a parity.  I take the meaning of the Seanad amendment to be that they are struggling to preserve that parity which, in the case that I have represented, was not preserved to it in the original form of the Bill.  Not only is there a question there in regard to general rights and general equities as between the two Houses, but there is a question of convenience.  It is quite conceivable, and more than conceivable&mdash;it is even highly probable &mdash;that in the future when some such regulations are tabled, the Dáil may happen to be very busy and it would be the Seanad that would then be able to give to them the time and attention that Deputies in the Dáil may not be able to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know exactly how many Deputies in the Dáil there are who read all the various regulations that are presumed to be on the Table for their attention. I confess that I, for one, am not able to read very many of them or to give many of them that attention that <Col N="1460" /> they require.  It is also a matter of knowledge and of fact that members of the Seanad have, whether they desire it or not, greater leisure than members of the Dáil have, and it would be right to expect that a degree of vigilance could be given by members of the Seanad that would not be expected from members of the Dáil.  That question of convenience is not of primary importance, it merely supplements the other; but the fact is, that in the normal working out of the original provisions of the Bill the Seanad would not be placed equally, although the intention was to have placed the Seanad and the Dáil equally in the matter, and the result would be that the Dáil would have an advantage that the Seanad would not have.  I imagine that the Minister for Finance partly appreciated that point in the amendments and in the substitutions that it had been his intention to have moved.  I think that his substitutions would very largely have met the case put forward by the Seanad on that occasion.  These substitutions are not now before the Dáil, but what is before the Dáil is the point put forward by the Seanad, and it is a point with which I agree.</P>

      <P>I would say again that I think there is a danger in allowing ourselves to arrive at a position in which certain special regulations put forward by the Civil Service Commission with the consent of the Minister for Finance&mdash;that is to say with the consent of the Executive Council, and made with the approval of the Dáil&mdash; are then to be annulled by the Seanad. In such circumstances there would be great danger that there might be a use of Clause 6, which, while perhaps of no great harm in itself might lead to real abuses in connection with that particular clause.  Clause 6 is the one which provides that in certain cases examinations need not be held.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In case the Minister for Finance and the Minister in charge of a Government Department shall consider that the qualifications in respect of knowledge and ability deemed requisite for any particular situation to <Col N="1461" /> which this Act applies in that Government Department are wholly or in part professional or otherwise peculiar and not ordinarily to be acquired in the Civil Service,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>It might be quite easy for them, and there might be a temptation if a special regulation confining certain examinations to army officers were turned down while holding that the people we want for these are the people who have been in the army, yet to let people into the service under Clause 6 who ought not to be let in under that clause, but who ought to be let in under a limited competitive examination.  I do not think that at the present time there is the slightest danger that the Seanad would turn down any special regulation confining an examination to men who were being demobilised from the army.</P>
    <P>A situation somewhat similar might arise, and I think it is undesirable that we should be in the position of having this particular clash between the two Houses, and of leaving the possibility of getting round the clause in a way which is not intended, and in a way which may not be wrong in itself, but which might lead to real abuses.  I do think that if a resolution is passed by the Seanad and it is seen to be a reasonable resolution in favour of the amendment of any particular special regulation, it would not be possible for the Executive to ignore it.  It certainly would have to re-examine the regulations very carefully and to withdraw them if the reasons put forward in the Seanad seemed to be substantial, even if the Dáil were not to pass a similar resolution at all.  I think that there is ample security in the Bill as sent up to the Seanad, and I think that we do get out of the difficulty that might arise through the Seanad annulling the regulation which the Dáil was in favour of, and which it might be attempted to give effect to by a certain round-about method.  I do not think we should accept the position that every regulation which may be annulled by resolution should be annulled by resolution of one House only.  I know that in Great Britain there are sometimes regulations that may be annulled by resolution of either the House of Commons or the <Col N="1462" /> House of Lords, and there are other regulations which require a resolution of both Houses.  For instance, under the Government of Ireland Act there were certain Orders which could be annulled by one House only, and others, such as putting the Act into effect, which could only be annulled by resolution of both Houses.  I made a suggestion which I thought would get over the need for looking at any Constitutional issue, but I certainly would not be in favour of accepting the position that any regulation, even a purely administrative regulation, should be annulled by resolution of one House only. I do not want to say anything in argument here that might make it more difficult to argue in favour of the acceptance of something when I am speaking in the Seanad.  I would like to say simply that I do not think that the Dáil should take up a position that in the future all regulations that were annullable by resolution should be annulled by resolution of one House only.</P>

      <P>Ministers always have two lines of argument.  Either the Minister for Finance explains to us the practice in Great Britain and points out that we are following that, or else the Minister informs us that we are sweeping away an old British practice and making a desirable change.  You are running two horses and you stand to win on one or other of them.  I do not think myself that the Minister at the moment fully realises the difference between power conferred by statute and power conferred by goodwill, when he argues that if the Seanad were to pass a resolution, even though it would have no force and would have no more effect than an expression of opinion in a Debating Society, that nevertheless the Government would be bound to take it into careful consideration.  That is no substitute for statutory power.  The Minister's proposal is to take away the rights of both Houses in this matter. The Minister appears to have taken the saying of the poet to heart, that he did not care who made the people's laws so long as he made their songs.  I do not think Ministers care how we make laws so long as they make rules and regulations. I do not like the Seanad's proposal <Col N="1463" /> as well as the original form in the Bill, but I infinitely prefer it to the olive branch the Minister is proposing to hold out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>One other point I should like to make is, that the powers that would be in the hands of the Government, the Minister for the time being, on the proposition of the Minister for Finance, are such, that no matter what resolutions might be passed as far as the law goes, they would be able to pass these resolutions by, and take no notice of them.  The Minister's position seems to be this: the Civil Service in Britain has grown up out of a personal service to the Crown.  It is not statutory in any way, and they were at the disposal of the Crown in any conditions it might like to impose.  That has come down the years, and the Treasury has the authority it now exercises of this power over the Civil Service.  It has gradually been modified by practice in Great Britain, but the Ministry here is taking the line that the same relations shall continue to exist between the Civil Service and the Executive, even though we are starting on entirely new lines, and even though the relationship should be different.  The Ministry evidently desires to maintain the relationship which theoretically has existed between the Crown and the Civil Service in Great Britain, and to transfer that condition of things to this country.  Even in Great Britain they have, recognising the necessities of the times, modified the practices in such a way as to allow the Civil Servants certain <Col N="1464" /> rights&mdash;certain privileges, if you like&mdash;but privileges that have developed and almost become rights.  The Civil Service Associations, for instance, are consulted in matters affecting the Service.  The Ministry here, or some of the Departments, at any rate, have refused that, and I think that we ought to recognise that we are establishing a somewhat different relationship, and that Civil Servants are being given certain statutory rights, not merely personal rights, and will henceforth be somewhat different from the Civil Servants of the past, who were merely creatures and servants of the Crown, whose conditions of service might be variable and alterable at will.  Civil Servants may be engaged on certain terms and those terms may be revoked simply by the judgement of the Minister for the time being without any consideration or consultation with the Dáil, or Seanad, or the Service itself.  I think that is not a desirable state of things to allow to develop or continue, and I think that while the regulations we are dealing with now are merely in regard to competitive examinations, the principle involved affects the status of Civil Servants generally, and we should allow the Dáil and the Seanad to have something to say to the regulations under which these Civil Servants are either to be appointed or retained, the conditions, and the remunerations.  It is because of the issue that is involved that I urge the House to accept the Seanad's amendment.</P>

      <P>I have spoken in the interval to the Ceann Comhairle and he suggests that as this suggestion of making a recommendation to the Seanad rather than passing a resolution is a new matter, we ought to consider the form and that we should postpone dealing with my suggestion of an amendment to the Seanad amendment until to-morrow, and proceed to deal with the Seanad amendments as they came down to us for the present.  That means that we should simply take this paper of the 30th January and deal with the next amendment that appears on it.</P>

      <P>When we come to it, I propose to ask the Dáil to agree with amendment No. 2 sent down by the Seanad.  It makes very little change in the clause of the Bill sent to the Seanad, except that it does provide that the Civil Service Commissioners may hold examinations for situations in the Defence Forces, the Metropolitan Police and the Civic Guard. The amendment of the Seanad provides that any examinations, competitive or qualifying, as required by law to be held in these Forces, shall be held by the Civil Service Commissioners.  The amendment is slight, and I propose that it should be accepted.</P>

      <P>This is really a more important matter than that on which we have voted.  The amendment on which we voted merely dealt with regulations governing certain examinations, whereas this one deals with the whole Civil Service&mdash;its pay, status, grading, pensions, etc. The Minister, when tracing the genesis of this amendment and when dealing with it in the Seanad, found himself attacked from two quarters.  He was under attack from a quarter which desired to maintain a check on the Minister by the Seanad as well as the Dáil. He also found himself attacked by those who wished to restore the Minister to that position of autocrat which he held when the Bill was first introduced.  I notice from the Official Reports of the Seanad that Senator Guinness said, on the 20th of December, &ldquo;Would the Minister accept an amendment to delete the Section?&rdquo; The Minister for Finance: &ldquo;I opposed this in the Dáil, but under considerable pressure it was inserted.&rdquo;  Senator Guinness: &ldquo;It might assist the Minister if we delete it.&rdquo;  So far as the official records show, the Minister did not say anything in answer to that, but I have a suspicion that under his breath he said, &ldquo;It might.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I cannot help feeling that it would have been a little fairer to the Dáil, since the Minister appears to have said nothing, if the Minister had said that he was pledged to the Dáil and did not wish to amend it.  Having, under considerable pressure, accepted an amendment which gave the Dáil and Seanad power to revise these regulations, and to pass resolutions dispensing with or altering them, the Minister should have said so to them, even though a section in the Seanad was anxious that he should not. I must recall the history of this sub-section. It will be remembered that the Bill as brought in gave the Minister absolute power over the whole Civil Service, powers to revise pay, pension, grading, hours of work, and everything. He defended this in the Dáil by saying that the English Chancellor of the Exchequer possesses the same power, but he found he got very little support <Col N="1468" /> from any section but one.  He was attacked by his own supporters, and the only support he got was from Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good, who came in at the end of the discussion, and nailed their flags to a mast from which the Minister unostentatiously had hauled his down, but upon which he has now nailed it again.  I think the Dáil would be wise to agree to the Seanad amendment. The Minister did not like an amendment which I moved in the Committee Stage, because it was not in the usual form.  What is the usual form? I tried to study it under the best masters. I looked in the Firearms Bill and found that the regulations could be annulled by a resolution of either the Dáil or the Seanad.  The Minister will, no doubt, say that that Bill has nothing to do with finance.  I looked in the Housing Bill, which has very much to do with finance, and found that the regulations made there can be annulled by either House.  The usual form is the very form of the Seanad amendment, and the form which the Minister will propose to us to-morrow is a form never yet seen on sea or land.  It is more the usual form than the form which, under pressure, he inserted.  I infinitely prefer the Seanad amendment.  Apart from anything else, let us consider what the actual position would be if we were to disagree with the Seanad amendment, and the Seanad were to disagree with ours.  It would mean that to alter any one of these regulations it would have to be introduced by a private member, but it is impossible for a private member to get support to carry a Bill of that kind through all its stages.  It may be said: &ldquo;You have a remedy, and you can bring in a Bill.&rdquo;  That is simply making a mockery of the Dáil, and I venture to hope that we shall not disagree with the Seanad amendment.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Dáil realises that Deputy Cooper has been talking nonsense, pure and unadulterated. First, he suggested an amendment of the Dáil which was, of course, not in the least like the amendment which I afterwards inserted, or like the Seanad's amendment.  He professed to be quite satisfied with the amendment which I brought in.  He now professes to be quite satisfied with the Seanad in <Col N="1469" /> altering an amendment with which he previously was quite satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case to insist on bringing in a Bill to alter a resolution by the Minister for Finance, is ridiculous.  The Minister for Finance is a member of the Executive Council and cannot resist a resolution passed by the Dáil.  It would be just as easy to get support for a resolution disagreeing with a particular order of the Minister for Finance or recommending its withdrawal as it would be to get a resolution annulling it.  A resolution of the Dáil would not be altered by inserting an amendment for which there was support here and would not be altered by the Seanad's amendment. The Seanad's amendment proposes to limit the power of the Minister for Finance, representing this House, to make regulations dealing as they all would, directly or indirectly, with financial matters.  I hold that the Minister for Finance, with the support of the Dáil, should have complete powers of dealing with scales of salaries, conditions of service and hours of work of Civil Servants, and it ought not be possible for the Seanad, apart from the Dáil, to annul the regulations made by the Minister for Finance on any one of those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cooper that this amendment of the Seanad deals with a very much more important matter than the previous one and I feel more strongly on it.  I have no objection at all to the insertion of the particular sub-section now in the Bill.  I opposed it simply because it was unnecessary, because it did not increase the power of the Dáil in any respect, and the idea of the sub-section only emerged after undesirable discussion of the amendment put forward by Deputy Cooper and for which there was no large support. I do not want the particular Section that is in the Bill omitted from the Bill at all.  I only suggest the form that is on the paper for the purpose of avoiding any clash with the Seanad. In any case I would ask the Dáil to reject the Seanad's amendment.  That is a matter about which I do care and I feel it is important.  It would be <Col N="1470" /> utterly impossible to regulate the finances of the country if a regulation of the Minister fixing the grades of service or scales of pay were to be turned down by the Seanad and if it were impossible to put that into effect, no matter how much the Dáil desired it without the formality of a Bill which might be held up for nine months by the Seanad.  It is very desirable that the control of this House in matters of finance should be untrammelled, that the Minister of this House in charge of finance should be responsible to this House, and that the power of the Seanad in financial matters in particular should not be enlarged in any degree.  It is more important still that it ought not to be possible that the sort of agitation which Civil Servants could carry on, and which they naturally will carry on, in regard to their own privileges and grade of pay, should have scope in the Seanad.  There have been cases where a section of Civil Servants were able to get up a considerable agitation for higher rates of pay in the Dáil.  I do not want such an agitation to be got up in the Seanad and that the Seanad should be able to turn down the Minister for Finance who is not responsible to it.  Whatever may happen, I suggest that for the purpose of avoiding conflict with the Seanad, the Seanad's amendment itself should be rejected.  I think we need hardly discuss the compromise I suggest at this stage, as the matter proposed now is the rejection of the Seanad's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as it left the Dáil, in my opinion, is much better than the Bill as it would be amended with the proposed compromise, as the Minister calls it, which he has suggested, but I would ask the House to remember what is in question.  It is not merely a financial question.  I agree with the Minister that it is desirable that the Dáil should retain control in financial matters, but the Section refers to the classification, remuneration, and other conditions and terms of service of all persons employed in the Civil Service, whether permanently or temporarily, and may at any time revoke or vary any such regulations.  I submit that it <Col N="1471" /> should not be left to the Minister for Finance to have complete power over all the conditions of service, classification, remuneration and of other terms and conditions of service which he may vary and revoke at his own will at any time without reference to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading from the Bill which we are supposed to be considering and which every Deputy is supposed to have in his hand.  The Minister asks me to deal with the motion which he proposes without regard to the subject which is under consideration. He may be able to do that, but I cannot.  I always feel that it is necessary to have regard to the question under discussion when we are dealing with any motion relating thereto, and the question under discussion is the terms and conditions of service which may be revoked by the Minister for Finance.  If the amendment of the Seanad is accepted or adopted it modifies to some extent his power and authority in this matter.  The Minister has on this occasion, as he has frequently done before, suggested that the Dáil has power whether it is in the Bill or not.  Of course the Dáil has power. The Dáil has power to refuse confidence in the Ministry, and if no confidence is expressed, then of course the Ministry cannot get its money to carry on.  But the Minister suggests, in saying that, that every question must be a question of confidence in the Government; that if the Dáil differs from a Regulation affecting a particular class or grade of the Civil Service and thinks that it should be amended, that the Ministry must fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand that that view is acceptable to the Ministry, and to the followers of the Ministry; that view <Col N="1472" /> being that anything said by the Ministry must be approved, willingly or not, that the Dáil is simply to be a registration office of the decisions of the Ministry. If one held that view, then I can understand the arguments of the Minister. But I suggest that this Dáil has some other functions; that we have the right to be critical of administrative affairs and, as in this case, quasi-legislative affairs, without necessarily desiring that the Government shall vacate office; that we ought to be given an opportunity of saying whether a certain course is approved or disapproved without having to compel the resignation of the Government.  When we are dealing with a large number of citizens who are in the Civil Service&mdash;and bear in mind that this deals with all classes of the Civil Service, whether permanently or temporarily engaged or employed&mdash;we ought to know, and they ought to know, beforehand what are the terms of their engagement, and those terms of engagement and conditions of employment ought not to be revokable simply at the discretion of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it left the Dáil, and as it would be if this motion were passed, would say that any such alteration in conditions would have to be placed before the Dáil.  The Bill, as it would be if the amendment of the Seanad were accepted, would say that any such alteration in conditions would have to be placed before the Dáil and the Seanad &mdash;any re-classification, any new terms of service&mdash;and that either the Dáil or the Seanad would have the right to veto such classification or new terms of service.  I think that the case for allowing the Seanad to consider any such Regulation equally with the Dáil is fully made out, inasmuch as this kind of legislation&mdash;and bear in mind that that is the effect of these Regulations; they are legislation&mdash;has just as much right to come before the two Houses as much of the other minor legislation that is brought before us under the Constitution. As Deputy Cooper has pointed out, while the same principle is involved, it has a very much wider application in Section 9 than it had under the previous Section.  I think that we should agree with the Seanad amendment <Col N="1473" /> in this case rather even than the proposed modification which the Minister touches upon because it will give some greater assurance, than they would have under the Bill as it left the Dáil, to the Civil Service, that their conditions, classifications, and the like, are not to be altered without the due consideration of the Oireachtas, and the Ministry of Finance will be bound to feel greater responsibility and to hesitate longer before making drastic alterations in the terms of service than would otherwise be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>All the arguments that I used before avail with regard to this amendment, which in form is the same as the one that preceded it, but in substance affects so much wider an issue.  I do not propose to repeat anything I stated.  I had not intended to have spoken on this particular amendment, inasmuch as the arguments that availed, or that seemed to me to be of importance in respect of it, had already been mentioned by me in regard to the last, but for one sentence used by the Minister for Finance.  That sentence was this.  He said it ought not to be possible for the Seanad, apart from the Dáil, to annul a Regulation. Accepting that, on the very terms of the Bill, as amended and passed in this Dáil, it equally ought not to be possible, if that is to be a true and right statement, for the Dáil, apart from the Seanad, to amend a resolution.  But the fact is, things being as they are, that although it states that both Houses are required to pass the resolution, if the resolution be originated and passed here and sent to the Seanad the Ministry will heed it.  But if it be originated in the Seanad and sent here, the Ministry need not, because the Ministry is responsible to this Dáil, and not responsible to the Seanad.  That is the actual effect of the Bill in its present form. It is to amend that and to give to each of the two Houses its own proper part in legislation&mdash;seeing that they are both parts of the legislative machine, and that these Regulations are sub-legislative of character and of kind&mdash; that the Seanad ought to have preserved for it its Constitutional right to have an equal effect&mdash;within a certain period of time, if you like&mdash;in respect <Col N="1474" /> of any such Regulations as the Dáil itself.  It has not got it in the Bill as it stands.  It does get it in the Seanad amendment.</P>

      <P>These particular matters will be practically and entirely financial.  I did not put in a form here that would have confined the power of annulment to the Dáil only, simply because other matters than finance will come in incidentally.  But matters of classification and remuneration and the terms and conditions of the Civil Service are really matters of finance.  They are matters between the State as employer and its employees.  They are financial matters, and in no way matters of legislation.  In these particular matters it certainly is not the fact that the Seanad has an equal right, and I think that it would be most unwise for the Dáil to take steps towards any division of financial control.  I think it is most desirable that the one House in this country which will be elected at intervals of not more than four years, and which will have a wider franchise, should in this particular matter of finance have undivided control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you make it impossible for the Dáil, through its own officers, to regulate the Civil Service, you will certainly be parting with a good share of financial control.  I do not think it is desirable to do anything more than the good sense of any Executive that may be appointed, or of any Dáil that may be elected from time to time, will do to make more secure the position of the civil servant.  Everyone knows that the civil servant&mdash;or the permanent official as he is called&mdash;has, and must have, extremely great influence at the present time.  His position is really one of being in office at will and pleasure.  If you increase the security he gets by custom and make it more difficult to remove him, if he requires removal, you will find that Ministers who may be appointed from time to time, will have less power in carrying on administra- <Col N="1475" /> tion than they ought to have.  It is most important that the Civil Service should reflect as closely and as quickly as possible the views of Ministers placed in charge of the various Departments. I do not think it is at all desirable to fetter the powers of Ministers in control of the Civil Service, as seems to be the aim of Deputy Johnson.  I think if you had a Civil Service, given the sort of tenure that Local Government servants have throughout the country, it would produce very undesirable results and would very much diminish the democratic control of Parliament over the administration of the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister has twitted me with inconsistency.  I admit that when I first brought this proposal forward, I looked at it solely from the point of view of the Dáil.  When I read the discussion in the Seanad, I saw that there was something to be said from their point of view&mdash;a capacity which I fancy permanently disqualifies me from Ministerial office.  I see, to a certain extent, by the Seanad's proposal that a compromise might be accepted. But I still prefer the original form of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will do the Minister justice, and say that he is certainly consistent and has always been consistent.  In this matter, he has always wanted to get as much power as possible over the Civil Service. It is the natural tendency of an able Minister to exalt his office, but it is a very dangerous one, particularly now when we are working a new Constitution, and setting up a new machine. I cannot accept his assurance about amending statutes by resolution.  I notice that the Attorney-General does not venture to suggest that that is a very valid remedy.  My objection to his proposal, to disagree with the Seanad's amendment, is that it is a stepping stone to a compromise that he is going to put forward to-morrow.  If he thinks I am going to be so inconsistent as to agree to that compromise, he is nourishing an illusion which will be very speedily shattered.  He will only have to wait until to-morrow.  My objection is really to that compromise.  This is the first stage on the way to it.  I will make a suggestion to the Minister. <Col N="1476" /> Would he be prepared to consider leaving the two suggestions that he is going to put forward to-morrow to the free judgment of the Dáil without putting on the Whips?  I am not asking for an immediate answer.  I shall talk his motion out until 6.30 and he can answer me at 7.30 if he wishes to do so. If not, he can assist in talking it out. That would withdraw some of my opposition. In that case by disagreeing with the Seanad amendment we would revert to the original form of the Bill.</P>
    <P>After all, this is a matter for the Dáil and not for the Executive or the Government. It is a matter on which the Dáil might be allowed to have its own views.  It is a new method of suggestion rather than amendment.  If he will do that, I personally would not be disposed to press this to a division.  Of course, I cannot bind others, but that is my personal view.  I think it would be an advantage, from every point of view, that we should have a frank discussion and find out where Deputies stand in regard to this.  We should then be in precisely the same constitutional position that we are in now.  It would mean merely that the Bill would go back to the Seanad in its original form, and that we should not make any suggestions. Any suggestions that might be made, or might have to be made, would come from them.  I gather that a consultation is proceeding.  I do not know if the Government are prepared to say what they are going to do now, or if I am to go on talking till 6.30.</P>

      <P>Very good.  I must compliment the Minister on his fine fighting form.  It is extremely interesting to see him when he takes his coat off, like a character in Dickens, but he did not announce he was going to begin; he went on.  That is in itself a very valuable gain for the Dáil as a whole.  The Minister told us, at an earlier stage, that there is no Civil Service Commission at present.  I gather, from an answer given by the President at Questions, that there is shortly going to be held a Civil Service Examination, confined to officers of the army.  Who is going to hold it, when there are no <Col N="1477" /> Commissioners, I cannot imagine.  If, by disagreeing with the Seanad, we leave it possible for the Bill to be held up for 270 days, surely that is in itself a somewhat dangerous matter.  Therefore, unless I can get some assurance of the kind that I have asked the Minister for, I shall be reluctantly compelled to put this matter to a division. As I am sure the Minister will have the courtesy to answer me, I shall now sit down.</P>

      <P>I would like to dissociate myself from the interpretation that the Minister for Finance gave of what I said before. I agree with him that the intention of the Constitution is perfectly clear, that so far as finance is concerned, the final power lies with the Dáil.  There is no question about that.  But finance is a very wide term, and it has a very ambiguous meaning if it is going to be given the interpretation that the Minister for Finance has given it.  He spoke about the classification of Civil Servants.  Well, obviously a Civil <Col N="1478" /> Servant's pay must in some degree be commensurate with this classification. Classification might be called finance, but it is not finance all the same.  He spoke about their qualifications.  Well, one would like to assume that at least finance is going to be somewhat commensurate with qualifications.  But to decide upon qualification is not a financial consideration.  The majority of matters to be considered here are not financial nor essentially financial, but are ordinary legislative or quasi-legislative matters; in these matters, inasmuch as they are not financial, it is perfectly clear that the Seanad has equal power with the Dáil in a decision on legislative matters of that kind and in their amendment they are merely insisting on what is their right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE (Mr. McGrath) Joseph McGrath">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE (Mr. McGrath)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that this Bill be now read a <Col N="1480" /> second time.  The Bill is introduced for the purpose of relieving the electricity undertakings specified in the schedule from a difficulty created by the fact that an Act which gave relief to English undertakings did not apply to Ireland.  Statutory undertakings such as those for the supply of gas and electricity are usually limited in their powers of charge&mdash;a maximum price being fixed by statute.  Those maximum charges which were fixed previous to 1914 were rendered wholly inadequate by the great increase of costs during and subsequent to the European War; and temporary relief was given by the passing of the Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1918, which provided that the responsible Government Department could issue an order authorising an increase of charge.  The Continuance Act recently passed by the Oireachtas maintained the position as regards certain tramway companies and harbour boards which had obtained authority to increase their charges temporarily.  The seven electricity undertakings set out in the schedule to this Bill could not be so provided for, however, and the power of charging beyond pre-war maximum rates in those cases lapsed in August last.  Owing to the continuance of high costs of production, outside the control of the undertakings, it is still difficult, if not impossible, for these undertakings to revert to pre-war rates of charge, without creating serious deficits, and thus in the case of local authorities, throwing additional burden upon the rates, which I think it is generally understood are already overburdened. Powers to obtain revision were secured originally by statute in one case&mdash;that of the Dublin Corporation, but the procedure is complicated, and it was considered advisable to include the Dublin Electricity Undertaking in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general position as regards gas undertakings was relieved by the passing of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which gives power to revise the system and rates of charge; and as regards electricity undertakings, powers of revision of charges in England and Scotland were provided for in the Electricity <Col N="1481" /> Supply Act, 1922.  The latter Act, however, did not apply to Ireland; and it has become necessary, therefore, that temporary relief should be given by legislation such as this Bill to the electricity undertakings which require to be thus provided for; and also that their position since August last should be legalised.  It is right that I should point out that the financial positions of the electricity undertakings of the Saorstát were seriously affected by the recent troubles, and that in some cases actual danger to plant and mains put a heavy loss upon the concerns.</P>
    <P>While it is considered reasonable that these electricity undertakings should not be forced immediately back to the pre-war rates of charge, it is also desirable that by any legislative relief given to them, they should not be placed in a position to impose unreasonable charges upon the public.  It is accordingly sought by the Bill to confer powers on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to enforce revision of charges in cases where the undertakers themselves do not make reasonable reductions such as would correspond with reduced cost of production.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the Act, if passed, shall continue in force only to the 31st December next.  It is hoped that before that date, the Oireachtas will by its sanction have enabled fresh electricity legislation to be put in operation; and simple procedure for revision of charges is provided for in the new Electricity Bill which is at present in course of preparation.  It is expected, within the next month or so, that a Bill will be introduced.  It is generally recognised, at least the Ministry recognise it, that some of the undertakings mentioned in the Schedule are charging a good deal more than they should charge, and it is proposed to take immediate steps to bring about a revision in these cases.</P>

It provides that the Department of Agriculture may promote agriculture by means of educational grants, and it also provides that that Department may deal with agricultural statistics.

      <P>It is not intended to interfere with the decision to have statistics generally, industrial and commercial, under the Department of Industry and Commerce, but the Minister for Agriculture has mentioned to me his doubts as to whether his Department would still be in a position to prepare their specialised statistics which, to a large extent, would be handed over to Industry and Commerce and worked up from the industrial and commercial point of view.  The Department of Agriculture want to be in a position to have their agricultural staffs engaged, as they might be required, to prepare specialised statistics regarding agriculture and land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand the necessity for an agricultural Department to have authority to prepare statistics in connection with agriculture and lands, but I am wondering whether the intention is to have two Statistical Departments, one dealing with Industry and Commerce exclusively, and the other dealing with Agriculture and Lands exclusively.  I was under the impression that the judgement of the Ministry was that there should be one authority compiling and publishing all statistics.  I do not want to make any comments antagonistic to this amendment, but I would like to have an understanding with regard to what is in the mind of the Ministry as to this.</P>

      <P>I would point out that Sub-Section (7) gives the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specified powers in connection with industrial and commercial statistics.  I take it that you would call the price of bacon, pigs, cattle or butter commercial statistics, and that, on the other hand, you would not call the amount of land under tillage commercial statistics.  That would come under the heading of agricultural statistics, and if this amendment is not carried I take it the result would be to transfer agricultural statistics to the President, because any powers not specified in this Bill go to the President's Department. <Col N="1485" /> I think, with all deference to Deputy Johnson, that such a course as that would be very undesirable.  I certainly do not think that the President's Department is one that should be concerned with the amount of land growing flax, or anything of that kind, in the country at any particular date.</P>

I think, by the way, that if the Department of Industry and Commerce desires to publish agricultural statistics, that they might do so under the term &ldquo;Industrial,&rdquo; because agriculture is an industry, according to our farmer friends.</P>
      <P>I am really anxious that one or other Department should realise its responsibility regarding the production of statistics, and that we should be supplied with at least as satisfactory a return as we have been in the habit of getting.</P>

      <P>Will the Attorney-General give us some guidance as to what is meant by this?  I want to try to guard against too much risk of overlapping. I can understand educational grants being grants, for instance, for &ldquo;Daily Mirror&rdquo; Exhibitions, and being called &ldquo;educational,&rdquo; but under the term &ldquo;educational grants&rdquo; we might have overlapping and the deprivation of supervision of the Minister for Education.  I do not think it is desirable that we should recede from the attitude that has generally been approved of unifying the control of education in all its aspects, and if this term &ldquo;educational grants&rdquo; would allow a Minister for Industry and Commerce to promote educational schemes, apart from the Ministry of Education, I think that is a defect.  I know that Deputy Cooper, and I think Deputy Thrift, rather urged that the commerce side should be specially dealt with, and that it should not be under the control <Col N="1487" /> of the Minister for Education.  I do not know whether the Ministry has conceded that position.  They did indicate, at earlier stages, that the intention was that education, as a whole, should be under one direction, one general supervision, and I would like to know at this stage what is the position taken by the Government on that matter.</P>

      <P>There is no intention to disturb the unification, and the hoped-for co-ordination of education.  The intention of this&mdash;and it is analogous to the amendment in the case of agriculture&mdash;is that it should be in the power of the Department if it saw that, say, a certain class of trade school or a certain class of trade or craft should be encouraged, to make grants, strictly limited, to promoting training and education in the particular trade school.  We certainly had certain trade schools in mind in relation to this, or it may be in crafts, or it may be in commerce.  But this particular Ministry would be in the position of approving of a grant and would be able to say to Education: &ldquo;We want that applied for the promotion of a particular line of trade, craft, handicraft or commercial education.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In regard to that point, I desire to ask a question which I think is a matter of moment, and is also a question of drafting. I assume, and I take it from the Attorney-General's answer to Deputy O'Connell, that when the grant has been made on the suggestion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that grant will actually be administered by the Minister for Education. But if that grant is going to be administered by the Minister for Education and if he is going to take the actual supervision of it, then surely in such a Bill as this the allocation of that particular matter might more particularly <Col N="1488" /> lie with the Department of Education than with the Department of Industry and Commerce, who merely suggest the money.  The Minister for Finance, with his customary reluctance, hands it over, but the actual administration lies with the Minister for Education.</P>

If we, by legislation, appoint, or allow to be appointed, Parliamentary Secretaries, and we allow the Minister to whom that Parliamentary Secretary is assigned, or to whom powers may be delegated, also to take upon himself the responsibilities of the office, then that is weakening the responsibilities of the Minister.  A Parliamentary Secretary may be a Secretary, but he should not be responsible to the Dáil, and it should not lessen the responsibilities of the Minister.  I think the insertion of this word &ldquo;responsibilities&rdquo; tends to remove responsibilities from the Minister to the Secretary, and will give statutory effect to that removal.  I think we <Col N="1491" /> should have some more justification for this change than we have had, and I would ask the Attorney-General to meet that point.</P>

      <P>I beg to propose the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To add to Section 8 the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that every Order made by such Council of Defence shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within four days after the next sitting of that House, and if either House shall within fifteen days pass a resolution annulling such Order, such Order shall be annulled, but such annulment shall not prejudice or invalidate any matter or thing previously done under such Order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the amendment is the ordinary manner of wording adopted in amendments of this kind, and has been adopted in a large number of Bills.  I urge that this is the place where it is especially necessary.  When speaking to an amendment to this Section when the Bill was in Committee, it was argued against me by Deputy Milroy, I think, that the effect of deleting the entire section would mean that the Army would cease to function. That, of course, was an absurd argument, and I refer to it now in order to mention that I stated that it was entirely within the power of the Minister <Col N="1492" /> for Defence to create any such Council of Defence at any moment he desired, and that it required no statutory power to enable him to do so.  In reply to that, an argument was put forward from the Ministerial side that statutory powers were required in order that a Council of Defence should be constituted, and that the purpose of having the Section in the Bill was to allow such Council of Defence to be created, there being a need for such a Council.  I had not at that time in my hand what I have had since, that is, the Defence Order No. 38, which is dated the 1st of December.  The date is important, because it is prior to the consideration of Section 8 by the Dáil at all.  It is dated before the consideration of this Section, by which statutory powers were sought for the creation of this Council of Defence.  Yet this Order, No. 38, signed by the Minister for Defence, creates and constitutes the Council of Defence, saying who shall form it, allocating to each of the persons the functions he has to serve, and saying further that this action has been taken pursuant, not to this piece of legislation, but to an Order of the Executive Council.  This Order states that the command of the National Forces is vested in the Executive Council, and exercised through the Minister for Defence, and it then quotes from the provisions of the Defence Forces Temporary Provisions Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Council of Defence has been created for the purpose of assisting the Minister for Defence in accordance with the following paragraph 2 of Executive Council Order No. 11 of 1923.  There shall be and there is hereby constituted a Council of Defence to assist the Minister for Defence in the administration of the business of Defence, but without derogating from the responsibility of the Minister for Defence to the Executive Council and to the Oireachtas respectively, for all the administration of the Department of Defence and for the exercise and performance of all the powers, duties, and functions connected therewith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we have not had an opportunity of having that before the Dáil, and I frankly confess that I learned for <Col N="1493" /> the first time there were such things as Executive Orders in this form.  This is numbered No. 11 of 1923.  I do not know exactly how late or early in the year No. 11 appeared, but I would assume that it argued a very early date in last year, and it certainly was prior to the introduction of this Bill into the Dáil.  It empowers the Minister for Defence to do a certain thing and he proceeds to do it under another Order, which is Defence Order No. 38.  It treats the matter, not as though there were to be some Council of Defence in the future, but as if the matter had already been dealt with, irrespective of sanction being required.  We get, in this case, two procedures.  It is proved by this Order No. 38 that legislative sanction certainly was not required, because here is in existence before, a legislative instrument.  The Minister proceeded to issue his Order.  There is no other Council of Defence in this Bill, according to this Order, but it is clear that Orders like this are to be issued, dispensing with legislative sanction.  A clear case is set up for all Orders hereafter to be issued to be laid before the legislature, in order that it may be privy to all that the Council of Defence does in its name.  The Minister for Defence is Chairman of the Council of Defence, and is responsible to the Dáil. Everything that he does will have to be answered for by him here, he having sat as Chairman of the Council.  It is necessary that the Dáil should know what Orders are being issued, and if a point were needed to press the case to a conclusion, it is furnished by the very Order of the Minister for Defence in which he cites an Order of the Executive Council, both of which were not within the knowledge of the Dáil and were not placed before it, when considering this Section of the Bill, though they were material to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may refer first to this mare's nest, it was expressly stated here, when Section 8 was under discussion, both by the Minister for Defence and myself, that a Council of Defence had, as an administrative expedient, been already created.  Up to that point it consisted only of military people, but it was certainly expressly stated that as a <Col N="1494" /> matter of military administration such Council had come into existence. Therefore the enlightenment that suddenly came to the Deputy last evening in discovering an Order issued last December must be due to his absence from the Dáil during the debate in Committee.  What the purpose of the amendment could be one is very much puzzled to learn, because the Deputy quotes an Order made by the Minister as showing the necessity for having Orders made by the Army Council dealt with in the way he proposes.  Under the Section, the Army Council has no authority to make Orders.  Under the Temporary Defence Forces Act all Orders must be made by the Minister, and the Act provides for laying all such Orders on the Table of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Presumably if other powers are given to the Ministry or the Army Council a provision of that kind would be inserted wherever the power of making the Order is contained.  It may arise on the Permanent Defence Forces Act, to be introduced at a later date.  Under the Section as it stands now, there is nothing whatever about Orders being made by the Council which is an administrative body to assist the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Figgis finds it difficult to understand certain matters, and he places us in the position of not being able to understand himself.  This Bill was ordered to be <Col N="1495" /> drafted on 10th October.  That, surely, if my idea of the order of the months is correct, was anterior to the 1st December. If it were after that date the Deputy will correct me, and we have not yet arrived at the next October. The Deputy had in his hands on the 10th October this extraordinary conspiracy of setting up a Council of Defence, and he had information before him that it had not diminished in any way the authority of the Minister for Defence.  He had also the facts before him that were disclosed to the Dáil. The Deputy's recollection is at fault, and in future he had better acquaint himself with those matters and not take up the time of the Dáil by telling us what came into his possession a month or two after it came into the possession of anybody else.  The Deputy objects to the Council of Defence.  It was never our intention to make it a legislative body, and its powers and duties are clearly set out here.  It was never intended that it should pass Acts of Parliament, and if the Deputy so intended we cannot subscribe to his proposals.</P>

The powers of the Minister under Sub-section (3) are very great to interfere with any such body as a General Nursing Council. Would the General Nursing Council come under this provision?</P>

      <P>I would not like to make a definite answer, which, on reconsideration, I might regret, but in so far as it takes over any properly Government functions it would possibly fall within the purview of this section.  There would be an Order made and laid on the Table of the House affecting it.  If it be merely a professional organisation dealing with the profession of nursing, then it would not be within this at all.  If the Deputy looks at the bodies to which the section applies he will find that they are statutory bodies and bodies exercising the function of Government or discharging any public duty in relation to public administration.  I am not certain whether the General Nursing Council is a professional organisation. If so, it is outside this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert immediately before Section 10, page 10, a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;Wherever the expenses or any part of the expenses of any public service assigned by or under this Act to any Department of State are now payable out of any specific departmental or other public funds other than the central fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas, or any specific departmental or other public funds other than as aforesaid are now applicable to or towards the discharge of the expenses or any part of the expenses of any such public service, it shall be lawful for the Executive Council by Order to do all or any of the following things:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to provide for the continued discharge of any such expenses as aforesaid or any part thereof out of the funds out of which the same are now payable or which are now applicable to or towards the discharge thereof,</P>
      <P>(b)  to make all such apportionments of public funds as may be rendered necessary by reason of the allotment by this Act of different portions of any such public service to different Departments of State,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  to provide for the winding-up and the payment into or disposal for the benefit of the Exchequer, in such manner as the Minister for Finance may appoint, of the whole or any part of the specific departmental or other public funds out of which such expenses or any part thereof have <Col N="1498" /> heretofore been payable or which have heretofore been applicable in or towards the discharge of such expenses or any part thereof as aforesaid, and to declare that such expenses shall hereafter be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this proposed new Section is this:&mdash;There are in many departments special funds out of which payment for public services is made. During the British regime there were various reasons why it was desirable, or thought desirable by them or others, to have these peculiar methods of providing funds for the discharge of certain services.  Take for instance the way in which the Dog Tax was pooled for the purpose of the remuneration of Petty Sessions Clerks.  The object of this new Section is to get rid of these special funds wherever possible which, to a certain extent, cloak charges and prevent the proper understanding of expenditure, and to transfer the expenditure so that it will appear in the Estimates and will be paid out of the Central Fund like any other item of public administration. In that way all this expenditure which now does not properly come into view on the Estimates on this class of expenditure will appear as ordinary items of public expenditure on the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have several proposals, but I do not propose to make them now.  I rather thought when the Attorney-General was pointing to the necessity of all payments coming under <Col N="1499" /> review here that he was referring to that particular fund among others. There is a small contribution made to the Teachers' Pensions Fund which appears on the Estimates each year, but the Fund itself has been largely built up in contributions from the teachers, as well as from a certain capital sum which was set aside so far back as 1879.  I was wondering if the Government were going to take it under this Regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be possible, because that could hardly be described as a Departmental or Public Fund.  It is largely a Fund in which private persons are interested, constituted by private contributions, even though they are under some statutory authority.  I think if it were proposed to deal with that Fund, there would certainly be need for very special legislation, and certainly very careful consideration.  I do not think, as at present advised, that it would come within this.</P>
