      <P>The number of motor vehicles registered under the Roads Act, 1920, during the two years ended the 30th ultimo is, approximately, 311 in the City of Waterford and 417 in the County of Waterford.  According to the records in the Department of Local Government the amount received by way of licence duties during that period is £6,185 15s. and £7,677 7s. 6d. respectively.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to give separately the figures for the urban area of Dungarvan, as the County Council is the Registration Authority for the whole of the county area, excluding the County Borough, and separate registers and accounts are not kept for the Urban District.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the practice of falsely describing and selling as Irish lace, lace of Chinese and other foreign origin, has been indulged in to a considerable extent by traders in the United States of America.</P>
      <P>The Ministry for Industry and Commerce have given close attention to this matter for some time past.  At their request, the Saorstát Trade Representative at New York lodged formal complaint in this regard with the Federal Trade Commission at Washington on the 17th April, 1923.  The Commission have had the matter under investigation since, and their decision will, it is expected, be made known at an early date.</P>
      <P>The Ministry have, through the trade representative, obtained from several leading firms in the U.S.A. written undertakings to discontinue describing or selling non-Irish lace as Irish.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Ministry's intervention, the practice complained of has been considerably checked, and should very soon cease altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was possible to make payment of benefit under the 1924 Act in some very urgent cases in Dublin last Friday.  At Cobh all benefit payable under the 1924 Act up to the previous Wednesday, was paid last Saturday.  Payment of all benefit due to date under the new Act is being made to-day at Tralee, Killarney, Dun Laoghaire, Limerick, Drogheda, Carlow and Passage West, and payment will be made everywhere in very urgent cases.  All payments due under the new Act up to and for next Wednesday will be made at all the local offices of the Department next Friday.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that in anticipation of the Bill becoming law, the local officers of the Ministry have been exceedingly busy in preparing claims and taking evidence of unemployment from those who had claimed since the last week in June, so that retrospective payment could be made to those entitled to it after the Bill finally passed into law.  It was only last Friday evening that the Bill received the assent of the Governor-General.  Some time must necessarily be occupied in authorising and computing claims to benefit and in performing other operations in connection with those claims which could not have been performed in advance of the legal authority conferred by the Act.</P>
      <P>It must not be supposed that there has been any week in which benefit has not been paid.  Those claimants who had not exhausted all the benefit authorised on the claims they had in the Second Benefit Year and who, therefore, had rights independent of the 1924 Act, have continued to receive their benefit week by week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for External Affairs whether he can make any statement to the Dáil respecting the Reparations Conference now sitting in London and the relations of the Irish Free State thereto, and more particularly in reference to the statement reported as having been made by Mr. Thomas, British Minister for Colonial Affairs, in which he said that all the nations forming the British Commonwealth had agreed to the method of representation at that Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Fitzgerald) Desmond FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to explain that at the Versailles Conference, the Dominions, that is to say, the States of the British Commonwealth other than Great Britain, had what might be described as two-fold representation. They were represented on the same status as Powers such as Belgium with two representatives, and also when they were particularly interested in any matter at the major Conference representatives of those Dominions attended as part of the British Delegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present case we are informed &mdash;and I wish to say that I quite accept the information&mdash;that there are difficulties which make it impossible for the Dominions to have distinct representation. The system proposed was that the British Delegation should be composed of four, and that the representation of one of these would be handed over to the Dominions, and they would have that representation turn and turn about.  That would mean that it is proposed to us that at each fourth meeting an Irish Free State representative would be able to be present as part of the British Delegation.  It is also proposed that representatives of each of the Dominions may be present at all <Col N="1841" /> the Conferences.  I understand that some of the Dominions agree to that status.  Canada agreed, I think, subject to a proviso that it would be clearly stated and agreed that any agreement that was come to, or any commitments that were included in the Protocol, should be subject to ratification or agreement by the Legislatures of the Dominions.</P>
    <P>I have given this matter very careful consideration, and we have decided that we cannot accept that proposal. The precedent was established in Versailles that the Dominions should be represented separately as individual units.  That is not possible in this Conference, and the Government feel that they could not, without adequate representation and full powers at that Conference, come to the Dáil and ask the Dáil to ratify any decision that might be come to at a Conference at which we were not properly represented.  We, therefore, have decided that we cannot take part in the Conference, and that we cannot feel ourselves in any way bound by or committed by any arrangement that may be come to out of this Conference.</P>
    <P>At the same time I wish to say that I quite believe that the difficulties of direct representation are real, and I also hope sincerely that our non-adherence to this Conference will in no way interfere with its successful results.</P>
    <P>The statement that Deputy Johnson refers to in the papers, I saw in the papers, and I think it would be a good thing if the Irish newspapers would occasionally do as Deputy Johnson did and ask a question.  I have not seen the official report of that statement in the British House of Commons, and until I see that official report I can only conclude that the matter was misreported.</P>

      <P>I ask the leave of the Dáil to introduce this Bill. It aims at making provision for the regulation and improvement of bulls and <Col N="1848" /> other live stock for breeding.  The necessity for the Bill is admitted by the various live stock associations and by the Farmers' Unions, and it aims at fulfilling a recommendation of the Agricultural Commission.  The general standard of our live stock has been considerably improved in recent years by voluntary schemes, but in order to eliminate the very considerable number of unsuitable animals throughout the country, it is necessary to provide the Department of Agriculture with compulsory powers.  If this Bill becomes law, no bull may be kept without a licence, and a licence would not be granted by the Department of Agriculture unless the animal reaches the approved standard.  The Bill may by Order be extended to boars and rams. It is fully realised that in the existing circumstances we will find it necessary to go slowly.  No undue hardship will be caused to anyone.  We are aiming eventually at a very high standard, but we realise that stock-breeders must get ample time and opportunity for grading up their stock gradually.  The licence fee to be charged is 5s., and there is to be an appeal to an arbitrator from any decision of the Department refusing to licence an animal.  In order that the various interests may have ample time to consider the Bill, I am introducing it now, but I do not propose to ask the Dáil to consider the Second Stage until after the Recess.</P>
      <P>Leave given to introduce the Bill.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell us what is the purpose of this?  I must confess it is one of the many sins of omission that I have not read this, although it affects the County Dublin. I am sure that the Deputies in the various other areas and all the Deputies for the County Dublin will make themselves acquainted with what is in this Order, but I confess that I have not done so, and I should be obliged if he would tell us what is in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a short memorandum here on the point, and as it is quite brief I will read the paragraph which relates to this particular Order.  It is semi-historical, and in the end explains some of the purposes of the said Order.  But really the Order explains itself.  The Order was presented on the 17th July, and it was before Deputies for some period, and I thought it might have been appreciated by them.  The point is that the Blackrock Urban District Council obtained an Electric Lighting Order in 1901 through the British Parliament.  The Order was continued in force by the British Board of Trade and Electricity Commissioners, but the Council contends that it has not been in a position to proceed with the work, and that it is not in a position to do so this year.  It is claimed that by giving power to transfer statutory rights possessed by the Council an arrangement may be entered into with some other local authority, or with some company or person, to provide a supply of electricity to the people of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the only alternative would appear to be the revocation of the original Blackrock Electric Lighting Order, the securing of which had involved the ratepayers in substantial expense, it has been felt right to make the Order now submitted in order to provide the local council with power to negotiate for a supply by other parties.  The rights of the ratepayers of the area are adequately safeguarded by the terms of the Order as the parties to whom it is proposed to make the transfer must first be approved by the Minister, and subsequently all the terms and conditions of the deed of transfer must receive similar approval.  Approval must be given to the terms and conditions of the deed of transfer, and this Order actually went before the Dáil or was made on the 26th March, 1923, but could not be approved finally until the Electricity Commissioners (Transfer of Functions Order), 1924, was made by the Executive Council on the 19th June, this year, under the provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  There is one clause I would draw attention to.  It is a clause definitely inserted not only in this Bill, but in every scheme for the development of power in the country. The object is to hold over all such schemes and orders of this type for incorporation in any national scheme that may afterwards arise requiring the parties on whose behalf the orders are made to take a supply of electricity in bulk from a central power station if such supply be made available, at a cost equal to or less than the local cost of generation.  The arrangement of the clauses of the Order itself describes the purpose pretty well.  The first clause is the short title.  The second clause deals with the incorporation of the Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899.  The third clause describes who the undertakers are.  The next clause deals with the area of supply.  The fifth clause deals with power to break up streets, etc.  There is a clause as to <Col N="1851" /> compulsory works.  There is also a clause dealing with maximum prices, the transfer of undertaking, etc.  Then there is the question of the relation to the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Tramways Co., and the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware or has he any knowledge in his Department that this particular local body has already made something which is tantamount to a contract with such person or persons as is specified in the Order, and if the matter has come before the attention of his Department and whether any action was taken in regard to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The action taken is rather general action.  It is that all the terms and conditions of any deed of transfer arising out of these matters must receive the approval of the Minister, and, consequently, contracts previously made, if they come within the scope of this at all, will be brought within the terms of the order itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I was putting to the Minister was rather directed to eliciting the position as to the local body and the person with whom the contract is made or may have been made.  In the event of the Minister withholding his sanction, what becomes of the position of the contract if such contract already existed in written from binding the private persons to supply, and binding the local body to the private persons to grant such power to supply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is purely hypothetical.  I personally do not know what distinct order it is to which the Deputy is referring.  All I am aware of is that this particular body has stated it was not in the position to proceed with certain work to which the Deputy refers and is not now in a position to proceed, and I cannot see how it could have entered into a binding contract while making an application of this sort, if that order be not one such as may be brought in afterwards within the scope of the terms of this Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>All that the Minister mentioned in his last statement was that powers were taken under the order.  As I understood his statement in the event of supplies from a central authority being available at a lower rate, then this authority was bound to take that supply, and I suppose scrap its existing works.  Is that the intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not merely the intention, but it is the condition under which the order is made.  Clause 12 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;In the event of a Central Power Station being established for a district in which the Blackrock (Co. Dublin) Urban area is included, and that a supply of electricity in bulk is thereby made available to the undertakers at a rate of charge equal to or less than the cost of generation in the generating station of the undertakers, the undertakers shall take such supply from the Central Power Station.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That has been entered into with the eyes of all parties concerned open to the matter, and it is a very valuable clause, and it is not a clause that can be contended with on the ground of equity.</P>

    <Col N="1853" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good seems to be unaware that the Minister for Local Government recently set up a commission for Greater Dublin.  He is obviously unaware that while certain townships are promoting a Bill for incorporation as a rival city, the Dublin Commissioners, acting as the Commissioners instead of the Corporation of the City of Dublin, wrote informing the Minister for Local Government that they did not intend to press the promotion of their Bill for the extension of the boundaries of the city pending the findings of that Greater Dublin Commission.  The Order just read out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce really keeps the matter open and prevents vested interests being established and the creation of a situation which would prejudice the findings of that Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect to Deputy Professor Magennis, I do not think that affects the question at all. The question is this: If the local authority is not to be encouraged in this expenditure pending other enquiries, would it not be better for the Government to say so, and not place the local authority in the awkward position that they will be placed in under this Order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the responsibility of my department was this: that they were faced with a situation in which a national power-scheme might or might not materialise.  They had to take precautions beforehand.  They could not hold up this Order any longer than it has been held up, and the only way out of the difficulty seems to be the incorporation of a clause of this sort which definitely gave notice and a warning to the undertakers under this Order that they would be obliged afterwards, and obliged to do what? They would be obliged to take a supply of electricity in bulk, if it is made available, at a rate equal to or less <Col N="1854" /> than the cost of generation in the generating station of the undertakers. I think that is quite fair and reasonable.</P>

      <P>I understood that the Blackrock Council and the people with whom they were in communication 18 months ago did, as a matter of fact, agree that such a condition should be applied to the motion they were then seeking acceptance of.  On the matter of the presentation of these Orders, the Minister quite justifiably pointed out that they were presented to the Dáil on Thursday last.  Since then we had Saturday and Sunday, but Deputies were not here in vast numbers yesterday. To-day is Tuesday, and I submit that that period is not enough, if any other period would be enough, to ensure that Deputies interested would have an opportunity of reading these Orders.  I am quite sure that if I had sought this Order yesterday or this morning that I would have found some of the other Deputies representing the County Dublin in possession of it, so that my chance of getting an opportunity to read it, would have been very small indeed.  I submit that matters of this kind should be circulated, because they are of considerable importance. This is an Order which has to be specifically approved of, and I would urge that a matter of this kind should be circulated rather than that Deputies should merely receive notification to the effect that it had been laid on the Table.</P>

      <P>I am very anxious to get an answer to the question that I put to the Minister.  This is a matter that is regarded as of some importance in the locality.  Strange as it may seem, I have read the Order, and I have read it with some care, and I have failed to find in it any answer to the question I have put.  The facts are these: The Blackrock Council did some time ago enter into negotiations with a person.  That person alleges that documents held by him from the Council constitute a contract, and that contract only requires some Order to be made by the Minister in order that this person may be able to enforce this contract. That is the position.  What I <Col N="1855" /> want to know from the Minister is whether this Order does purport to confirm that thing that is alleged to be a contract, and whether this Order is directly consequent upon these earlier negotiations by which this person or company will have passed over to it the powers to create such an electricity supply.  In other words, this is a general Order, and what I want to know is whether this general Order does empower a specific contract or alleged contract which is supposed to exist?</P>

I take it that it is a statutory obligation to present these documents and make them available for Deputies.  It will be easy to make arrangements by which Deputies interested could get copies in the Office when the documents appear on the Order Paper.  It might not be found necessary to circulate them to every Deputy, as they concern purely local matters.</P>

In the absence of this Order there was no such power, and how anything approaching a contract could be entered into without this Order or something corresponding to it I fail to see.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing this Bill there is just a word I would like to say and that is to point out that the Bill is not going to satisfy the requirements, as indicated by the Minister himself, that it does not pretend to be any logical settlement of the cases that are made, and I think that it is certain to give rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction.  While professing to be a Bill to empower the giving of pensions to men who have given service in the National Forces, it is really intended to give pensions to a section of those people who served in the Army pre-Truce.  It deprives those who, while serving in that Army pre-Truce were not able, for one reason or another, to serve in the National Forces post-Truce, and as a consequence I think it is sure to give rise to even more trouble than it is going to allay.  I am not opposing the Bill but I want to make it clear that it is firm opinion that it is not settling anything except a few cases, perhaps even many cases, but not by any means all those who deserve recompense for losses actually sustained or for broken careers.  I think it would have been better if the intention had been to confine the pensions to specific classes or to groups of persons, that it should have been so stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands, and as it will pass no doubt, it rather suggests to a considerable number of people that <Col N="1858" /> they are being left unprovided for and unconsidered, and that no just reason has been given for that failure to give consideration.  One result of the passing of the Bill will be to allow it to be said of all those who served in the pre-Truce period that they were serving because of their patriotic feelings and impulses and desires.  Now, it may be said that those who are not receiving pensions served out of their patriotic impulses and that those who are, have that satisfaction taken from them.  As I say, that is merely an illustration of the logical position that would be created by the passing of this Bill, and I think it is likely to be a misfortune rather than a benefit, except for the fortunate ones who are to be participants in the pensions.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson is seeing this Bill a little out of perspective, or seeing a number of things in the circumstances of the last four or five years a little out of perspective with regard to the Bill.  I do not want to sponsor the Bill in any way.  I have assisted in the Dáil to make any improvement in the Bill where possible from my particular point of view, but I think it would be wrong to look at the Bill from a wrong point of view, and I rise to make one or two remarks in regard to what Deputy Johnson has stated. Those who were members of the Second Dáil will naturally appreciate the fact that the idea never made its appearance in the Second Dáil that those who had given service in pre-Truce days should be pensioned in any way. There were one or two matters mentioned at one particular meeting of the Dáil early in 1922 as to how they might be assisted, but a proposal to pension them never came forward.  In 1922, if it did not seem right that persons who served should receive pensions, we ought not, in 1924, develop that idea.  I take it, it is not proposed that men who entered the National Forces in 1922, and who served, say, for a year and a half and who doubtless gave valuable service, should be put down as persons who ought to be pensioned. In the first place I would remind the President that in the beginning of 1923, when the considerations that <Col N="1859" /> have prompted the putting forward of a Bill in this form had not arisen, a much more modest proposal to deal with some of these cases, even the idea of such a modest proposal was rather looked at askance by him as Minister for Finance at that time.  His idea, I take it now, is to meet the particular set of circumstances that has arisen, and that in a definite and particular way it is intended to deal with men who have been removed from their ordinary avocations in a period stretching back to 1919, because full-time service in the recent struggle against the British might be taken roughly to have begun in the beginning of 1919.  Whatever went before that, was a matter of a very small number of individuals, so that we are dealing in this Bill with the fact that from 1919 to 1924 there was a certain class of individual, a person who gave pre-Truce service plus service in the National Army, and that his case deserves to be dealt with.  I think we are only raising hopes, that, I suggest, ought not to be raised by statements in the Dáil, in the minds of people who served for a small period pre-Truce or post-Truce, when we speak of this Bill being framed from any other angle than recognising that men of a particular class have been removed from their ordinary sphere of life over the period 1919 to 1924. There is another point in connection with this Bill that I would like to draw attention to.  The Bill is framed to meet the difficulty, that is no doubt a difficulty that might be foreseen, but at any rate, it is a difficulty of to-day. Many men who would come in under the terms of this particular Bill, six months ago or twelve months ago, did find employment in State service, and it is just a question as to whether, now, finding themselves brought in within the terms of a Bill, though they did not create the problem that brought about that Bill, and finding themselves entitled to a pension, they may be inclined to throw aside a position they have already secured and, through laziness or anything else, make themselves portion of the problem this Bill is provided to meet.  I would ask the President <Col N="1860" /> to keep that consideration in mind and to see whether, before the Bill becomes an Act, a clause might not be in that way introduced into the Bill, that would prevent the problem increasing itself by the actions of men of the type I suggest.  It is a matter that may have got his consideration already, but I think something might be done because I do see a possibility of the problem that this Bill is intended to meet increasing itself, simply because a Bill is brought forward.</P>

      <P>I cannot help wishing that Deputy Mulcahy's speech had been delivered at an earlier stage in the Bill, and, if possible, by the President, because it would have tended to correct some false hopes of which he spoke. The title of this Bill is misleading.  It raised hopes in many bosoms that may not be fulfilled.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that for every one satisfied by this Bill four or five will find they have new grievances, because they have been left out of its scope, or cannot get pensions which they deserve.  Both people who did not join the National Army for one reason or another, and people who have not had pre-Truce service, will feel they have been discriminated against.  I know that feeling exists amongst men who joined the National Army in 1922.  There is a feeling amongst them that the State used them when it needed them, and has no use for them now, and anything that tends to stimulate that feeling is. I suggest, a mistake.  I am afraid if there were another appeal for men in the terms of July, 1922, there would not be as ready and prompt a response. These men have left the Army without any great recognition of their services. Psychology has been neglected.  They have not been paraded or thanked, and nothing was done to help to create the feeling that they sustained the Government through a difficult and trying time.  It is because I know the feeling exists and is dangerous to the State that I am speaking now.  I do not suggest you can pension all those men. No country could do it.  This country could not.  It cannot afford it, and I am not suggesting it, but, before it was thought of pensioning anybody, some care should be taken of the reaction of <Col N="1861" /> the pension on the mind of those who would be ruled to be ineligible for them.  I do not think that care was taken in this instance.  The title of the Bill, the fact that a statement made on the introduction and Second Reading did not emphasise that only those with pre-Truce service would come under the Bill&mdash;all those factors are doing harm.  The Bill goes from us now an imperfect measure.  It has been very much improved, in my opinion, by the amendments Deputy Mulcahy moved in Committee, because they have made it less rigid and hide-bound; but it goes from us simply as an indication of an obligation, and I hope when he concludes the debate the President will explain&mdash;I know the reason, but I hope he will explain&mdash;to the world the reason why it is not possible to provide for every man who served the State, and will also express, as only he can, the gratitude of the country to those men who came forward in July, 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I much regret that there should have been any misunderstanding regarding the scope of this measure.  I thought it had been made very clear what we regarded as obligations that should be discharged, and that we faced on the other side of the column obligations which we acknowledged, but in respect of which we were unable to discharge any responsibility. In the cases mentioned by Deputy Cooper I am sure that I express the view of every member of the Dáil when I say we are under a debt of gratitude to the men who served us in that trying period, but I am sure they themselves would admit it was a very short period, and that while they rendered great service that there were many others who did not join the National Army, who perhaps did not join Oglaigh na hEireann previous to the establishment of the National Army, but who, nevertheless, rendered great service to the State during many a long day or month or year, and in respect of whom no charge would be made and no payment accepted.  No acknowledgement of service rendered would be expected by them, or perhaps even graciously received by them.  I think that some of the legislation administered in this country during the <Col N="1862" /> last eight or ten years has, perhaps, done more to sap the citizenship of the country than anything in the experience of the country during the last hundred years.  For example, the British Government, at its departure, made very ample and generous provision for those who had assisted them here, either in the Civil Service, the Police or the Army service.  The British Government is very rich.  It has enormous revenues and ample means at its disposal for providing out of its wealth for those who served.  But even there the British Government does not always provide for those who render Great Britain service either nationally or civically.  And it ought not to be a feature of service in this country that people should feel soured unless ample provision is made for them in subsequent years or in their declining years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment we have a very weighty pensions bill to meet every year not alone in respect of the State, but amongst the local authorities. I understand that there is one local authority at present in the country the liability of which in respect of pensions amounts to one shilling in the £.  That is an enormous liability.  We ought to try to get away from such an undue strain as liabilities of that kind will impose both on the State to-day and on the State of tomorrow, or the State of twenty years hence.  It is not intended, I think, either by the representatives of local authorities or by the representatives here that any such natural moral obligations on the part of the State should not be met; but it must be remembered by those who advocate meeting them that the money might in a great many cases be very, very much better spent. In these particular cases that we are dealing with at the moment I submit that we have made an attempt here, as I have said already in this Dáil, to compensate those who gave pre-Truce service and National Army service, for the interruption that took place in their lives.  For many months past I have had an opportunity of examining cases which have come before me of providing supplementary grants for ex-officers of the Army; and it has been borne in on me that in the vast <Col N="1863" /> majority of those cases&mdash;and in saying this I am not discounting by any means the services that were rendered &mdash;it has been borne in upon me, and it must be apparent to everybody in the State, that while good service was rendered, that service in the majority of cases was not continuous.  Except in a few instances&mdash;few compared with the fifty thousand soldiers who have passed through our hands&mdash;the service could not be regarded as continuous service, or service of such a character that it absorbed the entire time of the individual in question.  If you take, for example, one particular period that we have put down in this measure&mdash;the Easter Week period, where is the country that would give five years' service in respect of pension for that period, five years' purchase of a particular sum to which the individual would be entitled according to his rank?</P>
    <P>In that respect we have attempted to be generous.  But while being generous it is our duty also to be just.  And I do not believe that the State can afford, could possibly afford to include in a measure of this sort all the people who have been mentioned by Deputy Johnson.  And when Deputy Johnson takes his place here in the position which I now occupy he will realise that his popularity will be a great deal diminished as he finds it impossible to meet all the demands that are made upon him; and he will realise that while his heart may be big his purse is very light.</P>

      <P>We have to see that there will be something left in the purse when other people come along to take our places.  I do not mind the unpopularity which is bound to be reached by the Government in connection with these particular cases.  We cannot help it.  It is inevitable that it should occur, that people should be disappointed, that hopes should be raised that they would be entitled to benefit by this measure.  But I say that if Ireland is going to be served only by persons who have got to be pensioned, <Col N="1864" /> then the future must be dark, indeed. We have the right to expect that in respect of services rendered to Ireland, compensation or payment should not be asked for in every case.  If that had been the attitude during the past few years, I think we might not be in the independent position that we are in to-day. I regret very much that the State cannot afford to deal with all the cases.  I admit at once that there are cases which do not come within the scope of this measure, and which in the ordinary way ought to.  But it is one of the disadvantages of legislation that it is impossible to legislate for each individual case.  We have endeavoured by this measure to compensate the vast majority of persons in respect of whom we have a moral obligation.  We have not been able, I believe, to reach the whole of them, but in so far as we have been able to reach them we have done it according to the best of our ability and our capacity to bear the burden.</P>

      <P>I wish to put a question to the President.  Provision is made in this Bill for what he calls meeting a moral obligation without incurring an undue burden.  In regard to those who are excluded from the Bill, might it not be possible that they should get a preference in such temporary Government employment as is frequently available in different parts of the country?  Just as the soldier is now entitled to preference in the matter of employment, these men to whom I refer should be entitled to local temporary positions where they are available. If the President would see his way to make an order in that direction it would meet the cases of men who gave splendid service in the early days, but who were excluded from the Army, either through illness or some other cause of that nature.  I know myself of many who are suffering very keenly because of their connection with the national cause.</P>

There is one point I forgot in winding up, and perhaps I might be <Col N="1865" /> permitted to mention it now&mdash;the cases mentioned by General Mulcahy of those who are in the service.  It is possible some of them may leave the service. We cannot retain them.  They have their rights under this measure.  We thought we were making some provision for them when we included them in the service.  If they leave the service we would then include in the service such people as are mentioned by Deputy O'Doherty or others in respect of whom we have an obligation which we are unable to discharge.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  On the last day I think I made a Second Reading speech on this measure.  This Bill is to enable us to let certain Government property, or to dispose of it, and in cases that are mentioned in the schedule, to authorise that being done in these particular cases.  It is rather urgent it should be done.  I think I mentioned that on the last day.  Otherwise, I think there is nothing contentious about the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in moving the First Reading of this Bill gave us his reasons why it was necessary to bring it in, because of the necessity for dealing with Kehoe Barracks, and one or two other places, with a view to employment, but he did not hint even at the very great importance of this Bill.  What I wish to suggest is that it is a breach of the provisions of the Constitution, and I intend to oppose the Bill to the utmost, unless it is altered in such a way as to remove what I believe to be its very grave defects. We do not know what property, what land, is in the possession of the State as State lands, as distinct from the whole of the lands of the country. There are certain lands which have <Col N="1866" /> been held and used as State property. We do not know their extent, but we know that there are many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of acres.  The Bill proposes to hand over to the Minister for Finance, to do as he likes for 99 years with, those lands, subject only to notification in a very unsatisfactory manner to the Dáil.  If you read the provisions of Article 11 of the Constitution which is referred to in this Bill, you will see that it is required that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All the lands within the territory of the Irish Free State, and also all royalties, belong to the Irish Free State, subject to any trusts, grants, leases, etc., and shall be controlled and administered by the Oireachtas, in accordance with the regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation, but the same shall not nor shall any part thereof be alienated but may in the public interests be from time to time granted by way of lease or license to be worked or enjoyed under the authority and subject to the control of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, to give power to the Minister for Finance to grant leases and issue licences for the working of these lands under the conditions of this Bill is a renunciation by the Oireachtas of the power which the Constitution imposes, to retain such lands as being subject to the control of the Oireachtas. I realise at once that it may be a necessary, quite a desirable thing to lease certain lands for certain uses, but under the Bill the Minister is to make the terms of the leases, and all he is required to do is to notify the Dáil within 14 days that such a lease has been concluded, and it would then require specific action by the Dáil to break that lease.  It does not even say that the lease shall be annulled.  All it says is that: No lease shall be made or granted until the expiration of 14 days after a certain date, that is to say: &ldquo;the first day on which Dáil Eireann shall sit next after the statement in accordance with this section shall have been laid before Dáil Eireann,&rdquo; or if a later date, the first date on which the Seanad shall have a sitting.  I think that the effect of this Bill will be practically a renunciation of the powers of the Oireachtas over lands <Col N="1867" /> the property of Saorstát Eireann.  It is handing over to the Minister too much authority.  I think Ireland has suffered very, very much from the action of Ministers and Kings in handing over State property to private persons. We are confined to 99 years in this, but 99 years is time enough to do a great deal of damage and very much more recent experience of other countries has shown that Ministers have been able to do certain things with State lands, at least minerals or oils, which have caused a great deal of trouble, because they are done by the Ministers and not by the legislature.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to guard very earnestly against the possibilities of any future Minister doing things that he ought not to do, and leaving the control or check, such a doubtful check as is embodied in Section 2. I think, in fact, that the Bill does violate Article 11 of the Constitution, but whether that is so or not, I hope the Dáil will not allow the Bill to pass in its present form.  I suggest that the right method would be to deal with every such lease as is proposed by some modification perhaps of Private Bill legislation, or the lease should be attached to the schedule of the Bill presented, so that we would have the authority to check any faults in any proposal to let the property of the nation to other people.  That will apply, I suggest, to every attempt to let, or lease, or license the use of State property.  Sub-section 3 of Section 2 asks us to agree that the check which the Oireachtas is supposed to hold over such lettings and leasings is to be foregone in the case of certain properties.  We are not even to hold that check with regard to the properties enumerated in the schedule. We are to say, these leases having been agreed to, or to be agreed to, that for six months the Minister may do anything with State property, and that the obligation to submit leases and licences to the Oireachtas will not be imposed.  Surely that is asking too much.  We may have the utmost faith in the wisdom, not to speak of the integrity, of the Minister for Finance, but at least we are supposed to have a certain responsibility, and while the <Col N="1868" /> Constitution says that the Oireachtas must retain control, we are to hand over to the Minister the power which the Oireachtas is supposed to have, and to say that for six months he may do anything he likes with these State lands.  That is revolutionary, if you like.  Sometimes people are twitted with being revolutionary.  I say this is a revolution, a retrogressive revolution. I do not know what these properties enumerated in the schedule may be.  I do not know what their values are, and we do not know what the terms of the lettings may be.  It may be we are handing over to certain syndicates or private individuals property valued for a million pounds at a penny a year for 99 years.  Does any Deputy in the Dáil know whether that is so or not?  We do not, yet we are asked to say that the Minister for Finance is to have power to do that sort of thing for six months without any control whatever.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see that this Bill is not the sort of Bill that should be brought in in any circumstances, certainly not the sort of Bill that should be brought in in the last few days of this half of the session with the intention that it should be rushed through.  I am sure ways can be found for having an agreed Bill in respect of the Kehoe Barracks for instance, which it is presumably intended and which we are assured is to be handed over to somebody to facilitate rehousing&mdash;a very desirable and a very urgent proposition and it can be done, and I am sure it can be done by agreement, but let us have the agreement and let us know the terms.  I do not know whether these other properties referred to in the schedule have to be dealt with so rapidly or so urgently, but even if they have, let us know exactly the terms and the conditions of these leases.  We cannot say that we are retaining authority and control when we are simply handing over the power to a Minister to do as he likes for six months even without reporting.  He need not report the terms of the leases for six months for any property he hands over during this six months. After that he has to report and no licence shall be made or granted until fourteen days after the Dáil has sat. <Col N="1869" /> It does not mean to say that the Dáil shall have sat for fourteen days.  It may be sitting for, say, a day or two, or the Seanad may sit for a day or two when the Dáil is not sitting and then fourteen days after that day the business is done and cannot be abrogated except&mdash;bear this in mind&mdash;at the gravest risk of having to pay heavy compensation.  That I maintain is a breach of the intentions of the Constitution and whether it is so or not I think we should not allow this Bill to pass in this form.  We should not give it a Second Reading.  We should impress upon the Minister the necessity for dealing with this urgent question in a way much more satisfactory and not to give general powers to Ministers for Finance to lease public lands and property subject only to the very anaemic kind of check which is suggested in Section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed, as I always am impressed, by Deputy Johnson's Constitutional point but considering it carefully, as I have had time to, I think it can scarcely be said that this Bill violates the Constitution because these lands are vested in the Oireachtas.  It is impossible for the Oireachtas to control them; we can't have a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad to discuss the terms of a lease.  That would be reducing Parliamentary Government to an absurdity, and surely the normal and constitutional manner for the Oireachtas to act, and the Constitutional method of dealing with the matter is through a Minister appointed by the Oireachtas. I think that is so, and, therefore, I think in this Bill we are conferring a power which is a constitutional power, and which constitutionally we have a right to devolve on the Minister, but I agree with Deputy Johnson that we should be very careful in dealing with public lands and public property. I agree with him in his criticisms of many of the details; though I shall not vote with him on Second Reading, I probably shall vote with him on the Committee Stage if he proposes to delete Sub-section (3) of Section 2.  I do not think his suggestion to refer all these leases to a Private Bill Committee is a really sound one. <Col N="1870" /> We are not very rich in barristers, and I expect that the only barrister who was then in the Dáil would rise to propose a vote of thanks to Deputy Johnson because it would mean that barristers would appear before the Committee, and that the cost of any such transfer of land would be greatly increased. When you are buying land and also when you are leasing land, one of the heaviest items of expenditure is your bill of costs.  If a barrister's fee is to be added on to that bill of costs, and a barrister's work is to be included in that bill of costs, the transfer of State lands would be such an expensive business that you will find very few people willing to take it on.  Now I want to get some information, and I think this is a suitable occasion, as to the policy to be pursued with regard to lands and properties taken over from the British, and especially taken over from the British War Department.  Is it proposed to follow up the Kehoe Barracks experiment?  Are any other barracks to be used for housing in Dublin? If so, I would suggest that the most suitable for the purpose are the Arbour Hill Barracks.  They were built by the British as married quarters, and they consist of small self-contained flats that would require very little money to convert into residential quarters.  I think, if there is any proposal to use any more barracks for the housing problem, these barracks are the most suitable.  I do not know whether Arbour Hill Prison is at the Minister's disposal, whether it has been vacated, or whether he thinks it desirable to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in the schedule of this Bill a reference to a rifle range.  The other point I want to know is, what policy is being pursued in dealing with rifle ranges and the artillery range?  I think there are two artillery ranges which the British Government formerly used for that purpose.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture made a rather cryptic statement when we were dealing with another Bill.  He said he had taken over several hundred acres from the Minister for Defence.  That is not covered by the Bill, and I tried to find out where they were, but I got no information.  The Government might very easily go too far and make a mistake <Col N="1871" /> in getting rid of some of these lands until we have definitely decided to follow the policy of Denmark, and that, I take it, will not be until Deputy Johnson is in office.  These rifle ranges and artillery ranges are absolutely needed if you wish to keep your troops in a state of efficiency.  The money expended there is money well spent, because the straight-shooting soldier eats no more and is three times as valuable as a soldier who shoots badly in the hour of battle, so I hope we may get some idea of whether it is proposed under the Bill to follow the procedure adopted in the case of Clonmel rifle range, which is given away already. Our Army is about the same strength as the British Army was here in 1914, and, therefore, we ought not give up any of the training land that they possessed, for protecting ourselves in war.</P>

      <P>I am not going to deal with the question of these lands that are generally classed under the description, roughly, of &ldquo;handed over by the British.&rdquo;  There are other classes of land which, I think, are very important.  For a variety of reasons a number of ordinary farms have become vested in the State.  Take the case of one that happens to have been brought to my notice, and I know that other Deputies are in very much the same position, the case of land which originally passed into the hands of a certain farmer as a result of a loan he got from the Board of Works.  Gradually, in the course of time the annuities were not paid up.  After a while, as a result of the ordinary legal process, the land was vested in the State.  The land itself is a wretched bit of land, and, perhaps, the valuation of the whole thing would, in the case of some tenants, amount to about £10 a year.  The position at present as the result of Article 11 of the Constitution is this.  The Board of Works, or the State, cannot sell to the tenants, who, I understand, are technically trespassers, or squatters, on the land.  I doubt very much if they could lease the lands to them.  It seems to be absurd that Private Bills should be introduced to deal with such a situation. It is this land especially that I am interested <Col N="1872" /> in.  We all have a certain amount of interest in what generally goes under the high-sounding name of State property, but I would remind Deputies that there is a great quantity of property of the type I mention, and unless legislation is passed quickly there are all sorts of avenues for trouble in different parts of the country.</P>

      <P>The object of the Bill is to secure that when an occasion arises for disposing of State property, the necessary arrangements will be carried out in accordance with the Articles of the Constitution which Deputy Johnson thinks we are invading. It requires that such property should be controlled and administered by the Oireachtas, in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation. If we were to let Kehoe Barracks on a lease to the city of Dublin, obviously it would be an extravagant thing to imagine that we should go in to administer and control it.  It would be both extravagant and useless.  So that in that respect the words &ldquo;control and administer,&rdquo; I think, come in before the lease is made.</P>

The word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; occurs in the Article, and I do not know of anyone who would accept a lease in which you would allow the superior landlord to go in, control and administer property <Col N="1873" /> in respect of which he was going to spend a considerable sum of money. In the other case that is mentioned in the schedule, that is the drill field, I think the Clonmel Corporation is in this position, that they have actually put buildings on the property.  Speaking from recollection, I should say that they got authority to do that from the Minister for Local Government at the time of the existence of the Provisional Government.  At that time the Constitution had not come into law, and no particular system was drawn up regulating the letting or the leasing in that particular case.  A difficulty arises now in respect of the title, which should certainly be amended.  But granted that there is to be a lease, and a lease is mentioned in this Article, I have never heard of a lease which gave the landlord authority to control and administer after the lease had been granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when he makes this regulation under the lease.  Let us take Kehoe Barracks.  In that case an agreement is made in respect of which certain houses are to be erected there, houses for the working classes, of a certain size.  Once they are erected no control can be exercised in respect of them, neither can any administration be exercised. It could not possibly be done in connection with the lease. What the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; means is <Col N="1874" /> its generally accepted meaning, but the Minister for Finance and the Government are not waiving their rights under Article 11 of the Constitution. When the words &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; are mentioned here, although appearing to give certain powers to one individual, that is the term that is used in connection with very much larger property than this.  Some particular Minister must be responsible.  In the case of the Minister for Finance, it is in the Constitution that it is essential that three particular Ministers should be in the Executive.  They are the President, the Vice-President, and the Minister for Finance.  In that case you cannot separate the Minister for Finance. You cannot select any other person in respect of whom the responsibility could be greater than that of the Minister for Finance, so that it is not an individual here; it is the Executive Council. The fact that information is to be given to the two Houses of the Oireachtas is a sufficient guarantee that nothing in the nature of a bad bargain for the State could be made.  Kehoe Barracks has been already dealt with. Those premises mentioned in No. 3 and 4 of the Schedule have been burnt and destroyed.  The re-building would cost the State a very considerable amount of money.  In order to provide for a certain thoroughfare that the city of Dublin requires, some property must be yielded. It is an advantage to the State to yield this property in this particular case. It is not necessary to spend the money in order to put the buildings up.  If they were put up and the particular thoroughfare had to be constructed afterwards, we would have spent so much money and got nothing for it. The other premises&mdash;23, 24 and 25 Pearse Street&mdash;were a recruiting depot for the British, and are of no service to us.  The sooner we let them the better the advantage would be to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a lease in that particular case.  I take it that this particular schedule that has <Col N="1875" /> reference to it would rectify or settle that.  I am sure that if they have been leased it would not be legal unless this measure were passed into law.  There is a very considerable amount of land in Tallaght, and I do not think it will be required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of these premises that have been destroyed, formerly used by the accountants' branch of the post office.  I mentioned that in connection with the thoroughfare required by the city, and I do not know that anybody is willing on that particular site to give way.  If the Government waives its right in respect of that particular property it means a little moving up or down in the case of other properties, which will enable the thoroughfare to be constructed. With regard to the matter mentioned by Major Cooper I think we have too much property, military barracks, fields, and other property.  I do not know that the military authorities have considered the question of rifle ranges, but when the new Minister for Defence takes up duty one of the first matters that will come before him will be what particular properties are necessary to keep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of barracks must be considered in the light of what will be economic, having regard to the fact that this is a very scattered organisation. In Dublin city alone something like twenty different posts have to be maintained day after day.  I do not know whether the barrack that has been mentioned by the Deputy is the same as has been mentioned to me. McKee Barracks have been mentioned to me as barracks which it is more than likely we would be able to let.  In the case of the barracks that the Deputy mentioned, I think there are certain people in occupation of residences there.  I do not know that they are really entitled to them, and I gave instructions some time ago to take up the matter with the British Government. They are, I think, soldiers serving with the British Army at the present <Col N="1876" /> moment, and I think it is unreasonable in a case like that of the city of Dublin, where there is such dreadful congestion, that we should not be able to make that accommodation available for the Corporation.  In one other case where there are married quarters&mdash;Griffith Barracks, I think&mdash; those have been let to some industrial firm which started business here and could not find accommodation for its employees.  Those barracks have been let, but all those things are subject to the passing of this measure.</P>

In any case the disposal of the barracks would have to meet with the approval of the military authorities.  In the case of Kehoe Barracks, the letting there met with the approval of the military authorities, and I take it that they have in mind the defence needs of the moment and any defence needs that may possibly arise.  Military questions and the possibility of attack are, of course, problematical, but they had these matters under consideration, I am sure, when <Col N="1878" /> they recommended us to dispose of those barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with the remarks I made under this sub-head last night, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did not offer us any further information.  According to the Estimates the headquarters offices are costing £108,840; the Metropolitan offices, £459,480, and the Provincial offices just £3,000 less than a million.  I am not making any remarks with regard to the headquarters' offices, because I recognise that they serve the whole Saorstát. But when we come to the Metropolitan offices, and see that they are costing just half a million, and that the post offices in the rest of the country cost roughly a million, we wonder why the Minister did not include the city in his scheme of ruthless economy, as he called it.  He said that the same curtailment was in operation in the city as in the country.  But in the country districts we have had sixty-five offices closed, and I understand it is contemplated to close about twenty more. How many offices have been closed in the metropolitan area?  I understand that the Glasnevin office was closed, and that it is open again.  I have not heard of any other city post office being closed.  I want to know where they have been closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not object to two post offices being in one street, as they may be necessary, but when we have ruthless economy being carried out all over the country, when post offices are situated six Irish miles from each other in the rural districts, why is it absolutely necessary that there should be post offices in Dublin within 150 yards of each other?  If the Minister wants to justify himself in the rural districts he had better do the thing properly.  Here is half a million to be gambled with.  What the Minister has succeeded in saving by his economies in the country districts is very small indeed, and for the sake of that small amount he has created the utmost dissatisfaction.  He has alienated the sympathies of almost all the rural population.  It is these little pinpricks that count.  People ask why the country is not enthusiastic about the Government, why those on the register do not vote at elections, and why some people are becoming Irregulars.  It is <Col N="1880" /> because of this maladministration, this total disregard of the viewpoint of the people of the country districts.  There is no Deputy that I have more respect for than the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I recognise his honesty. I recognise that he is one man who is trying to do things according to his lights, but in this matter his viewpoint is that of a man who has been born and brought up in a town.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will deal with the matter in his own way.  The Minister must be animated by the viewpoint of the townsman&mdash;the town is the world to him and he does not recognise the country districts at all.  It was painful to listen to the Minister last night when he described the services in the country as luxurious and unnecessary. If these words have any application at all they must apply to the towns or the cities.  They certainly do not apply to the country districts.  When the Minister was talking about luxurious and unnecessary services, I think he must have been drawing on his imagination. If the Minister went down the country for a holiday, he would certainly know the inconveniences which the people in the rural districts suffer from.  If some members of his family had to go four or five miles to post a letter, and if he had to pay for every telegram delivered to him; if he was responsible for running a creamery and had to pay for every telegram received, sometimes as many as 20 a day, he would know what it means.  I want to know how the Minister justifies these two votes&mdash;the Metropolitan Vote and the Provincial Vote.  I want to know how many offices have been shut down in the metropolitan area.  The Minister ought to have this information, and I ask for it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey has asked what offices have been closed down in the city.  I want to know what particular reason there is for closing down the Wentworth Place Post Office. That Post Office was next door to Boland's Mills, was right opposite Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, and the Archer Ford-Car people.  There are also <Col N="1881" /> builders' yards and blocks of houses in the district, so that thousands of people were using the office.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us a just reason for closing it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Gorey did not move that this Vote be reduced by £800,000 in order to give Deputies a better opportunity of criticising the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs on account of the manner in which the service is carried on.  The Minister told us that if the letter rates were reduced there would be a loss of £300,000 on stamps alone.  In some country towns the morning delivery varies from 11 o'clock until 12.30 and later.  Some time ago I called the attention of the Minister to the postal service in the village of Glasson. Glasson comprises three islands in the Shannon on which there are 150 or 160 families.  These people received the post three times weekly in the past, but now there is only one delivery.  The postman who went to the islands was in receipt of 30/- a week.  He has now only 7/- weekly on which he is expected to live.  If there is to be economy surely it should not be at the expense of the workers.  I think it is wrong to make such drastic changes.  When postmen with long service are discharged or resign vacancies are not now filled by regular postmen.  Auxiliary postmen are appointed and no matter how long they serve they will not be entitled to any superannuation.  Is it the idea to replace the regular postman by auxiliary men?  Auxiliary postmen are paid about 30/- a week and they work from 6 in the morning until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening.  Surely that is not a satisfactory wage for such work.  It is not owing to the high wages postmen receive that the letter postage is 2d.  There must be something wrong some place else.  I notice that on the headquarter's staff there is a decrease of £7,104.  That saving, no doubt, was effected in wages.  The upkeep of the provincial offices has decreased by £89,350.  Is it the intention of the Minister to provide good postal facilities throughout the country?  In Athlone people who live within five minutes walk from the Post Office do not receive their letters until 1.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> When attention has been called to these matters the cry has been: &ldquo;We must reduce the staff.&rdquo;  The result is that the present staff is not large enough to deal with the work.  I would like to ask the Minister if postmen are engaged in an insured occupation, and if dismissed, or if they resign, will they be entitled, when they cannot find other employment, to unemployment benefit? Are contributions deducted from their wages towards National Health and Unemployment Insurance benefits?  The Minister mentioned that postal facilities were now provided on Good Friday.  I would like to know if postal facilities will be granted to the rural districts on bank holidays?  Do Deputies know the financial loss the stopping of the deliveries on bank holidays has been to the postmen?  Under the British Government the postmen were entitled to the full day's wages for the bank holiday, and if they worked half a day they were entitled to another day's wages.  That is, they were entitled to two days' wages for the holiday.  The Minister made a great saving by knocking off one day's pay for each bank holiday.  In some cases 12/6 was knocked off the wages of a man who was getting £3 17s. 6d. weekly.  That was not enough so the Department had to go further.  In order to make postmen realize that they had a Government of their own, it was necessary to reduce wages so that there might be a saving in the administration of the post office.</P>
    <P>The Minister has closed sixty-five of these sub-offices, and I understand he is expecting to close another twenty. I would like to know what the actual saving is on the closing of these offices. The real victims in my opinion of the closing of these sub-offices are the people who live in the vicinity of them. I would ask the Minister to release the hold he has on these people who are his victims, and again give them the opportunity of having the facilities which they enjoyed hitherto of a sub-post office in their own townlands.  A question was raised yesterday with regard to the delivery of telegrams.  According to the Minister, a charge is put on the delivery of telegrams to persons residing one mile, two miles or <Col N="1883" /> three miles from a post office.  I believe that in some cases the extra charge for the delivery of these telegrams is 2s. 6d.  What I want to know is, does that 2s. 6d. go to the telegraph messenger who delivers the telegram, or to the State.  I mentioned last year on the Post Office Estimate that it was time the price of stamps on letters and postcards was reduced.  In my opinion a penny ought to be sufficient for a stamp on a postcard, but under the present arrangement you must put a three-halfpenny stamp on it.  I wonder is the extra halfpenny due to the fact that a green dye is used now instead of the red one which we were accustomed to when the British were here.  I think that if the price of stamps was reduced that you would have more letters and postcards sent, and that instead of a loss there would be a gain to the Government Exchequer as a result of the change.  Of course I know, too, that the Minister is very fond of the postmen, and that he does not like to have them carrying a big load.  The Minister mentioned yesterday a matter regarding parcels.</P>

      <P>Deputies in the Dáil, representing rural constituencies, if they are to voice the opinions of their constituents must, I think, support the amendment that has been moved by Deputy Gorey.  We all admire the great attempt that has been made by the Minister to try and make ends meet so far as his Department is concerned.  We all know that for over thirty years, since about the year 1887, the institution of which the Minister is now head, never paid.  It never paid when the British were here, but even so, they never attempted to do what the Minister is attempting to do now, and that is, abolish a lot of sub-offices in rural areas.  I think there is very little more that I can add to what has already been said on this matter by other Deputies.  I desire, however, to say that it is most unfair to the rural areas to have all these sub-offices abolished. If that policy were applied all round there would be some grounds for the Minister's action, but in my opinion it is very unfair to penalise one section of the community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons has asked the Minister so many questions that he would require the lives of Methuselah's cat if he were to answer all of them.  I will try to help him by meeting Deputy Gorey and Deputy McKenna in their arguments to a certain extent, because they have not gone closely into the details of this Vote (A2), to which Deputy Gorey has moved a reduction.  I quite sympathise with Deputy Gorey's complaint against the reduction of rural post offices.  The saving effected is not very great.  As far as the sub-postmasters are concerned, the amount is only £5,000, and I think that is hardly commensurate with the amount of inconvenience that is caused.  Deputy Gorey contrasted the conditions in the country with the conditions in the towns, but I think there is one point which he overlooked. It is quite true that the figures are rather startling, and I trust that the Minister will give us a definition as to what is meant by <Col N="1885" /> the &ldquo;metropolitan area.&rdquo;  The metropolitan area, as I understand it, includes not only the City of Dublin but also the townships and even outside the townships in the County Dublin.  What is really an expensive item in this Vote is that the metropolitan offices include a staff of indoor supervising officers, sorting clerks, and telegraphists, etc. There are 942 of them, and only just over 1,000 throughout the rest of the country.  In the metropolitan offices all the telegraph work for the whole country has to be done.  If Deputy Gorey writes a letter to Deputy McKenna, asking him to come to the Dáil to make a speech, that letter goes through Dublin and has to be sorted in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with A1, but with A2, and I am contrasting A2 with A3 (Provincial offices).  There are no telegraphists in A1.  The point I was making was that if Deputy Gorey sends a telegram to Deputy White to Tirconaill, it has to go through Dublin, and has to be handled by the Dublin telegraphists.  In fact, these people in the metropolitan offices, while serving the city and suburban areas of the city, also serve the whole country, because Dublin is a sort of clearinghouse for the whole country. It is quite arguable, of course, that it should not be so, and that there is too much concentration in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be argued, for instance, that the work could be done more expeditiously by having large central telegraph offices in Athlone or Mullingar. That, I say, is a quite arguable point, but under the present system I maintain that that is an altogether exaggerated Vote as regards the metropolitan offices, because these offices, I hold, are doing work for the whole country. The number of sub-postmasters in the city is 150, while the number in the country is 1,985, and in addition there are 58 postmasters in provincial offices. In the metropolitan offices the number of outdoor supervising officers, postmen, messengers, etc., is 1,057, while the number for the provincial offices is just <Col N="1886" /> 6,000.  These figures show that this is a very inflated Vote as far as the metropolitan offices are concerned, because the sorting clerks and telegraphists, who should only work for Dublin alone, are really working for the whole country. That explains why the Vote for the metropolitan offices is so big.  I sympathise with Deputy Gorey in the plea he has put forward against the closing of so many sub-post offices in rural areas, but at the same time I cannot vote for the amendment he has moved, though I did vote with him last night on the motion that the Vote be referred back.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the views expressed by so many Deputies as to the dissatisfaction that has been caused by the closing of so many sub-post offices throughout the country.  I desire to refer to one in particular in the County Kildare.  This sub-post office was in the village of Johnstown Bridge, and its closing has caused great dissatisfaction and inconvenience to the people in the locality served by it.  The result of the closing of that office is this: the poor people drawing the old age pension have to go a distance of from five to six miles to the nearest post office for the purpose of drawing their pensions now.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gorey in regard to this Vote, but I would like to bring before the House another point of view, and that is the inefficient service rendered to the dairying industry of this country in the administration of the postal service. We find it very hard to market our agricultural produce owing to the very bad postal service.  It is three days before a letter posted in England is delivered to the creameries, and that is a very wretched service.  We have complaints from English merchants in regard to the unbusinesslike methods of the managers of the co-operative creameries, but the managers of the creameries are not to blame at all.  It is the postal service that is to blame. Frequently letters are let lie in the sub-post offices for twenty-four hours before they are delivered at the creamery. We certainly find the whole system of the postal service a great hardship <Col N="1887" /> in our rural districts.  In some of the villages the Post Office Department differentiates very much between the marketing of agricultural produce and the buying of English draperies.  Anyone setting up a creamery now, if he wanted to secure an efficient postal service, would be well advised to have his creamery situated in a village where there are draperies.  He would then be pretty sure to have his letters delivered daily, but if he sets up his creamery in the country, he could not rely on getting his English letters twenty-four hours after they had arrived.</P>
      <P>We spent a considerable amount of time passing a Dairy Bill through the Dáil which I am sure will give good results.  We, in the rural districts, wished that there could have been tacked on to it a clause giving us greater postal facilities in marketing the butter that we will produce under this Bill at a higher standard than at present.</P>

      <P>I said yesterday that the Postmaster-General admitted that he employed agents to come up here to the Lobby to hear what Deputies were saying, and I said that this was a most improper action, and the Postmaster-General denied it.  Unfortunately, I had left my copy of the evidence before the Broadcasting Committee behind me, and I could not contradict him at the time, and probably if I did so I would have been ruled out of order.  Now, at page 106 of the evidence given before <Col N="1888" /> the Wireless Broadcasting Committee the Postmaster-General said: &ldquo;It will be within the recollection of the Committee that both Deputy McGarry and Deputy Figgis have uttered a libellous statement against me, which was with drawn and apologised for.  It will also be remembered that I stated here on more than one occasion that the libel originated in the House, and also that I was satisfied the libel originated with those Deputies and was propagated by those Deputies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I never apologised to the P.M.G., and he can have the name of my solicitor, and I will instruct my solicitor to accept a writ for libel any time he likes. But that is not what I want to say in connection with the denial.  Deputy Magennis, at question 862, asked:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Does the P.M.G. say that he had employed agents to discover if slanderous conversations were going on among Members in the Lobby.&rdquo;</P>

That Broadcasting Report has nothing to do with this discussion and nothing to do with the Estimates.  It does not concern, in any way, the policy or administration of the Department of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a personal question as between Deputy McGarry <Col N="1889" /> and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. He made a statement yesterday, and the Minister made another statement.  I think we should let it lie at that.  If Deputy McGarry had consulted me on this question I might have found some opportunity for him, but it serves no good purpose whatever to go into personal matters here.  I thought Deputy McGarry was simply going to withdraw what he said yesterday.</P>

      <P>The point I want to put to the Minister is if the money stopped from postmen and auxiliary postmen is a contribution towards the sum of their unemployment insurance card.  I brought this matter under the notice of the Minister on the Estimates last year, when a number of auxiliary postmen had been reduced to three days a week owing to reduced delivery. <Col N="1890" /> Their wages in some cases ranged from ten shillings per week, and notwithstanding that they could only get work every second day from the Post Office, they were not eligible to draw unemployment insurance benefit.  I would like to know from the Minister when he replies if he has tried to adjust the work these men are performing, or tried to enter into any arrangement with the Minister for Industry and Commerce whereby these men may be allowed to get unemployment insurance benefit for the days they cannot get work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an idea that some such arrangement has been come to, and in this particular case it will be gone into carefully.  I think that that also disposes of the other point with reference to the insurance of postmen. Deputy Cooper disposed of the question of the respective charges in Dublin and the provinces very fully, except, perhaps, he failed to mention one item, and that is the maintenance of the different railway services, and also the cross-channel mail service is included in this particular Vote.  I can assure Deputy Gorey that we do not pay anybody in the metropolitan area, which includes the city and county, for knocking his heels against the wall. The same measure of retrenchment and of hard maximum output is insisted on here as elsewhere.  Only two post offices have been closed in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The work in these offices was insufficient to keep them going and to justify their retention. <Col N="1891" /> In regard to the closing of offices in the country the facts are otherwise to what have been stated.  It would astonish some Deputies if they knew the very meagre output in these offices. I have given facts and figures to Deputies who have protested against the closing of these offices, and when they saw them they agreed that the justification for their retention considering the cost was very little.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another consideration. In many cases we found offices open in close proximity to one another.  Some were opened in days gone by when it was apparently easy to influence British Ministers to do a turn for a district.  You found instances where sub-offices were within half a mile or mile of each other, both of them doing very little.  In regard to Wentworth Place, mentioned by Deputy Myles Keogh, we do not consider that there is sufficient justification for the retention of that office, and I see no reason to alter the decision to close it.  Deputy Lyons has referred to what he alleges to be a worse delivery in certain towns. There are a number of places in which we have to decide whether a morning delivery would suffice for the whole day or whether a morning plus cross-Channel delivery should be combined. In the majority of cases the option of deciding is left to the local people.  Our job is to facilitate the people to the best advantage without undue loss.  We have to take the question of loss into consideration whether we like it or not. In reference to the creameries, we have not, so far as I am aware, made the postal deliveries to creameries any <Col N="1892" /> worse.  Not only that, but we have a big list of creameries at the moment which we hope we will have joined up telephonically in the future.  This extension of the telephone service is going to cost the State something, but we are doing it to help industry.  It is not quite an easy matter to get the Minister for Finance to sanction an experiment of this kind.  Our predecessors, with all their wealth, never did it.  Were it not for the fact that we felt that we had made a case by retrenchment in other directions, we could not do it.  My critics here could not do it.  The big extension of the telephone service was due to the fact that we were able to save in another way.  Everyone here knows, as well as I know, that if we did not cut our cloth to a reasonable limit we would be quickly told about it.  It has been suggested here that if there had been an extension of that cutting we would also have been told about it.  The policy we adopt is to bring the loss on the Post Office to a reasonable limit.  We are approaching that stage, and once we have come to it, and get the Ministry of Finance to permit a grant, we can strike out in useful directions and we will do so. We do not say that because we save in one direction we will not go on in another.  It is quite immaterial to me, personally, whether we lose £600,000 or £1,000,000.  I am merely trying to carry out the wishes of the Dáil and the country, but there are limits within which we will be permitted to spend the nation's money.  I do not know whether we are dealing with the entire Vote here now.  If we are not I am not going to touch the question of telegraphs.</P>

      <P>With regard to the conveyance of mails by rail it seems that this sum of £320,000, though not quite half a million, is a considerable amount of money.  The Minister has said that he has got some reduction on that Estimate. It seems to show £12,000 of a reduction.  But notwithstanding that reduction, I think that this £320,000 is a huge amount for the services that the railways render in the distribution of the mails.  There is no exclusively mail service in this country.  Every mail train is a passenger train.  And the mail train is the fullest passenger train. It is the best service on the line; and it is the train most availed of by passengers. To my mind you do not get a proper return for this huge sum of money.  You do not get value for your money.</P>

      <P>I hardly think that the Deputy realises that every letter that is posted practically, except for local deliveries, which is a small proportion, has to be conveyed by mail train or mail boat.

      <P>£320,000 certainly does look a very large sum, but when one realises that it is one of the biggest items in connection with the distribution of letters, the proportion does not seem to me to be unreasonable.  What Deputy Gorey loses sight of is the fact that the mail trains would not be there running at their present speed were it not for the subsidy that they get from the mail service.</P>

      <P>Still I am not satisfied. Deputy Hewat says that practically every letter has to be carried by rail. It is as cheap to carry one thousand letters as to carry one.  The number of letters carried in the train does not make a scrap of difference.  I still think that this is an exorbitant charge.  The Minister has not satisfied me that it is not, and he has passed it over lightly by saying that it is only 75 per cent. over the pre-war rate.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to criticise, but I desire to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is responsible for the breaking up of new streets within practically six months of their being laid by the local councils. Can it not be arranged that when <Col N="1896" /> a new street is about to be put down the Engineer of the Post Office should inform the local authorities that he wishes to lay mains there?  I know a street in Dublin that cost £20,000 to make within the last twelve months; and within the last three months it has been torn up by the postal authorities. Of course they will say that it was necessary to lay the mains.  But the street will never be the same again. The same thing happens in the city with regard to new footpaths.  I think there ought to be some working agreement between the engineers of the Councils and the Engineers of the Post Office, and that the Engineer in charge of the Post Office Engineering Department should give some consideration to the expenditure of the money involved &mdash;both the ratepayers' money and the money of the Post Office&mdash;and notify the local council that it is the intention of the Post Office to lay new mains, and that they would like to know when the streets are to be taken up.  I think you will all agree that it is a deplorable thing that a street which it cost £20,000 or £30,000 to lay should be torn up within three months by the Post Office. I think there should be some co-operation between the post office and the municipal authorities.  I want to make the position clear.  I do not want to stop work, but I think the engineer should know when he is going to lay mains twelve months, or at least six months, in advance, and that when he sees the streets being taken up he should not wait until they are almost finished to put in his mains on the side streets, and tear the new street up again.  I think in this case the edge of the footpath could have been taken up, and so avoid spoiling a magnificent street.  The street I am referring to is quite convenient to O'Connell Street.</P>

That is very apparent in this particular case.  I do not know whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or his engineering staff, knew that this work he has undertaken was going to be undertaken at the time when the street was being taken up, but one cannot help being struck by the very deliberate lifting of the pavement.  In one case it is paved and in another case it has been steam-rolled, and made a new road.  It is a very continuous line of new-made road, and it must have cost the city a very considerable sum of money.  It has been so cut up that until it is thoroughly overhauled, and overhauled again, it cannot be put back into the condition in which it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>The MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a considerable lack of enthusiasm that I support this Estimate for my department.  It is not the amount that I put up from my department to the Ministry of Finance, and it was cut down in practically every detail without consultation with me.  It is an amount to my mind that is not sufficient; it is an amount at any rate that from my experience of the department, I would not consider sufficient, especially for fishery development. In fact, it is scarcely possible with this amount to carry on the old fishery functions of the Congested Districts Board and the Department of Agriculture.  I consider it a very parsimonious estimate and I feel that it can only be supported on the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread.  From my point of view, I have a certain amount of reason for being satisfied that before the 31st March, 1925, a supplementary estimate will have to be introduced for fishery development.  It might be well to explain the items from the point of view possibly of obviating discussion or perhaps giving enlightenment to Deputies <Col N="1900" /> in order to enable them to discuss the matter from a better angle, under the different sub-heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head A deals with salaries, wages and allowances, and there is there shown an increase in last year's estimate of £1,216.  That increase is due entirely to the fact that the Rural Industries Branch of the Congested Districts Board has since the last estimate been transferred to my Department. That money covers the salaries of the persons who are dealing with that branch.  Under sub-head B, there is an increase of £500 for travelling expenses. That is provided to meet the increased cost from the point of view of additional superintending staffs. There were two official superintendents recently appointed.  The increase under sub-head C hardly calls for any comment; it is only £15, that is for incidental expenses and is to meet occasional law costs and the supplying of official publications to our superintendents in the country.  Sub-head D calls for no comment.  Sub-head E is the important sub-head of the Vote&mdash;£35,777.  This is very much less than the amount I asked for.  This money is utilised for carrying on various schemes including certain fish-curing, boat building and repairing, loans to fishermen, a small amount for the dredging of fishery harbours, supplying of nets and gear to the fishermen from our stores, insuring motor boats against total loss, instructing fishermen in motor driving, fish-curing and so forth, and from the inland fishery point of view, grants to boards of conservators and the management of certain fisheries that are owned by the State, and for the construction and maintenance of certain salmon hatcheries and for scientific investigation. For fish curing there is a sum of £4,000 out of that £35,777.  That is we might cure, say a sample of 1,000 barrels of mackerel at certain selected stations in Galway and Cork for sale under an official brand, a Government brand, in the United States.  We would require to purchase salt and barrels and to employ curers.  The fish would be cured in the best Norwegian style and would be sold in one of the American ports, Boston or New York, under the supervision <Col N="1901" /> of the Saorstát Trade Representative. The same thing more or less would apply to the herring fishery and the places, in that case, would be Howth and Downing's Bay.  Another matter is the development of home markets.  That would apply to the employment of certain organisers of the retail fish trade for demonstrations by skilled retail salesmen in certain centres and for a certain amount of propaganda in regard to the food value of fish in order to encourage the eating of more fish.  A sum of £750 is allowed for that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the purchase and sale of fishery requisites there are places, especially along the west coast, where it is necessary to have stocks of salt, barrels, and so on, in case of glut of fish, in order that these may not have to be thrown into the sea.</P>
    <P>If they cannot be utilised by the local curers, who are mostly in a small way of business, we think it a good proposition to have these things ready for such emergencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give any information as to the amount for requisites?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £3,500.  For building and repairing boats there is £1,500.  There are two boat-yards maintained by the Ministry&mdash;one in Donegal and one in Galway.  These are also used for vocational instruction, and the same thing applies to motor engines and repairs, also in Donegal and Galway.  The repairs would be £400 in addition to the £1,500 for building and repairing boats.  Then there is an item of experimental fisheries, also in sub-head E, for which we are allowed £500. That is, to a great extent, being used for experiments with a view to the destruction of dog fish, which have become in many places a serious pest to fishermen from the point of view of destruction of nets, and it also applies to certain experiments with regard to the utilisation of a larger-mesh net.  This Sub-head E also involves a subsidy to the Aran-Galway steamship, of £1,100. In connection with the insurance of motor boats, the Ministry insures all the motor and steam vessels mortgaged, <Col N="1902" /> that is boats that are bought as a result of loans from the Department, or taken from the stock of boats that we have in hand.  The Ministry pays half the insurance on these boats, and the borrower pays the other half.  In some cases latterly, owing to the effect of the slump, the Ministry fell in for the payment of the greater part of the borrowers' end of the insurance.  This amounts to £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what the value of the boats is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think £140,000 would be approximately the value.  In connection with vocational instruction as distinct from what I mentioned already with regard to the maintenance of boat-building yards at Donegal and Galway, there is an item of £2,500 for vocational instruction.  Apprentices are taught boat-building at these two yards and also we subsidise two industrial schools, one at Killybegs and the other at Baltimore.  Fishermen are taught motor driving at Galway motor school, which is maintained by the Ministry, and certain occasional instruction is given in methods of fishing and curing.  These are, as a rule, temporary persons employed for a specific purpose for a period.  Under that sub-head also comes the sum of £1,500 for the dredging of fishery harbours.  As a matter of fact, this is the one item in the Vote submitted by us that was increased by the Ministry of Finance. We only asked for £1,000.  This, of course, is written off from the point of view of the Appropriations in Aid of the Commissioners of Public Works, and it is really not giving us anything. The next item is the Loan Fund.  I will mention what the figures are and come back to that afterwards, because this is a thing on which I feel rather keenly.  A sum of £5,000 is set off for loans, as against, I think, £15,000 that we asked for.  There also comes under this head scientific investigation of the sea.  There is an international arrangement by which we, as one member of the maritime States of Western Europe, take part in certain experiments of sea investigation.  That Body is called the International Council for the Investigation of the Sea.  All these countries <Col N="1903" /> do a certain amount of work and we contribute our little part.  We benefit by what the others have done, and we contribute our share to the general work.  We get benefit from the general work of this Council.  They investigate temperature at different points, the salinity that prevails, the fish food and other matters like that. That is important because these things govern the prevalence of the fish shoals.  We had an item down here that was struck off.  It was an item of £5,000 which we asked for a certain proposition in the development of steam trawling.  As a matter of fact, the scheme never developed.  It was merely verbal.  We failed to get any proposition in writing from the source which first brought the scheme before us.  I know that latterly certain Tirconnail people are arranging to charter those trawlers that belong to the Ministry of Defence with a view to getting into this work, so that, therefore, nothing falls on our Vote.  It was struck out by the Ministry of Finance, and it is not now necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the item for the upkeep of certain curing stations and shell fish development, £1,477.  There are persons all round the coast who are paid in many cases the munificent sum of £3 a year, or £4, or £5 a year, for supplying information to the Department of catches, and so on.  There are certain curing stations then that have to be kept by the Government. Statistics amount to £600.  The upkeep of certain stations which are the property of the Ministry, or are kept up by the Ministry, amounts to £750, and there is an item of £250 for shell fish development.  That is chiefly the protection of the mussel beds, and a certain amount of investigation with regard to mussels and oysters.  Under that head also comes certain items with regard to inland fisheries.  There is £6,000 which is a grant distributed amongst the different boards of conservators in the Saorstát for fishery protection.  This is utilised by the boards of conservators to pay their staffs of bailiffs and for general administration. There is the sum of £1,500 for the maintenance and improvement <Col N="1904" /> of hatcheries.  There is one hatchery which was taken over more or less as an obligation or an arrangement. That is the hatchery at Lismore and on this is spent £500.  That sum has been given each year for a number of years to the Lismore hatchery.  They supply ova and fry generally through the country at our request.  There is a sum of £1,250 for the management and development of fishery rights. That embodies the management of the Owenea River which was the property of the Congested Districts Board. That has been transferred to us now for management.  We pay the bailiff staff there, and the manager of the fishery and there are some others that are coming over to us in Mayo&mdash;there is the Burrishoole and a few other smaller ones in the County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Then there is a further sum of £600 for scientific investigation.  The greater part of that really will be utilised to make experiments this year in the Owenea River, experiments that we hope to be beneficial to other rivers throughout the country.  We hope to set up a certain type of trap at the mouth where salmon coming in will be noted and by which we will know the number of spawning fish that will be required to stock a stream.  Those going out will be marked to note their habits from the point of view of their return and from the point of view of their growth from the time they go out to sea until they come back to us as they usually do to the river from which they go.</P>
    <P>Now, on the question of the Loans, I have just a word to say.  That item covers practically all the £35,777.  The curtailment of the loans, is, I think, a very serious matter and I hope, after certain conversations that I had with the President and the Minister for Finance even since he was in hospital, that the loans will be increased during this year.  The loans are very serious from the point of view of the fishermen. These men for some years past wore out their gear in what might be called a vain effort in fruitless fishing. They are now faced with a situation where there is a heavy load of debt on their shoulders, and though the markets are improving they have no gear <Col N="1905" /> with which to fish.  And the markets are actually improving now.  Mackerel and herring fisheries are improving within the last four or five months.  I believe that the granting of loans now is a good economic proposition.  That has been proved in Howth and in Arklow last year.  The granting of loans will enable these men not only to pay back the loans now but will help them to pay off their debts to the State and at the same time maintain their families.  I admit that the arrears on the outstanding loans are high.  The outstanding loans are £130,000 and on these there are outstanding arrears of £30,000.  But after all certain arrangements have been made, for instance, for the farming community with regard to their arrears during a number of bad years, and the farmers had no worse years from the agricultural point of view than the fishermen had from their point of view.  Anyhow, if there is any chance of getting back for the State that £130,000 or £140,000, it is by enabling these men to fish and equip their boats.  This can only be done by giving them further loans on approved security.  We insist on approved security.  We will also consider our information about these particular individuals who apply for a loan, their industry and so on, and whether it is such as to warrant the giving of a loan.  We think that the giving of these loans will recoup the State rather than be a loss.  This particular problem of outstanding loans is not confined to An Saorstát or to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is only three or four weeks ago that the British Treasury loosed their purse strings and made £150,000 available to the Scottish Fishery Board to supply gear and nets to the fishermen, who were down and out owing to the bad years they passed through.  After all, if that can be done for Scotland, we feel that it is only right that the same privilege should be given to the Irish fishermen.  The figure in the estimate is £35,777.  The fact is that that is not the amount at all.  £5,000 is the amount that is reckoned that we get back on outstanding loans during the year.  But it really means that we get nil.  We get nothing except we get it in advance.  It is reckoned that we get back £5,000, and in other ways it is <Col N="1906" /> expected that there will be got back in all during the year £13,100, so that the net estimate for fishery development is only £22,677.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F deals with rural industries. The estimate under that sub-head last year was £14,000.  The industries were only transferred to the Department on the abolition of the C.D.B. by the Land Commission Act of 1923, which came into operation about the end of July of that year.  The cost of the schemes between the beginning of the financial year and, say, the 1st August, was met out of the funds of the C.D.B.  This year the entire service has to be provided for out of this vote.  That explains the increase.  The estimate for rural industries provides for the salaries and travelling expenses of the teaching staff at the different classes which are held on the southwestern and western seaboard.  Salaries, with bonus, amount to £11,200, and travelling expenses to £800.  The upkeep of premises and purchase of plant amount to £2,500.  The big item is the purchase of materials for sale. That amounts to £9,000, but the amount is mostly got back on re-sale of the material to the workers.  We purchase the raw material in bulk for all the classes, and it is served out to the workers.  Then, when they sell the manufactured article, we are recouped. There is from that a return of £12,100. The total sum in the estimate is £24,500, and, allowing for the £12,100 returned, it means that £12,400 is really expended.</P>
    <P>Item G deals with our old friend, the fishery cruiser.  The estimate this year is £500 less than it was last year.  That is because there will not be such a big overhaul.</P>

      <P>I do not think it will be necessary to have the cruiser overhauled to that extent this year at all. As the question has frequently been raised in the Dáil, I should say that the need for at least one further cruiser&mdash; from the point of view of necessity, I should really say two cruisers&mdash;grows. The British and Scotch fishermen were the chief offenders.  You now have <Col N="1907" /> them supplemented in their offences by the Belgians and the French.  They are poaching in our territorial waters, and one boat is absolutely incapable&mdash;no matter how hard the officers and crew work&mdash;of dealing effectively with illegal trawling and with the general infringement of our laws regarding territorial waters, whether it be trawling or fishing for lobster.  I feel that until finance provides for our getting at least one other cruiser, our fishing beds cannot be properly protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering whether the Minister would support a motion to send this Vote back for re-consideration. I gather that he, at least, is dissatisfied with the amount of the Estimate.  The Minister who is responsible to the Dáil for the administration of this Department, feels that he cannot administer it to the satisfaction of the Dáil, certainly not to the satisfaction of the industry, and not to his own satisfaction, on the sum that has been allocated by the Minister for Finance.  If the Dáil decide that this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration, I think it might be gratifying to the Minister, and would, perhaps, induce the Finance Department to accept, as an instruction from the Dáil, the view that there must be an increase in this Vote.  We have heard very often from all sides here how important this fishing industry is, and how much more important it should be to the country's prosperity.  When we are told by the Minister responsible for the Department&mdash;and he is directly responsible to the Dáil&mdash;that he cannot do the work, according to his judgment of what is necessary, on the money that is provided, it seems to me that we are almost obliged to tell the Minister that he is to go on on short commons, or to tell the Minister for Finance that we are not satisfied with this provision.  I think, before deciding to move that this Vote be referred back, I would like to have the views of the Minister himself.  He might say that we would not be doing him a kindness, that it might mean the resignation of the Executive Council, and that there would be further delay in getting <Col N="1908" /> even the £56,318.  Perhaps he would advise that we should not take that drastic step at this moment.  But I thoroughly believe that the majority of the House would agree to refer this Vote back for re-consideration, with a view to an increase, inasmuch as nearly every Deputy has said, at one time or another, that this industry should be fostered.</P>
      <P>The fostering of fisheries is a matter which cannot be done by private enterprise.  You might build boats or equip boats by private enterprise, but, unless you hand over the inland waters and the territorial waters beyond the coast line to private enterprise, it will inevitably be a matter for the State. The fishery industry is one that must, in the nature of things, be very largely fostered by the State, inasmuch as it involves very largely a common risk; that it is a kind of natural gamble, that you cannot foresee the chances or estimate the value of those chances, and that if the industry is valuable to the country there should be some share of the risk by all the citizens.  That matter was discussed, I think, in what ought to have been a celebrated Report of the Dáil Commission, but was not celebrated.  Nevertheless, some day it may be looked upon as having a certain value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support the Minister's plea in regard to loans for fishermen. It cannot be said, I think with any accuracy or fairness, that fishermen have been negligent, when times allowed them, to pay back their loans.  As I say, fishing, especially herring and mackerel fishing, is a risk to the best fishermen.  No matter how good the fisherman he cannot with certainty say that he is going to have a successful season.  We have not yet mastered the laws by which fish of any kind, especially migratory fish, come and go in their season.  We do not know what their season is.  We only know that for a few years perhaps there may be a regular fishing and then a sudden stop that nobody can account for or give an explanation of.  That is not peculiar to Irish fishing.  It is the same everywhere.  But the fact that fishermen have been assisted by loans in the past, that there has been a series <Col N="1909" /> of bad years, and that they have got into arrears, is not sufficient to justify us in refusing to assist them to make up for those bad years by the chance of good years.  If you have fishermen regularly working and taking a fair amount of risk in doubtful weather over a series of years they will make good.  But the bad year must be taken with the good, and the State must come to their assistance in the bad years.  I believe that is inevitable in the fishing industry, especially in a fishing industry which has not been thoroughly established, with a certain market.  I hope that the Minister's representations to the Finance Department will be successful and that he will be put in a position to assist fishermen to live throughout the year and to pay off the outstanding debts. Unless they are well equipped they cannot catch the fish, and if they cannot catch the fish they cannot pay off the loans.  I hope, as I say, that the Minister's pressure will have an effect.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister if he has used his good offices with the other Departments in regard to certain fishermen who cannot re-equip their boats because the State will not repay its debts to them.  The Minister probably is aware that in the neighbourhood of Valentia and Cahirciveen there are several men who have spent time&mdash;lost time as a matter of fact&mdash;in carrying troops and munitions from one place to the other.  They cannot get their money, and because they cannot get their money they cannot equip their boats for this season.  That means that the Defence Department is destroying the chances of fishermen making a living and enabling them to do the work which is necessary to be done during the season.  I hope the Minister will tell us the reason&mdash;if he can&mdash;why these accounts have not been paid.  He may have had explanations.  I am sure he has made representations, because he happens to be a Deputy from that part of the country, and in his, shall I say, advantageous position as Minister for Fisheries, knowing the need, I am sure he was able to make the earliest representations to the Department responsible. Perhaps he will tell us what excuse has been made for not paying these men what is due to them.  During <Col N="1910" /> the last few days I have had several letters from his constituency urging that these accounts should be paid, and I hope the Minister will be able to say something that will compel&mdash;if anything can compel&mdash;the Department concerned to dislodge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  I know that there are fishermen in the adjoining township of Howth who would be glad to have the assistance which the loans that have been referred to would give them to carry on their work.  I want to ask the Minister to make himself familiar with the demand that was made from Dun Laoghaire in regard to the establishment of a fishing station there.  A report has been received in respect of this matter from the Department of Public Works.  They say that the pier is not suitable for the establishment of a fishing station.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should have enquiries made as to the suitability from his point of view of Dun Laoghaire Pier as a curing station and then confer with the Department for Public Works and find out, if he can, whether anything might be done in this respect.  It is probably a matter for a technician, but the people in Dun Laoghaire who for years have seen boats of one kind or another moored where they suggest should be a curing station cannot understand the statement that it is not a fit place alongside which to moor boats.  I would like to ask the Minister if he would take that matter into consideration and consult with the people concerned in that part of County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he has done for more than a year the Minister has again insisted on the necessity of having additional protection for fisheries on the coast by having new cruisers.  I think it is generally admitted that one boat is entirely insufficient to do the work.  If the fisheries are to be protected, and if Irish fishermen are to get the benefit of the fisheries, there must be some assistance given in that direction.  I do not think there is any expenditure which would be more nationally profitable than well directed expenditure on fisheries.  If the Minister will give <Col N="1911" /> me the hint I will be very pleased to move that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>The Dáil is getting rather tired.  I may say that we are all looking forward, I take it, with impatience to any criticism of the Estimates which is going to prolong the agony.  In criticising the Ministry of Fisheries, therefore, perhaps the Dáil will pardon me for taking a rather wide view of the question.  The Minister for Fisheries is an Extern Minister, a law unto himself until any critcism is raised, and then he is repudiated by the Executive Council.  I think this Vote corresponds somewhat to the College of Science and I criticise it in that sense.  We were told recently that the College of Science should never have been established.  I rather take the same view of the Ministry of Fisheries.</P>

      <P>Consequently the Minister, not in a personal sense, but as Minister for Fisheries.  We have listened with interest to the Minister excusing, or explaining if you wish, the very large expenditure of £56,318 on this vote.  His explanation largely was that a lot of the money is spent on education.  If so, I commend it to the Ministry of Education.  I do not think it is beyond the power of the Minister for Education to teach all that is necessary in connection with fishing.  He seems to have a wide experience of educational matters.  Why this multiplication of educational establishments? The main criticism I have of this vote, and not only this vote, but of the estimates generally, is that we are placing an unbearable burden of taxation on the people of this country, who are getting relatively no value for the money that is being spent.  That applies to the Ministry of Fisheries.  I think it equally applies to a great many of the other votes.  Why I say that now is that I prefaced my remarks by saying that the Dáil was getting tired, and that perhaps this is the last chance I will have of treating the estimates in a general way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be plenty more chances, but I want a rest as well as other Deputies.  Perhaps, I am looking at the matter from a selfish point of view, but it is the usual way to look at these things.  Following the Minister's statement we had very rightly and properly criticisms by Deputy Johnson.  Deputy Johnson takes the line that this vote is only for £56,000, and that we should make it double the money.  Of course, that is a very pleasant way of looking at things.  I take it, however, that the necessary education as regards fishing might be economically transferred to some other Department, for instance, the Ministry of Education.  I think that Deputy Johnson and also the Minister for Fisheries, would lead the Dáil to believe that the fishermen along the coast are a very simple body of men, who follow a strenuous occupation, and are suffering from hard times, and that, apparently, the industry is one which cannot survive unless it is taken under the parental wing of the Minister for Fisheries.</P>
      <P>As far as fishing around the coast is concerned my experience of it is that the fishermen are not dependent on it. They go out fishing if it is a fine day, and they stop at home if it is a bad day.  They have little farms and other industries which they run concurrently with their fishing work.  I do not think the fishing round the coast is a wholetime occupation except in the larger boats which go out long distances and trawl.  What is called home fishing, or, fishing near the shore is not a wholetime occupation.  I make a present of that to the Minister for Fisheries.  When the men go further afield fishing is an enterprise that can be carried on only by private enterprise. In other words, the trawling industry is not confined to the home coast and is not carried on within the three-mile limit.  It is an industry precarious, if you will, profitable at times, and unprofitable at others.  If you wish to single out that as something that is peculiar to fisheries, I think the Dáil will agree that somewhat similar conditions prevail in the carrying on of any industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> The Minister says he wants loans, but he is not very encouraging as regards these loans for he says they are £30,000 in arrear out of £130,000.  I am not adverse to loans properly handled but I do say as regards any Ministry that the service of loans is a bad thing, and bad as regards this House as far as political influences are concerned.  Loans do not always get into the hands of the right people.  I do not say that the Minister would be guilty of any political bias, but I say that in spite of him loans would not always necessarily be used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The question of Dun Laoghaire Harbour was mentioned.  We heard, in another place, the other day that Dun Laoghaire is not an industrial harbour. I know that in old times the Commissioners refused to allow a crane to be put up there for coal vessels because coal might dirty the Harbour.  Is it likely we are going to allow stinking fish to be cured in our national harbour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a secret?  I think not.  I think Dun Laoghaire harbour is preserved in its amenities for the purpose of making a good impression upon our American visitors. I am certain that if a crane working on the quay would be too much for those amenities of civilisation, a fishing station at the end of the Pier would not be acceptable to the ladies who walk the Pier on Sunday afternoons. I say what we are suffering from in this House is want of co-operation among the opposition.  If we are to secure economies that are needful I am afraid a more effective opposition in some of these things will be necessary. At all events I venture to say that this luxury of what I might call fishery experts is very good in its way, but in my judgement it ought to wait on prosperity and when they have something less than 5/- in the £ income tax.  All those luxuries of experimental science put before this House, I think, must of necessity wait until we are able to pay our way more effectively than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> Deputy Johnson made the point that one fishery cruiser is not enough.  I say it is not enough and I say that one could not possibly protect the coast but I equally say if you had two or more you could not protect the coast. That is a big defence matter which requires a great deal more consideration than the haphazard putting on of an additional cruiser.  The whole question is bound up in a larger measure than could be touched on in this sort of way.  As far as I am concerned, I do not make any personal accusation against the Minister for Fisheries, but I say his Ministry is a farce.</P>

      <P>I had absolutely no intention of speaking on this Fisheries Vote until this morning.  I got a letter this morning which I ask permission to read, and I feel that if I am going to read this I must make a few remarks in connection with it.  I think the Minister for Fisheries has been very badly treated by the Ministry of Finance. I hold no brief for the Ministry of Fisheries, but I think it is not getting a fair chance.  The Minister told us here some time ago the trawlers that were held up and arrested for fishing within the three-mile limit could not be proceeded against because of the decision of the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the Minister's fault.  Let us be just.  Trawlers were arrested inside the three-mile limit, but they were not prosecuted simply because the Attorney-General decided they could not.  Now, this letter which came to me this morning is from the Aran Islands, Galway, and it is dated the 20th July.  It states that there have been trawlers within the three-mile limit and almost right up to the shore of the Aran Islands in the last two weeks.  It states further that fishing-boats have to stay in for fear of losing their fishing-nets, and that a lot of boats got their nets damaged; that the shoals of fish coming in have been broken up by the trawlers, which are making a base of Aran Island, and coming in on the roadstead every evening, and then clearing away before dawn.  The letter continues that if something is not done in the near future the poor fishermen will have to clear out or die of starvation, which <Col N="1915" /> they are on the brink of at the present time.  I will read the letter, though it is very difficult to read.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the discussion on this vote at all, but for the fact that I was struck very forcibly by the Minister's statement, which was to the effect that his whole attention was devoted to Galway and Donegal.  I think he forgot about the east coast of Ireland altogether, and I rise now to bring to his attention the serious depredations that are being committed day after day along the east coast, especially in that portion of it from which I come myself.  It is very well known that a good deal of illegal trawling is being done in Dundalk Bay, and from that as far as Balbriggan. <Col N="1916" /> I would back up the Minister as far as his Department is concerned in his endeavour to get an additional sum of money from the Minister for Finance to enable him to provide more patrol boats to look after our fisheries. If the inroads which are being made at present on our fisheries are allowed to go on, it will be a sad day, I believe, for the fishing industry in this country, because all the breeding places will be destroyed, and there will be no fish to be got in Irish waters at all.  I think it was Deputy Hewat who said that fishermen, as a rule, were not dependent on the fruits of their fishing.  I know a considerable number of fishermen in my own locality, and they are absolutely dependent on the earnings which the fishing brings them in.  They have no land, and I have known these people to be absolutely hungry on many occasions because of the dearth of fish in the sea and because of the depredations that the trawlers make on the waters they fish in.  These people have not the gear to go off, as Deputy Hewat suggested they should, to fish in foreign waters.  They must earn their livelihood at home, and for that reason I believe, and am convinced, that the Ministry for Finance should place a sum of additional money at the disposal of the Minister for Fisheries so as to enable him to get at least one, or perhaps two, additional boats to protect our Irish fisheries.  There is a great deal of money in the fisheries of this country, and if properly protected and fostered, I believe they will be a great asset to the country, an asset that is well worth preserving and developing.</P>

As far as the amount that is suggested for the inland fisheries is concerned, I was sorry indeed to hear that it was practically blank.  The Minister mentioned that a sum of £6,000 was being allocated to the Board of Fishery Conservators for the protection of fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, also mentioned that a sum of £1,500 was allocated for the improvement of the hatcheries in the Saorstát.  Any person who will go to the trouble of averaging these figures will find that the amount is not enough.  It is quite inadequate and insufficient for the purpose for which it is allocated.  I come from a county which has lakes that are the most celebrated in Ireland, and at the present time, as far as the Minister for Fisheries is concerned, the amount spent on them is absolutely nil.  There is no money paid to any person there, that I am aware of, for the purpose of protection.  Tens of thousands of trout come up the river in the spawning season, and in the past years none of them practically ever returned.  Persons go out at night with a light and a spear and take the fish out of the river and destroy them.  The fish are killed in hundreds, and there is nothing to prevent the wholesale destruction which is going on at present.  I am aware that the Civic Guard have been asked to do this work of protection.  While I have pleasure in paying the highest possible tribute to the Civic Guards for the work they have done, I must say that this is work they are not able to do, because these rivers are out in country districts and they would want to be on duty all night on the banks of the rivers if they were to prevent the destruction that is going on.  It is during the night that all the destruction is done.  I am not blaming the Minister for Fisheries for any neglect on his part, but I am blaming the conditions by reason of which he is not supplied with sufficient money to give him a chance of developing the industry that is there in Westmeath.  Owing to the endeavours of some local people, large numbers of young fish have been hatched and put into the lakes, and already the results of that have been shown during the past year, when the fishing has been better than ever it was before.  Large numbers of trout were caught during the spring.  If I were a Deputy on the benches on the opposite side of the Dáil, I would, as a protest against the amount supplied to the Minister for Fisheries, agree to having this Vote referred back. <Col N="1918" /> Deputy Johnson suggested that the Minister should agree to refer it back and if he does it will not necessitate a division.  I certainly would like to see a much larger sum of money supplied to the Minister, because I have no doubt that if additional money is provided for protection purposes on our rivers it will come back a hundred thousand-fold to us.  These fish cost practically nothing to hatch.  They could be turned into the lakes in tens of thousands, and in years to come they would bring back their cost to the nation many times over.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister might say what are his expectations with regard to the increased amount he may expect from the Minister for Finance for this very important work.</P>

It was only put into my hands about a half-an-hour ago, and several Deputies to whom I have shown it will, I think, agree that it was rather difficult to read.  The point of the letter is this, that there are several foreign trawlers fishing inside the three-mile limit on the west coast of Ireland.  The matter has been reported time after time, and up to some time ago the Minister for Fisheries would not be allowed by the Attorney-General to prosecute foreign trawlers fishing inside the three-mile limit. Now they are fishing inside that limit. They come in at night, and go out in the morning, and there is nobody to prevent them doing so.  The Minister for Fisheries has only one patrol boat. That boat has to come to Dun Laoghaire and spend a week there coaling and getting in provisions.  I think that the fishing industry in this country should be regarded as being just as important as, say, the agricultural industry. As a matter of fact, I think, if it were gone into properly, fisheries would be a more important industry than agriculture.  Deputy Gorey would not agree with that.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear <Col N="1919" /> that.  I suppose some Deputies will ask what do I know about fisheries.  I know nothing.  I have, however, been talking to several people who know a good deal about them, and I am assured that some of the most valuable fishing grounds in Western Europe are off the coast of Ireland, and that the most valuable spawning grounds are off Carnsore Point.  The British Government realised that and fixed the limit at twelve miles, inside which British and Irish ships can go.  These foreign trawlers use a trawl which takes up fry and everything.  The Minister is not given power to protect the fisheries of this country, and if he is not given that power what is the good of having a Ministry of Fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are baiting him, calling him this, that and the other, and saying that he is not doing his work, but how can he do his work if he has to protect the whole coast of Ireland with one boat? My information is that the shoals coming in along the western coast have been smashed and driven away by foreign trawlers in sight of the coast. I do not know why fisheries are being singled out as the Department that cannot get any money.  I do not see why there should not be patrol boats here and there around the coast, and why there should not be money provided for watchers who can sight these trawlers within three miles.  I hear that the Civic Guard is supposed to do that.  What could the Civic Guard do when a trawler is three miles out&mdash;whistle and they will come in? There is absolutely no means by which an attempt could be made to catch people who trespass inside the three-miles limit.  With regard to inland fisheries, I suppose the Civic Guard, if they knew how, could possibly do it; but with the sea fisheries there must be some attempt made to give the Minister instruments by which he can carry out the fishery laws.  I am told on very good authority that the coasts of Ireland yield more fish than those of any other European country, especially with regard to herring, mackerel and other fish.  Still the Minister is expected with one boat to look after the fisheries and prevent pilfering.  I think <Col N="1920" /> the Minister for Finance should be persuaded by the Dáil to give them facilities to prevent pilfering by foreign ships.</P>

      <P>Throughout this debate there has been almost a measure of unanimity in criticism of the Ministry of Finance, with special reference to the Vote under consideration&mdash;the Vote for the Ministry of Fisheries.  It is, of course, an easy thing to criticise the Department which has the responsibility of finding the money.  It requires no particular thought.  When in doubt, curse the Ministry of Finance. We are dealing here with Estimates running to upwards of £30,000,000 which the Minister for Finance has to find, and for the expenditure of which the Minister for Finance has primary responsibility.  We are all, I suppose, in greater or lesser degrees, idealists, and each Minister&mdash;Extern Ministers not excepted&mdash;would, I suppose, like to see the country blossoming like a rose under his wand.  That is natural, and he believes he could do wonders if his Estimates were multiplied by five, by four, by three, or even by two.  That, I suppose, is natural too, but the Minister for Finance has to find the money, and in eking out that money he has to exercise a sense of proportion and try to aim at some kind of proper perspective. Deputy Johnson was rather arch on this question, on the advisability of the Minister for Fisheries moving his Vote of censure, so to speak, on the Minister for Finance, and the Deputy is frequently arch on this subject.  Extern Ministers are to be set at the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have no responsibility for finding the money, and no responsibility for its proper expenditure.  They are only responsible for their own particular Departments, and, with regard to these, they are responsible exclusively to the Dáil.  It is, therefore, good sport, a good way of passing an afternoon, or a couple of hours to set a somewhat piqued and disappointed Minister at the Executive Council, and Deputy Johnson is quite willing to hulloo him on.  There is, of course, the other side of the picture.  I have reminded the Dáil that we are still engaged on discussing Estimates, the total of which <Col N="1921" /> runs to over £30,000,000.  We have had some rather passionate rhetoric from time to time about the inadequacy of this Vote, and about the inadequacy of that Vote.  We have been reminded of the genuine hardship which exists through the country, words of&mdash;I will not say threat, as I do not say it was in any way intended as a threat&mdash;but words of grave warning to the Executive Council were spoken, and, when all is said and done, it comes down definitely to the question of finding the money, which is the primary responsibility of the Minister for Finance and the collective responsibility of the Executive Council.  It would, no doubt, be grand to have the coast dotted with protective trawlers, so that a Civic Guard would not have to whistle for the pirates to come in, as Deputy McGarry suggested.  There, again, it is a question of money, and the Minister for Finance and his officials have to weigh one need against the other, and try to exercise whatever sense of proportion God gave them. The needs are many.  The money is scarce.  The people are poor.  Taxation is high, and you have not here in this country at the moment just all the factors necessary to make the best of credit conditions.  These are the facts, and it is no use just lightly cursing the Ministry of Finance, not that I think it is unnatural, not that I think it is not universal.  I do not suppose that there is a popular Treasury in the world, but let us not lightly assume that if these extern Ministers got their choice the country would be blooming, and that it is all the fault of the Minister for Finance because he does not give them the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that owing to my late arrival I did not hear the statement made by the Minister for Fisheries, but I understand that one of his principal arguments is that he is not getting sufficient money to administer his office.  There is one fact that I am convinced of, and that is, that he is making bad use of what he is getting.  On several occasions I have raised this question of poaching trawlers, both by question and on a notice on the adjournment.  Of course, I got very nice and suavely-worded replies, <Col N="1922" /> but that is the amount of it.  Everyone here who has been listening to me and to the replies the Minister for Fisheries made to my statement must be convinced that no adequate protection is afforded to the fishermen around the Saorstát coast line.  I have already shown to the Dáil that it is an impossibility for one fishery cruiser to protect the Saorstát coast.  There is a fleet of foreign trawlers at the present time operating from Lough Foyle right to the Donegal coast line, on to the Sligo coast, and I told you here a fortnight ago that those fellows are carefully and cautiously watching the local fishermen when they go out to fish, and they spot the place where those hand-line men started their operations.  The next night those foreign pirates or marauders swoop down on this spot, with the names and numbers of their boats covered by tarpaulin, take the whole fish, and, in addition, destroy the fishing.  The result is that the whole of the fishermen around Donegal are in a state of absolute starvation.  They have a small spot of land on the coast line on which they can grow potatoes and oats. Heretofore they were able to supplement that by fishing, and so get a decent living.  The potatoes failed last year, and they got little sympathy from the Government.  The foreign trawlers steal their fish, and thus add to the plight that those unfortunate people are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When some of those trawlers are caught there is no prosecution against them, and the Minister explained that owing to some difficulty or technicality that arose in the Legal Department of the Government, they are not clear whether they have the right to prosecute them or not.  I think they should risk prosecution.  I also drew attention the last day to the case of the captains of two French lobster boats who were caught poaching on the Galway coast and brought before the District Justice.  He fined them £10. Some poor fellow caught making poteen would be fined £50.  During the week-end I was talking to fishermen and they told me that a fleet of those trawlers containing about 11 boats was based in Lough Foyle.  Those fellows are on the same game.  They watch <Col N="1923" /> the local fishermen and go out at night with their numbers and names covered. They swoop on the fish and the poor fishermen watching them can do nothing.  There is no attempt made to cope with them.  The last time this matter was raised by me, Deputy Cooper made a very valuable and practical suggestion.  I commend it to the Minister for Fisheries, and I believe it would not cost a great deal of money. It had reference to the employment of motor boats manned by local crews for the purpose of watching the waters. I have been discussing it with fishermen since.  I am sure if those boats were placed at proper points, those motor boats would be able to cope with those poaching trawlers.  The impunity with which this illegal foreign trawling is, at the present time, conducted is getting beyond the patience of the people, and I would again strongly recommend the Ministry of Fisheries to give serious consideration to the suggestion about the employment of local boats, and to make some endeavour to utilise the money at his disposal, and to give some sort of adequate protection to those poor people, who are robbed by those foreign trawlers, acting with the utmost impunity.  It is a scandal to see those fellows coming down and sailing away with the fish, and I appeal to the Minister that something should be done immediately.</P>

      <P>I learned from the Minister for Justice with surprise and horror that in my absence Deputy Johnson has been promoting a Rodeo. He has been inciting the Minister for Fisheries to leap on the Minister for Finance, wrestle with him, and bring him to the ground under the hope of extracting a fishery cruiser.  That is what I heard.  I do not propose to join him.  I accept the Estimate that this is all that can be allowed.  Taking it on that basis, I want to put to the Government a dilemma which the logical mind of the Minister for Justice saw, but he did not enlighten us or give us any justification for the ineffectual protection of the fisheries.  I can understand the Minister getting all the money he wants, and taking every precaution he wants.  That is an ideal <Col N="1924" /> position, if he could do that.  If, owing to the financial conditions of the country, that is impossible, is not the alternative to say, &ldquo;We cannot protect you at all.  We will give up fishing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These great assets of ours&mdash;these fishing grounds around our coasts&mdash;are so long and so indented that we cannot afford proper protection for them, and therefore we must tell the fishermen: &ldquo;You had better go out of the business and take up some trade on the land.&rdquo; Those are the two logical alternatives. But there is nothing to be said for a protection which every witness agrees is entirely inadequate.  Within twenty miles of Dublin these trawlers are coming in.  And, as a man said to me, they can throw a biscuit on shore at Skerries, they are fishing so close. That is obviously an intensely unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I should like to be sure that the resources of civilisation are not entirely exhausted, even if our money is limited.</P>
      <P>We have inherited the system of protection by one fishery cruiser from the days of the British; we have inherited it from the time when, if it was necessary, the British Navy could be called in to help us, when there were coastguard stations all around the coast from which you could get good official evidence of people trawling.  We are carrying on that system even to these days, and it is just remotely possible that the money might be more helpfully spent in other ways.  I do not pretend to be an expert in this matter.  I made one suggestion in the last debate.  I will now make one other suggestion that will not cost any money.  These men who engage in this illegal trawling make such large profits that they can laugh at fines.  Why not make the punishment imprisonment without the option of a fine?  It will only be effectual when they are caught, but when they are caught it will be a most effective deterrent.  That would not cost anything except the time of the Dáil, and it would be something to help the fishermen.  They would feel that there was more concern for their fate than they feel that there is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, leaving the sea, where I am not very much at home, I will come in to the land, come to the inland fisheries. <Col N="1925" /> I want to support Deputy Shaw's plea for a greater cultivation of our inland fisheries, because our inland fisheries can be made a more valuable asset and made an enormous asset of the country. They are an enormous asset of Scotland, and they are an enormous asset of Norway; and they ought to be an enormous asset of Ireland.  Of course, within the last five years everything has gone.  Poaching has been carried on practically without any check at all.  My own experience of my own river is that the Gárda Síochána are doing their very best, and are going out at night to stop poaching, and the District Justices are doing their very best by imposing very heavy penalties when poachers are caught. But more is needed, because people do not realise how valuable these fisheries are.  We want to develop our tourist traffic more than anything, and the fisherman is the most valuable tourist you can get.  He spends money on his boatmen and on his lodging-house; he is usually a man of some means, able to pay well for anything he wants, and he is usually a sportsman who gets on very well with the people.  I have a fishery which I let every year.  Last year I could not get anybody to take it.  This year I determined I would let it, even if it was an unprofitable bargain, because I wanted to make it plain that it was possible for people to fish in Ireland.  My tenant caught eleven fish in one day, and when he goes back to England he will proclaim that there is no place for fishing like Ireland.  I want people to go back to England or to India, or wherever they come from, and to act when they return as advertising agents for Ireland, proclaiming its excellence as a place to travel in, and especially lauding the Irish fisheries.  Anything that can be done to prevent poaching, to improve the breed of fish, to protect the hatcheries and the fry, and, gradually, to put the inland fisheries in a more satisfactory position than they are now, is a real service and a real and lasting advantage for the country.</P>

      <P>If the Ministry of Fisheries can justify its existence as a source of wealth and income to the nation, then it ought to <Col N="1926" /> get sufficient money to carry out adequately its functions, and if the Minister for Finance has no better defence than that which is offered by the Minister for Justice for not supplying adequate money to the Minister for Fisheries to carry on with, that defence is a very lame one, indeed.  We must look to other countries to discover what revenue is derived from the fishing industry of these countries.  It is generally said that the fishing bays from Galway to Donegal are possibly the richest that can be found anywhere and yet we find that there are no adequate provisions made for the development of the fishing industry along that coast.  There is no provision made for quick and immediate transport, and no provision made for providing those who engage in the fishing industry with the necessary apparatus to carry on that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hewat told us two very interesting things with regard to fishermen in general.  He told us that they go to sea on a fine day and work at home on their farms on a bad day. I wonder what they do on their farms on a bad day.  It would be a very bad system of farming under which a man would remain at home on his farm on a bad day or work on it.  I know some of the fishing villages in at least four counties in Ireland, and I will say this: that the people who engage in the fishing industry, in the main, as far as I know them, are people with little or nothing else to live upon.  They are huddled together in little villages dotted here and there along the sea coast.  And what have they?  In the main, they have a little thatched house with one or two rooms, and nothing to live upon except what they can garner from the sea.  And yet we are told that they have other things to live on, and that they should not get anything else in the shape of subsidies or loans to purchase tackle and boats, and to help them to keep body and soul together, and to support their families.  That is the suggestion that comes from certain benches in that connection.  I know all the western coast of Clare, from Black Head to Loop Head, and along that coast, there are villages of fishermen who have nothing else whatever <Col N="1927" /> to keep them from starvation except what they can garner from the sea.  What do we find?  We find French trawlers coming in right to the very coast.  I was told a good story &mdash;and I hope the Minister for Justice will take note of it&mdash;that some of these French pirates come in to Clare and ask for poteen in French.  I do not know whether they should be prosecuted for that as well as for illegal fishing.  It would be an interesting point in international law.  But it is a fact that these pirates come to the coast and take away the means of subsistence of the people who live there.</P>
    <P>I think the Vote is entirely inadequate, and that the defence put forward for not increasing it is a very lame one, indeed.  I should also like to say something on the inland fisheries, and in that connection I should like to support the plea put forward by Deputy Shaw and Deputy Cooper that there should be greater attention given to them.  It is true that fishermen come to this country from other countries for the inland fishing.  I know something about the inland fishing along the Shannon, and when the people who would fish there find that there is no protection afforded to the fish there, they come to the conclusion that there is no use in spending their time or money in these districts during the summer season.  Let me mention one matter: during the <i>regime</i> of the British in this country there was a certain amount offered for the destruction of cormorants.  I do not think that provision is made at all now.  I do not think there is anything paid for the destruction of these birds, and yet they are the most destructive agents, so far as the inland fisheries are concerned. That is one item alone, a very petty item I think you will find it, but yet it affects the inland fishing industry very much.  There is another aspect, and I suppose I will be accused of dragging this aspect into every question that I endeavour to speak on in the Dáil, but I will drag it into this question, and I do so with all sincerity; in the western seaboard the fishing districts are mainly centres where you will find the Irish language living as a spoken <Col N="1928" /> tongue.  The people living in those districts can be used to preserve the Irish language as a living language, and to help to spread it over the country, right up to the very Pale.  And yet to preserve the fishing industry in these Irish-speaking areas, an industry on which these people mainly depend for their subsistence, there is a vote of only £56,000.  I think that such an action on the part of a Government that claims to be national, that claims to have a desire to perpetuate the lives, the traditions, and everything that appertains to national distinctiveness, is very petty, in allowing the life blood of the nation to trickle through at these fishing districts, as is being done. You are only encouraging emigration from these districts.  To suggest that these people have other means of subsistence than what they derive from the sea, which they have not, is simply toying with the question, and it is also toying with the question on the part of the Government to grant such a small amount for the protection and extension of fishing on the western coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the Minister for Justice is quite right in what he said, and I will try to prove that he is right.  I have stood up in the Dáil on previous occasions on this question of fisheries development, and I found very little support.  It is quite as defensible and quite as right to steal the crops off the land as it is to steal the fish around our coast, and it is quite as defensible and quite as right to destroy the crops on the land as it is to destroy the fish in the inland rivers, and to destroy our spawning stock.  The reason the Minister is right is this: there is no use asking for money to protect fisheries if you have not a proper scheme to administer. Has the Minister a scheme, or is he satisfied with the scheme he has got?  I, as a man who knows something about inland fisheries, having spent a number of years in inland fishing, know that the present system is rotten and the most ineffective in the world.  It is modelled on nothing, and no attempt has been made at improvement. If we had a proper scheme we would give the money for the administration of it, but we have not a proper scheme, either <Col N="1929" /> as regards inland or the sea fisheries.  I would venture to suggest to those at the head of the fisheries in this country that they know very little about them.  It was always a neglected industry.  Under the British regime it was neglected.  It was carried on wrongly then, and it is carried on in the same way to-day.  I have no confidence in the present Ministry and the present method of doing things.  What we want is the right kind of experts to sit down and devise a proper scheme, and when you have a proper scheme, by all means finance it.  What comparison has the Irish scheme with the Scotch scheme, either inland or coast?  Have you as good or as effective a method in Ireland as in Scotland, and if not, why have you not?  It is all very well to ask for money here.  For what?  To give us a Board of Conservators, to pay a few old men to protect rivers in the fishing season, while nothing is being done to protect them in the spawning season.  There is not a scrap of protection in the inland rivers in the spawning season.  You have an odd Civic Guard here and there, who attempts to do it, and an odd policeman here and there attempted to do it formerly, but only an odd one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested previously that where there are rivers to protect there should be men trained in fishery protection attached to every Civic Guard barracks in the country bordering on spawning beds and spawning streams. They could be moved around in the different seasons where protection is needed; there is no need for protection in the upper reaches in the summer, but there is an absolutely urgent need in the winter.  You can take them where they are needed in the summer time.  Take them to rivers where fishing is going on and have your laws enforced.  A very small number of men would do it.  In the absence of a proper scheme, and in the absence of knowledge as to whether you are going to get value for your money, I do not see the use of voting money.  The Scotch inland fisheries have been developed into a great national asset.  Anyone who knows about the Scotch fishing knows what a great asset it is. We have better natural facilities here, better rivers and more of them, and <Col N="1930" /> lakes.  Before the Scotch started developing their fisheries we were far in front of them.  At one time Ireland was far ahead of Scotland, and England had practically no fish at all in its rivers.  To-day the English returns are quite good, even though a number of the rivers are polluted in passing through industrial centres.  A few years ago England was sending nothing to the London markets; now they are, for they have developed their fisheries.  They have a proper scheme, as they have in Scotland.  I suggest that if you want to do anything with your fisheries here you must go to countries where they have a well-developed and well-thought-out scheme. Send men over to study the conditions there, and get them to give a report to somebody who will be able to give a proper decision on this matter.  A Deputy here has suggested that there is very little difference between the wealth of our fisheries and the wealth of our lands, if properly developed.  I will not say one is equal to the other, but it might be found that fisheries would be the second biggest item of our national wealth.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any one item of the produce of the land, such as cattle or poultry, which is a big thing, that would be equal to the value of our fishing if it were properly developed and if the fish were properly marketed.  What facilities have our fishermen got to dispose of their fish? Have they got any, or what effort has been made in that direction?  Not a word has been said in this Vote, although this matter has been laboured on previous occasions, of procuring facilities for the disposal of the fish. There are a lot of words in the Vote, but very little in them.  Loans are very desirable, no doubt, for the reason that fishing is a very precarious industry. Men may be very well off this year after a splendid season, but next season they may be, practically speaking, bankrupt.  They will owe money to the local shopkeepers.  Loans are good, but loans are not the principal thing.  The fact is that all our little fishing villages are generally in the hands of the local shopkeepers, the local gombeen men, who buy the fish at a very bad price, a hundred per cent. <Col N="1931" /> lower than London prices.  They get no chance of selling their fish direct, and a number of people are fattening on their backs; no facilities have been given them, and no effort has been made to procure facilities for them. Deputy White reminds me that they are being paid 10d. and 11d. for salmon in Donegal, while the London price is 2s. 6d., but that is no news to me.  It is a common practice, and what has always obtained.  We have not yet built up schemes.  The fishermen on the coast have not been taught a method or have not been encouraged in any scheme of self help which they could carry out for themselves if they tried, and if they were only organised.</P>
    <P>A Deputy referred to the destruction of cormorants.  There is also the destruction of the seals, otters, and of several other things that destroy fish. With proper organisation a good deal of this could be done by the fishermen themselves, but no effort has been made to secure proper organisation.  If the fishermen could be taught to help themselves and to see what they could do to help themselves, they would willingly do it.  I suggest that when we get a vacation the Minister should go for a prolonged cruise along the coast with his officials and see things for himself.  I think he will find something to see, that is, if he confines himself to the coast.  With regard to inland development, all our Irish rivers could be made to carry seven or eight times as much as they are carrying at the moment.  While the disturbance was going on advantage was taken of it in nearly all districts&mdash;certainly in that in my constituency, which I know, the Waterford fishery district, and practically the whole fishing was destroyed. Men came along from village to village, dynamited and killed all the fish.  They destroyed rivers wholesale. Dynamite and other explosives such as gelignite were used.  This is all a matter of the greatest importance, and there is, as I said before, no well-thought-out scheme to help to meet it, and until you have a scheme you are not beginning at the right end. Except you are prepared to set up a Commission, send out a few intelligent men who know something about the <Col N="1932" /> subject to take lessons in other countries, you will do nothing.  You need not begin the experiments here.  They have been carried out elsewhere, and results can be obtained in a month or two months.  If you do that you will be going in the right way, and a few hundreds spent that way will get good results.  £57,000 is not a small sum, and with intelligent co-operation by the fishermen a good deal could be done with it, to give them, in the first instance, a proper scheme, instead of handing money to people who know nothing about the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this discussion at all if it were not for some of the statements made.  Deputy Hewat said that the fishing industry was a part-time occupation when he deprecated the giving of loans to fishermen, and when he was inclined to be generally sarcastic about the grievances of fishermen.  I think I might be able to convince him that many of his statements were made without very much knowledge of the facts. Deputy Hewat, I submit, knows very little of the fishing industry in a good many parts of the country.  He knows very little of the conditions under which the fishermen live, and perhaps some of the statements in a letter from a gentleman who is very conversant with the fishing industry in West Cork, and who knows the conditions under which the fishermen there live, might serve to enlighten him as to the exact position and as to the need for something to be done to improve these conditions. This gentleman deals with the conditions in a fishing island off the coast of West Cork, an island entirely inhabited by fishermen.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of the island is about five hundred acres, with about one-third arable land; the remainder is a mass of bare rocks.  There are forty-two families on the island with only three slate houses; the remainder are miserable hovels with, on an average, five or six living in each.  As can be <Col N="1933" /> seen from the above, the farms are small, only a few acres in each.  At present there are sixteen families without a cow and several with only one, and that a very poor one, so that for the greater part of the year the vast majority are unable to get milk, they are unable to buy substitutes, the chief articles of diet being bread, black tea and potatoes, with the result that from want of proper nourishment there are four children suffering from bone disease at present in Skibbereen Hospital.</P>
    <P>The chief industry of the islanders was lobstering, and the condition of this was given, I think, on last week's <i>Star</i>, where it was stated that a cutter called to Schull Harbour for a cargo of lobsters, and had to depart again as none were to be had.</P>
    <P>I spent nearly five years teaching in England (N. Staffs), and came in contact with many children from the slums, but their sufferings were entirely eclipsed by those of the children in Hare Island.  The latter are compelled to pick winkles.  The season for such starts about October and continues till June, and one can imagine children (boys and girls) from eight years upwards standing in the mud for a period of four hours, knee-deep, and even deeper, on a frosty morning picking winkles (for a mere trifle).  I have had several instances of children trying to escape the punishment by stealing away to school often without their breakfasts, and parents following them requesting me to send them home, as they were unable to obtain the price of the next morning's breakfast otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat, I respectfully submit, in the comfort of his suburban home, is very much out of touch with the people that are referred to in that letter.  He had no right whatever to speak of them in the flippant and sarcastic way that he did.  In that particular area there is a great need for some works to be started to improve the conditions of the fishermen, and to give them better facilities to carry on their trade.  I have in mind a particular scheme that was put up by the Congested Districts Board in West Cork some years ago. <Col N="1934" /> That scheme was a very great necessity in the district at the time, but it has been held up because money for it has not been forthcoming.  The Minister, in his very frank statement, made it clear on whom the responsibility lies. I trust that one of the results of this debate may be that the Minister for Finance may adopt a more reasonable attitude in connection with the development of the fishing industry.  Like Deputy White, I am also concerned with the existence of illegal trawling, and illegal trawling along the coast of West Cork is rampant at present. The fishermen complain of the action of captains of trawlers who are caught.  They adopt a very abusive and violent attitude on a good many occasions, and sometimes they refuse to give their names, or to give any particulars whatever.  I appreciate the statement made by the Minister for Fisheries as to his difficulties, and I appreciate also the statement of the Minister for Justice in connection with the financial difficulties, but I think in the case of fisheries that there certainly are very many strong arguments for some improvement, and I do suggest that the Minister for Fisheries should endeavour to make some advance in the direction that has been outlined in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would state when he is replying, what action, if any, has been taken by his Department, to afford facilities for the transport of fish to inland towns.  We often read in the papers of where there is a glut of fish which cannot be disposed of, and at the same time in most inland towns it is impossible to purchase fish at all, except you go into a shop and buy some tinned salmon or something like that. Now, I suggest that the Ministry should engage itself in trying to see if some scheme could not be evolved whereby the home market could be supplied.  I would also like to join in what has been said by Deputy Gorey and others in regard to inland fisheries and poaching.  It is notorious that it is carried on to such an extent that even in parts of the country I know of, people kill so much fish during the spawning season by the use of explosives, by spears and other methods, <Col N="1935" /> that they put them in large barrels, pickle them, and have them for the whole year.  Another means that is adopted in some places where there are mills on the river, is that the sluices are manipulated in such a way that they are able to kill any amount of fish they like during the season, and I suggest to the Minister for Justice that if the Gárda Síochána were instructed to keep a special eye on some of these mills where these sluices are situated, during the spawning season, it might do no harm.</P>

      <P>There is an item I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to&mdash;sub-head F, Rural Industries. In 1923-24 it was £14,000, and this year it is £24,500, an increase of £10,500.  I notice here that he has schemes for the development of rural industries in congested districts, and I would wish to draw his attention to the present condition of the rural industries in County Donegal.  They are in a very bad way.  Lace-making, I understand, was a reasonably remunerative industry up to the past few years, but it has fallen on evil times for the past two or three years, and I bespeak the Minister's attention to that to see if he could put aside a sum of money for the development of that local industry.  I understand that grants have been made from time to time in various ways by the Congested Districts Board for the development and fostering of this industry, and I believe that at present in several districts of the county there are good expert workers who cannot find any work or cannot find any market for the work they have done.  There is also in some places glove-making carried on, and the very same remarks apply to that.  I desire to draw the Minister's attention to that as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the West of the county the homespuns are in a very bad way at present for want of proper markets. They are in a precarious condition, and if the Minister could do something by way of grants whereby some means could be devised, it would have a very good effect.  He should endeavour to do something to develop and foster these industries in the County Donegal, particularly in the Irish-speaking <Col N="1936" /> districts, and these people are all living in Irish-speaking districts.  Deputy Gorey made a suggestion, and I would emphasise it, that the Minister should go round in a fishery cruiser, have a look all round the coast and see how things are going on.  I am perfectly sure he will be convinced of the statements made here and that he would have no difficulty in seeing the devastation done by these foreign trawlers. He could also see the inadequacy of the arrangements under which one fishing cruiser is expected to patrol the whole Saorstát coast line.  I do not blame the Minister for the present condition of affairs.  I know the Finance Department will not give him sufficient money to provide adequate protection and facilities on the coast, but the Ministry of Finance should understand there are millions at stake in the fishery industry round the coast line in labour and in transit and in the provision of wholesome food.  I am perfectly sure if he would open the purse strings which he is keeping hold of with such a relentless grip, that in the course of time the fisheries would become reproductive, and in some indirect way the Minister for Finance would get back probably three times what he is asked to spend on the proper protection of the coast line.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice thought fit to castigate us all for our criticism of the Ministry of Finance, and more or less suggested that I was trying to shirk responsibility for my own sins by saying &ldquo;The other fellow is the cause of it.&rdquo;  I have no intention of shirking responsibility for anything for which I am responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the trend of his argument was that the Department of Finance was criticised unjustly. It might have been criticised unjustly, but, as far as I was concerned, I was merely putting the facts before the Dáil.  This is my opportunity. I am not a member of the Executive Council who can put up his case there at that assembly.  I have to defend myself here; I am directly responsible to the Dáil, and if there are things <Col N="1937" /> over which I have no control, it is here I must say that.  I do not at all pretend or hope to pose as one who will try to keep everything happy in the garden by a stroke of my wand if the Ministry of Finance would be only good enough to do what I want them to do.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody could say that I ever did attempt to adopt that course.  But I repeat that I think that I should have at least been given as much money as was available for special loan purposes under the old regime.  That amount is not now available, even though certain monies were actually in the funds of the Congested Districts Board, and were specially allocated for fishery loans.  These, I say, have been now collared by Finance, and are not made available for me for fishery loans.  Deputy Johnson asked had I looked into the question of certain bills outstanding and certain claims for compensation, and seen that redress would be given.  I have, of course, as far as I could, and, as a matter of fact, certain of these claims have been paid through my intervention. In other cases we have not had a decision.  I have asked Finance, on the speculation of what is due by the Government to certain fishermen who lost their boats through army service of one kind or another, to allow us to make loans.</P>
      <P>Regarding the pier at Dun Laoghaire, we abide by the engineer's verdict in the matter, and the engineer's verdict is that the pier is not suited for the purpose for which the Dun Laoghaire fishermen wanted it.  It is a question also whether it would not be better to concentrate on Howth, which is a well-known fishing centre, and improve that from the point of view of harbour dredging and so on.  At any rate, we are advised by the engineers from the Department of Public Works that the place is unsuitable.  Deputy Hewat said that Deputy Johnson took the natural line.  Deputy Hewat, I might say, took his natural line.  He referred to the fact that we were getting no value for this money, that, in fact, we were not justified in expending this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I wonder is it anything to the State, when it is considering the expenditure of money, to know that the <Col N="1938" /> expenditure of moneys is enabling its nationals, its citizens, to live and work?  This is not in the nature of a grant.  This is not a dole.  These loans are merely enabling fishermen to follow their avocation.  The loans are got on guaranteed securities which, first of all, have to satisfy us, and, then, have to satisfy the Minister for Finance.  Of course, as I said, the fact is that the loans given by the Congested Districts Board and the D.A.T.I. were greater than are made available now.  These arrears outstanding, great as they may be, are an inheritance.  The arrears have not been contracted since the formation of the Ministry of Fisheries. They are arrears that are inherited chiefly from the Congested Districts Board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shaw complained of the neglect of inland fisheries.  Considering the total Vote, I think the inland fisheries get a fair proportion.  There are grants amounting to £6,000 towards Boards of Conservators.  That is the biggest item; it is a sum which Deputy Gorey thinks is absolutely thrown away.  I had a Bill ready for introduction, in the hope of its being made law in the session that is now drawing to a close, to reconstitute these Boards on lines which were entirely agreed on by an Advisory Committee, of which, I think, Deputy Gorey was a member. There are £6,000 in grants, £1,500 for hatcheries, £1,250 for State fisheries, which are also inland fisheries, and £600 for scientific investigation.  That is £9,350 in all, which is a fair proportion of the total amount.  I do admit that trout protection has been rather neglected, because there has been more concentration on the protection of the more valuable fish&mdash;the salmon.  Boards of Conservators&mdash;say what you like about them&mdash;with the resources at their disposal, have tried in most cases to do their best.</P>
    <P>Deputy White was not here when spoke.  I am not going to argu against Deputy White that one boat is sufficient to protect the coast.  But might point out to him that there are twenty-six local gentlemen from In nishowen fishing in the Fleetwood trawlers, and I think if he would make enquiries he would find that these are <Col N="1939" /> the spies, these are the fellows who show the trawlers where the fishing beds are.  Deputy Cooper referred to the fact that we should utilise the services of local fishermen in this matter. We do, and a big proportion of the cases where we prosecute are reported to us by the local fishermen.  We enlist their support, as far as we can, and tell them the type of information we want in order to justify us in prosecuting so as to get a conviction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pádraig O hOgáin referred to the cormorant pests.  Boards of Conservators in many districts have power to give certain grants for their destruction. The dropping off in the utilisation of that power is largely due to the disturbed conditions.  Deputy Gorey made a contrast with Scotland and England.  The same laws apply to the sea and inland fisheries in the Saorstát as do beyond.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the administration through local Committees or Boards of Conservators.  With regard to Deputy White's reference to rural industries, I think he was not here when I pointed out the reason for the discrepancy between this year's Vote and last year's Vote.  This <Col N="1940" /> amount came in only as a supplementary estimate last year.  We did not have control of this particular branch until about August.  In Donegal there are ten centres at present for lace-making and knitting.  There is also glove-making. Glove-making was tried, but my opinion is that it was not a success. The homespun market in Donegal, as well as in Kerry, has been bad for the past three or four years.  We are working on a scheme at the moment to try and open markets for these products of what are called &ldquo;the classes&rdquo; in the congested areas.  We hope to work through a central marketing depot in Dublin, with possibly travellers to find markets for these products across the Channel in places where such products are sought.</P>

      <P>As far as the facilities are concerned, we have made representations time and again to the railway companies from the point of view of freightage.  The Midland Great Western Railway Company has been so far the most accommodating.  The Great Southern and Western Railway Company has, to a certain extent, met us in certain places from the point of view of putting on fish trains, which will stand by for the landing of the fish.  As regards inland markets, we had a man on the road investigating the matter for a time last year.  We were in the way, for a period, of getting fresh fish handled by some of the bigger type of multiple shop.  Lipton's were prepared to put up a slab for the fish, but it was turned down from their headquarters.  It is all very well to talk about the money that is to be had from retailing fish, but we have found it extremely difficult to get people to tackle that very question in the inland towns.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding <Col N="1941" /> £2,677,145 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1925, to defray the cost of the Army.</P>
    <P>I circulated two documents giving notes on Army Estimates, and some other particulars in another form dealing with Army organisation.  Table B does not, in the present circumstances, exactly represent what the state of affairs is.  There is provision there for a General and two Major-Generals. I think there is a mistake in that.  The number of Major-Generals is wrong.  I cannot say what the exact number is, but I should say it is very much more than two.  There is a mistake so far as the number is concerned, because that table was made up some time ago, and at that time General MacMahon was not gazetted. His name should have been gazetted towards the end of the week.  I would also like to refer to item AA&mdash;gratuities payable on demobilisation to certain officers with prolonged, including pre-Truce, service.  That amounts to £25,000.  Although the revised scheme did not affect that particular amount, it will be in the recollection of Deputies that general demobilisation took place on the 7th March, and that the sum of £25,000 would be unequal to the charges that would be made in respect of that service.  There is also item (U) in relation to compensation for damage or injury.  I anticipate that that amount will be exceeded.</P>
    <P>Apart from those two publications which have been issued, there is the general question which has been referred to here very often&mdash;the Army accounts. I think I mentioned before, in dealing with that matter, that apart from the old accounts there were representations being made daily for payments of one sort or other of accounts going on for a very considerable period. The number of old accounts still to be disposed of is 1,600, and of these nearly 1,200 have not yet been certified, mainly owing to the fact that the officers responsible have been demobilised and information regarding the accounts is not available.  Arrangements are, however, being made whereby a claimant may make a statutory declaration <Col N="1942" /> substantiating the genuineness of the account.  The remaining 400 cases to be disposed of are being dealt with as rapidly as possible.  Deputies will recognise that that is terminology that has been used in this connection fairly regularly.  Some of these claims are for balances of previous accounts, and investigation of them sometimes involves the examination of monthly accounts for two years in order to establish whether the balances were legitimate reductions for overcharges.  Many of the accounts require very close scrutiny, as there is no doubt advantage has been taken of the absence of records to furnish grossly exaggerated, and even fictitious accounts.  We have had some representations from areas in the country to the effect that accounts rendered are fictitious.  This is one letter that has come in:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Things have come to a nice pass in this town.  Mr. &ldquo;A.&rdquo; gets a large amount for billetting soldiers, which was planned by Mr. &ldquo;B.&rdquo;  Is this the way the ratepayers have to give their money?  If inquiries were made in this case some people would be in jail.</P>
    <P>Another letter reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I was in charge of the troops in &mdash;&mdash; on two dates which are mentioned. I do not remember any troops staying in this house.  In my opinion the claim is a concoction.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of letters have come in drawing attention to the fact that there have been either gross exaggerations or that accounts have been fabricated.  While Deputies may at times feel that this particular branch is slow in dealing with accounts, the fact is that very considerable care has got to be taken or the taxpayers' money may be very easily spent to no useful purpose, and not in respect of legitimate charges.</P>
    <P>As to the other item with regard to the Supplementary Grant, something like 1,400 claims have been dealt with up to date, representing a sum running into very close on £120,000.  There are some cases still to be dealt with, but the original figure will not be exceeded. In these cases, too, there are complications by reason of the fact that quite a number of references which are necessary <Col N="1943" /> are those of demobilised officers, and it is not easy in certain cases to get correct information.  In some cases the information is very contradictory, and involves, in consequence, considerable delay in getting at the actual truth of the matter.  Beyond that I do not think the Army Estimate calls for any remarks from me, but should any question be raised and I have the information at hand, I shall be very pleased to supply it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the President would answer a question with reference to Army organisation. A certain scheme was being put into force in March last.  It was founded upon certain principles of organisation and control.  That scheme, I understand, has been somewhat radically changed, and perhaps the President would be able to say what are the principal points in regard to which a change has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that would require a somewhat more technical expert than I am to go into it.  It did appear to me when the original scheme was proposed that it was rather top-heavy, and that the organisation through the country was scarcely sufficiently big to warrant such a very large organisation at Headquarters. The new scheme in effect has much the same characteristics as the old scheme with that particular difference.  Some criticism was passed here previously about the extra authority being given to G.O.C's.  I am informed that whatever strengthening of authority there was, there is no weakening, so far as discipline, control, or administration is concerned.  The position of the G.O.C. Commands in relation to the Ministry in the present scheme is exactly the same as in the old scheme, where it is stipulated that G.O.C.'s are responsible for the proper conduct and efficiency of all services in their districts, so far as concerns such duties as the distribution of troops; defence of posts occupied by troops; troops and stores; conduct of operations; intelligence; training of the troops; studying and advising on the military situation; supervision of all military matters; preparation <Col N="1944" /> of reports, and any other duties which may be defined by the Ministry. There is a difference in this respect that the G.O.C. is now given machinery to enable him more effectively to discharge the duties for which he is made responsible in both schemes.  It has been found in this new scheme that there is no necessity for a Major, in addition to the Colonel, in each of the nine Brigades, and the military authorities are satisfied that the efficiency of the Brigade will not suffer in consequence. In the original scheme there was a Major in each Brigade; there is no Major under the new scheme, so far as the Brigade is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very great diffidence in discussing the Army on this Estimate, but I feel that it is my duty to make one or two remarks with regard to it.  The scheme of organisation has been radically changed, and, as far as I can judge from the headings that are supplied in this book that has been issued recently, I am perfectly correct when I say that the scheme provides us with an Army that cannot move as an Army without creating the most utter confusion to the people that are responsible for it.  It gives us an Army, no reasonably large portion of which could move as a piece of military organisation without creating utter confusion.  It does not put you in the position of facing a definite military problem.  Supposing it was found necessary to send for one of your Generals and to say to him, &ldquo;A force of 600 men has shown up outside Enniscorthy, and are apparently going to hold together and give battle in regular battle formation.  I want to make you responsible for dealing with them.&rdquo;  He could not tell you what particular units of the Army he would want to take in order to deal with that situation.  Your Army is not organised into what can be readily recognised as, or what are recognisable units of force that would enable a soldier to deal with the military problem that is involved.  It is not organised in a way that would allow you to expand it in any emergency without creating confusion. The lines of organisation, and the principles of organisation, are such that you could not reduce your Army <Col N="1945" /> without involving confusion and further reorganisation.  The details at the bottom of that statement of mine are rather technical, but I am quite convinced from an analysis of the paper, that that is so.</P>
      <P>I am also convinced that it does not give your senior soldiers a chance of developing as men who could become technical soldiers, who could size up military problems in a soldierly way. That is a very serious criticism of our Army organisation, but, I feel that it is necessary I should make that statement to the President.  That is my opinion on the scheme as changed and that is in our hands in a certain form at present. I want to draw the attention of Deputies to what can be deduced from the organisation of the engineers.  If, as I suggest, a certain force found its way into Wexford, and that we were in the position that any bridge across the Slaney had been destroyed, and that we had a force below Enniscorthy who held the upper reaches of the river, there is no unit in this organisation that we could call upon to throw three or four bridges across the upper waters of the Slaney, if we wanted to do so. If the President has any details to show that my argument is incorrect, I think we ought to hear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation, apart from the Commands, is made up of nine brigades.  There are two in each of the Commands, with the exception of the Eastern Command, in which there are three.  There are two brigades at the Curragh.  I take it that these two brigades would be available for an emergency such as Deputy General Mulcahy has mentioned.  Of course, it might take some time for them to head off the troops in Enniscorthy, but they would be available for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain, but, I think a brigade comprises three battalions, and that there are 27 battalions, three battalions being in each brigade.  I might admit that Deputy General Mulcahy would be right if the facts were not somewhat different from what he states.  I think he said that <Col N="1946" /> the scheme does not put us in the position of facing a definite military problem. If there was a force of 600 men at Enniscorthy who would give battle, it might take some time, with the best organised institution&mdash;even if we were at full strength&mdash;to be able to throw out from neighbouring places, such as Clonmel or Kilkenny, a force to meet these men.  The Deputy went on to say that the scheme is not organised to allow of expansion in an emergency, and that we could not reduce the Army without confusion.  As a matter of fact, we are in this position at the moment that the Army is not up to strength, and as far as I am aware, there is no confusion.  I take it that when the Army would be at full strength it would be something like 19,000.  There would be no interference with its efficiency. The proposal was that as brigades would be trained at the Curragh they would replace brigades in the various Commands, and that during the 12 months every officer in the Army would go through the School of Instruction at the Curragh and pass an examination.  I do not know whether it is a qualifying or competitive examination, but, at any rate, it would necessitate passing one or the other to qualify for whatever commission he would get from the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that talking on this Vote at this hour is rather wasteful, and that the Minister should move to report progress.  Before going very far into the discussion, I would like to have from the Minister, some indication, in this year 1924, when one may look forward to a cessation of conflict, and a period of civil peace, what is in the mind of the Ministry with regard to the purpose of this Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the re-organisation scheme they must have had some picture in their mind as to what the Army was intended to be used for.  Is it to repel an invader from overseas, is it to repel an invader from across the present border, is it to repel or to suppress internal trouble, or is it an elaborate police force armed, or what is it?  I think <Col N="1947" /> that an explanation is due to us as to the principles that have been attempted to be applied in the organisation of the Army, either the original organisation or the revised organisation.  As I see it, being a very ignorant man in these matters, unless we know the purpose or at least the main purpose for which this military machine is supposed to be used, we are not in a position to estimate to any degree, even as ignorant men, whether it is likely to be efficient for the purpose.  I would have expected that the Minister, in introducing an Estimate of this kind, would have elaborated somewhat what was in his mind.  He is asking for a very large sum of money to provide an Army of 20,000 men.  What, I ask, does he want them to do?  How is he going to train them?  Is it for guerilla warfare, is it in massed battalions or what?  Are they to be organised in massed battalions for, say, oversea services?  I am sure the Minister will say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Then let him tell us what the Army is to be used for.  That, at least, I think, is due to us.  We have been told in the past, since we began to discuss Army Estimates, that the purpose of this Army was to suppress internal enemies in the State.  That was the contention, and that was the use to which the Army was put.  Now, I ask, is the purpose changed, or is it only intended to meet the possibility of similar activities in the future, or is it to be maintained for any other purpose? Is the Army organised for the purpose of suppressing internal troubles?  If so, is this the best kind of organisation for that purpose?  These are questions that will at once arise, and I at least hoped that we would have had some enlightenment upon them before we went on to the discussion of the Estimates in detail.  I hope that, even still, the Minister will enlighten us on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the easiest question I could be asked: What is the Army for?  I think most people realise what it is for.  A Defence Force can be for only one purpose&mdash;to meet any National emergency that may arise.  That may arise internally.  We have had experience of that.  It did arise internally before by reason of the <Col N="1948" /> smallness of its numbers, to some extent, and perhaps also because certain people who thought they could carry out their bluff had to be undeceived with regard to that.  Now, this State must be defended either from external aggression or from internal aggression, and the experiences of the last two years do not, in my opinion, justify such a reduction of the Defence Forces as might invite anything in the nature of a repetition of that particular experiment.  Within the last twelve months people who made speeches referred to the fact&mdash;some of them constitutionally-minded&mdash;that they are &ldquo;not yet demobilised.&rdquo;  Well, if they were to say that they had been demobilised, it would not have had any more effect on me.  The fact is that some of them think that their game of bluff may yet again be experimented, and if it is, it is not with a hastily mobilised force that one can meet them with the least possible expense.  An efficient military machine will, I think, for some time to come, at any rate, be a national necessity here.  The efficiency of a military machine in a country like this depends upon many things.  To some extent its efficiency is seriously impaired in this country by reason of the many posts that it has to occupy.  I think that Deputy General Mulcahy would admit that whenever, during the last twelve or eighteen months, he drew in soldiers from particular posts, that very many representations were made to him that these posts ought to be left there.  Now, it seriously interferes with the discipline of a military force to have a number of scattered posts in various parts of the country, and the idea of the policy, as far as the Army establishment is concerned, certainly for this year, and possibly for next year, should be to have an exceedingly efficient military machine, capable of being used at the shortest possible notice, trained to arms, trained in discipline, and trained in efficiency and a credit to the nation.  Young States in every part of the world, from the earliest periods in history, required Defence Forces.  We are no different to the rest of them, highly civilised as we are, and with a civilisation extending over many centuries which, I hope, we will continue.  But I hope that the <Col N="1949" /> civilisation we will have experience of in the future will be an improvement upon the civilisation of the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>I am quite agreeable, but may I say this to Deputies, and I think it would meet with approval if we took a vote of the Dáil with the Whips off, that we should make a real earnest attempt to adjourn on Friday.  We have made two or three attempts already, and have not been successful, although some of them were very earnest.  It would be necessary to get through the Appropriation Bill on Friday, and even then it would be necessary to return one day next week in the event of any amendments being made to Bills in the Seanad or in the event of any recommendation in connection with the Appropriation Bill. We have met now for the best part of two years, and I do not think that any legislature in the world has worked so hard in that two years.  We have had a great deal of work to do, and I think it would be in the interest of Deputies of all parties that there should be this Recess at the earliest possible moment.</P>
