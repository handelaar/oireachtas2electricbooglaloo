      <P>asked the President if the Committee which was set up some months ago to investigate the cases of Government employees who were arrested or interned since July, 1922, has yet furnished its Report, and if not, if he will state how soon the Report may be expected.</P>

      <P>The Advisory Committee has not yet completed its investigations, but it is hoped to furnish to the Government within the next week an Interim Report covering the cases in which the Committee is satisfied that the persons concerned were not guilty of complicity with the Irregular Forces.  In the remaining cases it will be necessary to give the persons concerned an opportunity of stating their cases in person before the Committee, and steps to this end are now being taken.  The Committee will make every endeavour to furnish their final report with the least possible delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>About 400 cases were referred to this Committee, and in 126 cases the Committee have found that there was complicity with the Irregulars. In the other cases, or in the majority of them, at any rate, the Committee <Col N="2842" /> are satisfied that evidence exists that there was complicity.  So far as they are concerned, they are going to give them an opportunity of appearing before them with a view to making their case.</P>

      <P>asked the President whether the Government have considered the desirability of taking the necessary steps to have the Parks at Parnell Square and elsewhere in the city thrown open to the people of the surrounding congested areas; whether, if under the existing law there is no power to do this, he will introduce a short Bill empowering the Government to nationalise these parks; and whether he could undertake to have such a measure introduced so that the parks would be open to the public in time for the Tailteann Games in August next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Squares to which the question refers were enclosed and are governed by bodies constituted under private Acts.  Legislation would be necessary to transfer to the Government the property of those bodies which would also have to be compensated.  The proposal is not one which could be dealt with hurriedly, and separate consideration would have to be given to the circumstances of each Square.  I regret that in the existing congested state of public business, I can see no prospect of sufficient time being made available for giving to the proposal the mature consideration which it requires.  In the case of Stephen's Green, Lord Ardilaun expended £50,000 of his own money in providing that for a park.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the schoolhouse at Ballintubber, Co. Roscommon, is in an insanitary and dangerous condition and is wholly unsuitable for the purposes of a school; whether proposals for the erection of a new building to replace the existing one were made so long as twenty-five years ago; whether these proposals have been renewed on several occasions since but nothing has so far been done; whether it is a fact that a suitable site was given by the late Congested Districts Board some years ago, and, if so, if that site is still available; and whether, in view of the dangers incurred by pupils and teachers who attend this school, he will take steps to have the work of erecting a new school building in this district put in hand at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing Ballintubber schoolhouse is reported to be unsuitable and the accommodation insufficient for the number of pupils in attendance.</P>
      <P>A grant for the erection of a new schoolhouse was sanctioned some years ago and a lease of the site executed. The then manager was informed by the Board of Works that he could proceed with the erection of the building, but he was unable to obtain the services of a suitable contractor, and subsequently the erection of the schoolhouse had to be postponed owing to the general restrictions on expenditure on school buildings during the European war.</P>
      <P>The site is still available, so far as this Department is aware.</P>
      <P>The present manager has been asked whether he is in a position to proceed with the case.  If a suitable tender be submitted by him this Department will be prepared to consider the question of sanctioning a supplemental grant of two-thirds of the additional expenditure which will be necessary in view of the present cost of building.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is proposed to take the Order Paper in the order in which it is set down.  In the event of not finishing Item 11 to-day, it is proposed to take it as the first business to-morrow.  In the programme I have set out I hope to be able to afford four hours for the Estimates on to-morrow, two hours on Thursday, and three hours on Friday.  That is in anticipation of some of the measures that are down for those days being non-contentious, as I believe they are.  I find that in my statement on Friday I stated that it was intended to introduce eight Bills.  That statement was made out on the day previous, but four Bills were introduced on Friday, so that there remained only four to be introduced then.</P>

      <P>I have been disappointed in not having had the President's statement circulated, as it was not quite so easy to follow a written statement.  I, for one, rather anticipated the circulation of that statement to the Deputies.  Will the Minister say what is his proposal regarding the motion which is in fact a motion of censure on the Government, which stands in the name of Deputy Milroy, and whether he proposes to shelve the motion of censure, or to allow it to be taken, and also whether it is intended to deal with the other motion on the Order Paper in private Deputies' time on to-morrow?</P>

In connection with Deputy Milroy's motion which, I think, he innocently stated was not in the nature of a motion of condemnation, I propose to give time for its consideration to-morrow.  I would at any time allow time for the discussion of a motion of want of confidence.  In that connection I think the three motions <Col N="2851" /> down for to-morrow will go by the board.  But if a motion were put down as a motion of want of confidence, I would undertake to give time for that to be discussed&mdash;a moderate number of them.</P>

      <P>That raises the matter of the report of the Army Inquiry Committee, which was to be further considered.  I believe that the raising of the matter last Wednesday did not fulfil the President's intention to set aside a day, or part of a day, for the consideration of it.  Is the matter to be considered again, and may we be told if any of these matters raised by Deputy Mulcahy in the three resolutions he has put before us are to come up in their present form, or in any other form before the Dáil?  The report itself, the adequate consideration  it, and the dealing with it generally, should take precedence of any motions of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to afford time for considering the report, unless a motion be tabled in connection with it.  I would be prepared to give consideration to the matter when such a motion would be tabled.</P>

      <P>The Damage to Property Act provided that in a case where the judge gave an award, that is a case coming under Section 13, the Minister for Finance should have power to <Col N="2853" /> create, by order, certain securities and to use these securities for the purpose of paying in certain proportions the person who had received the award.  In the case of what are called wrongful acts, which consist mainly in the destruction of bank or Government notes or paper currency of any kind, and secondly, the taking away of chattels, without the consent of the owner, the judge was not empowered to give an award.  He was authorised to investigate the case and to report to the Minister for Finance in writing, amongst other things, the sum which would fairly compensate the owner for such loss.  It would be possible to pay these report cases in cash when a vote had been taken in the Dáil, but it would not be possible, without an Act of this sort, to pay in securities.  It does not seem to us that it is desirable that the report cases should be in a more favourable position than the decree cases.  We propose, therefore, by this Act to take power to issue in payment of report cases, the securities issued under the order made under Section 13, primarily where there are awards or decrees.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces are at present maintained under the transitory provisions of the Act passed last year.  As soon as the present Bill becomes law, it is intended to establish the Forces by means of a proclamation issued by the Executive Council under Section 22 of the Act. When that proclamation is published commissions will be issued to officers in the form laid down in the First Schedule. It is proposed then that all officers should go through a military school and pass the qualifying tests.  In the event of an officer not passing the test, unless this provision were in, the only alternative left was to demobilise that officer, but it is proposed by means of this particular section to afford him an opportunity of qualifying for the rank immediately under that to which he was commissioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day, I think, Deputy Nagle asked a question on this section.  He asked what was the reason for the difference between the oath that an officer takes and the oath an ordinary private soldier takes.  Different forms are prescribed, because in the case of an officer his position is analogous to that of a Civil Servant. He holds his commission during the pleasure of the Executive Council, and there is no contract between him and the State.  The soldier is enlisted, and enlistment, in that sense, is the acceptance of an engagement in the military service of the State, and it is in the nature of a contract between the person enlisted and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain a little further what are the terms of that contract?  Is there to be a stated reward on the one part&mdash;payment for the services rendered, and what is that payment?  I notice by the form of the oath that the soldier is to swear, &ldquo;I will accept such pay, bounty, rations and clothing as may from time to time be prescribed.&rdquo;  Is <Col N="2857" /> is suggested that the contract is one which may be varied at will by one party to the contract without reference to the other party, and if it is a contract, is it not within the terms of the contract or the general equities of the case that when a change is made in the conditions under which the contract is fulfilled, that either party may withdraw from it?  I notice, if we take the next section, Section 10, we find there that an officer who declines or neglects to take the oath prescribed for him, is deemed to have resigned his commission. There is no such suggestion in reference to the oath to be taken by soldiers.  I am still in a difficulty to reconcile the distinction, if the distinction is as the Minister, has now stated, that in the one case it is a contract.  I am anxious to know why the terms of the contract are not made known to one of the parties.  When they vary one of the parties to the contract may decline to accept the variation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The mode of enlistment and the attestation are set out in Section 148 of the Act.  It is not proposed to vary the contract unless where it is so specified, in such cases, say, as ration allowances or things of that sort in which it would be inadvisable, I think, to set up a regular and rigid standard.  In the case of a soldier, he understands on his attestation or enlistment, how he stands exactly. It is before him, and he has the particulars of it.  In the case of officers it is not the same at all, because we have them already.  It is not in contemplation at present to issue commissions to men other than those we have at present in the Army, and in their case, unless they take the oath which is in addition to the Act of last year, then they will be deemed to have been demobilised or to have resigned in that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is merely re-stating the position which he has already given to the Dáil.  I am rather asking why the distinction should be made.  You have soldiers and officers at present in the Army. You are proposing new legislation which changes the terms of the oath in both cases.  In the one case an officer who declines or neglects to take the oath is deemed to have resigned, but in the other case there is no option, or <Col N="2858" /> may we take it, that in both cases neglect to take the oath will mean freedom to demobilise oneself.  A soldier may demobilise himself by neglecting to take the oath.  Is that, I ask, the position? Further, on the question of the distinction between the term of service, the Minister states that in the case of a soldier it is a contract of service, and that it is not proposed, he says, to vary the conditions.  That, I suggest, does not affect the case.  The Minister may not propose it, but his successor may.  I want to know, supposing the Minister's successor proposes to change the terms of service, which apparently he is entitled to do, without reference to the soldier, when a contract has been entered into, the soldier must be deemed to have been aware of the terms of that contract, and if a variation takes place during the terms of service, then may we take it that the contract has been broken on the side of the State, and that the soldier is no longer bound by this contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The soldier's enlistment is not completed until he has taken the oath, and the fact of his enlistment or, at least, the mode of the attestation, is set out in Section 148. On the other hand, Section 148 does not exhaust it.  If you look at Section 149 it is found that the soldier may, as it were, buy himself out.  In the case of the officers, who are at present in the Army, it is proposed to issue commissions to them.  Properly speaking, they have not got these commissions at present, although gazetted to commissioned ranks.  As soon as the Act is passed it is proposed to issue a proclamation by the Executive Council, and these commissions will be issued, and it is necessary for the officers to take the oath.  In the case of the men, it is necessary to do it before enlistment, and they are not enlisted until they have taken the oath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the President if he could give us any information as to why any change should have been required in the principal Act in connection with these matters of punishment and courtsmartial, and so on.  A little information as to why within the last year and for a period of only a very few months, it is required to make these very considerable changes should be given to the House and would, I think, help us to understand perhaps, what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In Clause 21 the maximum fine is reduced from £5 to £3; that might have been imposed on a summary conviction by a commanding officer, and the fine is reduced.  The prescribed officer who, it is intended will be a G.O.C., can reduce or remit the punishment awarded by a Commanding Officer.  In cases of rates of pay, the accused has a right to elect to be tried by courtmartial.  In the case of Section 22, Section 82 of the Act provides for the punishment which may be awarded to a private soldier by a Commanding Officer, and practically the same provisions are made&mdash;that is, the reduction of the fine, and so on, are provided for.  Now, as regards Section 23, Section 83 of the Act provides for the punishment which may be summarily awarded to a private soldier by a Company Commander.  This clause is a result of the change in the organisation <Col N="2861" /> of the Army, and also is a result of the experience gained in working of the disciplinary code in the Army for the last 12 months.  The Army, as reorganised, does not provide for a Commanding Officer and a Company Commander for each unit.  Experience has shown that it is desirable that the Commanding Officer should be ordinarily the proper person to investigate a charge against a soldier.  Provision is made by Clause 27 enabling Commanding Officers in certain cases to delegate powers of summarily disposing of cases to officers serving under them.</P>
      <P>Section 24 deals with Section 84, which provides for the manner in which a charge against an officer is to be investigated. This section re-enacts that, with certain modifications&mdash;that is, such a case as that in which a commanding officer himself might be the person charged.  Paragraph (b) is consequential on the previous paragraph, and (c) introduces the accused's right to elect to be tried by court-martial in cases where an award or punishment would affect pay.  Generally speaking, most of these amendments have been made as a result of experience which we have gained during the last twelve months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing, I would like to ask the Minister to consider the position of the soldiers under this Bill for the period preparatory to the bringing forward of a new permanent measure.  The Minister has said that these amendments have been found necessary in consequence of the experience of the last twelve months. Now, inasmuch as the law relating to the Defence Forces is the law relating to soldiers in the Army, one would naturally expect that the experiences those soldiers themselves gained should have something to say to the permanent measure which will govern the conduct of the Army.  The experiences of the Headquarters Staff may be one thing, the experiences of the soldiers themselves will be quite another, and it seems to me that the interim between now and the permanent measure should be availed of to enable the soldiers themselves to give expression in some way to what they consider unjust or unfair or impracticable in the conduct of the service so far as they are concerned, and more particularly when it comes to the question of discipline and disciplinary measures, punishments and the like.  Soldiers are precluded under the terms of their declaration, or oath, from subscribing to or becoming members of any political society or organisation whatsoever, and I want it to be made clear by the Minister himself that that does not preclude soldiers from expressing their views upon what is requisite to the proper conduct of the Military Forces, in so far as the law affecting soldiers is concerned.  If we are to understand how a measure of this kind affects a soldier, then that soldier must be free to express his dissatisfaction, or his sense of injustice, or to make suggestions as to alterations of the law, which, in fact, is a political effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Minister to make distinct <Col N="2863" /> here that when we say a soldier is not to be a member of or to subscribe to any political society or organisation whatsoever, that that does not preclude him, or any number of soldiers, from making representations in regard to a political measure, such as the Defence Forces Bill, and that it will not be deemed to be insubordination for soldiers to make representation regarding the terms of the Act under which they are working and living.  There must be, I think, and there ought to be, some means whereby the legislature should be made aware of the soldiers' grievances, and if they are precluded by virtue of any oath or regulation from making representations in regard to the incidence of Acts of Parliament, then they are practically helpless things in a machine.  I suggest to the Minister that he should make it clear to the Army, to those at least who are likely to continue to serve, who are not likely to be demobilised in the next month or two, that their experiences of the disciplinary terms and conditions under which they are working should be given expression to if they desire, so that when we come to deal with a permanent measure we shall have not only the views of the Headquarters Staff and the Ministry itself, but also the people who are obliged to obey the rules laid down and the conditions prescribed by the law.  I think that it must be understood that this measure, as the last measure, the Principal Act, as it is called, is temporary, and that the permanent Act will have to receive very much more careful consideration from the Oireachtas.  In giving it that consideration we ought to have knowledge of the experience, not only of the Headquarters, but of the rank and file of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put down two amendments.  I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1. To insert before Section 9, page 9, a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  If any person who has paid tax charged under an assessment to income tax made for any year under Schedule D, or according to the Rules applicable to that Schedule, alleges that the assessment was excessive by reason of some error or mistake in the return or statement made by him for the purposes of the assessment, he may, at any time not later than three years after the end of the year of assessment within which the assessment was made, make an application in writing to the Revenue Commissioners for relief.</P>
      <P>(2)  On receiving any such application the Revenue Commissioners shall inquire into the matter and shall, subject to the provisions of this section, give by way of repayment such relief (including any consequential relief from super-tax) in respect of the error or mistake as is reasonable and just:</P>
      <P>Provided that no relief shall be given under this section in respect of an error or mistake as to the basis on which the liability of the applicant ought to have been computed where the return or statement was in fact made on the basis or in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time when the return or statement was made.</P>
      <P>(3)  In determining any application under this section the Revenue Commissioners shall have regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case, and in particular shall consider whether the granting of relief would result in the exclusion from charge to income tax or super-tax of any part of the profits or income of the applicant, and for this purpose the Commissioners may take into consideration the liability of the applicant and assessments made on him in respect of other years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2866" /> (4)  Any person who is aggrieved by the determination of the Revenue Commissioners on an application made by him under this section may, on giving notice in writing to those Commissioners within twenty-one days after the notification to him of their determination, appeal to the Special Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(5) The Special Commissioners shall thereupon hear and determine the appeal in accordance with the principles to be followed by the Revenue Commissioners in determining applications under this section, and subject thereto, in like manner as in the case of an appeal to them against an assessment under Schedule D, and the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to such an appeal (including the provisions relating to the statement of a case of the opinion of the High Court on a point of law) shall apply accordingly with the necessary modifications:</P>
    <P>Provided that neither the appellant nor the Revenue Commissioners shall be entitled to require a case to be stated for the opinion of the High Court otherwise than on a point of law arising in connection with the computation of profits or income.</P>
    <P>The object of this proposal is to bring the Finance Bill into conformity with the Finance Act that exists in England.  The position under the Bill is this, that where an assessment is made under Schedule D, if an appeal be not lodged against that assessment within 21 days, the assessment becomes final.  Under Section 24 of the British Act, any taxpayer&mdash;and if this amendment is passed we will have the same privileges here&mdash;can reclaim any tax paid through error, or from any other causes in making his return.  It is hardly necessary in these days in this country to point out the reasonableness of such a provision as is now proposed.  Many people on whom these assessments were made have left the country.  In other cases our postal arrangements are not exactly in an ideal state.  One might cite many reasons why it is very undesirable that <Col N="2867" /> where an appeal against an assessment should be made within twenty-one days, that, in the circumstances I have pointed out, it would be quite unfair to enforce these conditions, and for that reason I propose that this additional section should be added.  It will put the income taxpayer in the Free State in exactly the same position as the income taxpayer is in England, where the same conditions that I have cited do not prevail.</P>

      <P>This amendment is, I think, a copy of Section 24 of the British Finance Act of last year, with the substitution of the words &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; for &ldquo;Commissioners of Inland Revenue.&rdquo;  It is one of two sections in that Act.  One section gives certain additional powers to the Revenue, and another gives certain additional privileges to the taxpayer. Deputy Good has proposed a section which gives certain privileges to the taxpayer.  It has been the practice for a good many years past to repay the taxpayer any tax overpaid by him in error, and the section will only give him as a legal right what he has got in practice in the past.  There are, however, one or two slight emendations which, I think, would be necessary.  As we do not propose, at present at any rate, to take the additional powers for recovery of penalties which were taken by the British in the Act of 1923, I do not think that it is desirable that we should give what may be in some cases six years for the making of the application. Then, as the law stands at present, if this amendment were passed, we would give an additional appeal in this case beyond the appeal in England.  We would give an appeal not merely to the Commissioners but to the Circuit Court.  In these matters of errors I do not think it is necessary that we should have an appeal to the Circuit Court, and have the litigation and delays that are likely to rise.  If Deputy Good would accept a couple of small emendations which I would suggest, I will be prepared to take the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Good to insert <Col N="2868" /> the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;within&rdquo; in the third last line of paragraph 1, so that it would read: &ldquo;he may, at any time, not later than three years after the end of the year of assessment for which the assessment was made, make an application in writing to the Revenue Commissioners for relief.&rdquo;  In the brackets in paragraph 5, I suggest the insertion of the words &ldquo;but excluding the provisions of Section 196 of the Income Tax Act of 1918,&rdquo; so that it would read &ldquo;(including the provisions relating to the statement of a case of the opinion of the High Court on a point of law, but excluding the provisions of Section 196 of the Income Tax Act of 1918).&rdquo;  If these words were inserted the position in regard to appeals would be the same as in England.  If they were not inserted there would be an appeal to the Circuit Court, for where there is no parallel in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before section 9, page 9, a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Section forty-one of the Income Tax Act, 1918, and Rule 5 of No. V. of Schedule A. (which fix the period within which certain claims for repayment of income tax may be made) shall, so far as relates to claims for repayment in respect of income tax charged for the year 1921-22 or for any subsequent year of assessment, have effect as though a period of six years after the expiration of the year of assessment were substituted for a period of three years after the expiration of the year of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Section twenty-five of the Income Tax Act, 1918 (which grants relief from tax in respect of income <Col N="2869" /> accumulated under trusts) shall, in case of such a contingency as is referred to in that section happening in the year 1921-22 or in any subsequent year of assessment, have effect as though a period of six years after the end of the year of assessment in which the contingency happens were substituted for a period of three years after the end of the year of assessment in which the contingency happens.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any provision of the Income Tax Acts which authorises a claim for repayment of income tax to be made at the end of any year of assessment or within a specified period of less than one year after the end of any year of assessment shall be amended so as to authorise the making of the claim within a period of one year after the end of the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>This proposed new section extends the time for making claims for refunds under the Income Tax Act to six years beginning with the year 1920-21.  The period at the moment is three years. This will bring the Free State Finance Act into conformity with the Finance Act of 1923 which is in existence in Great Britain at the moment.  One might also mention incidentally that the period of six years within which one can make claims is also the period fixed by the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I must resist this proposed new section, because, even more than in the previous case, this is only part of the change which was made in Great Britain.  There were two sections inserted together in the British Finance Act of 1923.  Section 29, which extended from 3 to 6 years the time within which additional assessments or surcharges for 1920-21, or any subsequent year, could be made by the Revenue; and Section 30, which extended the time within which the taxpayer might claim repayment from 3 to 6 years.  This matter was considered by us, and we decided that we could not this year, at any rate, introduce the changes here that were introduced in Great Britain.  The income tax staff here is so heavily worked, from the point of view of dealing with arrears already in existence, that it would be <Col N="2870" /> impossible for them to make use of additional powers such as were taken for the Revenue under Section 29 of the British Act.  Then there is the additional reason that we do not wish to go back now on matters prior to 1922-23, when we took over the income tax collection. If we adopted this proposal it would mean that we would give the taxpayers six years for reclaiming without giving the revenue 6 years in which to make additional assessments or surcharges. We think that if a change is being made the two changes should come about together.  There is another reason.  If this change were made it would automatically involve us in making repayments to taxpayers who had paid to the British, so that, as a matter of fact, we would be repaying money which we had never received.  I do not think that this is particularly desirable. We are inclined to think that a change such as this might be made, and I think that the Deputy may take it that in a subsequent Finance Bill this provision, with the countervailing provision giving the Revenue authorities their 6 years, will be included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, I think the explanation of the Minister is only fair.  To give the privilege to one side, and not extend the same privilege to the Executive, would be unfair.  I think the Minister would be well advised in a few years to try, as far as possible, and keep the taxpayer, from the point of view of privileges in the Free State on the same terms as the taxpayer in Great Britain.  We are anxious that many of those who, owing to high rates of income tax and other reasons, have left the Free State, in many cases taking considerable amount of capital with them, should be encouraged to return and give the advantage of that capital to the Free State.  From that and other points of view I urge that it would be exceedingly desirable in future Finance Bills that the Minister should, as far as possible, in matters of this kind, endeavour to have the Acts prevailing in the two countries as nearly alike as possible. In view of what the Minister has said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will be permitted to say a few words arising out of Deputy Good's remarks.  He has suggested that it should be the policy of the Minister for Finance to approximate the finance schemes of the Free State to that of Great Britain&mdash;in effect, to make of no value the fiscal freedom that we have to develop on our own lines.  If it is to be the policy that Ministers for Finance should make their finance schemes fit in with those of Great Britain, I would suggest to the Minister that it should be rather the contrary, that we should not adopt a finance scheme and make it conform to that of Great Britain, but rather to a very great extent be the opposite to it.  The present scheme is mainly a carry-over scheme from the British scheme.</P>
      <P>The result of it is to impose on the mass of the people as consumers a disproportionate share of the burden of running the State.  The effect of that is that the consumers of the ordinary, common necessaries of life as such are made to bear this disproportionate burden, notwithsanding the pleas made on behalf of income tax payers, notwithstanding what one may speak of as the bitter cry of the income tax payer.  The fact that the poor man and woman who do not pay income tax are taxed upon the necessaries and common luxuries makes them bear an undue burden of taxation.  I suggest to the Minister that the whole plan of the Bill is wrong and should not be continued any longer than is necessary, that so far from carrying over the taxes on sugar and tea and other necessaries which are all imported, it would be better for the State to reduce the taxation on those articles which are not produced at home, and transfer those taxes upon imports, so long as taxes upon imports continue, to articles of the kind that may be produced in this country.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look around for other methods of financing the State, and in taking into account the imposition of taxes for services which are at present rendered, he ought also take into account services that ought to be rendered and are not.  This, no doubt, would cost money, or possibly might cost money, but it would either immediately or eventually become beneficial and of advantage in wealth production to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dissent from the general scheme of this Bill, and would more especially dissent from it if I thought it were likely to be the basis of continued legislation with regard to finance, because it is following out a plan which was adopted by Britain, an industrial country living on the export of manufactured goods and depending for its existence upon the importation of foreign-grown food stuffs.  We in this country have entirely different economic conditions and, therefore, I submit we should have a different system <Col N="2875" /> of taxation and that the taxation scheme should be fitted in, not merely to make it comparatively easy for the Finance Department to rake in money, but should also be designed for the purpose of enlarging the area of cultivation and generally promoting the production of commodities which are consumable and exchangeable within, and outside, this country.  I submit that the scheme of finance ought to have regard, to a very much greater extent than this Bill has, to its re-action in the field of production and it should also differ entirely and utterly from the ideas expressed by Deputy Good. We should rather go counter to the schemes of finance and the raising of revenue that have been adopted in Great Britain.  This cannot be done this year and, no doubt, the Bill will pass without any further comments or alterations, but for fear the Minister is unduly impressed by the arguments of Deputy Good I want to put in the other side of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is the least fear of the Minister being unduly influenced by any remark of mine, but I am influenced by a suggestion which has fallen from Deputy Johnson, who urges, seeing that Great Britain is going in one direction, that it ought to be the policy of those in charge of the finances of the Free State to go in the other direction.  If that means that while Great Britain is maintaining a high rate of income tax at a war level, which is very inadvisable in times of peace, and if Deputy Johnson means that we should go in the opposite direction and get the income tax back to what it ought to be, instead of being on a war rate level, there is no difference whatever between Deputy Johnson and myself, and I heartily support his proposal.  In this question of taxation and the burden of taxation I urge that at least the taxpayer in the Free State should not be put at any disadvantage as compared with the taxpayer in Great Britain.  The reasons why I urge that as a policy are obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last few years the Free State has lost a considerable number of its old citizens as well as a considerable amount of capital.  That is a distinct <Col N="2876" /> disadvantage to the Free State, and I therefore urge, in putting forward these economies, that we should do everything we possibly can to attract back to this country those persons with capital who have left, and everything that places the taxpayer in the Free State at a disadvantage, as compared with the taxpayer in Great Britain, adds to the difficulty of getting those persons and that capital back to the Free State.  One does not want to go into all the grievances from which we suffer, such as high income tax, high postal rates, and high charges of one kind or another which do not exist on the other side to the same extent.  The only attraction at all which the Minister for Finance holds out to those possessed of capital and who left this country, in order that they might come back to the Free State, is a reduction in death duties.  I do not know whether that reduction will be looked upon as a very attractive one on the other side, because my idea is that where people live they generally die, and if he cannot attract them to live in the Free State, I do not think that we will attract them to die here by a reduction of death duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never surprised by Deputy Johnson, but I got nearer to it this afternoon than I normally get, because his speech was more divorced from reality than is customary with him.  I expected him to complain, not that we were following Great Britain too closely, but that we did not follow the present Chancellor of the Exchequer closely enough.  I expected him to ask the Minister for Finance for a reduction in the sugar and tea duties, further than that which has been given, and a reduction on other items which have been taxed, but Deputy Johnson did not take that line. I want to know exactly on which leg Deputy Johnson stands.  Does he believe in increasing direct taxation? Is that his policy, because if so, it is and has been the British policy?  The thing that differentiates British financial policy from that of other countries is the fact that they introduced income tax at an earlier date, and collected it on a very much higher scale than any continental country.  The continental <Col N="2877" /> countries relied on high prices and indirect taxation, while the British, on the other hand, introduced the income tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson does not wish income tax to be done away with, and at the same time wishes to get away from the direct system, the British system, which is an income tax system. Take France, for example.  The system of taxation is indirect, and is largely avoided.  The same thing holds in Italy.  The way money is raised there is by high taxes.  As Deputy Johnson knows, and certainly Deputy Davin knows, you cannot leave the station, at Paris, Milan, or Rome without a man at the gate asking you if you are bringing in any foodstuffs.  That is for the purpose of the municipal <i>octroi</i>, the tax on the import of any foodstuffs. That raises the cost of living for the poor.  Is that Deputy Johnson's policy?  Are we to get away from the income tax and follow that un-British policy?  There was one respect in which I would ask the Minister to follow the French financial policy. At present, if an American visitor takes a house here, tax is levied on the whole of his income if he remains over a certain time.  In France that policy is not followed.  He is taxed with the income he apparently spends in the country on the valuation of his villa and on the income he appears to enjoy.  If he lives in a modest way the tax is a moderate tax, but it is helpful to the Revenue.  If the Minister would, in considering his budget for next year, see the wisdom of making reductions on those lines, the visitors to the Tailteann games might be persuaded to return, and settle here for a longer period.  Or is Deputy Johnson's other alternative that this country should follow the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard it put forward by men whose opinion I value, that the policy of this country should be that of the United States&mdash;high import duties, high prices and high wages.  I am sure from what I can now remember of the Governor-General's speech&mdash;it is a long time ago since I read it&mdash;that that is not the policy of the Government.  Is that Deputy Johnson's policy, and is that the horse he declares to win on? <Col N="2878" /> If so, I would ask him to bear in mind the difference between a Continent largely undeveloped, with huge mineral resources, and a somewhat over-populated island, which has at present very little resources beyond that of agriculture, backed by a little distilling and brewing.  Until our conditions are better, it is impossible to adopt a policy of that kind.  It may be that tentative measures introduced by the Minister in this Finance Bill may help to an industrial revival.  If that is so, let us help to develop the country, and then the time may come for Deputy Johnson's proposal.  The time has not yet come, and it is chimerical when we reflect that across an imaginary land frontier there is another fiscal system in operation.  You cannot draw an imaginary line there, and it is impossible that we cannot be influenced by that.  In some cases there are men who have to pay under both systems.  In many cases there are people with financial interests in both countries, and they do what Deputy Good says&mdash; they go and spend their money, and the interest of their money, in the country where it pays them best.  That is human nature.  Speaking for myself, if I may take a personal instance, Deputy Johnson has frankly warned me of his intentions with regard to income tax.  On the day he becomes Minister for Finance I shall get out of this country with all I can take.  He can confiscate all I may leave behind, but that will not be worth more than three years' income tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking seriously, I think Deputy Johnson's proposals tend to additional insecurity and unsettlement, such as have done a lot of harm in the last four or five years.  We want to dissipate that atmosphere, and the Government have done a great deal in that direction.  Let them be prepared to <Col N="2879" /> meet those arguments to realise that there is something behind them, and it may be that there will be a fulfilment in ten or twenty years time, but Deputy Johnson's desires now would mean nothing but disaster.</P>

      <P>There is one small point I would like to draw attention to.  It is a matter for the future rather than the present.  I refer to the question of insisting on stamps on receipts for wages, which is the custom at the present time.  I refer especially to that practice so far as it refers to Government servants.  It may be argued when a man is paid his salary for a month, and has to pay 2d. for a stamp he has not very much of a grievance.  I do not say he has very much of a grievance, but there are other cases where a man, such as in the Post Office, etc., is paid weekly wages, and has to pay for a 2d. receipt stamp on his weekly receipt.  I think that is an unfair tax.  Many of those from whom such a tax is demanded have a small wage, and it is necessary for them to look into every penny.  I think that matter ought certainly be considered by the Government.  It is a question of a tax of something like 8/- or 9/- a year on those small wage earners. In the case of those who get a weekly wage, I would like the Minister to consider that position.  I would like him to see if there would not be some way by which the payment of this tax could be discontinued.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that if this is the law now, and that we cannot get out of it in any other way, it could be managed by paying bi-weekly.  I am sure that would be looked on by the particular people concerned as an advantage from another point of view.</P>

With regard to the point raised by Deputy Bryan Cooper about the millionaires, I do not think he is quite well informed.  As a matter of fact, a millionaire would be taxed on his whole income only if he were domiciled here.  If he were merely resident, <Col N="2880" /> he would be taxed on the amount remitted, so that I do not think that any millionaire who may come will have very much to complain of.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is merely a small provision to remedy what, I think, is an oversight in the Bill&mdash;that no provision has been made for the Counties of Leitrim and Kerry, where there are now no county councils.  I want to secure that the ratepayers in those counties shall have the same benefits, such as they are, given by this Bill, as the ratepayers in other counties.  I might follow the example of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Trade Loans Bill, and give a much more subtle description of <Col N="2881" /> a county council, but I think this, which is a plain, simple, but, possibly, not legal definition, conveys the meaning sufficiently.</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;County Council,&rdquo; which is set out in the Bill, is a definition by exclusion.

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to ask the reason for leaving out the county boroughs, because, in some cases, the county boroughs contain a great deal of agricultural land within their limits.  I quite agree that it would be most unreasonable if the county borough council in Dublin, or the Commissioners acting for it, were to demand a loan under the provisions of this Act.  But, I believe, in Cork&mdash;I speak subject to correction by those who know the place better&mdash;there is a very considerable amount of agricultural land included within the borough limits.  That was shown by the fact that the Farmers' Party thought it worth while to put up a candidate in Cork at the last election, and I believe he polled a considerable number of votes and was not obliged to forfeit his deposit.  The provision may press hard on <i>bona fide</i> agriculturists living within borough limits and paying heavy rates. Borough rates are invariably higher than the rates on the county-at-large. This may press hard on men like these, and I should like an explanation as to why this course is being adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of agricultural land included in the county boroughs is extremely small.  The valuation would be no more than £10,000 or £15,000, and the rates would be no more than £1,000 or £2,000.  That is the first reason for excluding county boroughs.  Secondly, the problems of agriculturists&mdash;if you like to use that <Col N="2882" /> term&mdash;in the county boroughs, are quite different.  The agriculturist in the county borough is in a different position from the farmer who is living outside the county borough, and whose markets are far away.  The man within the county borough is doing market gardening.  He has to pay higher rates, but if he has he gets the benefit of water, heating, lighting and other things.  He is, therefore, in a different position.  In addition, he gets better prices, as he goes in for market gardening. The problem the ordinary market gardener constitutes is a wholly different problem from the problem which any ordinary farmer in any county constitutes. I agree he has his grievances also.  They are very serious, but they are not grievances of the same kind as those of the farmer outside, and this Bill is intended to deal with the man who is making his living in the ordinary way out of agricultural land.</P>

      <P>There is the other point that there are, I think, only four county boroughs in the Saorstát, leaving out Cork and Dublin.  The valuation of the land is very small, the amount of land is extremely small, and it would require exceptionally complicated and intricate arrangements to make the necessary adjustments.  It is a question really of expediency more than anything else, and the amount of land involved would hardly justify the trouble.  I just learn now that agricultural land in a county borough does not pay more than one-fourth of the rate per £ of the rates payable in the particular county borough.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2&mdash;to delete sub-section (2).  I do so because I think it is very undesirable to encourage the growth of a municipal debt in this country.  At present we are fairly free from it.  We may have large schemes in the future that will need development by borrowing, and it would be well to keep our hands as free as possible.  If you say to a county council, or a body of that kind, that it can borrow under this Act, and that the amount it shall borrow shall not count as part of its total debt, you are to that extent giving veiled encouragement to borrowing.  You are giving the idea that if any such need occurs in the future, a similar stipulation may be put into a Bill, so that they can continue to borrow.  The Minister may say that the statutory powers of borrowing which these bodies enjoy are very small and very limited.  That is so.  They are extremely limited, but I think that should be dealt with as a question by itself in a Local Government Bill, and that we should not continually have these saving clauses put into Bills dealing with other matters, and saying that the loans shall <Col N="2884" /> not be reckoned as part of the total debt of a county council.  The general policy of the Government with regard to debt has been to avoid creating debt wherever possible.  The Minister for Finance has not borrowed to anything like the extent he should.  I think it is rather a pity in a matter of this kind to reverse that policy and to put in a provision which will inevitably be in the nature of a veiled encouragement to county councils to increase their debt.</P>

As the Deputy has pointed out, the borrowing powers of these councils is not very great, and I think, in an important Bill of this kind, which deals to a certain extent with questions outside the scope of the county councils, that nothing should be done to interfere with the powers they at present possess.

There may be some county councils who for various reasons have had to borrow considerable sums of money, and if they want to give relief under this Bill they may be unable to do it without further borrowing.  I think it would be most undesirable that the amendment should be inserted.  On the other hand, there are other county councils which have very little debt, and it would not affect them to any great extent.  There are some county councils in the Saorstát which had to borrow in recent years, and if this amendment were accepted it would handicap them and perhaps nullify the effect of this Bill.</P>

If, as I think, some of the county councils have very nearly exhausted their borrowing powers, of course this Act will be of no use to those councils.  To the extent that the councils have used up their borrowing <Col N="2885" /> powers, acceptance of the amendment would mean that the Act is not going to be of any use to these councils.  I would ask Deputy Bryan Cooper, when continuing this discussion, if he will tell us, or if he can tell us, how it will affect the county councils, assuming that the county councils still desire to use this Bill for the purpose of borrowing money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment means that loans borrowed under this section shall be repaid in 10 years instead of 7 years. I put it down because, after the Minister's speech on the Second Reading, I find no reason to hope that the agricultural depression will have passed in 7 years, or that the county councils will be in a much better position to repay than they are now.  Agricultural depression usually moves in cycles, and those who observe those cycles know that a cycle lasts usually 12 or 14 years. The present agricultural depression may be said to have begun about 4 years ago, possibly five years.  The Minister's proposal would, therefore, bring it within the minimum limit of the cycle, while my amendment would extend it to the maximum.  While I do not want to upset any arrangements made with the Bank&mdash;and, of course, it will be optional to the Bank or anybody making the loan to stipulate 7 years, which is only a statutory limitation&mdash;I think a little more latitude <Col N="2886" /> would be wise and would work better in administration.

      <P>I would press this amendment on the Minister for very much the same reason as I objected to the last amendment.  There are many councils, both urban and county councils, who have borrowed money for different stated periods.  Owing to the difficult circumstances in which these councils have been placed they have not been able to meet their instalments, and I think the principle that this amendment involves is a very good one. I might not agree with Deputy Cooper as to the period of ten years, but I certainly approve of the period being extended.  I have certain strong ideas in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will note that the next amendment, Amendment No. 4, deals with this matter. The amendment which will be moved by Deputy Duggan proposes in sub-section (3), line 7, after the word &ldquo;years,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on the 31st day of March, 1925.&rdquo;  If that amendment is accepted, the sub-section will read: &ldquo;A loan borrowed under this section shall be repaid within such period not exceeding seven years from the 31st March, 1925, as the county council may with the consent of the Minister determine.&rdquo;  That is giving little less than 8 years from now so that there is not much between myself and Deputy Cooper.  I previously pointed out that besides the rate-payers and the county councils there are other parties interested in this scheme and they are the banks.  The banks have met us fairly in this matter.  This is not, strictly speaking, a banking proposition. This is not normal banking, but they have met us very fairly, and the Standing Committee have agreed to leave this loan 7 years from the 31st March, 1925, and to have it repaid by annuity.  That is a big concession.  This is not ordinary banking business, and as they are parties without whom this section cannot work I certainly did not feel inclined to press them any further than that.  I would like myself if we could get 10 or 12 years but we must recognise the banking difficulties, in these matters, and the difficulties are <Col N="2887" /> that in ordinary circumstances they would not allow money to be outstanding for such a long period.  In view of that fact and of the fact that without the banks we cannot do business under this Bill, I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks of an arrangement with the banks.  I think it would be interesting and valuable to know what that exactly means. Does it mean that the Minister has consulted the banks <i>en bloc</i> or separately, arriving at a similar agreement? Does it mean that there is an association of bankers which decides these questions; in fact that there is a banking trust.  I know there is an association, but I thought it purported to deal with internal arrangements between the banks.  Now it seems&mdash;unless the Minister can correct it&mdash;there is an association of bankers who will make terms with the Government and I presume that if one bank desires to go better than another that a stop is put to that bank, that its little game is checked and that, as a matter of practice, the banks are able to control the Government, and through the Government, to control the country.  I would like to know definitely from the Minister what exactly he means by saying that he has made an arrangement with the banks and that they have agreed to this.  Is it an arrangement with <Col N="2888" /> each bank separately and independently or is it an arrangement with the banks taken altogether?  If so, is that the common process of making engagements between the Government and Finance Institutions?</P>

      <P>This is a red herring. The fact is this Bill really gives power to a county council to exercise an option.  It may or may not exercise that option.  I thought it good business myself&mdash;on behalf of the county councils, if you like&mdash;to find out whether the banks would, in the event of a county council approaching its particular treasurer, facilitate us in this matter. I took the trouble of writing to the Secretary of the Standing Committee of the banks and asking when their next meeting would be, and whether they could not arrange an interview with me after a meeting of the Standing Committee of the banks.  The Standing Committee of the banks is a committee which includes representatives from all the banks.  They would be all in Dublin on the same occasion, and I found it a convenient time to see them.  I dare say I could have been them one by one, and as a matter of arrangement I could have seen the representatives of the banks when they would be in Dublin at a meeting of the Standing Committee once a fortnight or once a week.  But, as a matter of expediency, I thought it is advisable to see all the representatives of all the banks, and I asked them if a county council came to any of them and sought the facilities which they are entitled to ask for under the Bill would they give the county councils those facilities.  They said they would.  I asked what period for repayment of the loan would suit, and I suggested the number of years set out here, and that was agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all that is in it.  There is nothing to hide and there is nothing to keep back.  We need not have done that at all.  We might have allowed each county council to go to its treasurer.  One bank might say that they would give five or six years; another might arrange eight or nine years; and still another would mention ten years.  It was much more convenient for the county councils to see the banks beforehand and to ask them <Col N="2889" /> to make a uniform arrangement.  That was done.  It is not that the banks limit the number of years; probably the banks will give a greater number of years for the repayment by the county councils than if they had not been approached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I think this is too much.  We have just passed the Committee Stage of a Bill, and though there has been no opposition to it, to ask us now to agree to suspend the Standing Orders in order to take the succeeding stages, no matter how trifling may have been the amendments to the Bill, is asking the Dáil to loose its control.  This is rather a matter of putting a stop to this galloping method, and in the circumstances I am opposing the motion. There is another motion a little later on in regard to another Bill, which is, in my view, much more urgent.</P>
      <P>I think the Dáil will need to be more careful about allowing such Motions as these to pass.  As I said two or three days ago, when we thought we were working to a time-table, there might be some justification for this, but when all that has disappeared, and we are simply asked to gallop through legislation, I urge on the Dáil the necessity for taking a little care and putting a little rein on the Ministerial desire to get through business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will lose anything by postponing this for at least one day, and I would suggest to him that the Dáil would be much more agreeable to take the final stages of the Bill as the first business to-morrow, if he desires to present the Bill to the Seanad then.  I do not know what his intentions are.  I suggest that there is no need to take those further stages to-day without notice.  I am asking the Dáil to oppose the motion because there is no case made for it, and as far as I can, I want to put a stay upon this <Col N="2891" /> method of galloping through legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy means that under no circumstances, good, bad, or indifferent, should the Fourth and Fifth Stages of a Bill be taken.  He may mean that, and there may be something to be said for it.  That is the only attitude consistent with his opposition.  Whether this Bill is good, bad, or indifferent, and whether its defects are small or great, it is an urgent measure.  I know its limitations.  It is only an expedient, and a second-rate expedient at that, but such as it is it is extremely urgent.</P>
      <P>It is a Bill dealing with the collection of this year's rates.  It is obvious demand notes should be sent out as soon as possible, and there should be no holding up of the rate collection. The Bill consists of five sections, and it is extremely simple.  It has been before the Dáil for a month, and Deputies must know every clause of it by heart if they are really interested. Here it is three weeks after being introduced, and there are verbal amendments proposed by myself to the Bill. I do not believe any body really wishes to deny the extreme urgency of the Bill and the necessity for having no holding up of the collection of rates; also, it is a very short and simple Bill. I put it to the Dáil that if the taking of the remaining Stages is justified in any case it is justified in this, and I ask for approval of the Motion which I have on the Order Paper.  Deputy Johnson knows enough about Parliamentary procedure to know that a little time makes a lot of difference, and the getting of the Bill through the Dáil to-day instead of to-morrow would facilitate matters greatly.</P>

This report appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; where it was stated that I opposed this Bill on behalf of the farmers.  What I said was that I accepted the Bill.  We do accept <Col N="2892" /> it as a second rate expedient.  We think that the proper way of relieving the agricultural community is by increasing the agricultural grant.  This is not a grant.  It is a totally different thing altogether.  It is something that we have got to pay back, and pay back with interest, and our point of view is that a grant is the only thing that would meet the situation.  However, there is an effort made to tide us over a difficulty.  Deputy Cooper alludes to this as being within a certain cycle of depression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That will mean that if this Bill is held up in the Seanad there will be no rates collected at all until August.  For that reason I would ask Deputy Johnson to waive his objection.</P>

      <P>There was another amendment to be considered, but no amendment has been introduced on foot of that.  It has been considered.  I read again what Deputy Morrissey said in introducing it, and I came to the conclusion that the amendment had been wrongly worded or else that wrong arguments had been used in putting forward the amendment.  In so far as the amendment meant what it said I repeat again what I said on the last occasion, and that is that the carrying out of the section is done in accordance with what <Col N="2894" /> has been proposed by the amendment. But the arguments used by Deputy Morrissey went further, and urged that men should not be moved from a district where a higher rate of wages prevailed to one where a lower rate prevailed.  That seemed to me to enlarge the right to benefit. I do not think that the enlargement of a right to benefit should take place upon a temporary Bill.  If there are well-founded complaints, then there is time between this and the going of the Bill into the Seanad for some samples of these complaints being sent to me for consideration, and the matter can be gone into, and an amendment may be accepted in the Seanad.  If the second point is what the Deputy has in mind, I do not think that that could be accepted on a merely temporary Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should understand that the complaint which the amendment as originally proposed was intended to remove was that there had been frequent complaints of offers of employment at considerably lower rates&mdash;not merely lower rates, but at a difference which was so great that it was an invitation to the employed person to refuse to accept employment in that low wage district.  The suspicion is that that practice has been adopted in some districts simply for the purpose of striking a man off the lists.  He is invited, in fact, to refuse employment in such a district.  Whether I can produce any considerable number of individual cases I cannot promise, but that the practice prevails I am convinced, in view of a considerable number of general complaints that I have heard from time to time.  I am sorry that I did not notice that that amendment had not been embodied in this Report stage.  I had overlooked the fact that it had been withdrawn, for I thought it had been accepted.  I am sorry now that the matter is to be dealt with in the Seanad.  I will endeavour to bring specific evidence before the Minister, and I have no doubt I would be able to do so if the legislative programme was not so heavy, and we had time.  But unfortunately between one Bill and another we have not time to think about <Col N="2895" /> the Bills, let alone examine them and bring instances forward in support of our amendments.  The chances of a Research Department are very little when dealing with Bills in this manner.  I assure the Minister the complaint which has been spoken of, and which he sought to remedy, is fairly widely held, and it is a grievance which is felt by quite a number of trades and people concerned in the administration of Unemployment Insurance, believing that the administration is weighted against them in that particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's first line of attack is to stress the point about the speed at which legislation is going through this House.  I have before me the fact that time might be required to bring forward complaints, but I have also the very specific statement made by Deputy Johnson on the Third Stage, to the effect: &ldquo;I assure the Minister that if this Bill had not been brought in when it was, he would have had a request from the Executive of the Trades Union Congress, and from the Cork Workers' Council, to receive a deputation on this specific question.  We had a conference to discuss this matter, and I had complaints time and again from many parts of the country, and amongst those complaints this is one of the most insistent.&rdquo;&mdash;[Official Report, 18th June, 1924, column 2567.]</P>
      <P>Surely these cases are ready and can be supplied to me between this and the going of the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday last I listened to the debate on this Bill.  I have come to the conclusion that the Minister for Justice, in company with many of the Deputies who delivered speeches in support of the measure, seems to have become convinced that he and they are dealing with a nation of drunkards, and that Ireland is the home of drunkards. If that is their opinion it is certainly not mine.  I do not believe that Ireland to-day is as bad as the Total Abstinence Association and other organisations of that kind would like to make us believe that it is.  From my travels around I have come to the conclusion that drunkenness has diminished, especially during the last seven or eight years.  Therefore, I do not believe for a moment that any man is justified in supporting a measure of this kind.  Drunkenness has been reduced by, I believe, fifty per cent. in this country, and as far as I am concerned I do not believe that Ireland was ever a very drunken nation.  Section 1 of the Bill prohibits the opening of licensed houses at particular hours, and specifies their closing at particular hours.  Under this section a very grave and unjust hardship will in my opinion be entailed on a very large number of people who compose the marketing community.  For many years, and at the present day we have what are known as a number of night houses. These houses are open to people coming to the city with market produce. They are on practically every road leading to the city, and the people who take advantage of them travel in some cases distances of from 30 to 35 miles, and in some instances as far as 40 miles. It has been customary for a great many years, and the custom prevailed under the existing licensing law, to allow these houses on the main roads leading to the city to remain open until 5 o'clock in the morning.  That was allowed for the purpose of affording men travelling with farm produce to the city an opportunity of getting refreshment, not only for themselves but for their horses.  It was customary for these people to take the horses from <Col N="2898" /> the cars and to give them food and drink, and also to give the animals a couple of hours' rest.  Such a custom is observed in Clonee, which is about twenty-seven miles distant from Dublin. Some of the people who put up there for a few hours during the night travel from near Delvin to the city of Dublin with farm produce.  They do not arrive at Clonee until about 3 o'clock in the morning.  They stop at this house and get refreshments for themselves and also give their horses a couple of hours' rest.  That rest is necessary for the animals as well as for the men themselves.</P>
      <P>As I read Section 1 of this Bill, that custom is going to be abolished.  If these people open their houses now at that hour in the morning and allow men going to the market in to have refreshments, they can be prosecuted if the Civic Guard come along and catch them on the premises.  Therefore, I oppose this section, because I think it is a bad one.  There is another point in this section to which I wish to direct attention. We all know that in country villages and in provincial towns people drive in on Sunday mornings from the country to church.  Up to the present it has been customary with them to put up their horses in the yards attached to licensed premises while they were away at church themselves.  If they were to leave their horses and cars on the public streets, without anyone in charge of them, they would be liable to be prosecuted on the charge of the animals not being under proper control.  Under this section these people, whether bona fide travellers or not, are forbidden to enter licensed premises, even to the extent of putting up their horses and cars while attending church.  Under the Act the yard is part of the licensed premises, and hence people will not be allowed to enter the yard for the purpose of stabling their horses.  That will impose a great hardship on people, and I suggest it is a matter that deserves consideration from the Minister.</P>

In the course of his speech he has made two points, and I am wondering <Col N="2899" /> whether he has read the memorandum which deals with the position as to bona fide travellers.

      <P>It is not definitely specified in the Bill, but I take the position to be as I have stated it, that if people put up their horses and cars in a yard attached to a public house, which, was I understand it, is part of the licensed premises, they will be liable to prosecution if found there during prohibited hours.  Even the publican himself will be open to prosecution for opening his yard gate to allow these people in with their horses and cars.  That is the construction that I put on the reading of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I am wrong, but if I am the Minister will correct me.  I now come to the section dealing with mixed trading.  I believe that this, too, will impose great hardship on people in this country.  I do not want to dwell too long on it, as the majority of Deputies spoke at some length on the section.  Its chances of passing are, I think, very poor, and I intend to oppose the Bill on these two issues. The hours for trading on week-days are from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.  I cannot see how the Minister can reasonably ask the community, as a whole, to accept this particular clause of the Bill, because on every morning in the week there is a fair being held in some part of Ireland.  Many fairs start as early as 3.30 in the morning, but the majority start business at about 4 a.m.  I know that in the Co. Meath several fairs are held at 4 o'clock in the morning. I do not think it is reasonable or fair to ask men who have been walking all night with cattle, and who arrive at a town where a fair is held, to stand on the fair from 4 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock without an opportunity of getting some refreshments. I think that is most unreasonable, and I think the same remark applies to closing on Good Friday, as that is also a <Col N="2900" /> fair day and a general working day in the country, where it is not observed in the same way as in the city of Dublin.  I intend to oppose the Bill on that issue also.  I am not of the same mind as some Deputies on the Labour Benches as regards the employment of female assistants under eighteen years of age in public-houses.  I believe that if a girl is going to take up employment as a barmaid that she ought to be allowed to go into the business house in which she proposes to serve her time at sixteen years of age, so that she may be able to draw a salary when she reaches the age of eighteen.  Under this Bill a girl is denied that opportunity, because under this section she must be eighteen years of age before she is allowed into licensed premises to serve her time, and then she will be twenty years of age before she is entitled to draw a salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many publichouses in which female assistants are employed, and I do not see anything very wrong happening. I do not see girls going to the bad from all the wild talk and dirty language that it is alleged is heard in publichouses.  As far as my experience goes, I do not think employment in publichouses corrupts girls' morals in the least.  If some Deputies who have supported this particular section in the Bill would give us some facts where a particular female shop assistant has gone wrong as a result of the bad things she heard in publichouses, I might be inclined to agree with them, but I do not think there is a Deputy in the Dáil who could give us a concrete statement on that.  All their talk on that was pure theory, and they were merely expressing their own feelings as to what they would do with their own daughters.  Some of them told us that a publichouse is no place for the employment of a girl, but if this section goes through where are the thousands of girls at present employed as barmaids going to find employment if they are not allowed to work in licensed premises.  I do not think it is fair either to prohibit a publican's daughter from serving behind the counter while her father or mother may be absent for ten or fifteen minutes at their tea.  If she is under eighteen <Col N="2901" /> years of age she will not be allowed to go behind the counter while her parents are at their tea.  That would impose a very great injustice, especially on country traders, many of whom are very poor men, and are not in a position to employ assistants.  If this section goes through it will mean that they will have to close up their business altogether.</P>
    <P>I know some publicans and they have to go out and work by the day because the business they do would not be sufficient to support them otherwise. In fact, I know some publicans and they are members of the Transport Union.  I, like Deputy Hogan, do not agree with the section which prohibits a publican from giving credit.  I do not see why we in the Dáil should protect the publican any more than we protect any other class of trader.  I believe that under the common law as it exists at the moment, if a publican serves drink to a man so that he gets blind drunk every day in the week in his shop that he cannot recover the cost of the drink if the man gets drunk by running into debt in his shop.  I ask why the publican has not the moral courage to protect himself by refusing to give drink on credit to such a man as that.  I think the publican should turn over a new leaf and do a cash trade, but at any rate I think we are not here to protect him if he does give credit.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Davin, speaking in support of late opening in the morning, went further than he really might when he found that the worker was the strongest pillar to rest upon in support of his argument.  If he did not exactly say it, at all events he left it to be inferred that no one entered a public house for drink before nine o'clock in the morning but the working man.</P>

      <P>I have drawn that inference anyway, and I certainly say that there is a good deal less drunkenness amongst workingmen than there is amongst wealthy people.  The reasons why they are not drunk in the morning before they go to work are there for anyone to see.  There are many reasons.  In the first instance, they have <Col N="2902" /> not sufficient pay to purchase the necessaries of life for their households, and, secondly, if they go in to work drunk, to Deputy Good, for instance, I guarantee that they will not go in the next morning; he would dismiss them at once.  We have not heard of many of these cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are discussing references that have been made, and I say that this argument is not an argument that should be entertained, because it goes no distance in building up support for this Bill.  I have never seen a man going drunk to his work, and I know very few men who have been in the habit of resorting to the public house before going to work.  Arguments like this are, I think, uncalled for.  I never noticed it, and I was surprised when I heard a Deputy on these Benches making that declaration.</P>

      <P>I think that anyone who ventures on this thorny subject of licensing enters on a very difficult path; in fact, it would require a superman to satisfy the contending factions in this dispute, the extreme temperance people and the licensed trade, and he is a lucky man who can draw a happy mean between the two.  I think this Bill is an honest attempt, so far as it goes, to do that.  There are certain things in it which are open to amendment, but the value to be obtained from the Bill is far in excess of its faults.  I think the section dealing with poteen is very important.  There is no doubt that there is nothing that does more damage to the country and to the minds of the people than this abominable stuff.  The licensing of clubs is also a most valuable thing.  I do not see any reason why they should not be on exactly the same status as the public house, and it is only reasonable that they should be well under control.  I think that the part dealing with the sale of methylated spirits is also an extremely valuable addition. There is no doubt at all that in many parts of the country this pernicious spirit has been drunk extensively, and I am glad to see that the Government is <Col N="2903" /> going to stop it.  There are, of course, as there are in every Bill, things that one would take exception to.  There is the division of the licensed premises into two parts, the separation of the licensed part from the part where other goods are sold, and I think that in the present state of things it would be extremely unfair to ask licensed people to do that.  It would involve enormous cost to carry it out, and it would be obviously most unjust to ask the holders of licenses to do it, except they were to get compensation from the Government, and the Exchequer is not in a state to stand that. Therefore, I cannot support that section, and I understand that the Minister will not insist on it.  I am almost a total abstainer; I am afraid that I would not be accepted by the unco' guid as belonging to them, but nevertheless I hold for the encouragement of temperance as much as possible. But one thing I noticed during the thirty years or so that I sat on a bench of magistrates and tried to administer justice after a sort, was that the majority of cases in the country districts that came before one were cases of drunkenness on Sundays&mdash;and that with the public houses all closed.  It showed that something must have been very wrong.  Of course, we hope, in these days, with an efficient Gárda Síochána, that such a thing will not prevail, but undoubtedly in the old days it was the case.  Certainly before the different courts in which I have been, there was a great deal more drunkenness to be found on a Sunday, when all the front doors were shut, than there was on any other day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came to the conclusion, therefore, that it would be much better to be honest about the thing, and to have the number of houses largely reduced in the country districts, so that they could be under control, and to have them open on Sundays for about two hours, just as they are in the towns, and have it done openly and above board, because it was done.  But we hope that with the new regime that will not be necessary.  I see that the Minister still seeks to allow houses to be opened in certain towns on Sundays for a certain <Col N="2904" /> number of hours, but not in the country districts.  Let it be so; we will see how it acts.  A wand may be swept over the scene and everything may be altered for the good.  I hope it will be so. But my idea is&mdash;and I hope that in the next Bill it will come to pass&mdash;that a large number of licences will be extinguished by payment of compensation, and that there will be greater and better supervision over those that will remain.  I think that that is the fairest way to deal with what is a reasonable and a right trade that should have its chances, like any other trade, but should be under strict control.  I hope that it will be on these lines that licensing in the future will be carried out.  I intend to support the Bill.  Those of my constituents who have approached me on the subject are of my opinion, that the Bill ought to be supported, with the exception of Section 12.  Of course, a good many think that an extra hour on a fair morning, as the Deputy who has just spoken instanced, might be allowed, and I think there is a great deal in it.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that on the Committee Stage.  But, with this and the other exception that I have mentioned, I think the Bill is a very fair attempt to try to improve a very difficult situation, and I hope that it will be improved upon later on by a Bill that will finally settle the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'DOHERTY Mr. O'DOHERTY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister deserves credit for having produced a Bill that has met with such a fair reception from the Dáil, whether from members like myself who object to many clauses, or members who support it and think that it has not gone far enough.  The Minister has made a good case for the Second Reading and deserves to get it.  Many speeches would have been better delivered, I think, on the Committee Stage.  I will confine myself merely to two aspects. Clause 12 has been largely commented on.  I listened very attentively to one of the observations by the Minister when presenting the Bill for Second Reading, and that was the one ending up with the village blacksmith going for a shilling's worth of nails into a mixed house who was liable to be <Col N="2905" /> tempted to spend his money in liquid refreshment instead of buying the nails.  That was a valid but very farfetched excuse.  The second, shall I call it apologia, was that the unemployed question would be affected, and that unemployed would get employment in altering the structures of the houses that would be dealt with under the Bill. I do not know whether or not that would tempt Deputy Johnson to support the Bill.  I am sure that outside that he will give it consideration, but I think that a clause which has only that recommendation is one that should be left out as unsuitable.  The general voice of the Dáil is decidedly against Clause 12, and I trust when it comes up in Committee that the Minister for Justice will take that into consideration and drop it entirely.  Another matter which, as a resident of Dublin, I should like to call the attention of the Dáil to is the question of the added areas in this city.  I have looked into the case presented by people in these areas who wish to be relieved of their grievances, and I think they have made out a strong case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust sincerely when the Bill comes up in Committee that the Minister will give favourable consideration to their claims.  Some of the other clauses are very necessary from my point of view, but from the point of view of the temperance advocate the Bill does not meet the question at all.  The Minister referred to the sociological aspect of it, but the Bill does not meet that aspect completely.  Having found the views of the Deputies, and of those they represent in the country parts, I make the suggestion to the Minister to drop the Bill, and set up a commission representing the divergent interests to thrash this question out, and bring in a complete Bill that will be accepted throughout the country as a whole.  I wish to refer to only one other portion of the Bill, and that is parts 4 and 5, dealing with illicit distillation and methylated spirits.  It seems to me, from my knowledge of these subjects, that if the Minister made these two offences so that they could be dealt with under the criminal law he would have the support of the Dáil.  Certainly he deserves the thanks of this Dáil for having dealt <Col N="2906" /> with them in the manner he has done. I support the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to prolong the discussion much, but I wish in the first place to enter a protest against having the Bill introduced at this stage.  We in the Dáil who have endeavoured to keep in touch with the legislation passing through find it almost impossible to become really conversant with the Bills poured on us from day to day.  The result is that Bills pass through with which we are not thoroughly acquainted.  I believe it is the duty of any Deputy who wants properly to perform the work for which he is sent here to be conversant, as far as is in his power, with the details of the Bills passed through the Dáil.  This is a highly contentious measure of social reform for which there should be ample time given, not only to the Dáil but to the people of the country, to discuss and hammer out what they consider would be the best system of temperance reform.  I do not know why the Bill was introduced at this stage.  The Minister probably has his reasons for doing so, but I think the reforms advocated in it are not sufficient to justify the time of the Dáil being taken up at this stage of the sittings when Deputies are tired perhaps of poring over the different Bills, and when this measure will not get the proper consideration which it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, I am inclined to think that it is only right to give a measure of support to any reforms which will tend to improve the social life of the country, as far as the use of intoxicating liquors is concerned.  I am not at all sure that the reforms are of any great importance, and that there will be any wonderful change in the conditions of the country as regards the consumption of drink.  My knowledge of the country is, as far as intoxication is concerned, that the people have improved enormously within recent years.  I know it was quite a common thing at one time to see many drunken men in the streets of Dublin.  Now it is very rare to see such a thing happen.  It is a saying down in the country that Lloyd George was the greatest reformer that ever attempted to deal with the temperance <Col N="2907" /> question.  His system was by the increase of taxation on drink; he made it almost impossible for the average man to get more than he could bear. This Bill evidently is an attempt to deal with the problem to a certain extent. I think it is the duty of those who are endeavouring to secure a measure of temperance reform to give it a conditional measure of support.  I am prepared to do that, but there are certain sections I do not approve of, and which I think capable of amendment in Committee.  In particular I refer to section 12, which has been so much discussed.  My objection to that section is not that the idea in itself is not a good one, for I believe it is, but I do not believe that it is feasible or just to carry it out in the existing circumstances.  I think the ideal the Minister is aiming at is a correct one, but as the Bill stands it will be inequitable and it will hit the people who should not be hit.  The poorer publicans will be forced to carry out these reforms, while the larger and richer publicans will not.</P>
    <P>They will be forced to carry out these structural alterations in houses which are not, in many cases, architecturally suited to such alterations.  I know myself of a public house which, perhaps, corresponds to the Minister's example, where nails can be purchased at one side of the house and drink at the other.  It is a long, narrow public house, with buildings at each side, and, as far as I can see, it would be a physical impossibility to make the alterations which the Minister demands even with the thinnest possible partition. Such being the objections to that section, the support which I give to the Bill is conditional on amendment of that section.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prohibition of the employment of girls under 18 in a bar, I have no objection to that section provided it does not forbid the employment of the members of the family of the owner of the premises.  If that is the intention I think it would actually be impossible to carry it out.  It would be quite impossible for the owner of a public house to avoid having his children attend at the bar on rare occasions.  If that section is not <Col N="2908" /> eliminated, at least, amendments ought to be put forward which would have the effect of allowing the members of the family of the publican to attend in the bar when required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support the Second Reading of the Bill, because I agree with most of its provisions&mdash;not all, but practically all.  I think that the hours which are proposed in the Bill are reasonable.  The demand, if there is a demand, ought to be for reasonable refreshment and facilities for reasonable refreshment and no more.  I maintain that under the provisions of the Bill such facilities are available.  It has been said with some truth that to introduce a Bill of this kind at this stage of the session is not treating the matter fairly, or as it should be treated.  We cannot fail to remember, however, that a Bill somewhat on these lines was introduced this time last year and dropped.  Certainly the question in all its bearings has been before the country for a considerable time.  In any case, it is quite evident on the face of it that this measure proposes only to deal with the fringes of the question, and does not purport to be by any means the last word in licensing legislation.  Even if this Bill is passed now there will still, in my opinion, be a necessity for a Commission to go into the whole question of our licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated, I think the hours of working are reasonable.  I do not profess to be intimately acquainted with the licensing laws, but I do believe there are provisions whereby exceptional licenses may be obtained for exceptional purposes.  In such cases as those mentioned by Deputy Hall I do not think there is any great grievance. If the Deputy tells me that a fair starts at 3.30 or 4 in the morning, and that, therefore, it is necessary to open the publichouses to accommodate the people who come to the fairs, I would retort that it is far more reasonable to arrange that the fair would not open at such an unreasonable hour.  I never could see the reason for having fairs at such unseasonable hours as 3.30, 4 or 5 a.m.  Undoubtedly that was the practice in the old days, but it has died out to a considerable extent. <Col N="2909" /> Even under the present arrangements a man has to wait until 7 o'clock before he can get a drink, and if he has patience to wait that length he will not have a very great grievance if he has to wait for another hour or two.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the Bill which I strongly commend, and that is the section which prohibits the sale of drink to young persons under eighteen. I also approve of the regulation to prevent young girls under eighteen being employed in a bar.  I have doubts as to whether that should not be extended to young boys under eighteen.  Indeed, I think it would be advisable.  If it is wrong to sell drink to children under eighteen, it is wrong to have such children selling drink, and I make no distinction whatsoever in the case of the owner's children.  If it is wrong to have a young girl employed at that work, it is wrong for the publican to put his own daughter to that work.  It has been said that the publican might find it necessary to leave his daughter in charge of the shop while he was having a cup of tea.  The sacrifice will not be very great if that is all the sacrifice he will have to make, because he will be able to find someone to look after the shop while he is away.</P>
    <P>I approve of the proposal with regard to clubs.  I never could see the reason why there should be special facilities given to clubs for the sale of drink.  A club is supposed to be an establishment for a purpose other than the sale or consumption of spirituous liquor.  I am greatly afraid that there are, at least, some clubs that seem to have quite misconceived that idea.  If one can draw conclusions from practice, the sole object, sometimes, seems to be the consumption of liquor.  I quite agree that a club, such as a golf club, might be in a different position from some clubs established for indoor amusement.  In neither case can the claim be made for an extension of facilities for the sale of drink.  Reasonable facilities are allowed under the provisions of this measure.  I have grave doubts as to the wisdom of licensing clubs at all.  I do not suggest that drastic measures should be taken to prevent the licensing of clubs, but I have very grave doubts of the wisdom <Col N="2910" /> of that practice.  If men cannot come together for social enjoyment without feeling compelled to purchase intoxicating drink I think there is very little to be said for them.  I have yet to find a club, and it is not a popular club, I am sure, where refreshments, other than intoxicating drinks, are supplied.  If the supply of drink at clubs is purely as refreshments, that is a genuine reason, but one would naturally think that other forms of refreshment would sometimes be substituted. We know that that is not the case.  I do not pretend for a moment to be in favour of total abstinence.  I believe in reasonable facilities being provided for reasonable refreshment. I do not believe in anything more than that.  We heard one or two Deputies saying, and we have often heard it outside, that you cannot make people sober by Act of Parliament.  Even people who use that argument here will readily vote for the sections prohibiting illicit distillation, and dealing with methylated spirits.  They believe that you can prevent the abuses under that head by Act of Parliament.  I hold that you can equally prevent, by Act of Parliament, the other abuses which, undoubtedly, occur under other heads.</P>
    <P>As the section dealing with mixed trading stands in the Bill, I cannot support it, not because I do not agree with the principle, but, as Deputy Heffernan stated, because I think it would be an undue hardship on people at present engaged in that business.  There is also the fact that the construction of very many of these houses makes it almost impossible to make the structural alterations suggested in the Bill.  That does not say that the principle is not a good one.  It is a good one, and, I think, something might certainly be done on the lines suggested by Deputy Corish; that some kind of temporary partition of the place where drink is sold should, as far as is reasonable, be insisted upon.  In a great many cases, I believe that could, and should, be done.  The suggestion made by Deputy Johnson, that longer time should be given than is suggested in the Bill for making these alterations, is also one that I think the Minister might consider. I think that no new licences should be granted in future to any <Col N="2911" /> houses in which mixed trading is carried on.  That should be insisted upon. In the remodelling of houses, and in cases where transfers of licences are applied for, perhaps, it would be possible to insist that some such provision as this would be inserted in the Bill. As I said in the beginning, I think the Bill is a reasonable attempt, and no more than reasonable, to bring about better conditions in the sale of intoxicating liquor.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been rather fully discussed, and I am wondering what was the net effect left on the mind of the average Deputy by the discussion.  In a matter of this kind I am not claiming to be unbiassed or unprejudiced. I am naturally prejudiced in favour of this set of provisions which I bring forward after very full investigation of the subject, and after very full inquiry of all channels available to me, but I am asking myself the question as to what exactly is the net effect left on the mind of the Deputy who is not placed as I am, and who has listened here in the last few days to the discussion on this Bill.  Certainly the effect left in my mind is that the discussion shows how very, very little of substance, how little of pith or reality can be urged against the set of provisions and the proposals which the Bill contains.  Some Deputies spoke, quite obviously, not having read the Bill or even the explanatory memorandum which is prefixed.  There is a rather striking unanimity on two parts of the Bill&mdash;Part 4, dealing with illicit distillation, and Part 5, dealing with methylated spirits.  I think one would be justified in drawing from that the conclusion that we have in the Dáil no Deputy who has fallen a victim either to poteen or methylated spirits, and so far as it goes that is eminently satisfactory. There was not anything like unanimity with regard to the other <Col N="2912" /> three parts&mdash;Part 1, dealing with the question of hours; Part 2, of a rather general nature, and Part 3, embodying certain regulations with regard to clubs.</P>
      <P>Deputies will find in the memorandum, and I think it natural to refer to it again, the exact changes proposed with regard to hours.  On week days, other than Saturdays, the existing hours are from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. in cities and towns with a population over 5,000, and elsewhere in the country from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.  That means really that for the greater part of the country on these week days the proposed hour of closing is not any earlier than the existing hour of closing.  Its real effect is an alteration of one hour, in cities and towns with a population of over 5,000.  When Deputies start slinging adjectives about, and waxing rhetorical it is always well for some one to bring them back to actual facts, and the actual proposals, and I am going to go through this memorandum briefly. As I say, that is the effect on weekdays other than Saturdays&mdash;an earlier closing by one hour.  On Saturdays what is the effect?  The existing hours are from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. in towns and cities with a population of over 5,000, and from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. elsewhere, so that the result of the proposal in the Bill will be that cities and towns with a population of over 5,000 will close half an hour earlier than under the existing law, and elsewhere in the country there is an extension of half an hour.  On Sundays there is no change except the change referred to lower down in the memorandum, namely, that during the period from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. drink may not be sold. On the Committee Stage if any Deputy has the hardihood to put down an amendment dealing with that I am prepared to discuss it very fully.  I think it is an admirably proper provision and a provision that the members of any and every church in the country should agree with&mdash;that these morning hours in which Divine Service takes place in the various churches ought to be hours in which the public houses would not be open for the sale or consumption of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to those days in which complete closing is proposed, there <Col N="2913" /> again, there can be discussion.  On Good Friday, of course, I think there will be very little comment or controversy. There was always complete closing on Christmas day, so that there is no change in regard to that.  Any little comment there was turned on the question of St. Patrick's Day.  There are two points of view there.  Many people in the country hold the view which extended for a long time back that there ought to be complete closing on St. Patrick's Day if only as a matter of sentiment.  Deputies have said that drunkenness is not prevalent in the country at the moment.  If it is agreed that there was a time when drunkenness was prevalent in the country then a complete closing of licensed premises on the National Festival would at any rate, mark the turning of backs on such a state of affairs and give some expression to that sentiment which we all mouth freely enough, that we are in favour of a sober and temperate country and that we have no future along any other path.  The number of Deputies who managed to combine strong temperance views with an advocacy of unlimited facilities for drinking, rather surprised me and disappointed me in this debate.</P>
    <P>We are told that drunkenness is not prevalent in the country.  That, of course, is a question of standards.  It is somewhat a relative question.  In the course of the year 1923 there were arrested in the metropolitan area for drunkenness 674 men and 734 women, a total of 1,408 persons.  That marks an increase on the year 1921 of 150 arrests.  Now there is drunkenness and drunkenness, and Deputies know that the Metropolitan Police, in practice, only make arrests for drunkenness where a person is obviously incapable of taking care of himself and making his way home in safety.  Yet in the last year there were 1,408 arrests for drunkenness in the Metropolitan Police area.  In the month of May in the current year there were 137 arrests as compared with 150 in April.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have their own points of view about these figures as to whether they are good, bad or indifferent, but I do submit that, remembering that arrests are only made of persons obviously incapable of looking <Col N="2914" /> after themselves, those figures reflect badly on the sobriety of the city. There are stages of drunkenness.  I saw somewhere that a person is only theologically drunk when he is in that condition that he would go to light his pipe at a tap.  You can take it that those arrests are arrests of people who would very nearly go to light their pipes at a tap.  Deputies should be quite clear on the question of restrictions and hours as to the exact effect of the proposals.  If they keep that in mind we should have an end of the extravagant language used in the Second Reading of the Bill.  Moving on to Part II. of the Bill, you had a few sections on which there was some slight comment.  You had Section 8.  Very little exception was taken to Section 7. I am aware of the views that exist about Section 8.  You have on one side the picture of the working man coming home to his dinner, his wife busy preparing and laying his dinner for him, and his son or daughter of fourteen or fifteen years of age being sent out for a pint of porter or a bottle of stout. That is one aspect of the thing.  Some Deputies spoke to me about that section, and from the trend of what they had to say I gathered that the objection lay in the possibility of children taking some of the liquor on the way back between the shop and the home. I do not think that that is the objection of the temperence people.  It is not what I gathered from them.  I think the objection is to familiarising growing boys or girls with a public house. They get to know the habits and the lie of the place, and when the boy of 14, 15 or 16 grows into a youth of 18 or 19 he will go there on his own business where he formerly went on his father's business.  I think that is the gist of the objection, and it is for Deputies, when we come to consider this section more in detail, to weigh well whether there is substance or reality in that objection.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy McGoldrick is the only Deputy who took strong exception to Section 10, which deals with the consumption of liquor on premises which are only licensed for consumption off the premises.  Deputy McGoldrick thinks that is harsh, and that when people have been granted a particular <Col N="2915" /> kind of licence on condition that they will sell only for consumption off the premises, it is a great hardship that when those conditions are thrown to the winds, smashed and trampled upon, there should be a removal of the licence. That is a matter of opinion, too.  I do not know whether many Deputies will share Deputy McGoldrick's opinion on that matter.  It seems to me that when the conditions are broken the only and obvious remedy is the withdrawal and forfeiture of the licence.  Coming, then, to Section 12, Deputies had, of course, as I expected, a great deal to say about Section 12, and will, no doubt, in further stages of the Bill have a great deal to say.  I am not objecting to that.  On the contrary, it is a section that would need very full consideration and discussion. I have my own strong and definite views, and because I wish to put those views to the Dáil I have left that section in the Bill, although I am assured that it is not a section which meets with the approval of the Party which supports the Government.  I am in the position that I will simply put that section to an open vote of the Dáil. It is a matter that has more aspects than one.  I stressed some of the aspects on speaking previously on this Bill.  I think the public are entitled to be served other than in this manner at this hour of the day.  I think people who are carrying on this business have done well enough out of the public to justify the public in demanding that there shall be a change for the future.</P>
    <P>Remember, this is all on a basis of service to the community, and the community is, I submit, entitled to take this stand, that they shall be served somewhat differently in the future, that their children, boys and girls, going in on household messages, shall not be in the position of having to go in through beershops.  Then there is the other point of view, the point of view of the temptation to the man of the house himself, going in on household messages&mdash;that there should be some little partition, some separation, so that if he were to decide to have a drink that would be a decision rather <Col N="2916" /> than simply a yielding to irresistible impulse or temptation.  There is still another aspect, and it is this; that the previous administration here, the British administration, simply dealt out licences through the country in a very reckless and very haphazard manner, with very little consideration of the real interests of the country and of the people of the country.  That is admitted upon all sides.  It is admitted by the traders themselves.  No one contends that 15,000 public houses are needed for the reasonable refreshment of the Irish people, and there is a further result.  It is not merely the question of the superfluity of public houses.  You have all through the country this system of one business eking out the other, and it has been contended time after time, that neither can survive alone.  What does that point to?  If it is true, it simply means that you have in this country an utterly unsound economic position; that back through the last twenty, thirty or forty years there has been a steady multiplication of middlemen out of all proportion to the real requirements of the citizens.  There is much talk of profiteering and the high cost of living.</P>
    <P>Deputies should try to get down to the pith of the matter.  You can have very high prices and profiteering in the technical sense without anyone making huge fortunes out of it.  Take the average town or village in Ireland depending for its business on a catchment area of a four or five mile radius, and what is the picture?  Dotted from one of the main streets to the other you have people dealing in substantially the same commodities.  They all have to live on that catchment area, a rural area, a four or five mile radius. The moral is obvious.  The talk of competition is a myth, a fiction.  Prices are ruled for the weakest link in the chain, and yet Deputies say that it is not right to say that the public are entitled to be better or differently served in the future than they have been in the past.  If you say there must be separation between one portion of a shop and another you are saying something that is harsh, unjust, and confiscatory in its effect.  Licences were dealt out in a reckless, haphazard <Col N="2917" /> fashion here by the British administration, and it is that situation we are facing to-day.  Because one business was not sufficient another counter was opened and it was eked out with another business.  The net result is that you have had that multiplication of distributors, that multiplication of retailers, going on in the country, and all those must live on the producers. That is why producers are down at bedrock to-day fighting for their very existence. If we are only to tell the truth when it is palatable, and if we are only to tell the truth when we are quite sure we are not walking on anyone's corns, we are not going to get anywhere in dealing with the social and economic evils of the country.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with clubs. The proposal is that clubs shall not sell intoxicating liquor later than 10 p.m. on an ordinary week-day and 9.30 p.m. on Saturdays, and not between the hours of 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sundays. That again, of course, has been branded as tyrannical in the extreme.  I have been charged with &ldquo;undue rigidity&rdquo; because I did not leave loopholes through which Deputy Figgis might slip in and out.  Reasonable refreshments we are told are denied to members of the clubs after 10 p.m.  Such liquids as water, tea, coffee or minerals do not count in the vocabulary of the clubmen, if we are to believe all that has been said here.</P>

      <P>It is not a harsh or tyrannical provision.  The point has been made that for a few weeks in summer golf may, with good sight and good luck, be played up to 9.30 p.m. or after it.  That is true, but you cannot base legislation on the circumstances that prevail for a week or two weeks on each side of the longest day.  Anyone that would set out to frame a measure by taking stock of special cases of that kind would not have much to congratulate himself on by the time he would be through.  The fact is&mdash; and everyone knows it&mdash;that if things went on as they have been going on, the tendency would be that these clubs would become less and less golf clubs and more and more just late-night <Col N="2918" /> drinking dens, from which people would go home uproarious in the small hours of the morning.</P>

      <P>Killing Deputy Gorey's stock, maybe, with their motor-cars on the roadside on their way home.  On a Bill like this I much prefer the Committee Stage to the Second Reading.  On Second Reading people can get up and talk generalities in perfervid rhetoric and they have never to come down to the bedrock thing of saying what is exactly wrong or what the alternative should be.  I look forward with a certain zest and with certain pleasure to the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I want, for instance, Deputy Hall to put down amendments on the lines of the speech he made here this evening, which showed that he had not even read the first page of the memorandum which is prefixed to the Bill.  He spoke as if there were no such thing as <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any such statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Or as if, by this Bill, it was proposed to abolish it. Staring him in the face, on the first page of the memorandum, were these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Under the existing law <i>bona fide</i> travellers&mdash;</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy knows what that is&mdash;</P>
      <P>may be lawfully served by publicans at any hour upon any day of the year.</P>
      <P>Day there includes night.  The only restriction which the Bill imposes upon that latitude is that</P>
      <P>
        <i>Bona fide</i> travellers may not be served&mdash;(1) at any hour on Christmas Day, Good Friday, St. Patrick's Day; or (2) during the period 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, Deputy Hall's interesting travellers coming from 40 or 50 miles, with farm produce, tired and weary and, incidentally, thirsty and with their horses in the same condition, may knock up any wayside publican at 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning and <Col N="2919" /> get reasonable refreshment for man if not for beast.</P>

      <P>As I said, in connection with this Bill, I had to take stock of many conflicting views, and I had conferences in which interests that were radically opposed were represented. My own considered opinion is that, of all the interests that were represented, the people who have the most real grievance with the provisions of this Bill are the temperance advocates. That is simply because they have to face the fact that, unfortunately, they are ahead of the country, ahead of the times, ahead of the electorate and of the representatives of the electorate.  But to brand this Bill as a harsh measure or a sweeping infringement of anybody's rights, is simply absurd.  When subjected to any kind of scrutiny or any kind of analysis, it is no such thing.  It is as moderate and as mild a measure of reform on this question, which clamours for reform, as any Minister in my position could conscientiously bring forward. Other questions were mentioned which are not dealt  in the Bill, but certainly this year I want to see a commission set up that will get to grips with many bigger questions that the Bill does not purport to deal with; that will get to grips with this question of the enormous excess of licensed establishments in the country to the real requirements of the people, and that will consider such special local problems as may be found to exist&mdash; the problem, for instance, in Cork, where you have these tied houses.  The <Col N="2920" /> Terms of Reference of such a commission ought to be drafted as broadly as possible, to permit of the commission making any representations to the Government which they might think fit to make in connection with this traffic which plays an admittedly important part in the life of the country.  Deputies who advocated and urged the immediate setting up of this commission ought not to quote that intention as a sufficient reason for doing nothing at all in face of the situation which confronts us.  A commission of that kind might take five or six months or perhaps more on its work.  By the time a Bill would be brought forward here for the consideration of the Dáil and Seanad it might be as long again.  All this Bill purports to do is to deal with certain matters which call for immediate attention, pending a fuller investigation of the whole question by a competent commission.  In Committee I am prepared to give reasonable consideration to such amendments as may be put down.  Certainly, every amendment put down will be closely considered, but I am going to make no extravagant promises, no promises that will creat in Deputies' minds the idea that the Bill, as it stands, is something in the nature of a try-on and that we are prepared to throw out a lot of ballast in Committee.  Certain minor matters may be discussed and may be more fully considered but, substantially, the Bill is as mild and as moderate a measure as could be sponsored by any responsible Minister.  If there is anything big asked for, or anything big pressed for, then I would sooner the whole Bill should go overboard than that it should be nullified by amendments to sections which do not bear amendment.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested to me that it might be as well not to take the Estimates this evening, and to begin them after question time to-morrow. I am agreeable to go on, but if there is a desire to that effect, I think it might be as well to take them after questions to-morrow.</P>
