      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will have further inquiries made about the application for old age pension of Thomas Newman, of Kill, Straffan, Co. Kildare; further, if he is aware that the Registers of Eadestown, Cross Chapel and Blessington Churches and Somerset House show no record of his birth in 1853, and whether, as this man is practically a cripple and unable to earn his living he will give favourable consideration to the claim.</P>

      <P>This claim was disallowed on the 2nd January last on the ground of insufficient evidence of age.</P>
      <P>Claimant's birth certificate was not produced.  There were written statements that his baptism was not recorded in the Registers of the Kill and Blessington Parishes.  A neighbour also declared that he had no hesitation in believing that claimant was certainly over 70 years of age.</P>
      <P>The facts as put forward were held to be insufficient to justify a decision on age in favour of the claimant.  If he is now in a position to offer more definite and reasonably conclusive evidence of age it is open to him to make a new claim and to forward it in the usual way, with the evidence, to the Pension Officer.</P>

Od. only as dependent's allowance; whether her son, before joining the National Army, was earning up to £3 10s. per week, and whether, seeing that Brennan joined the National Army in April, 1922, and was discharged in December last, he will state whether this claim is one for further consideration and further allowance, in view of the loss this woman has sustained by the fact of her son giving up his employment to join the National Army.</P>

In respect of this extent of dependence an allowance of 7s. a week, as specified by regulations, was issued to Mrs. McKeown.  Those regulations were based on a recognition of an obligation for a soldier to contribute at least 8s. a week towards the upkeep of his home whilst serving in the Army.

Any persons who object to this Bill may appear before the Joint Committee, may be represented <Col N="871" /> by Counsel, and may then put forward their objections.

I understand from the Dublin Corporation representative that the Corporation have a Bill which is in process of being lodged.  As that Bill will obviously be somewhat on the same lines as the present Bill, it would seem for the convenience both of the Dáil and the Committee that they should have the three Bills before them at the one time as they relate to the one matter. I submit that the setting up of this Committee should be postponed for two months, as the Corporation Bill will be before the Dáil in the meantime.</P>

Would it not save the time of the Committee if they went into the merits of the three Bills at the one time?  I do not wish to takes sides one way or the other in this matter, but as there are three Bills coming before the Dáil on the same matter, the Committee should be able to go into them at the same time and have the whole matter in perspective, so to speak, before them.  It is to save the time of the Dáil and of the Committee that Deputy Hewat has made his suggestion.</P>

      <P>I think it is better <Col N="872" /> to postpone the consideration of those Electric Supply Bills until they can all be considered together.  I understand that a case occurred not very long ago in England in which there were three sets of promoters for the one work. The Committee proceeded to investigate the first Bill that came before them and rejected it.  Then they came to the second Bill and found it was considerably worse than the first. They rejected that also.  When they came to the third they found it was even worse still and it also was rejected, so that the whole thing fell to the ground.  Presuming that the best of these three Bills comes before the Committee and is rejected, what position will we be in?  As the Corporation Bill is a democratic experiment it should get the first show.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of postponing this Bill until all the Bills are ready, because until we have all of them before us we cannot know which is the best.  We would be taking up the time of the Dáil discussing two of the Bills, and when the third Bill is introduced later on we will be taking up further time discussing that.  I think it would be advisable, from every point of view, to defer consideration of any of the Bills until we have all of them before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make this a Government matter.  I think it ought to be left to the free vote of the Dáil.  It is the first occasion upon which Bills privately promoted have come before us.  I understand that Deputy P. Doyle would have been here to-day to oppose this Bill being referred to the Joint Committee, but that he has to fulfil an engagement upon a very important matter.  I believe he would have stated the case for the Corporation, as Deputy Keogh has stated it.  The Dublin Corporation is a very important body, and I am sure that it was equally alive to the necessity for the promotion of a Bill some months ago as it is now.  It has been a little late.  It has not Tabled any Bill.  It was open to it to have Tabled a Bill, and it has not availed of that opportunity.  There are three Bills now before us, put forward in good faith, and I think that some <Col N="873" /> complaint about the arrangements for the reception of Bills from private promoters lies against us.  I do not see that the Corporation's case&mdash;supposing that it does introduce a Bill&mdash;will be prejudicially affected.  The Corporation at least will have an opportunity of seeing what the proposals of the other people are, should this Bill be sent to a Joint Committee.  The proposal is made here by a responsible Committee that this Bill be sent to the Joint Committee.  It will be open to any party who wishes to oppose the Bill to be present there and make a case against it.  Personally I do not think it is at all likely that this Bill will get beyond its early stages in this Session.  We intended to adjourn about the 4th July, and I do not see any likelihood of the Bill&mdash;granted that it is able to overcome any opposition put up against it&mdash;getting through this Session. In the circumstances, it ought to be allowed to go before the Joint Committee. I am speaking now only in an individual capacity, and I am not putting that to the Dáil as a Government policy.  If it were put to a vote I would be disposed to vote for the motion of Deputy Cooper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As one entirely unprejudiced in this matter, if we are to take it, as I think we are, that the Dublin Corporation's proposal is a serious one, and not merely a blocking proposal, it would seem obvious that the business-like proceeding was to take the three proposals before the Committee at the same time.  At least, the Committee which would be inquiring into Bill No. 1 should know what the serious proposals in Bill No. 3 would be.  If what the President speaks of as the possibilities of this Session are anyway accurate, no one will be very much prejudiced by delay.  Assuming all the time that the Dublin Corporation Bill is a serious attempt to promote legislation on the same subject as the other Private Bills, then I would support the proposal, which, I understand, Deputy Hewat has made, that the consideration of the motion be postponed for two months.  I do that purely as a matter of business-like arrangement, to save time and trouble for the Committee that will be discussing the second <Col N="874" /> or third Bill and duplicating its work. I think it is not correct to suggest, as the President did, that the Dublin Corporation does not know already what the proposals of the Private Bill promoters are.  They are already before the Dublin Corporation, and I presume it is because of the schemes put forward by the Private Bill promoters that the Dublin Corporation decided to promote a Bill of its own.  It is because it is the obviously business-like procedure to have the three Bills in hand while the Committee is considering either of them that I would support the proposal to postpone the appointment of this Committee.</P>

I have striven to maintain the impartiality of a judge in this issue. The suggestion made, to reject this motion and postpone consideration of the Bill, raises a question on the Standing Orders.  I am relieved to learn that there is something Deputy Johnson does not know.  He does not know the Standing Orders on Private Bill procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>If he had he would realise that it was not a business-like proceeding.  It is not a question of <Col N="875" /> postponing the Bill for two months. The Standing Orders we adopted at the end of last year laid down a definite date at which Bills are to be lodged. That was the month of October or November.  The Dublin Corporation Bill cannot be lodged until October or November.  Various notices have to be sent out on or before the 15th December and so on.  That would put back this Bill for nearly a year.  This Bill was not lodged in October or November owing to the Election, and owing to the fact that the last Dáil had not adopted Standing Orders for dealing with Private Bill business.  A Resolution was adopted by the Dáil on the 4th December last, saying that during the current Session the promoters of any Private Bill may publish the notices required by Standing Order 8 during the months of December and January instead of October and November, and that the date for the deposit of plans, copies of the Bill, and petitions against shall be correspondingly altered.  The promoters of this Bill, and the promoters of the Bill as to which I am going to propose a Resolution later on, have complied with our Standing Orders in every particular.  They have deposited the necessary money, they have gone through all the necessary formalities, and done all that they have been asked to do by the Oireachtas.  Is it a fair thing to say that, after you lodged your Bills, if the Dublin Corporation comes to the conclusion that it wants to promote a Bill, your Bills must be put back until the Corporation saw fit to bring in their Bill?  There has already been undue delay in this matter.  The Corporation knew of these Standing Orders and are in a better position than any Private Bill promoter can be. They have a legal department, they have an engineering department, and they must, in the interests of the citizens, have studied these Standing Orders to see how they would affect the city.  Still they did not comply with them, but waited until other people brought forward Bills to object.  I hope that the Dáil will agree with me in this motion.  If not, two things will happen.  In the first place, no private individual or private firm will bring forward private legislation at all if they <Col N="876" /> are to be at the mercy of Corporations or other such bodies who wished to legislate on the same subject.  The second point that will be achieved is, when the Standing Orders of the Dáil conflict with the wishes of the Corporation, it is the wishes of the Corporation are to prevail.  I think that would be a position of intolerable indignity, and I do not think you will get people to serve on the Standing Orders Committee if that position is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I suffer from the same limitation as the last speaker in the beginning of his speech.  As a member of the Committee on Private Bill legislation I am obliged to adopt a judicial attitude.  I think I am obliged to adhere to it right through and not merely at the commencement of the speech.  It is true that if the present Bills that have complied with the Standing Orders are postponed until the Dublin Corporation rival scheme is ready it will be not a postponement for two months but for a considerably longer time.  Except for that fact, or at least the departure from the fact which was not known to Deputy Johnson, I accept everything that Deputy Johnson has said as a good and sufficient reason why the consideration ought to be postponed.  There is a considerable difficulty, as Deputy Cooper is well aware, in constituting Committees for the purpose of inquiring into Private Bills.  If a committee proceeds to investigate one of these schemes it will take a considerable expenditure of time and energy.  Then much the same line will have to be traversed by another, or perhaps the same committee under another title, and again in dealing with the Corporation scheme.  It would facilitate the work of the Oireachtas and would undoubtedly conduce to the public advantage to have all these schemes considered together.  The saving in point of expenditure would be enormous. The situation will not be, with all respect to Deputy Cooper, what you have been told that it will be, that the Dublin Corporation is dictating to the Dáil and that our Standing Orders give way as to a superior power and superior interest when they come in conflict with the desires of the Dublin Corporation. The Dublin Corporation in this matter <Col N="877" /> is considering the interests and advantages of the citizens.  They put forward a very reasonable request. According to Deputy Cooper's argument, private enterprise will not proceed by way of Private Bill legislation if they are to be at the mercy of a Corporation.  Nobody knows better than Deputy Cooper that when these enterprises of private initiation do happen to conflict with what one might call for convenience the interests watched over and served by the Corporation, it is the duty of the Corporation to intervene on behalf of the citizens, and everyone who promotes a scheme of this sort does so with the full consciousness that those are the conditions.  I am not aware that a delay, if it can be rightly called a delay, has occurred in the preparation of the Dublin Corporation scheme, but there is the fact.  There are several rival schemes for exploiting the water-power of the Liffey for the production of electrical energy.  The Dublin Corporation-let us say now, as it is customary to attack them and speak in a derogatory fashion about them&mdash;have been asleep and have wakened up at the eleventh hour, or at a quarter to 12.  However, they have awakened and it is to the interests of the citizens that they should be heard.  I would suggest without, I hope, departing from judicial impartiality, that the departure from judicial impartiality on the part of Deputy Cooper requires to be counterbalanced.  The result is that we could have then a dispassionate attitude.  But it is really necessary for the saving of the time of members of the Oireachtas and their intellectual energy, that these schemes, all dealing with the same project, for the promotion of the same thing, should be considered at the same time.</P>

I do not think there is any immediate hurry: nothing will be lost by waiting.  The only thing that might be gained would be that all the schemes would be considered on their merits and not that one scheme would get an advantage&mdash;to my mind an undue advantage&mdash;over another.</P>

      <P>On that I understand that a Bill can be lodged up to the 20th of this month, under the Standing Orders.  An application has been received, but so far no Bill has been lodged.  That is merely on the question of fact.  With regard to the other question raised by Deputy Baxter, if these two Bills were sent to a Committee, I hope Deputies are quite clear that they would still be able to stop them after they have been considered by the Committee.  That is to say, the Committee will report that one of the Bills, with or without amendments, was a good Bill.  At that point the Dáil could reject or delay the Bill <Col N="879" /> if it transpired that another Bill was lodged and, as a matter of fact, the Joint Committee on Standing Orders could send the new Bill, whatever it was, after a certain period, to the same Committee.  Merely as a matter of fact, the Bill could be stopped after it had gone to the Committee, and the report had been received from the Committee. The passing of this motion does not mean that the Dáil loses control of the Bill by any means.  I take it that we are really discussing two things; if the first motion were decided in one way the second would be decided in the same.  It would mean that the Bill would be before the Joint Committee, and the Joint Committee would report. When it reported, the position would arise again in regard to objections raised.</P>

It is proposed to accept this amendment.  It deals with a point raised in the course of the debate by Deputy Johnson.  I think he pointed out that the phrase, as used, could be construed rather widely and could definitely cover inquiries or inquests, such as coroners' inquests, which in no way depended previously on the jury book.  It is now being amended to have a definite limitation put on the point, and it is proposed to accept the Seanad amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendment as put down has a greater effect than what has been described by Deputy O'Connell.  The section as drafted makes the decision of the tribunal final as regards amalgamation and absorption schemes.  It precludes appeal even on a question of law on any matter connected with amalgamation and absorpsorption. This amendment would propose even with regard to amalgamation and absorption schemes, and on a point of law, and that would undoubtedly lead to serious delays in the final amalgamation scheme.  For that reason it is not proposed to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a major question.  The position that the railway tribunal would be in would be one which makes it superior to any court, except a Court of Appeal.  The tribunal in questions of amalgamation and absorption will have to consider the relations between the different classes of stock-holders, and I put it to the Minister as conceivable, though extreme, but of course there is the possibility, that a tribunal which consists of three persons, only one of whom is a lawyer, might by a majority make certain decisions which are contrary <Col N="883" /> to the accepted law.  The judge who is chairman, according to the provisions of the Bill as supported by the Minister, will not be entitled to express any dissent, though he is a lawyer and he knows the two men are deciding a matter of law against the law, but there shall be no appeal.  I put it to the Minister that that is a most unfortunate position to allow ourselves to be led into.  There was a case I understand under the British Act where certain stockholders of a company believed they had a grievance and that their legal rights had been contravened, and the tribunal decided against them.  They did in fact appeal on a question of law, and appealed successfully against the tribunal.  Bear in mind the position, that you have a tribunal consisting of one lawyer and two laymen; the majority of that tribunal will decide on a question of law, and the chairman who is supposed to know the law has no right to express any dissent, and yet no one has a right to appeal even on a question of law. Surely that is not common sense, and should not be embodied in an Act of the Oireachtas?</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 51: Before Section 22 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">ESTABLISHMENT OF RAILWAY RATES TRIBUNAL.</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be established a court styled the Railway Rates Tribunal, consisting of three permanent members, that is to say, a chairman and two ordinary members, with power to add to their number as hereinafter provided.</P>
      <P>(2)  The permanent members of the railway rates tribunal shall be appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>(3)  The permanent members of the railway rates tribunal shall hold office for such term not exceeding seven years from the date of their appointment as may be determined at the time of their appointment and then retire; but a retiring member shall be eligible for re-appointment.</P>
      <P>(4)  A permanent member of the railway rates tribunal may resign his office at any time.</P>
      <P>(5)  A permanent member of the railway rates tribunal may only be removed from his office by a resolution passed by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann for incapacity, or misbehaviour stated in the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  The railway rates tribunal shall be a court of record and shall have an official seal, which shall be officially and judicially noticed, and <Col N="886" /> the railway rates tribunal may act notwithstanding a vacancy in its number.</P>
    <P>It has been most unfortunate for the discussion of this Bill, so far as I am concerned, that this question of one Tribunal was not decided at an earlier date, but as I am as much responsible as anybody else for the postponement, I realise that the complications which have ensued are to be laid at my own door.  But the question of establishing a Railway Tribunal to have two functions which are not even allied&mdash;to do two jobs, and to do them both at the same time in a great measure&mdash;seems to me to be wrong and undesirable.  I have no feeling so far as the Railway Companies are concerned in this, and no interest is being served by a suggestion that there should be two tribunals set up, except public convenience and more business-like procedure.  What is proposed in the Bill is to establish one Tribunal which will, in the first instance, have to receive and consider proposals relating to the amalgamation and absorption of companies existing, and in case of any failure to agree on the part of existing companies to make a scheme of their own, in effect to impose it upon the companies.  That may be a very considerable undertaking; it may occupy a considerable time, and it will require certain faculties of a judicial character and, as has been suggested, financial and business experience on the part of the Tribunal.  But this is a work which will be undertaken and, one would assume, finished within a few months.  One might reasonably expect that the persons who would be appointed to do that work could apply themselves for a few months and finish the work.  The proposal in the Bill is to take those same persons, appoint them to do this work of arranging the amalgamation terms, and then to carry on for a period of five years to do an entirely different kind of work.  I suggest that it is possible that the best persons to do the first part of the duty are not the best persons to do the second.  Then I would ask the Minister and the Dáil to recognise the difficulties that will be placed before that Tribunal if the scheme of the Bill as proposed is adopted.  Under Section 9 of the Bill <Col N="887" /> the Tribunal will receive and consider any preliminary schemes which may be submitted, and their duty will be to decide whether procedure, as laid down in the Bill or as laid down in the Act as it will then be, has been faithfully followed.  Then before the 31st July of this year, according to Section 3, the amalgamation scheme which has been agreed to by the companies shall have been submitted to the Tribunal.  An absorption scheme shall be submitted to them at the same time; that is, before the 31st July.  But in case of failure to agree, the Tribunal will be obliged to prepare a scheme of their own for forcible amalgamation.  That will have to be done before the end of this year. I submit we have a right to consider all the possibilities; we have a right to consider that it will be incumbent upon the Tribunal to prepare a complete scheme from the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>They may be obliged to take into consideration within the following 7 or 8 months the whole of the railway undertakings&mdash;share classifications and all the intricacies of railway affairs&mdash; and in that few months to propound a scheme, to hear objections from the companies, and to make the scheme effective.  All that has to be done between the 31st July and the 31st December, and while this tribunal is fixed by the Bill to do that work, it has also to take into consideration and review all the existing rates, and then it has to proceed to a re-classification.  It has to promote a new classification, and, I presume, hear evidence from thousands possibly of traders and decide upon new rates before the end of December, 1925.</P>
    <P>I submit that it is not possible for a single tribunal to do those two operations simultaneously.  Unless the Minister is in a position to say with absolute certainty&mdash;and if it were so, it should be put in the Bill&mdash;that the scheme is ready and only requires a formal decision by the tribunal&mdash;unless that is the fact, the tribunal ought not be asked to do that work and also the work of reviewing the rates and charges which are paid by the trading community.  The proposal we have tabled is to repeat here what was thought to be desirable <Col N="888" /> and what proved to be practicable and effective elsewhere&mdash;to have two distinct tribunals, one of which would deal with the proceedings relating to absorption and amalgamation and an entirely separate tribunal to carry on the work relating to charges and classification. We are proposing a Railway Rates Tribunal, and if this proposal were adopted it would be necessary, at a later stage of the Bill, to define and amend previous sections to make it appear that the &ldquo;railway tribunal&rdquo; already in the Bill would be a railway amalgamation tribunal.</P>
    <P>The railway tribunal in the Bill it is proposed to continue only for five years as a rates tribunal.  It is expected by the present Minister that there shall be either a new tribunal or a modified tribunal to carry on the work after five years, and it is not expected that the duties of the tribunal regarding rates shall cease at the end of five years. Presumably the guarantee of standard revenue under Sections 52 and 53 will also cease at the end of five years.  But also there will have ceased any control at all of the rates to be charged by the companies after the five years.  It is not enough, I submit, to say that after five years a court or a new tribunal may be appointed.  If it is intended that there should be a tribunal, then we should make that mandatory.  The proposal in the amendment, which seeks to establish a railway rates tribunal, will ensure that the rates tribunal will persist, that there shall be a rates tribunal until new legislation alters the matter.</P>
    <P>Those are the main reasons why I would urge this amendment upon the Dáil; purely in the interests of convenience and practical working, and I think also in the interests of more efficient practice in the work of amalgamation and in the work of fixing rates&mdash;both of which may go on concurrently under the proposals in the amendment, but which I think cannot be carried out practically under the scheme as proposed in the Bill.  I, therefore, move amendment 51, establishing a Railway Rates Tribunal as distinct from a Railway Amalgamation Tribunal.  I may say that Amendment 51 and later amendments are almost wholly taken from the Bill as printed, with the alterations requisite. <Col N="889" /> Amendments 51 to 55 will depend upon the acceptance of this principle to establish a separate Railway Rates Tribunal.</P>

      <P>I am always searching for an opportunity to support my friend, Deputy Johnson's, amendments to this Bill.  In this particular case I am sorry that I cannot find that we see eye to eye.  Deputy Johnson's proposal here is that in addition to the Railway Tribunal there should be set up a Railway Rates Tribunal.  He outlined the large amount of work that will be entailed in connection with amalgamation, plus a much larger amount of work entailed in connection with examining the rates charged by railway companies.  The President, I think, gave us some information at a previous sitting, and he rather indicated that not only is the work cut and dry for this Railway Tribunal, as regards the amalgamation of the companies, but I think he even indicated that the personnel of this Tribunal is already arranged in his own mind, though not by Act of Parliament.  I think he had it arranged in his own mind, so that he could give us the names of the proposed Tribunal offhand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right, Professor. What has been the experience of railway companies in connection with tribunals?  We are all conversant with the fact that in connection with the administration of railways, various tribunals have been set up and have heard various cases, for instance, the Carrigan award.  I sat the other day on a tribunal at which I spent a great <Col N="890" /> deal of time and out of which I got very little information.  That is not the way you are going to settle these things; and to load the thing with another tribunal is, I think loading another staff, loading more expense, and putting any chance that the unfortunate users of railways may look forward to for getting relief in rates further into the dim and distant future. This Bill has had a very detrimental effect on the chances of traders getting a reduction in rates; and the setting up of another tribunal is not going to help us, while the additional expense is, of course, going to be a burthen which, according to the present state of affairs it would appear that the railway companies cannot stand.  This railway problem is a serious one and this Bill is a serious Bill.  Deputy Johnson's amendment is not helping to simplify it and therefore, with all the goodwill in the world to support any amendment put forward, I am sorry I cannot find myself in the same pew with Deputy Johnson and the Labour Party on this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>He stated, I think, at one stage of the Bill that when this Bill was passed he, as a loyal, though perhaps, reluctant supporter of the Government, would do the best he could to see that it was carried out in the most effective way.  I hope that I am interpreting his conditional loyalty in the proper way.  Deputy Hewat would, no doubt, be interested first of all in the work of this tribunal in so far as he is, I am sure, anxiously looking forward to any relief in the nature of rates.  I suggest that it is absolutely impossible for any tribunal to be loaded first of all with the duty of examining the preliminary schemes that may be submitted inside five months, because <Col N="891" /> the whole scheme will come into operation after the 1st January, 1925, and at the same time in three months after the coming into operation to be called upon to go into questions of the revision of rates.  That, I think, must be quite clear, but Deputy Hewat, if he were a member of the tribunal, would, I am sure, not get up here and guarantee that he would discharge his part of the duty and undertake that impossible task.  Some Deputy in a previous discussion stated that in England they had three of these tribunals to deal with what was to be the duty of one body here.  That is quite so, but there is only one body in England with the authority that is given to this tribunal here, that is final authority to determine any questions of law or fact that may arise out of schemes in the Bill. It may be argued that three bodies in England are there because the whole scheme of railway organisation, previous to the passing of the 1921 Act, was much more comprehensive than the scheme of railway organisation we know of in this country.  While all that may be true, the tribunal here will be faced with the same propositions and with the same serious questions to be decided as they have been faced with in England following the passing of the 1921 Act.  It may be useful to the Minister and others to know, and I am sure his advisers are well aware of this, that following the passing of the 1921 Act in the British House of Commons in connection with the grouping schemes, a railway rates body has been sitting for the past three years in connection with classification schemes, and up to the present they have not brought in any reports.  How, therefore, can the Minister expect that any body that he may set up under the terms of this Bill can do in three months what the other body in England has failed to do in three years?</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to explain in my own peculiar way the work which the Minister intends to pile on to this body of supermen which he intends to set up in connection with the formation of the tribunal. Deputy Hewat has argued that the meaning of Deputy Johnson's amendment is to pile on additional expense because an additional staff would be required for any second tribunal that may be agreed to, and such as is suggested in the amendment. The members of the tribunal, provided there are two such tribunals, will be called on to deal with questions arising out of the conditions of amalgamation and absorption, and will be a body of men expert in financial matters.  I know that the intention of the amendment is that that body would only be a temporary body for a short time, and it would be necessary for them to determine such questions as might, and perhaps will arise in connection with that part of the Bill.  I do not see that it would be necessary to employ any additional staff to assist them in that part of their work, which would only be for a short time.  I think whatever staff would be necessary to assist the Rates Tribunal would be quite capable and fitted to assist the other section of the tribunal which I hope will be set up to deal with absorption and amalgamation.  I do not think there is much in that point of Deputy Hewat. It is quite obvious that the Government will get a body of men quite competent to deal with questions of rates and fares, and other questions in connection with that matter, and deal with that particular aspect of the application of the Bill, but they would not, and I am sure will not, be able to deal with these great questions of finance involved in connection with amalgamation and absorption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You may and will have men, including the chairman, competent to deal with the question of rates, but even the chairman, who may be a good chairman, a lawyer, judge or whatever he may be, who might be competent to <Col N="893" /> deal with questions of rates and fares and the diversion of traffic in any dispute left to the tribunal to decide, would not have that knowledge of financial matters which would be necessary to deal in a satisfactory way with questions arising out of amalgamation and absorption. If Deputy Hewat is prepared to leave in the hands of such men the great questions of finance and other questions that may arise in connection with that aspect of the proposals in this Bill, I fail to see why he should do so as a business man.  I put it to the Minister, and I think every point that is under his consideration has been put to him by Deputy Johnson, that it is an impossible proposition for him to put on to the back of a tribunal the question of the examining of preliminary schemes of dealing with disputes and the question of amalgamation in five months and at the same time to call upon them to deal with the question of rates revision under Section 24 of this Bill inside three months.  I, so far as I am concerned, cannot see how it can be done within the period laid down.  There are Deputies in this House who always contend both outside and inside the House that simply because the thing is done in England that we here in Ireland, with a different outlook, cannot copy it.  The good things that are done in England can be copied to the advantage of the Irish people.  I have never been so bigoted as to hold the view that because things are done in that country by people whom we may not like we cannot follow their good example by doing those particular things.  Therefore, if we are guided in those things by things that are happening in England we can copy a very good example.</P>

      <P>His Bill speaks for itself.  The super men of whom this <Col N="894" /> tribunal will consist will not have such a tremendous lot of work to deal with as one is led to believe by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Davin.  When the companies raised the rates in 1917 and 1918 it was done by one stroke of the pen&mdash;50 or 100 per cent.&mdash;and they can be reduced by one stroke of the pen, so there is no necessity to inquire into all this question of rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the idea underlying the Minister's mind, and it has been given expression to by the President.  It is assumed that those various Companies will not agree.  We know pretty well that the most of them have already agreed, and that for those who have not agreed it is only a question of coalescing the one with the many, and a financial man could soon do that.  There is not much work in it at all.  Any stockbroker would size up the relative value in five minutes, and the Stock Exchange is a good index of their value.  Therefore, I do not see any great necessity in instituting another Board.  One is enough.  With regard to the rating and revision of classification that is to take place, it cannot be anticipated that the classification will be so altered that its incidence will be different from the classification which will obtain in that portion of Ireland which is not in the jurisdiction of the Free State.  It would not be possible to have goods rated Class 4 in the Free State going in on the Northern line and being called Class 2.  What will happen, to my mind, is that classification will be general, and the same as exists presently.  At one time the Irish railway system had an Irish Railway Clearing House classification and an English Railway Clearing House classification, and goods Class 3 in England would be Class 4 in Ireland. It was found unworkable, and it will be found unworkable here, and the classification will in practice be the same with the northern as with the southern lines.  The Rates Tribunal must of necessity have a man skilled in finance, because you cannot fix your rates at the point that will not yield 4.12.  The financial man will be there, and will say: &ldquo;We must earn 4.12, and the <Col N="895" /> rates cannot go down below a certain point.&rdquo;</P>

For those reasons I think the Minister's proposals are more in accordance with the requirements of the Free State, and we do not want a multiplicity of Boards.  Also, we do not want the railways to have a staff anything approaching what is required in Britain.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Hewat stands for the merchants and manufacturers and commercial men, and is against a separate tribunal, and if Deputy Wilson speaks on behalf of the agricultural community, the cattle dealers, and all the rest of the trading community, and is against the tribunal, I take it that both of them together speak for the regular passengers, and that they are against a separate tribunal. One might ask why I should be so concerned.  I am concerned because it is more workable and more sensible and the more likely to lead to the efficient working of this scheme. If Deputy Wilson thinks that the work of the tribunal at this first stage, the reviewing of the existing charges with a view to modification, can be done in three months, and still the earning power of the companies be maintained to ensure them a standard dividend, and that that can all be done with a stroke of the pen, I suggest to the Minister he has one obvious name before him for the tribunal.</P>

Again I submit this suggestion <Col N="896" /> for the consideration of the trading community, the persons who are primarily concerned with the traffic rates and charges, who are looking forward to the review of the existing charges which are promised within three months of the passing of the Act, with a view to modification.  If that term modification exactly means a deduction, and a deduction is intended, then I suggest to the Dáil that it is better not to impose upon that tribunal the duty of examining into the financial matters connected with the amalgamation and absorption and hearing the various parties and considering carefully what the various parties have to say with regard to the schemes of amalgamation and absorption.  They will not be able to do them both at the same time, and to do them properly. I am prepared to back my views in this matter notwithstanding that the trading community think I am wrong.  And if it turns out in the long run that in the working out of this scheme the trading community are going to be disappointed, then it will be the representatives of the trading community that will be held accountable, and not I.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson and Deputy Hewat assumed for the sake of convenience, and to suit their arguments, that the object of the amendment was to multiply the number of Boards and set up two permanent Boards.  If the Minister agrees to accept the amendment, or the principle contained in the amendment, and if a scheme dealing with the conditions of amalgamation or absorption were coming into operation on the 1st January, 1925, I assume, and I think that the work of the Railway Tribunal, so far as dealing with amalgamation and absorption was concerned, would terminate before the scheme would come into operation.  Therefore there is no idea in the amendment that would coincide with the argument of Deputy Wilson, that we want to set up two permanent Boards.  The really permanent Board will be the Railway Rates Tribunal to deal with all these questions with which Deputy <Col N="897" /> Wilson and Deputy Hewat are much more concerned than we on the Labour benches.  Deputy Wilson also speaks about one individual being on this Board skilled in questions of finance. Now that clause of the Bill which deals with the classification of the members of the Tribunal states that one should be a judge or a member of the Bar with a certain number of years' practice; another to be drawn from commercial circles, and another member having a knowledge of the working of railways. The President made it clear to Deputy Good or Deputy Hewat that the individual who was to be drawn from commercial circles would be an expert accountant.  Therefore, so far as that part of it is concerned, Deputy Wilson would be quite clear as to what was the intention of the Government on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be useful information for Deputy Wilson to know that the body which has been considering the question of the revision of classification of goods in England has actually recommended&mdash;though it has not been actually officially announced yet&mdash;that instead of the present classification into five ordinary classes there will, in future, be a classification into 25 ordinary classes.  That statement is subject of course to this qualification, that it has not yet been sanctioned by the Transport Ministry in England.  I have been given that information by a man who is in close touch with the body considering classification in England.  Deputy Wilson will have to consider that the classification in England in the future will be different to the classification which is in force in Ireland and England to-day. He will have to consider the question of the complications that may arise in connection with arrangement <Col N="898" /> of through rates.  If the classification that will obtain in the future inside the Free State will be different to the classification in England under the new scheme of classification that is going to come into operation, then I say that that is a matter that will have to be very seriously considered in the light of the voluntary agreements that exist between the Irish and English companies. These are things that Deputy Wilson will have to admit will engage attention, and perhaps the very first things that will have to engage the attention of the tribunal, that will have at the same time to deal with the question of the finance connected with amalgamation and absorption.  We have put up a previous amendment which the Minister has promised to reconsider concerning the question of the powers of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put up a previous amendment which intends to make it clear as to whether or not the tribunal is to go into the whole question of the conditions and agreements that have been come to between the companies that are prepared to submit agreed preliminary schemes.  We have put up that amendment which desires to place upon the tribunal the responsibility of considering these schemes on their merits, as well as from the point of view of whether the procedure laid down in the Bill is carried out.  The Minister is to reconsider that amendment.  I say that it has a bearing on the question that is now being discussed to this extent, that it will place a greater amount of work upon the tribunal in dealing with amalgamation and absorption and will still further add to the work of this railway tribunal as proposed in the Bill.  Time will tell, and a very short experience will prove, especially so far as the tribunal is concerned, that if the anticipations of the Government in regard to the success of this measure are to be realised, the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson will make for easy working and will work out in practice better than what the Minister says in theory.  I am sure the Minister will give us this credit, which Deputy Hewat cannot claim, <Col N="899" /> that we do not seek to destroy the Bill. That is proved by our vote on the very first clause of the Bill.  Our amendments are put up after consultation with experts in railway work, experts so far as their legal knowledge of the British Act is concerned, and they are put up in the most helpful manner possible after these people have so to put it, given them serious consideration. That is our attitude in putting up the amendment and I trust the Minister will seriously consider the amendment before he turns it down, and I think that if the Minister is going to turn it down that we will be called upon to force him to bring up his big battalions, so that those who are absent will come in here and register decisions upon matters that are vital to the successful working of the whole Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite an accurate description.  I suggested that if you wanted the maximum of efficiency it was possible to have two separate tribunals.  The most efficient for the judicial work of amalgamation might not be the most efficient for the work of fixing rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the smaller point of the two objections raised, and in so far as it is to be met at all it can be met in this way: while it is quite right to say a tribunal of three selected for amalgamation purposes might not be a suitable tribunal for rate fixing purposes, there is the other side of the question, that the tribunal of three, selected specially with both ends in view, may be quite <Col N="900" /> adequate to perform both types of functions allotted to it under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it would be more desirable for the Government, in considering this matter, to give due consideration to the men who will be required to carry on work for five or ten years, than to other men who would be carrying it on temporarily for five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin travels too fast.  It has not been decided that there will be any Tribunal to do only work of a temporary nature.  That arises if this amendment is passed. But, taking the Tribunal for the five-year period, and admitting that the members on retirement are to be reeligible for appointment, and all the consequential matters that flow from that, it will be a pretty permanent Tribunal that will have to deal with both matters.  The big objection is that in the view of Deputies Johnson and Davin it is impossible for the Tribunal to do the work which they believe is allotted to it in the time they believe the Tribunal is limited to.  I put it that they have not properly gathered what the work of the Tribunal is to be and the dates on which it is to carry out its work.  As I view the matter, immediately on the passing of the Bill, the Railway Tribunal will proceed to the preliminary revision, under Section 24.  Not later than the 31st July it must receive whatever agreed amalgamation or absorption schemes there are, but while waiting for the reception of these schemes, and after receiving them, it can keep at the preliminary review of rates under Section 24.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Seanad.  After the agreed schemes have been received, the Tribunal proceeds to determine a scheme for the complete amalgamation of the undertaking, <Col N="901" /> and that scheme has to be determined so as to come into operation on 1st January next.  After it has got the whole amalgamation and absorption scheme out of its way, it starts on the general classification and the fixing of rates generally, but it cannot proceed to do that until it has got the amalgamation scheme out of its way. It has a complete year from the 1st January, 1925, to the 31st December of the same year, in which to get about the business of the complete classification and re-adjustment of rates.  That is a totally different scheme of events from what is in the minds of Deputies Johnson and Davin.  Deputy Davin said that the classification period had lasted in England, over three years, and he asked me if it was my view that this Railway Tribunal could, in a period of three months, do what the English were taking three years to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by the revision of existing charges?  Is it the application of a stroke of the pen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have described that as a preliminary review.  What Deputy Davin states the English are doing is not a preliminary review; it is a general classification which cannot be attempted here until 1925, and we hope to have that completed and in operation by the 31st December, 1925.  The preliminary scheme under Section 24 is a very small matter.  It is based on a Ministry of Transport Order in 1920, a general percentage order raising rates all round.  There are two or three things to be taken into consideration in re-adjusting the charges established under that order. One big thing is this, that the 1920 Order established rates to make up in eleven months for a deficit that was accruing over a sixteen months' period. Obviously for charges so made there is immediate case for reduction, and it is that general percentage Order of 1920, made by the Ministry of Transport, which is to be reviewed in the three months after the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme before the Railway Tribunal is not so heavy as is made out.  They have time, before they receive <Col N="902" /> any scheme, to make preparations for this review.  They then receive the agreed schemes and they have to determine a scheme, if it falls to them, and get it out of the way by the 1st January next, and they have then the general classification in the year after. There is overlapping to a slight extent. There is overlapping in so far as the review of the general percentage order may conflict with some of their duties in determining a scheme, if a scheme be not agreed to.</P>
    <P>We have been asked if an agreed scheme is ready, merely awaiting formal sanction by the Tribunal.  It has not got to that point.  There are agreed schemes.  There is even an approach to an agreement in one absorption scheme, but there is no general agreement either of amalgamation or absorption. The spade work has been done and a certain amount of progress has been made.  It is not considered likely that the work of the Tribunal in the matter of amalgamation and absorption will be very heavy, and it is not thought that it will interfere in anyway with the minor type of review that is to be made under Section 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we are to take it that all the agreed schemes will be swallowed by the Government without examination by the Tribunal.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Bill sets out what is to be done.  The Bill provides for all that.  Therefore, while I am not disposed to put the rejection of this amendment to the Dáil, I do say that no great case has been made for it.  There is a small point as regards overlapping which does exist. There is danger of that, and I would not go so far as Deputy Wilson, when he said that it is merely to be a stroke of the pen.  Section 24 definitely provides for having regard to the circumstances and also to any reduction in working expenses since September, 1920.  There are amendments which may introduce other complications, so that the matter is not so simple as Deputy Wilson would have us believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would simply point out that the time seems to me sufficient for the work to be done.  On the other hand, against this amendment there must be urged the claim of economy.  If we were to have two tribunals there would necessarily be an increase in expenditure, and that increase will be borne by the companies, and, presumably, passed on in rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventy-five per cent. of the increase will be passed on to the farmers.  I put it to Deputy Johnson that there is a certain virtue in having the same people concerned with the amalgamation and absorption schemes, whatever they be, and having them afterwards to do with the fixing of rates.  There is a certain virtue in having the people who are afterwards to fix the rates and attend to the general classification scheme possessing that intimate knowledge of the railway companies which they will get from the consideration of the amalgamation and absorption schemes that come before them.</P>

The persons who are responsible for the terms of capitalisation, who will say how this scheme should be financed, and who will have to do with the different financial arrangements connected with the new scheme, will be finally responsible for launching it, and will then have to justify their judgement by fixing rates accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be obliged to have in their minds possible mistakes that they made, and they will have to try and prove to the community that they were right in scheme No. 1 by making scheme No. 2 fit in, and possibly they may be wrong in both cases.  I, unfortunately, for the <Col N="904" /> purpose of the argument at any rate, assumed that the Bill really meant what it said, and that the Ministry was quite honest in its contention that the tribunal to be set up was to be a judicial tribunal, and that it was to have a sense of responsibility.  I assumed that, and as a consequence I thought that when the tribunal was to have the duty of reviewing, with a view to modification, the existing charges, that it would hear evidence and that it would listen to the contentions of companies who have told us up to now that they are not able to reduce charges.  Now, if the Ministry has already made up its mind that those charges must be reduced and can be reduced, notwithstanding what the railway companies say to the contrary, and it binds the Tribunal, which is to be a judicial tribunal, and which is to carry out what the Ministry already sees is possible and must be done, then I say the judicial nature of the tribunal goes to the wind, and it is no longer judicial.  It is doing what it is told to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But bear in mind this is a railway tribunal and is to have as a member a person skilled in railway affairs, and the chances are that such person would be one who had been contending for the last few months that it is not possible to reduce railway charges.  First, is he going to turn his back on all he has said?  He is going to approach the matter of modification of present charges, and of reviewing present charges, either with his mind already made up, or he is going to examine the proposals. He is going to examine the proposals and the conditions of to-day as compared with the conditions in 1920, and I am only assuming that that is going to be done carefully and thoroughly, and if it is done carefully and thoroughly it will take time.  The Minister's argument rather leads one to assume that that was never intended, and that it is to be more or less a general examination.  If two and two make four, then two from four leaves two, and the stroke of the pen of Deputy Wilson will come into operation. If that is to be the case, then there is no need to be talking about the judicial nature of the tribunal.  As I have said, I have assumed the good faith of the Government in putting in <Col N="905" /> that section in the Bill, in stating that the tribunal would be judicial, and that when it proceeds to review the present charges with a view to modification it will do that carefully and take time and hear all sides.  If it is to do that, it is going to find it difficult to do the other work of examination of absorption and amalgamation schemes. If the Bill were already through the Dáil, and there were two months to do that. there might be more to be said for the Minister's argument, but unless he is prepared to postpone dates he has no right to expect that this Bill will become law before the end of June. Then there will be four weeks in the summer when judicial persons will want holidays, and I imagine it will be found in the working out that the review will either be a stroke of the pen review, or it will be unsatisfactory and possibly be considered to be unjust.  It might well be that the other railway dividend protection section in the Bill will be violated, and that future schemes will be prejudiced by the fact that they have to make up in next year's charges what they lose in this year's charges. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument unless we are to assume that the decision of the Government is going to be the decision of the judicial tribunal.</P>

      <P>I think if the Deputy had confined himself, in recommending his amendment, to the last portion of his statement he would have been on very solid ground.

      <P>I think the Deputy went much further in the beginning of his statement, because he criticised this Railway Rates Tribunal as if that were the only body that could make mistakes with regard to the matter of amalgamation and that a stroke of the pen would settle it.

      <P>I think I did, and I think the Deputy mixed up the two things.  The two things are different and are set out differently in the Bill. What we are concerned with and the only thing that matters in connection with the Bill is the standard of revenue. To that extent only is the country committed. Suppose for a moment that a company coming into this amalgamation is allowed in at a much higher price, by reason of the infirmities of the tribunal, than it is worth, that does not effect the issue, good, bad or indifferent. Supposing the Dublin South Eastern came in on its full nominal capital of three-and-a-half millions, approximately, and the Great Southern and Western came in with its capital, the only matter on which there would be complaint there would be on the part of the shareholders of the Great Southern and Western that while the whole amalgamated or unified body which would result would be limited to the standard revenue, the proportion the Dublin South Eastern shareholders would get would be higher than the proportion of the Great Southern and Western.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what happens after five years, that is the case as far as they are concerned, and as far as the country is concerned, and the country cannot lose more&mdash;if we put it in that rather crude way, which may savour somewhat of confiscation&mdash; than the standard revenue, subject of course to the minor arrangements that are to be made in the event of the railways developing and more economies being effected.  If there is a small percentage of increased profits that may be held by the company, I think amounting to 20 per cent.  Now, this particular standard revenue to which I referred does not come into operation until January, 1926.  The preliminary revision that has to take place almost immediately is a revision which, in the light of the circumstances described by the Minister, does not I think leave that particular revision open to any <Col N="907" /> criticism.  The present rates charged were fixed at a particular time and for 11 months one collected 16 months' worth of rates and the only case that is made, or can be made for two tribunals is that one wished to afford the Rates Tribunal all the time at their disposal in order to consider the question of rates.  On the other hand, the Minister's contention is a good one, that they will have subsequently to consider, and ought to know, a great many of the circumstances that would be disclosed to them in the matter of amalgamation&mdash;and that would be of immense benefit.  If the House thinks there is a case for allowing the whole of the time of the Rates Tribunal, then there is a case for having two tribunals, but even if they were to make all the mistakes that the Deputy outlined, that does not affect and will not affect the ultimate result we anticipate from this Bill, because they are limited to the standard revenue.</P>

We have no right to assume, unless where it is stated in the Bill, that it shall cease its operations after five years, or to assume that the future beyond five years will not be prejudiced by this Bill or anything contained in it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to argue that the difficulties that are put in the way of the working of the Tribunal in regard to the revision of rates are such as to make it impossible for it to carry out the task which is laid down for it to carry out, in a period of three months, and, also, to argue this upon the amendment before the House.  Deputy Hewat gave the House a slight indication of his recent experience on another Tribunal.  He said he learned nothing.  I am sorry he did not learn something from his experience on the Tribunal recently honoured by his presence.  I have been told, at any rate, that figures were produced before the Tribunal in regard to working expenditure and general administration of the railways which were fairly well flattened out by people on the other side.  I do not know whether that was any education to Deputy Hewat, but it is only another indication that the Tribunal which will be set up to deal with this revision of rates when it comes to the reduction of working expenses will be faced with statements from one side that will be taken serious exception to by another. <Col N="910" /> I have no doubt that it would be the duty of the expert advisers of the Government in the Transport Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to examine very closely, from their own intimate association with people who put up these figures, to see that the figures are not taken as they are represented, and if there is any reason whatsoever that would enable them to dispute the figures, it would be their duty on behalf of the Government to question them and prove that they are inaccurate.  It takes time to do all these things, when arguments on the one side are contradicted by arguments and statements put up on the other.  I contend that that is another reason why the Government, in their own interests and the interests of the people on whose behalf they are putting forward this Bill&mdash;the general body of the community&mdash;should seriously consider whether asking the Tribunal of three members to deal with two or three things at the same time is not an impossible task and one that will be unworkable in practice.  If what we say takes place, it will mean that the dates now given in the Bill will have to be changed.  That will be a reflection upon the good judgement of the Government, and, in my opinion, what we anticipate in that respect will take place unless the Government agree to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is one of Deputy Alfred Byrne's children, but he has deserted me.  I do not think it needs any words of mine to commend it to the Dáil.  It asks that the amalgamated company shall be in the same position under the Bill as the unamalgamated companies are.  At all events, if the amalgamated company, in their wisdom, find they are in a position to reduce the rates under the Act, as it stands, there is no provision for putting that reduction into operation. I think everybody will agree that in the event of their being willing to reduce their charges, there will be no objection on the part of the people generally, who will receive something in the direction of relief from the charges that are at present prevailing.  I take it that I can count on the support of the Labour Party, as far as that is concerned. And now that the Whips have been taken off, I expect a modicum of support from the Government benches. Sub-section 2 states: &ldquo;Any representative body of traders may apply to the Railway Tribunal to reduce the aforesaid charges or any of them.&rdquo;  That is provided for but, you see, clause 23 deals with the appointed day, and really, in connection with that matter, clauses 23 and 24 go together.  A further amendment that is down dealing with Section 24 clears up this amendment to some extent.  Sub-section 3 says &ldquo;Any trader interested in any particular charge may apply to the Railway Tribunal to reduce that charge.&rdquo;  In other words, the holding up of the operation of the reduced charges will not be so strict as to prevent any obvious case of a just claim being considered and adopted by the companies.  In other words, it is to <Col N="914" /> take it out of the hard and fast scheme of the appointed day.  I think that that also would commend itself to everybody. If in any particular case a trader was able to put up a good and proper claim for a reduction, it ought to be considered and relief given, if possible in the period that will elapse between the passing of this Act and the arrival of the appointed day.</P>
      <P>No. 4 is &ldquo;The Amalgamated Company may apply to the Railway Tribunal to increase the aforesaid charges or any of them.&rdquo;  That does not appeal with so much force to my friends.  Of course, after all, we have to be just in these matters.  Whereas, on the one hand I put forward a one-sided claim on behalf of the traders and on behalf of the users of the railway, with due apologies to the Dáil, and only owing to the great regard I have for just treatment, I put in that last clause.  I am sure I am speaking Deputy Byrne's sentiments, because this is his amendment: &ldquo;Any such application shall be published in such manner as the railway tribunal prescribes, and the tribunal, after hearing all parties whom they consider entitled to be heard, may make such modifications in the said charges or any of them, as to the tribunal may seem just, and shall fix a day upon which the modifications are to come into force.&rdquo;  The main thing in that section is&mdash;</P>

The section as it stands would appear to be mandatory that the charges in operation on the 3rd day of April, 1924, shall be the charges which the railway company will charge for the intervening period.  I ask that it should be specifically stated in the clause that they are at liberty to reduce rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Until now I did not understand why Deputy Hewat proposed the last amendment.  It is quite clear that Deputy Hewat does not want any reduction in charges, and will insist that there shall be no reduction until the amalgamated company is complete; that is to say until the end of December.  Then the amalgamated company will have the option of reducing charges, or the traders will have the option of going before the tribunal to have charges reduced, or companies will have the option of going before the tribunal, but there will be no reduction in charges until this tribunal has either decided that there must be, or the amalgamated company is pleased to make reductions.  There is an attempt in the Bill as it stands, however defective the machinery may be, to reduce some charges, but now Deputy Hewat tells the commercial community that the railway company will look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Railway companies will look after the charges and you need not have any fears.  You are not going to have any reduction in charges until the amalgamated company is perfectly formed and condescends to make reductions. That would be quite understandable from one like Deputy Hewat, if he had not intimated several times to the Dáil that he was not speaking on behalf of railway companies.  He is speaking on behalf of the commercial community. He tells that commercial community that they must be satisfied with existing charges until at least the company is very well formed as an amalgamated company.  After that you can make your case and prove to the Tribunal that such reductions should take place.  Then there may be reductions. <Col N="916" /> I wonder will Deputy Wilson now support this amendment?  The motion which it is sought to amend intimates that the charges in force on the 3rd April shall be the maximum, but this amendment makes it possible to have increases.  Again, Deputy Hewat is talking for the commercial community. I hope the commercial community will be thankful to him.</P>

      <P>Might I ask Deputy Johnson to refer to Clause 30.  It is a little bit ahead, but he will see in that that there is provision in this Bill for non-amalgamated companies.  All that this amendment, so far as I can see, does is to extend what you provide for the non-amalgamated companies to the amalgamated companies.  In essence, that is what it amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat is assuming&mdash;I think wrongly, according to the Bill&mdash;that the powers of the Tribunal over non-amalgamated companies are nil.  That is not so.  The Bill gives the Tribunal such powers as the Tribunal may wish to use in order to exercise control over non-amalgamated companies inside the area of the Free State. The non-amalgamated companies are not so free as he thinks from the activities of this terrible Tribunal, which he is trying to knock out of every clause of this Bill.  Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good have already stressed the point&mdash;and no doubt there is a good deal in it&mdash;that a good deal more consideration has been given to the traders in the area served by the non-amalgamated companies than has been given in the areas served by the companies constituting the amalgamated company, which it is proposed to form under the terms of this Bill.  I can understand the position of the companies that it is now proposed to bring within the terms of this amalgamation Bill and their general attitude to the traders and others who may be concerned with railway working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Free State Government, or the Provisional Government, before the Free State Government, told the railway companies of this country&mdash;all and not a section&mdash;that they were not satisfied with the present system of organisation of the Irish railways. They gave them a certain time to make <Col N="917" /> up their minds and to see if they could agree upon a scheme of re-organisation within certain lines that were apparently laid down by the Provisional Government at the time and subsequently by the Free State Government. The companies knew perfectly well who were to come within the meaning of that Bill, and the companies that it is now proposed should come within the amalgamation scheme naturally did all they possibly could to put as much money as possible into their Exchequer before amalgamation would come into operation.  The other companies, knowing they would not be interfered with or interfered with only to the extent that this Bill provides, did of their own free will what they possibly could to reduce their rates.  That is the real explanation, and Deputy Good should be quite prepared to admit that.  Of course, it is quite clear to anybody who opens his eyes and sees the real meaning of the amendment that Deputy Hewat is moving in order that the amalgamated company may apply to the Railway Tribunal&mdash;in this he is prepared to recognise the Railway Tribunal&mdash;to enforce these charges.  If Deputy Wilson, who has supported him on a previous amendment, with his eyes already open, is prepared to support him in this, let him explain to the agricultural community why he is prepared to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. P. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, the history of the dispute is as follows:&mdash;A member of the Transport Union was promoted by the Gas Company to a post which involved, according <Col N="918" /> to the Company, his resignation from the Union.  He was unwilling to resign from the Union, and the Company then intimated that he must revert to his previous position in their employment.</P>
      <P>The question was taken up by the Transport Union as a matter of principle, and the Union claimed that the employee in question should retain his promotion and also his membership of the Union.  Conferences on the matter failed to arrive at a settlement and a week's notice was given by the Union of a stoppage of work for Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I met representatives of both parties on Monday last, when it appeared that the situation was complicated by other alleged grievances on the part of the Union.  I suggested that the stoppage of work, of which notice had been given, should be deferred until an independent person had been given an opportunity to inquire into all the grievances alleged to exist.  This suggestion was accepted by the Company, and the representatives of the Union agreed to put it before the men.</P>
      <P>Next morning I was informed that the men had by a majority rejected the proposal.  I then decided, as I stated in the House on Tuesday, to appoint a formal Court of Inquiry.</P>
      <P>Mr. Allan, who was appointed for the purpose, invited the Union and the Gas Company to meet him at 11 o'clock this morning.  Shortly before 11 the following letter was received from the General President of the Union in reply to the invitation to attend the Court:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To Mr. J. Connell,</P>
      <P>Secretary, Court of Inquiry,</P>
      <P>24 Kildare Street.</P>
      <P>16th May, 1924.</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>We are in receipt of your letter of the 15th inst. inviting this Union to be represented at the Court of Inquiry to be held to-day at 11 a.m. at 24 Kildare Street, and we regret that this Union is unable to be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men concerned in this dispute have declined to accept our advice to continue working pending the decision of the Court of Inquiry, and after the stoppage had taken place, <Col N="919" /> they declined to take a ballot vote on the same issue.  In addition, the men have appointed as spokesman a person who is not an official or a member of this Union, and under these circumstances, this Union is unable to attend the Inquiry.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">IRISH TRANSPORT AND GENERAL WORKERS' UNION.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Per,</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) THOMAS FORAN,</P>
    <P Just="Right">General President.</P>
    <P>Shortly after 11 o'clock, representatives of the men and of the company attended at Mr. Allan's offices.  Mr. Allan read the letter which I have quoted, and explained that in view of the terms of the letter he could not proceed with the inquiry until he had referred to me for instructions, as his terms of reference related to a dispute between the Transport Union and the Company, whereas the letter I have read intimated that the Union would not be associated with the inquiry.  The representatives of the men informed Mr. Allan that they were prepared to proceed, but desired to appoint their own spokesman.  Mr. Allan then referred the matter to me.</P>
    <P>I have considered the position very carefully.  As I see it, the men have repudiated the officials of their Union and are now engaged in a strike which is not official nor authorised by the Union.  I understand that the Union will not pay strike pay.  The first issue before the Court of Inquiry is an issue involving a principle of trades unionism, namely, whether a certain post in the employment of the Gas Company should be held by a member of a Union. It appears to me embarrassing, if not ridiculous, for the Court of Inquiry to be asked to consider such an issue at the instance of members of the Union who have repudiated the officials of the Union.  Any recommendations for a settlement made by the Court could not be made the basis of an agreement between the Union and the Company, since the Union is not a party to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, informed Mr. Allan that I do not see my way to amend the terms of reference so as to exclude the <Col N="920" /> Union.  If workers who belong to a trade union and become parties to a dispute, particularly a dispute involving a question of trades unionism, repudiate their officials, a Government Department cannot in formal proceedings appear to endorse that repudiation. It is not a question of persons or of principles, it is simply a question of the orderly conduct of business.  Chaos would result if in dealing with industrial difficulties neither the Government, the public, nor employers knew with whom agreements were to be negotiated, nor who had authority to make a binding arrangement.</P>
    <P>I regret that matters of this kind should have intervened to delay a speedy settlement.  I understand that even if work were resumed at once the gas supply could not be restored for a week or more.  This makes it all the more urgent in the public interest that an early settlement should be sought through the regular and recognised channels of negotiation, and judging by the letter I have read from the Union officials, this should not be difficult of accomplishment if they take proper part in the proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to the distress at present prevailing in the West of Ireland.  I have nothing of an alarmist character to say about the matter.  Complaints have come from several counties in the West of Ireland, and in some quarters these have been been characterised as exaggeration. There may be exaggeration, but when you make discount for exaggeration there is unfortunately a very serious sub-stratum of truth in the reports that come from the West of Ireland. The potato crop failed to a large extent on the poor soil of Connemara, Mayo, and other portions of Connaught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the potato crop with the large farmer, or where the land is good, is not a matter of very serious consequence, but when you take into consideration that the whole of our land is very poor you will have an idea what the condition is of those who have to live on the cultivation of those patches.  I made inquiries myself into a number of cases and the report I got was that by this time the supply of potatoes was very nearly exhausted. My informant who told me about the condition of one parish in particular, said that if the people used them as seed they would not have them for the use of the family.  They had not a supply of seed oats either.  They depended on the local shopkeepers for groceries and in some cases the shopkeepers threatened to stop supplying them as their credit was exhausted. I must say the Government and the Co. Council met me to some extent by supplying the people with <Col N="922" /> seed potatoes by means of a loan.  That is not enough.  There is serious distress in Mayo and large portions of County Galway.  The Local Government Dept. sent down their Inspectors who furnished reports on the situation. As a result of that grants were given to Donegal, Connemara and North Mayo.  As far as these grants went they were so much to the good, but they were not sufficient and left wide districts not touched upon at all.  I do not wish to exaggerate the conditions in Mayo, but I say the distress is confined to some small districts, particularly to the parish of Partry, and that has not been touched upon and no provision has been made for it.  The people there are in great distress.  They are discouraged.  The potato crop is growing less and nothing appears to have been done for them.  The Government have listened to their Inspectors and have given more credence to the accounts of the Inspectors than they have to our accounts.  They consider that we have exaggerated the situation. I hold that with regard to the small districts of Mayo, with which I am acquainted, we have not exaggerated the situation, and I have received distressing letters from priests like Father Healy describing the sorrowful condition of their people.  They held public meetings in Louisburg describing the situation there and asking for work.  The Mayo Co. Council passed a resolution about Achill.  People say: &ldquo;Here is the same old story about distress in the West,&rdquo; and they are surprised at its continuance.  When the cause of the distress continues it is not surprising that the distress has continued. It is impossible for them to live on the small holdings.  Nothing has been done to better their lot, while people say: &ldquo;Here they are again with their cry of distress from the West.&rdquo;  As regards some of the areas with which I am acquainted, there is really good ground for the cry, and it should be listened to.  And something should be done.</P>
    <P>We were hoping that the Minister for Agriculture would be able to commence the &ldquo;striping&rdquo; and dividing of the ranches, and we put off making any urgent appeal pending that division. The &ldquo;striping&rdquo; of the ranches would <Col N="923" /> end, to a large extent, the state of poverty that exists there.  We met the Minister for Agriculture and he told us about the necessary and unavoidable delay that took place in enquiring into the titles and the rentals of those estates that are to be divided and all that necessary work.  That was a reasonable explanation of the delay in the dividing up of the ranches, which cannot be divided up for the next two or three months, and perhaps longer. That means that nothing can be done at once in that direction.  To get over the acute distress that prevails, immediate work should be provided for those people who are badly in need of it.  If you are going to increase the farms and give the farms to people generally with large families you must not allow any of these people to suffer in the meantime.  These people are the seed from which you will draw in the future.  I am moving in the matter to-day, because I saw that at a conference at Clifden, at which the Archbishop of Tuam presided, a resolution was passed referring to the acute distress.  I do not think that that conference would have thought it necessary to pass that resolution impressing on the Government the necessity of providing work for these people if there was no real necessity for it, and unless there were very good grounds for their appeal.  I see that at Oughterard also the Home Assistance Officer said that the unusual illness of the people and the increased illness there, were due to starvation. That is going very far.  Now we are not as badly off in Mayo, but we are badly off enough.  We are not so badly off as they are in Galway.  In some places in Northern Mayo, such as Erris, the people are in a very bad way, too. Some work has been started there, but in the parish of Ballindine and other parishes there is great distress.  In consequence of the extraordinary congestion and the acute distress that exists some public works have been started there.  The distress is so acute that, in fact, the priest has gone out to each home, and he selects the men from each house alternately in order to distribute the work.  That is a poor way of doing things.</P>
    <P>Now if the Minister could say that <Col N="924" /> where this distress is there is no work to be done, he would have a very good excuse, though I do not say that the Government would want any excuse, or that they would use any such excuse. But in the county, where the congestion to which I am referring prevails, there is a considerable amount of public work requiring to be done. There are arrears of work that have been left lying over by the negligent Governments we had in Ireland in the past.  There are bogs to be opened up, bogs that now can be taken over and divided under the new Land Act. There are roads to be made into these bogs.  True we have not an area like the Barrow Basin which is flooded, but we have little rivers there that do their own share of flooding, and these destroy the crops year after year, and the people are continually having reason to complain of the amount of destruction to crops done by these little rivers.  These people wait on me every time I go down there to put that matter before me, and through me before the Government.  In one case they had a scheme which was passed by the old Local Government Board, and got a grant from the Development Commissioners, but that scheme was held up by the War.  It was pigeon-holed, and the people are now crying out to have this work done.  We say that is work that should be done.  The people would be crying out to have it done even if there were no distress at all. As a matter of fact, the Minister should welcome this opportunity to get this development work carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said the other day that there was great scarcity of money.  Still, money could easily be provided for work of reconstruction. I submit that very valuable work of reconstruction could be started in these places that I have mentioned.  I suggest that the Government should look into this matter; that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance should be able to put forward a scheme to relieve those districts that are affected in this way, and not be throwing the responsibility on the county councils who are not able to grapple with these schemes.  They have their own difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the representatives for one of those areas affected in the way in which Deputy Sears has put before the Dáil, I desire to join with him in urging the Government to tackle this very pressing question. It is not a question of to-day or yesterday; it is one almost of annual recurrence.  This position of distress in the West was regarded as one of the biggest blots under the old British regime.  Here we are after two years of our own Government, and we have the problem with us still, and no indication that it is going to be tackled in a national way, the only way in which it could be tackled.  It is, as Deputy Sears has pointed out, supposed to be exaggerated.  I can assure the Dáil that it is not exaggerated in any way. I do not think that the Archbishop of Tuam and the clergy of Clifden would be the people who would exaggerate the destitution that prevails.  Yet we have those Government inspectors, from one time to another, going through these districts, and after making a few superficial inquiries they go back and say: &ldquo;Oh!  the tales that we hear about distress are exaggerated.&rdquo; They know very little about the position when they make these re ports.  This is not a new matter even to the present Government, for it is some months ago since the representatives of the Province of Connaught, irrespective of Party&mdash;for Party does not enter into this matter&mdash;made representations to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, and pointed out to them what the position in the West was.  Promises were made that immediate action would be taken, and we were informed that works would be opened up here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Sears has pointed out, certain works have been opened and certain employment has been given.  But the employment given and the amount of money set apart for this employment is altogether inadequate to meet the situation that exists in the West.  I do not wish to go in any way into details as to what might have been done in this matter, but it is certainly evident that the Government have not tackled this question of distress in the way in which they ought to <Col N="926" /> have tackled it.  It is no use to leave this to local effort.  Local effort is not capable of dealing with the problem that exists there.  It is a strange thing, but it is a matter that requires some explanation, that even the share of the road grant that was given to the county council has not for some reason or another found its way into the Clifden area, and a proper share has not found its way into areas where it is most sadly wanted.</P>
    <P>The District Council of Oughterard has complained that it did not get its share of the road grant.  That is a matter in regard to which we should have some explanation.  I might refer, too, to the ever-recurring problem of the fever in the Lettermore district.  That is caused largely through the want of a pure water supply.  Nothing has been done and nothing is being done to deal with that very urgent matter.  I join with Deputy Sears in impressing upon the Ministry the urgency of this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that more time could not be devoted to the consideration of this very important question.  I desire to associate myself with the other speakers in regard to the conditions of distress existing in several parts of Ireland.  In the county that I come from the conditions are fully as acute, and perhaps more extreme, than in the areas referred to by Deputy Sears and other Deputies.  The position in Donegal is pretty acute at the present moment, and we are faced with something approaching a crisis. Other Deputies have dealt with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government.  I will deal with another Ministry, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has knowledge of the circumstances existing in districts particularly on the western seaboard.  We have a right to demand from the Minister that he should produce some scheme of relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people living in the districts referred to are seriously affected and are suffering many hardships.  They are our own people, and we should give some consideration to the fact that they did their own share in securing <Col N="927" /> for us the liberty we have attained.  It is the duty of the Minister to conserve and consolidate and endeavour to get some schemes of re-construction in operation so as to alleviate to some extent at any rate the existing distress. The people are very willing to work; it is not purely a question of their willingness or unwillingness.  They are anxious to get something to do.  Some of them hold small bits of land, but these are scarcely sufficient to afford a livelihood.  It is the duty of the Minister to provide some schemes whereby an improvement will be brought about in those districts, and under which the people will be able to live in some condition of decency.  We should endeavour to preserve the Celtic spirit that prevails in those areas, together with the native language and customs. Unless we do that everything we have gained will be thrown by the board. The duty devolves on the Minister, and he should not hesitate to accept that duty.</P>
    <P>If schemes of reconstruction and development such as I suggest involve the expenditure of huge sums of money, let it be understood that there will be people there to make it a reproductive concern.  There need be no fear that such schemes will be otherwise than reproductive.  The people will do their best in that direction, and they will be glad to be afforded some opportunity of living in decent conditions in their own country.  I attach a great deal of importance to the position of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I hope he will not let down the parts of the country that we speak for. To a very large extent those very areas are the bedrock of the nation.  By ignoring the appeal of the inhabitants there for assistance, you are doing serious injury to the nation; if you accede to their request and put development schemes into operation, you are doing good work for the country.</P>

I am glad that this matter has been raised, in public, by Deputy Sears.  It is well to say that the representatives <Col N="928" /> of all parties from the Western districts were aware that the situation was very bad in the West, and they held meetings and urged upon the Minister the necessity for attending to this matter.  In response to the appeal made by the Deputies from the Western seaboard, the Land Commission started some works, but the distress existing there is so bad that these works are not sufficient to alleviate it.  Some time ago a special grant was given to those distressed districts. The amount was £100,000, and works were decided upon by the Ministry for Local Government and the Local Councils, but, unfortunately, they were held up.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to make this grant available again.  If that grant was given to those districts it would relieve the situation at the moment.  In addition, it would be well if the Land Commission were to take up the matter of dealing with the estates in those districts, because the distribution of land and the resulting work on the holdings would give a good deal of employment.  I may mention also that the large bog wastes in the Western districts could be made reproductive if the system of planting were introduced.</P>

The same applies equally to Achill, in the Westport Union, and the Land Commission has done absolutely nothing there to relieve that distress.  Nothing whatever was done.  In that area you have poverty, sickness and distress on the one-side of the county.  On the other side of the county you have the sheriff's bailiffs driving the cattle off the land, but I am glad to say, however, that they have been prevented from doing that latterly.

    <P>I did not intend to intervene in this <Col N="929" /> debate, but there was one thing said by Deputy O'Connell that I would like to correct.  He says there was a feeling in Connemara that the people of Clifden did not get their fair share of the road grant.  Well there was an unanimous decision come to at the County Council meeting allocating the unexpended money and the Clifden members of the County Council were absolutely satisfied with it and agreed that Clifden had got its fair share of the grant.</P>

      <P>This offensive by the men of the West has taken me more or less by surprise.  I have not had any official representations of any kind about any very acute distress in the West.  We hear a certain amount of rumours all over the country as to distress and the failure of the potato crop and all that sort of thing, but not of such a serious character as to make <Col N="930" /> Government intervention necessary. Some months ago we investigated this question of distress thoroughly all along the Western seaboard.  Inspectors of my department collaborated with inspectors from the Board of Agriculture, and as a result of their representations we did a considerable amount to relieve distress in these areas.  When cases of real distress were put up before us, we came to the relief of the persons concerned.  We have not heard anything about the cases put up here, but if any urgent case is brought before my department we will be ready to consider it and do what we can to relieve the distress.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a sum of £92 16s. 6d. is due to Mr. S. Jordan, boot and leather merchant, Athenry, on account of boots supplied during the months of February, March and April, 1922, to the National Troops at Renmore Barracks; whether repeated applications have been made for payment of this account without avail; whether the Battalion Paymaster from Tuam made investigations and vouched the account as correct, and whether he will see that immediate payment of this long outstanding account is now made.</P>

      <P>A claim for the amount mentioned has been received from Mr. Jordan, and is at present under investigation.  It has not yet been definitely ascertained that there is a liability on Army Funds for payment, the goods having been ordered by a member of the Irregular forces.  A decision on the claim is, however, being expedited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a motor bicycle, the property of Mr. Patrick O'Brien, King Street, Athlone, was commandeered by Irish Volunteers on November 1st, 1921; that a claim amounting to £100 has been lodged in respect of this bicycle, and whether he will state if, and when, claims for goods commandeered in the pre-truce period by Irish Volunteers will be paid.</P>

      <P>The facts appear to be as stated.  The claim has not been paid, as it arose during a period in respect of which claims cannot be discharged out of funds voted by the Dáil for the maintenance of the Army.  The general question as to what extent and from what funds such claims may be settled is at present under consideration. I will communicate with the Deputy regarding Mr. O'Brien's case in due course.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that dependent's allowance has not been paid to Mrs. Mary Maher, Monroe, Newtown, Nenagh, wife of Private James Maher, 16740, although she has been married since January 17th, 1924, and whether he will have this case considered with a view to payment.</P>

      <P>Under present regulations (Defence Order No. 30) marriage allowance is not issuable in the cases of soldiers who marry after the 8th October last.  The revision of those regulations is about to be considered. Pending the issue of new regulations I regret that it is not practicable to grant an allowance to Mrs. Maher.</P>
