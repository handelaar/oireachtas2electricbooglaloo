      <P>I find that Patrick Meehan, on a claim made on the 30th June last, was paid unemployment benefit for 60 days, which was the maximum amount payable in the third benefit year.  Mr. Meehan had altogether only 61 contributions to his credit at the commencement of the third benefit year.  Sixty of these were exhausted by the unemployment benefit paid in that year.  On a further claim made on the 30th October at the commencement of the current benefit year he was allowed benefit for one day, representing the unexhausted balance of his contributions to the unemployment fund.  Payment of this amount, less a sum of 1/2 payable to the Home Help Authority under the Unemployment Insurance Act, was tendered to and refused by him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that on a claim which he made on the 30th June last, James Curtiss was paid Unemployment Benefit for 41 days.  This exhausted his credit in the Unemployment Fund as there was only evidence of 41 contributions having been paid for him altogether under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  This total of 41 contributions included six contributions for which he was given credit on the Unemployment Book current for the 1922/23 insurance year which was lost somewhere about the end of the year 1922.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I can inform the Deputy that credit is allowed for contributions stated to have been paid by means of stamps affixed to Unemployment Books which have been lost, destroyed, or defaced, if it is established that such contributions have in fact been paid. I will be glad to consider any additional evidence Mr. Curtiss can produce, showing that he should be credited with further contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for a little more information on one point.  I think he will agree with me, and the Dáil will agree with me, that this Bill, which we hope will produce beneficient results, is only the beginning in tackling a very great problem.  The limitation of the hours during which drink is sold may be a benefit, but at the same time it may be a nuisance.  Whether it may be a benefit or otherwise, you cannot really tackle the drink problem until you have tackled the excessive number of publichouses which exist in the country.  In speaking to this Bill the Minister indicated that he was going to set up some form of inquiry into how that excessive number of publichouses could be dealt with in fairness to all the interests concerned, and he mentioned either a Departmental Committee or a Commission as the most suitable body.  I want to urge upon him now, if possible, to abandon the idea of the Departmental Committee.  In dealing with a problem of this size, a Departmental Committee is not the most convenient form of inquiry. I do not think it would carry sufficient public confidence.  A Commission, in which all interests would be represented, would be more suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind was a committee which would take evidence in public, and which would educate the public mind.  The Minister has in mind a committee which would sit privately, and very likely get through the business more expeditiously. I would prefer the type of committee I have in mind.  The great evil &mdash; I will not say the great evil, but rather the great defect &mdash; in the Minister's scheme, has been that he was legislating somewhat in advance of public opinion, and because of that he has had to abandon what I personally regarded as one of the most valuable sections of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill &mdash; one that I had been in favour of for very many years.  The public mind needs to be educated on those matters, and I do hope that the Minister will put aside the idea of a committee that will only sit in private, and that will present private conclusions to be cogitated over by the Minister, from whose head will suddenly spring ideas, just as Minerva sprang from the head of her father.  A far more preferable type of inquiry would be one that would sit in public and take evidence and help people to understand what are the difficulties in arriving at a solution.</P>

In connection with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill we were largely expressing our own opinions; yet it is a matter that ought to come from a public demand for reform.  On the other hand, the setting up and the working of this commission or committee, or whatever it is going to be, will be much more tedious than if it was an expert committee. I am inclined to agree with Deputy Cooper that a public committee will serve the object of coming to a conclusion that will have a certain weight of public opinion behind it, and in that way it will be very valuable.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Connor Hogan.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;kept,&rdquo; line 29, to insert the words &ldquo;but nothing in this section shall be construed in the revocation of the licence aforesaid, as prohibiting the owner of any pedigree herd retaining a pure bred bull of identical breed for stud purposes with the herd aforesaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will read the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Duggan, which has been accepted, I think he will find that the purpose of Deputy Connor Hogan's amendment is met by that amendment.  The Deputy will remember also that I gave an undertaking to Deputy Johnson that this section would be sub-divided on Report so that certain changes might be made which would make the position clearer. As the section stands at present, it is obvious that a licence would be refused in every case referred to in clause (c); that is, where the bull was affected by any contagious or infectious disease.  On the other hand, it is equally obvious that the Minister should exercise discretion with regard to clause (b).  The proposal is that the clause be changed so that it would run something like this: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time suspend or revoke the licence if he is satisfied the bull to which such licence relates is not suitable for the district in which he is kept.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we are in agreement that there are certain districts into which it would be wrong to bring certain types of bulls.  I instanced myself the Cahirciveen district of Kerry, and I said it would be wrong to let a Shorthorn bull in there.  I think every Deputy will agree with me in that.  It was then pointed out that in the case of a pure-bred bull, used exclusively <Col N="1087" /> by the owner for his own herd, there should be discretion on the part of the Minister to allow such a bull for, say, a Shorthorn or Hereford herd.  As the section is altered, it is clear, in view of the amendment which is proposed to be inserted, that the Minister may license a half-bred bull kept exclusively for the use of such herd, even in a district like Cahirciveen.  The object of that clause, which is causing a considerable amount of trouble, and which looks dangerous, is to prevent such a case as this arising, because it might very easily arise.  Take the district I have mentioned, Cahirciveen, in Kerry, where there is a fine breed of Kerry cows, where people come in to buy, and where they would be absolutely certain they would get good Kerry cows.  An owner there might want a Shorthorn bull.  We can let him, if we have that discretion.  But suppose every owner there wanted to be allowed to bring in a Shorthorn bull the effect would be that the breeders would say that the Kerry breed is being crossed in Cahirciveen, and they might say: &ldquo;We cannot go there in future and buy Kerry cows,&rdquo; and so on.  We must draw the line somewhere. I think Deputy Duggan's amendment, changing the section, makes it clear that we have discretion to do the right thing.  I am afraid the Deputy will have to leave it to the Department and the Minister to do the right thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;<Col N="1089" /> Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall after consultation with such bodies and persons as he may consider representative of the interests concerned establish by order an advisory council in each administrative county for the purpose of giving advice to the Minister in connection with the administration of this Act in so far as paragraph <i>(b)</i> sub-section (1) of Section 3 and paragraph <i>(b)</i> of Section 4 are concerned.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The said advisory councils shall consist of such persons as the Minister after such consultation as aforesaid shall from time to time appoint to be members thereof, each of whom shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership of such county advisory council for two years from the date of his appointment, but shall be eligible for re-nomination.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The said county advisory councils shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister, and also on such other occasions as the said county advisory councils shall from time to time determine..&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The idea of this amendment is that it should not lie with the Department to say what type of a bull should be kept in a district, but that a special advisory council should be set up in each county.  I do not exactly stand by the wording of the amendment, or by the division of the country into sections, but I stand by the principle that an advisory council should be set up. It might be better, perhaps, to set up provincial advisory councils, or councils covering two or three counties where farming is more or less of the same character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that I was willing to insert an amendment, with the necessary charges, similar to Section 45 of the Dairy Produce Bill, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall, after consultation with such bodies and persons as he may consider most representative of the several interests <Col N="1090" /> concerned establish by order a consultative council for giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with any matter in relation to the making of regulations under, or otherwise carrying into execution of, the provisions of this Act, or any other matters affecting the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The said consultative council shall consist of such persons as the Minister after such consultation as aforesaid shall from time to time nominate to be members thereof, each of whom shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership for two years only from the date of his nomination, but shall be eligible for re-nomination.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The said consultative council shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister, and also on such other occasions as the council may from time to time determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not very much difference between that section and this amendment. I would point out to the Deputy that his amendment does not establish the sort of body that he has defined in his speech.  This is only a consultative or advisory council, and it could not have the last word.  The Department of Agriculture will be responsible for the administration of this Bill, and will be held responsible for the results.  That being so, the Department must have the last word, and must be in a position to turn down the advice of the consultative or advisory council &mdash; which ever you like to call it &mdash; if the Department thinks well.  The real use of an advisory council is that you would have a number of men on it in touch with the industry itself &mdash; able men who know their business. The Department is anxious to administer this Bill, like the Dairy Bill, in consultation with the interests concerned. We realise that a council composed of men who know their business, and who have spent their lives in breeding, rearing, and dealing with live stock, could give really useful assistance and advice.</P>
    <P>We propose to set up such a council. We shall not set it up for adornment. It is not to be a camouflaged body.  We <Col N="1091" /> are going to ask its advice, but, if the Department thinks it right to refuse to act on the advice of such a body, the whole matter can be discussed in the Dáil.  The Minister representing the Department will be under the necessity of defending in the Dáil, and before every Party, his action in refusing to act on the advice of such a body.  That, I think, makes it absolutely certain that the body will have real functions. On the other hand, the Department must be judged by the results of this Bill.  We will have the responsibility for the Bill, and must have the last word.  You could not have a body of that sort actually administering.  The reason I point that out is, that even the amendment refers to an advisory council, but the Deputy spoke as if it were to be an administrative council, which would make regulations and lay down the law that the Department would have to follow.</P>

      <P>There is no reason for having provincial councils.  Why should you have provincial councils?  The provinces were delimited for reasons which have nothing to do with the live-stock industry.  You have different breeds of live-stock in each county. You have the same sort of stock in what we have left of Ulster as in Munster. You have the dairy industry in Ulster and in Munster; to a lesser extent in Connaught, and to a certain extent in Leinster.  On the other hand, you have certain districts of certain counties where there are special breeds of cattle &mdash; such as Kerry &mdash; or districts where purely beef cattle are bred. These districts do not coincide in any way with the counties or rural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> In my opinion the council should be representative of the various interests. It should be representative of the dairying interests wherever they are, whether Munster, Ulster, Leinster or Connaught; of the store districts and of the beef districts.  There should be representatives not only of the breeds of cattle, but of the particular uses to which these breeds are put.  For instance, you have dairy Shorthorns and beef Shorthorns, you have breeders, feeders and farmers who should be represented. It is on these lines it is proposed to constitute the council.</P>
    <P>There is no point in constituting such a council according to provinces. My own idea would be to consult the various associations and ask them to nominate members.  I will not bind myself to this, as I have not thought it out in detail, but my idea at present is to ask the various associations to nominate certain men, leaving me a discretion to pick from within these nominations.  It would be quite impossible to say to associations such as the Farmers' Union, the Kerry Cattle Association, and so on, &ldquo;nominate so many representatives,&rdquo; and that they should automatically go on the council. I want a really good council composed of the best men in the trade.  I think it is only in that way you will get them.  Undoubtedly the associations should have a certain say as to the personnel and I propose to give them some influence by enabling them to nominate a certain number of members from which I would pick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to recommend Deputies in the Farmers' Party to scrutinise this whole transaction very closely.  Otherwise, if I may respectfully say so, although they know their own business better than I do, I think they are going to be let down badly. I think that what is at the back of Deputy Heffernan's mind in connection with the amendment is that he wants an organisation set up which will, more or less, keep control apart from the Department.  The Minister says, and I think very naturally, &ldquo;No, hands off, farmers, I am going to do this job.  I am going to nominate the Committee, and I am going to make it a little tail <Col N="1093" /> that I can wag any way I like!&rdquo;  This is a very big industry, and the whole trend of this Bill, as far as the farmers are concerned, is to put them in the halfpenny place.  The whole trend of the Minister's thought is in the direction of keeping control over the industry. The weak point is that the farmers propose to let that go on.  I respectfully submit that they will be sorry a little later on that they did any such thing.  We all know what Government Departments are.  They are inclined to be autocratic, bureaucratic, and certainly are not in the least inclined to take advice, if that advice does not suit them.  This council under the Minister for Agriculture is going to be more or less of a farce unless the Farmers' Party assert themselves.  I would deprecate very much any such line of action as is indicated here, as it is not in the interests of the industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>If you had a live body with a solid backing of farmers I think it could be of great assistance to the Minister, but the moment this opinion comes into conflict with the opinion of the Department, if the Minister has the right and can ignore this body altogether, then I say to the farmers: &ldquo;Better not set it up at all; it is going to do no good.&rdquo; Visualise the trend of things in connection with the farming industry under our worthy and respected Minister for Agriculture, who works on the lines that he hopes the model farms run by the Department will never by any chance make a profit, and I think Deputies will get their minds on a line with the progress of events that will develop, unless the Farmers' Party, or the farmers of the country, retain a reasonable amount of control of the policy that is going to be adopted by the Department in connection with this and other matters.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill we asked for an advisory committee and the Minister has met us. We did not intend that it should be an administrative committee.  The Minister took a wrong impression if he thought that.  I asked the Minister previously to indicate how many members would constitute the committee and where they would be drawn from.  We do not want a provincial committee. We believe that a committee drawn from all parts of the Saorstát will get the same attention as if it was composed of members from the provinces or from counties.  We would like to know how many members have been allocated to the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Hewat's remarks, our minds are more or less at ease on that question.  The Minister has promised us this committee.  We do not want it to be an administrative committee but we want an advisory committee.  That being so, and as the Government are administering the Bill, we admit that it should have the last word.  Any Government worthy of the name should have the last word.  If the advice of that committee, which we might think right, is turned down by the Department, we have the Dáil in which to ventilate any complaint. Although there are only fifteen Deputies in the Farmers' Party we might have thirty or forty, perhaps fifty or sixty in the next Dáil.  If my forecast is of any use it will be fifty next time.</P>

We claim that the farmers' organisation should be represented on the council by one member from each county, or 26 altogether.  I do not think that would be too much.  I do not care what interests these representatives are concerned with.  The Southern districts, where cattle are largely bred, would require larger representation than districts where cattle are fed only. We want more people from breeding districts than any other districts to tender advice.  I would like if the Minister gave an outline of what is to be the personnel and the constitution of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the line the discussion on Deputy Heffernan's amendment has taken shows that its ostensible supporters are really not supporting it.  The Minister promised to set up an advisory council for advising on the administration of this particular Bill, and it is to be an advisory council representing all the interests concerned.  There is another advisory council in respect of dairying, representing its various interests and advising the Minister.  Presumably following that line there will be councils advising the Minister if he brings in a Bill relating to any other department of agriculture.  I think it is right that the Minister should have advisory councils, if not any other kind of councils, but I suggest that when you are dealing with the cattle trade &mdash; or, rather, when you are thinking of a council representing the whole of the farmers' interests in relation to cattle breeding &mdash; you should have a council to deal with the whole of the cattle industry and not merely a council to advise in the administration of this particular Bill.  The proposition of Deputy Heffernan, as it seems to me, is brought forward to meet the arguments used at an early stage.  The Minister himself has instanced, to-day as previously, Cahirciveen district and the unwisdom of introducing Shorthorns amongst breeds of Kerry cattle.  But if you <Col N="1096" /> have an advisory committee representing the whole country, there is at least a possibility that Shorthorn interests might predominate, and they would be just as likely to forget the particular interests of Kerry as the Minister without the advisory committee.</P>
      <P>Now, the proposition in the amendment seemed to me to be sound in this sense, that it intended that the Minister, before introducing a particular character or breed of cattle into a particular district, would take the advice of the people in that district.  I think that is sound, but the proposal which Deputy Gorey and Deputy Heffernan supports is to have an advisory council, representing cattle breeding interests over the whole country, which is entirely different from that in the amendment. I think it is sound to say that before issuing an order respecting the breeds of cattle in a particular district that the views of the people in that district should be sought, and that is what apparently was desired by Deputy Heffernan, when he was framing this amendment.  I hope that idea will be embodied somehow in the Bill, whether the larger idea is embodied or not.  It is quite a distinct one and, apart from the larger proposition which the Minister now supports, he should state his views in regard to the proposal for a local advisory committee in a particular area where peculiar characteristics among cattle are considered to be desirable.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given an illustration.  He has spoken of Dingle peninsula and Kerry generally. He has also spoken at other times of Limerick and Tipperary, and that, to me, would indicate the necessity of having, shall I call them, &ldquo;regional councils.&rdquo;  There is no necessity of defining beforehand the region or the area from which the council shall be drawn, but before an Order of the Minister is made, in respect to any <Col N="1097" /> area, the advice of the people within that area, however large or small it might be, would be taken through a council of the kind.  I think that is a sound proposition and if the Minister and his successors are discreet enough it is likely to be followed whether there is a council or not.  When we are promised a council representing the whole country in respect of cattle breeding, there is even a greater probability perhaps that that council will advise against the interests of a particular locality, overlooking its peculiarities.  A council of that kind, if a particular type of cattle interest were affected, might not be as discriminating as the Minister's own expert advisers would be, and I would urge that the proposition that is in the amendment should receive consideration apart from the other proposition. It is quite a distinct one and is, I think, a valuable suggestion.  I do not think it is covered by this phraseology, but certainly the idea is one which I think should be embodied in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has largely voiced my views with regard to this matter.  I knew what I intended to convey when I put this amendment down.  The Minister avoided that issue and went on to this matter of the general Consultative or Advisory Councils.  I was glad to hear him say that he is willing to grant an Advisory Council for all Ireland, and I am perfectly willing to accept that suggestion.  On this amendment Deputy Johnson has covered my views with regard to the matter.  I call the Minister's attention to the fact that these councils would only be set up to deal with sub-section (b) of Section 3, and sub-section (b) of Section 4 &mdash; that is as regards the breed or type that was to be used in a particular district. I told the Minister I was not tied down to the question of a county, but I think there is something in Deputy Johnson's idea with regard to Regional Councils being set up.  The Minister can easily understand that. He can get certain districts in which a Regional Council could be established &mdash; for example, parts of Limerick, South Tipperary and Cahirciveen, in County Kerry.</P>

Except the Minister makes his Committee very large and unwieldy he may, by accident or otherwise, get a Council, a majority of whom will favour particular breeds &mdash; men belonging, say, to the Aberdeen Angus or Shorthorn Breeders' Association. They will endeavour to force their ideas against the will of the people in those districts.  My idea is that this Council should be set up to deal with the particular type.  Once the Council has decided what type it is going to allow into those districts, its purpose would be fulfilled, and there would be no necessity for it to continue.

      <P>The Deputy has turned &ldquo;Bolshie&rdquo; but he does not know it.  I am warning him.  He suggested that this council would be a real danger unless it was turned into a Soviet &mdash; except it was a body that would have some real control over the policy of the department.  Beyond yea or nay he said that.  What does that amount to?  It amounts to this &mdash; and I put it in all seriousness, as a fellow-Conservative, to Deputy Hewat &mdash; that a body outside the Dáil and non-representative should control the policy of a Government Department.  That may or may not be right.  In any event, it means that the Dáil should be abolished. That is what it comes to.  If Government Departments are not responsible to the Dáil, then the Dáil has no useful function.  If Government Departments are to be subject, in their policy, to bodies outside the Dáil, then this Parliament is only a figurehead. I am surprised and grieved that Deputy Hewat should make such a suggestion.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy did that, I would not be &ldquo;evading the issue.&rdquo;  I do not like that expression to be used except I am guilty of evading the issue &mdash; which is not outside the bounds of possibility.  I did not evade the issue here.  I met the exact issue which the Deputy put up in his amendment.  Deputy Johnson suggests that there is something in the question of the regional council.  That is one consideration.  I suggest to him that we are liable to confuse this point by reason of the fact that one breed of cattle, called Kerry cattle, are, in fact, confined to Kerry.  They are bred there only, but they are, of course, spread all over Ireland.  The source of supply is Kerry.  When Deputy Johnson suggested <Col N="1101" /> that people of that district should be consulted &mdash; Deputy Heffernan echoed him &mdash; I asked what district, and I was answered Kerry.  Deputy Johnson went on to say Limerick and Tipperary, and Deputy Heffernan referred to Limerick.  Kerry is one case and one case only.  If Shorthorns were confined to certain counties, if dairy Shorthorns were confined to certain counties, if Aberdeen Angus cattle were confined to certain counties, if Herefords, or any other breeds, were confined to certain counties, you might talk of regional councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But remember you would be taking in exactly the same thing as I speak of when I say it should not be regional councils but one council representative of the various breeds, no matter what districts they come from.  If, in fact, the various breeds come from separate, isolated districts, then the council, I suggest, will, in fact, be a regional council.  It will be a regional council in so far as Kerry is concerned.  There is one point I want to make on this question of a consultative council for twenty-six counties.  It is in connection with the suggestion that certain interests would have the controlling power on this council.  That point I will deal with later.  What I want to insist on now is that the council will be regional so far as Kerry is concerned. The men who are on that council representing the Kerry Cattle Society will represent the interests whose cattle are confined to a certain district.  The same applies to Shorthorns.  We could not set up a separate council for, say, Limerick and Tipperary.  Why not include part of Cavan for dairy Shorthorns, and why not include Cork?  Why not include a part of Clare and a part of Laoighis and Offaly?  You could not do it.  You could not by any process I know, define any district and say &ldquo;from that district dairy Shorthorns come, and we will have representatives, not of dairy Shorthorns, but of that particular district.&rdquo; It would be impossible to do that, and if you could do it there would be no point in it, because it is admitted that this is a consultative council, not an administrative council.  I should say that twelve members should be <Col N="1102" /> sufficient for this council.  You do not want twenty-six members representing one organisation alone.  There will be certain people there because they can speak for the dairy Shorthorn; there will be certain people there because they can speak for beef cattle, and certain people representing Kerry cattle. It will be a consultative council.  I do not believe that the particular case that Deputy Johnson quoted is likely to arise, because I think that every man in the trade will realise that it would be impossible to put dairy Shorthorns into Kerry and allow them to serve cows there.  Other points of the same sort will arise.</P>
    <P>Take it that there is only a Kerry interest affected; there may be only two members from Kerry, and representing that particular interest.  They will fight it, and the Minister will be there, probably with the Secretary of the Department also, to listen, and he will have the last word.  In that way there is not the slightest danger that the interests of one particular section that may be in the minority would be overridden by the majority.  That is really the advantage of the Consultative Council.  The Department will have the advantage of hearing every side of the question argued out by people who know their business, and whether the Department accepts the advice or rejects it, in 99 per cent. of the cases it will be extremely useful to the Department, or the Minister, who can accept the advice, to have it argued out on both sides with clashing interests. Deputy Johnson was right when he said that this would not be the last of these councils, and I do not say that this is an ideal way to build up advisory or consultative councils.  The organisation may be wrong, and we may find afterwards that we will have to federate these councils, which may come to be subcommittees of a larger council.  But I do say that it is safer to build up councils in that way, interest by interest, in rather an elastic way than to sit down with a piece of pencil and paper and to try to think out beforehand this whole question, this very complex question, of advisory councils for various agricultural interests.  Let these <Col N="1103" /> councils be appointed and function for a bit.  We will see the advantages and the disadvantages, and see where the weaknesses are.  They will grow up gradually, but probably will be sounder for that reason, probably for the reason that they will not have been all that they should have been in the beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clear up a misconception in the Minister's mind.  The proposed council is to advise the Minister in respect of his proposal to refuse to grant a licence for a bull which he thinks to be of a breed or type unsuitable for the district in which it is proposed to be kept.  Let us take an entirely different illustration from that upon which he has been working.  I recollect an attempt made to introduce the Galloway into Donegal and a rival attempt to introduce the Polled Angus.  The Minister has suggested that this council will be representative of the Aberdeen Angus Society, and if there was a Galloway Society, the interests of the Galloway. They will, no doubt, be very keen upon presenting their case to the Minister, but the people of Donegal, taking this instance, have no particular society, have no particular breed.  They are not thinking of a particular breed.  They are thinking of the interests of the cattle trade in that area.  The particular interests of the particular breeds may prevail over the Minister and impose upon Donegal the Galloway or the Aberdeen Angus, whereas the people of Donegal may say, having had experience of Kerries: &ldquo;No, the kind of cattle that would suit this county is the Kerry; if we are going to have an improvement upon the existing breeds, the Kerry type will suit us better.&rdquo;  But there are no local interests pushing the Kerry; there are particular interests pushing the Aberdeen Angus or the Galloway.  I suggest that there is a need for an assurance to be given that the views of the locality in respect of their cattle-breeding interests will be properly considered and properly heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made on two or three occasions here, and many times <Col N="1104" /> for the last few years outside, that had the dairying interests in Limerick and Tipperary been consulted, they would not have approved of the introduction by the Department of the beef shorthorn in those districts.  I am not questioning the wisdom, or unwisdom, of that view, but I am taking the idea that the local feeling and experience should have an assurance that it would be heard.  It cannot be guaranteed by an All-Ireland council, especially if that council is going to be representative of particular breeds rather than areas.  I think the Minister can readily see that when you are dealing with the question of refusing to license a bull because it is of a kind which is unsuitable for a particular area, that the opinions of the people in that area, and the reasons why it is believed to be suitable, should find expression.  On your proposed council there is no guarantee of that, and the proposition of the amendment is that, in any area of the kind, before a decision is made to refuse to grant a licence because it is unsuitable, the views of the people concerned should be heard.</P>

      <P>The Minister is taking power under this Bill to slaughter a large number of cattle, but before that he slaughters the whole doctrine of the Constitution.  He attacked Deputy Hewat for having suggested that any council outside the Dáil should have any power over the Minister. Well, that is a sound, British constitutional doctrine; it may be, for all we know, a sound German constitutional doctrine, but it is not the doctrine laid down in the Constitution of the Saorstát.  Article 45 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the establishment of Functional or Vocational Councils representing branches of the social and economic life of the nation.  A law establishing any such Council shall determine its powers, rights and duties, and its relation to the Government of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And it goes on, in Article 56, to say that such councils may actually be of so much importance that not merely the Minister is to be responsible for them but that they may even nominate External Ministers.</P>

      <P>The council suggested by the Minister, representing all interests in breeding and so on, is precisely the kind of council that is contemplated by these two Articles of the Constitution.  The only difference is that it should be established by a law, not merely by an amendment to a Bill dealing with another matter; it should have a definite statute to itself, and not merely an amendment, and when the Minister pours scorn on Deputy Hewat for suggesting any such arrangement, I say that what Deputy Hewat suggested is practically what was contemplated, that such councils coming into being might well be given the power contemplated here.  In any event the doctrine laid down by the Minister as to Ministerial infallibility except as regards his responsibility to the Dáil is rather an extensive one.  It may be so in regard to the case of the Minister for Agriculture; it is not so in the case of the Minister for Justice.  If the Minister for Justice arrests me by mistake, I have it in my power to bring an action for false imprisonment, unless he safeguards himself under one of his recent Acts.  If the Minister for Finance assesses me for income tax at too high a rate I have a certain statutory appeal left open to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> The question is whether we should not lay down here some statutory appeal from the decision of the Minister as to whether a certain breed of cattle is suitable or unsuitable.  That seems to me to be the whole question we have to decide; should there be an appeal of any kind and, if so, what form of appeal tribunal should you have?  These are the two questions, and I must say that I have not yet heard from the Minister anything that shakes my opinion that the powers given in this Bill are so drastic that some form of appeal should not be provided.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this matter has been based more or less on hypothetical statements or supposed cases which really do not exist. I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to what is really in operation at the moment.  In every county there is what is known as a Committee of Agriculture, and that particular committee recommends a certain type of bull to be used in that area.  These committees are functioning at present, and as a consequence there is not this danger, which Deputy Johnson fears, of a district being forced to accept an animal which it does not require, because the Committee of Agriculture is there.</P>

I am taking it that they have a little more common sense.  Although they have been electioneering, still, I think the Minister will go down to bedrock, and when he comes to a question of economic facts he will take reasonable action.  I say there is no such danger. We hear exactly what it will be.  You have not said a word about the British Holsteins.  That could be one of the breeds turned down.  Will you permit them to come on the consultative council?  If the Minister will explain who and what interests would be on this consultative council, then we will know where we are.</P>

      <P>Earlier I asked the Minister what the constitution would be, and how many members.  He told me twelve.  Earlier still he told us representatives of the different breeds would be on this Council.  Well, if we have Holsteins, Frisian, Shorthorns, Galloway, Aberdeen-Angus, Dairy Shorthorn, Kerry, and probably a few other breeds, I would like to know where the rank and file of the breeders of the stock of the country come in. I do not view very favourably the introduction of representatives of each breed on this Advisory Committee.  I do not view favourably the representatives of the Beef Shorthorn, the Aberdeen Angus, or the Galloway.  All these have been in the country, and they have more or less proved themselves to the plain people.  If I want a view on the relative merits of a particular breed, I prefer to take it from the users and not from the representatives of a particular breed.  I think if all these breeders are on this council of 12 there will be very little room for the people who matter, the people who pay the piper and who should call the tune.  As a matter of fact I would prefer all the representatives of the breeds should be off, because they are not disinterested.  A man with money invested in any particular breed is not the best judge.  His view point is dwarfed.  He is speaking for a particular <Col N="1108" /> interest, and you cannot blame him.</P>
      <P>If it is only going to be twelve, I say eight at least should be representatives of the people of the country who use the breeds, and there is a good deal in that regional viewpoint.  I take it when the Minister is going to appoint this council, if the regional viewpoint is ever under consideration, as it will be, that the view expressed from that particular region will be the view the Minister will take, not the view of the breeders throughout the country in opposition to the regional view.  It was said that if there was any fault to be found with the Department in the years gone by &mdash; twelve, fifteen, or twenty years ago &mdash; they could trace that fault to the influence of certain breeders in the councils of those days, and the influence of certain breeders in the department.  I am not going into that question.  There is no use kicking that old dog, but I say this consultative committee should be more representative of the people who use the animals than of the breeders. If the number is going to be twelve, then I say that we, the people who represent the breeders of live stock in the country, should have at least eight members.  We do not object to four or five experts; we want eight of the twelve at least.  We would be satisfied with that.</P>

That has brought down upon me the wrath of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I am a Bolshevik.  I am everything else.  I might even be one of the Minister's opponents in the election.  What is my fault?  Wherein have I erred?  I gave our friends the farmers more or less of a tip.  The farmers certainly turned it down, but that is their look out.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture said that I said &ldquo;this council should have powers over the Government.&rdquo;  I said nothing of <Col N="1109" /> the kind.  Let us be clear upon what I did say, or at least upon what I intended to say.  This advisory council proposed to be set up by Act of Parliament is, according to the Minister, to be under his thumb.  He is going to select the <i>personnel.</i></P>

We have had a lot of discussion in the Dáil over this advisory council, and I venture to suggest the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has been forming his Committee as the discussion has gone on.  He had not the haziest idea as to what lines he was going to put the advisory council upon when he came to the Dáil to-day. There is one thing clear.  We know Government Departments, and I can visualise our Minister saying to one of his staff: &ldquo;There is a crux about Galloways in Donegal.  Do not you think it would be advisable that we should call this council together?  Let us think &mdash; a little chat at Christmas, and if there is any disturbance we will put it on to the advisory council.&rdquo;  On the other hand, if he thinks the advisory council is going to interfere in any way with his work in his Department he is not going to call them together of course.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper suggested that my point was sound British law or perhaps sound German law, but that it offended his well-known ultra-Gaelic susceptibilities.  It is in accordance with the Constitution. Any suggestion that an outside external non-representative body should control a Government Department, because that is what it amounts <Col N="1111" /> to, is absolutely at variance with the Constitution.  The suggestion that it should not only forbid, but initiate regulations and control a Government Department is absolutely contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  I think what Deputy Johnson wants is an assurance that certain regions, such as regions like Donegal, Mayo, Kerry, and North Tipperary should be represented. I agree that there are certain districts where special conditions prevail and where tradition and experience have shown that a special type of livestock is suitable.  The only thing I am concerned with is to point out that these districts are not confined to a county. Exactly the same conditions apply to Donegal as to the coast of Kerry and Mayo, and exactly the same conditions apply to the mountainy areas all over Ireland.  Deputy Gorey wished to know whether we were going to have representatives of the Aberdeen Angus, Hereford, Shorthorn, and Galloway, and if so, he suggested that there would be very little room for the ordinary farmer.  Surely the ordinary County Limerick or County Cork farmer would be a first-class representative of the Dairy Shorthorn interest?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It does not follow for a moment because a man is an ordinary farmer that he is not well able to represent and give advice upon questions in connection with, let us say, Dairy Shorthorn herds, which is the main breed of the country.  It does not follow either that we need go to somebody who breeds beef Shorthorns for a representative of the beef Shorthorn, which is also an extreme side of our live stock.</P>
      <P>I do not pretend to have thought out the advisory council exhaustively and fully, and I go further in saying I am not in exactly the vague frame of mind which Deputy Hewat suggests.  I do not want Deputies to jump to the conclusion that when I speak of representatives of various breeds I am going to the well-known breeders pure and simple.</P>

      <P>I do not think I mentioned three or four.  I may have.  I said I would take one from each.  We may find it necessary to get in people who can speak authoritatively on the question. This council is not to be purely representative of societies.  I do not think I gave that impression, but perhaps I did.  It will be representative of regions.  We will nominate some men for the mountainy areas which are very large areas in the country, and they can speak also for the Galloway breed and the Aberdeen Angus and so on.  I am not in a position to say exactly, at the present moment, what the constitution of this council is to be.  I will try to give representation to the breeders pure and simple, and they are entitled to representation.  The breeders are doing invaluable work for live stock and they must get representation.  Ordinary farmers must get representation as well, and there will be representation of farmers in regional districts. We must make all this fit in, but that is different from having representation from each county.  We have that already in the Council of Agriculture, and we will consult it and take its advice where necessary, but we can discuss all this again on that amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has wandered away from the discussion of this amendment and from the general proposition relating to the Advisory Council. I want to nail him down to this particular amendment.  If it were stated in the Bill that the County Committees of Agriculture would be consulted I would accept that, but it is not stated in the Bill and there is no indication whatever that they will be consulted.  The people of <Col N="1113" /> a county are the people who are directly interested in the kind of breeds that are to be encouraged in that county, and it is for that reason I urge that the County Committees, which are representative of each county, should be consulted.  It would be quite an easy thing to do.  There would be no need to have regional areas defined, because it is quite an easy thing to define the bounds of a county.  There is no body that could tell the people of a county the breed of cattle they want better than the people themselves.  The Minister says that the same type of man would represent the mountainy breeds in the different parts of Ireland, such as Donegal, Kerry and Cork.  That argument is not sound in my opinion.  The mountainy breeds in Kerry are breeds in which a Kerry man would be particularly interested, and the same, of course, would apply in Galway in the case of the Galloways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If you put on one representative of the pure-bred stock societies then you will have to put all on.  The suggestion in the amendment is that a special committee should be set up in each county to deal with this, a Committee that could be consulted when required.  I would expect when such a Committee is consulted that attention would be paid to its advice, and that decisions would not be left to the general council, consisting largely of men with axes to grind in regard to particular breeds of cattle.  Each man on that Council will have special regard for his own particular breed.  In that case, you might have the Ministry acting on a minority report.  I would not like to see the Minister acting on such a report, but rather I would like to see him acting on the advice given to him by the consultative council.  I would like to see that advice in most cases unanimous. I would also like to see the Minister take the advice which would be given to him by the local council, which I suggest should be set up.  If the Minister will give an undertaking that at a later stage he will introduce an amendment to the effect that local committees will be consulted, it will meet my desires in regard to this amendment.</P>

    <P>The whole inspiration of the scheme came from that particular report, and, <Col N="1115" /> therefore, I take it that the Minister would be bound by the chapter I have quoted just as he is bound by the general tenour of the whole report.

      <P>This proposal is certainly for local advisory Councils.  The Minister, as is frequently done, was giving an alternative scheme in the hope that this proposal would be withdrawn.  From that we have ranged into a discussion on the difference between local councils and councils for the whole of the country.  It is difficult to prevent a discussion on the general question.  We have been over an hour at it now, but we do not seem to be getting any nearer to a conclusion.  I understand that Section 4 of the Bill, which has just been passed, is going to be divided into two parts and amended. The Minister speaks of a new section dealing with consultative councils.  It may be simpler, when this discussion has gone so far, to postpone further discussion until the next stage to see what the Minister's proposal really is. If necessary, this proposal may be moved again as it stands, or some amendment may be moved to the Minister's proposal which would make it suitable to what Deputy Heffernan desires.</P>

I may say that I do not know what objection Deputies have to hypothetical cases.  This section is intended to cover any case that may arise in the future.  If Deputy Heffernan, for instance, brings a cow along to the owner of a bull and asks the owner for his licence, the owner may say, &ldquo;it is all right, it is in the house,&rdquo; but he does not produce it.  However, the cow proves to have contagious abortion in four or five months.  Deputy Heffernan then finds that every cow from the same bull is suffering from the same malady. He may then hear from somebody that the owner has not got a licence and <Col N="1118" /> that it was refused.  If, after another few months, Deputy Heffernan finds that all his cows have contagious abortion, and then acquaints the Department, and the Department takes proceedings and finds the man has no licence, would the Deputy in that case think that a penalty of £2 rather than £10 would be the proper one?</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1) to delete the word &lsquo;not,&rsquo; line 25.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, if this section is not amended in the manner I suggest, the whole Bill will very likely break down. In dealing with a Bill of this sort we must bear in mind the different customs that exist in various parts of the country.  In the South the season for bulls will be May and June, and if permits are not made transferable there will not be a free sale of bulls.  Under the Bill as it stands, if a bull is sold or transferred, before the buyer can take possession, he must apply to the Minister for permission.  In County Limerick the usual custom is for men to buy bulls early in May, hold them for about five weeks, and then sell them <Col N="1121" /> at auctions.  The small farmer makes a practice of buying early in May, running the bull with his small herd, and then selling him again in late May or June.  He might make a profit, or perhaps there would be a loss of a couple of pounds; if he held the bull over until July he might lose from £10 to £15.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man who breeds bull calves.  An inspection will be held.  That man would have five or six bulls, but under the Bill he would not be allowed to sell them without getting permission from the Minister to have the transfer of the permits belonging to the bulls.  In my opinion the permits should be transferred in such a way that there would be a free exchange of bulls.  Perhaps it would meet the point if there was a special marking on the horns or on the hooves. On the last day when this matter was debated the Minister stated it would be copying the system in vogue in connection with the Horse Breeding Scheme and Cow-testing Associations. If that system is useful in connection with the Horse Breeding Scheme and Cow-testing, it would be useful in this instance.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister agrees to amend this section, we cannot place much reliance on the Bill.  You actually increase the value of the cow by copying the brand and by saying that the animal could produce 2,000 gallons of milk.  On the other hand, a farmer would gain no material advantage from copying the brand of a bull which has been refused a permit.  In the country a bull is bought on his merits whether it has a permit or not. In my opinion it will be impossible to work the Bill unless this section is amended.  You must have a free sale of bulls, and you have not got that under the Bill.  Before the licence is transferred we have to apply to the Department for permission if the period exceeds one month.  As the season for bulls is only May and June, and probably part of July, it would upset the whole custom that we have in the South if this Bill is not amended.  In the South we have practically 90 per cent. of the dairy cows of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right. There is a contingency which needs to be covered in connection with the section. It is a fact that unless the bull is lent, hired or leased it cannot be used on sale.  There is the case of a man who buys a bull and wishes to let it run with his cows immediately.  At the same time, he is not the licensee.  The bull is not licensed in his name, and he has no right to let it run with his cows. I will undertake to put in a provision on the Report Stage providing that it shall be legal for a man buying a bull to allow it to run with his cows for a reasonable period, a period in which he could apply to the Department and get his licence.  That may not go the whole way to meet the Deputy, but it covers one particular point.  We can put in an amendment which will provide for that contingency.  The procedure will be that the bull can be sold.  The licence holder, the seller, has, under Section 9, to acquaint the Department immediately, and arrangements may be made immediately to transfer that licence.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Department must keep trace of bulls.  The Department issues, or refuses to issue, licences. I hope the Deputy is clear on two points.  There is nothing to prevent the bull being sold before the licence is transferred.  He certainly may be sold. There is a catch in the Bill as it stands. The buyer cannot use the bull until he gets his licence.  We propose now to cover that point on the Report Stage by introducing an amendment which will enable the buyer to run the bull with his cows for a certain reasonable period in which he will endeavour to get a licence.  That will cover every case except the case where the Department eventually refuses a licence.  If the Department does, of course, they cannot take proceedings against the man who purchased the bull.  He is covered for that reasonable period, but the effect will be that he cannot use the bull in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the cases in which the Department would refuse a licence? There is only one case.  It is agreed that we will not allow a certain type of bull into a certain district &mdash; the Kerry case again.  It is agreed <Col N="1123" /> that the Department should have power to prevent certain bulls entering certain districts, such as the case of Cahirciveen, County Kerry. Therefore, we must safeguard that point in the Bill.  The case in which a bull is unsuitable for a district, and in which an effort is made to transfer it from one district to another, is the only possible case in which the Department would refuse to give a licence to the transferee.  That case would occur only once in a thousand times.  At the same time we must know that the buyer is licensed and we must know where the bull is.  I will give the undertaking I have referred to, and we will put on the buyer the onus of applying for a licence within a reasonable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <P>Take the case where the bull is licensed at the age of nine or ten months and he goes up for sale at the age of twelve or fourteen months, accompanied by the licence or permit. Would it not be simpler if the purchaser of the bull would get the licence, and let it hold good?  Of course, I agree that it is necessary to trace where the bull is.</P>

      <P>The Minister has met my point in regard to the delay after the purchasing of a bull and <Col N="1124" /> before he could apply to the Department for permission to purchase the bull.  But he has not met my point in regard to the other alternative, the suggestion that would enable the Bill to work smoothly.  I would like to remind the Minister that the less clerical labour he puts on the farmer the smoother the Bill will work.  The less he makes it incumbent on the farmers to be applying to Dublin for permission to licence a bull, the more cooperation he will have from the dairy farmers of the country.  From what I know of the farmers all this red tape will not help the working of the Bill. A simpler method would be to have the bull branded on the horns with a special brand and to have special markings on the bull, and to allow of a free exchange of the bull and the licence to go with him on sale or transfer. It is very hard under the Bill as it at present stands to work it.  I do not believe it will work.  I believe it will break down, because I do not believe the Minister will have the cooperation of the dairy farmers in the working of the Act.  I do not see what objection the Minister could have to the scheme that I am advocating about the branding of the bulls.  This same scheme has been adopted already by the Department in the matter of branding mares.  Under the system, as it stands, you can purchase a mare that has received the premium without applying to the Department for a licence.  That mare is already branded on the hoof and the mark is on the premium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point, which is really psychological.  A farmer goes and sells a bull and another farmer buys him.  In actual practice the farmer has not only to get the price of the bull but he has to arrange with the Department that the licence is to be transferred to the purchaser of the bull, and the purchaser of the bull has to see that he gets a licence.  But is not that difficulty inherent in the Bill unless we allow the bull to be transferred to any district in Ireland? There are some circles that you cannot square.</P>

      <P>Is it not as easy to notify the Department as to notify the police? There must be some case where we must prevent the transfer of a bull from one district to another.  It will be found that these transfers take place automatically.  There will be no immediate hardship because the farmer may run the bull with his herd the moment he gets it.  It will be found then that the transfer will become almost automatic. In fact, this is the very provision that is in the Northern Bill, and it is not causing the slightest trouble.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will suggest some means of getting over the two difficulties which I put to him, and which I have been trying to solve, I will be glad to hear them, because I <Col N="1126" /> really believe there is a certain objection to this.  Has the Deputy put forward anything to get over these difficulties:&mdash; (1)  There are certain bulls that cannot be freely transferred from one district to another.  For instance, a Jersey bull cannot be transferred to the County Limerick.  And (2) the Department of Agriculture should be notified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, when issuing the first licence for the bull, the Department should say: &ldquo;This bull shall not be used for service in Kerry,&rdquo; and then it can be transferred anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that would not suit.  There are parts of Kerry that would correspond with West Limerick. It is only certain districts in Kerry into which you could not transfer a Shorthorn bull.  It would meet the Minister's point if the bull were used only for the owner's cows.  Of course, in some cases two or three farmers may join in the purchase of one bull which could be used only by the owners who were joined in the purchase.  The bull would not be served out to other cows in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not seem to realise my meaning when I said there was no County Limerick in the North.  I think the only district in the country where the practice that Deputy Hogan's amendment would be affected by, is the County Limerick and that district.  But I think the practical suggestion for the consideration of the Minister might be that the certificate or permit issued with the bull in the first instance would be transferred to the new owner as the bull is transferred, and a condition imposed that in going into any new district it should be reported to the representative of the County Committee of Agriculture. Here is where the local administration comes in &mdash; practically to follow the policy that the Prisons Board and others of the kind carry through; that is a ticket-of-leave system.  As the bull goes from one administrative area to another, the certificate should follow and be registered, and impose upon the local official the responsibility of communicating with the Department. <Col N="1127" /> I think that is a proposal worthy of consideration, and it would solve some of the difficulties the Deputy has raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.K. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment would do away with &ldquo;red tapeism.&rdquo; A County Limerick farmer rears six bull calves.  The Inspector comes down and the farmer gets premiums for these bull calves.  Under the Bill, the owner is liable to a penalty if he does not notify the Department that he has sold these calves, and, then, again, the buyers of the calves are liable to a penalty too.  Because if the buyers do not apply to the Department for permission to purchase, they will not be licensed.  Therefore, you have twelve letters going to the Department over the sale of these six calves.  I would certainly do away with that in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a magnificent example of the Department's &ldquo;red tapeism.&rdquo;  Here is a bull duly registered, and it, surely, requires that a licence be issued.  And we are told that this is &ldquo;red tapeism.&rdquo; If the owner of the bull is John Murphy, and it is sold to John Doyle, how is this Bill to be administered in such a way that you have a schedule there of the bulls that are licensed, should the bull happen to change hands two or three times?  The bull was John Murphy's and it is now Deputy Gorey's, and this is &ldquo;red tapeism.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is red-tapeism to ask a farmer to sit down, put his licence in an envelope, and send it to the Department, with the name of the man to whom he sold the bull.  That sort of red-tapeism is absolutely necessary if the Bill is to be administered. The only difference Deputy Johnson's point makes is that he would acquaint the local official.  It means a letter in any case, and it is just as easy to acquaint the other.  It should go direct to the live stock inspector and not to the agricultural instructor.  Let us consider this matter on the Report Stage. Will the Deputy consider and tell me on the Report Stage that the Department should not be acquainted if the bull is transferred?  If he does not go <Col N="1128" /> that far, will he tell me if it is too much to ask the owner who is transferring the bull simply to send a licence to the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed to introduce a section which would enable the purchaser to run a bull with his cows until the bull is licensed.  As the Bill stands, the idea is, that after selling the bull the seller simply sends his licence to the Department.  The amendment can be so drafted that we can put the onus on one of them, if Deputies like.  Supposing we put in a section which safeguarded the purchaser anyhow, without putting any other duty on him, gave him the right to run a bull with his cows, leaving the onus on the seller to send up the licence with the name of the person to whom the bull was transferred, in 999 cases out of a thousand the Department would simply change the name.  It would be only in the odd case I mentioned, that a Hereford bull, say, would go to a district where it is absolutely unsuited, that they would refuse.  I can go so far as to say that the transfer would be automatic in every other case.  In that one case out of a thousand it would mean that the Department would have to send down an inspector and withdraw the licence for that particular bull in that district.  It would be rather unfair to the purchaser.  If the Deputy thinks it is any good I will do that.  I considered this for a long time, and I can see no way out.  It is exactly the same in the Northern Bill.  Deputy Johnson suggested that there was no County Limerick in the North.  There is exactly the same trouble there.  There is, if you like, the Jersey, Guernsey or Dexter bull going to the County Limerick.</P>

We, too, are interested in having it effective, but we think the method outlined in the Bill is too complicated and is more than the average farmer is likely to comply with.  We accept the Minister's suggestion to think over the matter between this and the Report Stage, so as to try and have it amended.  We are satisfied to do that, even to the extent of consulting with the Minister. Perhaps the local police might be utilised in the matter.  The number of <Col N="1130" /> bulls is very large, and after the first licences are issued, if the matter is to be dealt with in Dublin, it will need a tremendous staff and a lot of trouble to many people.  If there is a transfer of a bull for a period, and the seller and buyer have to comply with certain regulations, there will be a lot of correspondence necessary.  It will be very expensive.  If a simpler method, that will be equally effective, can be devised we are quite satisfied, and I am sure the Department will be satisfied. When we think over the matter, perhaps we will be able to put up some proposal to the Minister before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Before I withdraw this amendment, I would like to see what I am going to get in its place. In the County Limerick we will be very hard hit.  We will be hit more than any other county, because the County Limerick supplies a large number of half-bred Shorthorn bulls to other counties. During the months of May and June 40 or 50 auctions of bulls are held, and farmers in the counties of Cork, Kerry and Clare attend them.  The County Limerick really is the breeding ground for Shorthorn bulls.  There is such a sale for bulls that this Bill will very seriously affect free sales, and as a result interfere with the breeding of bulls.  Farmers will not be able to comply with all the regulations, and if they neglect to comply there is a very heavy penalty.  The result will be that they will not take the risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking the Minister was out of order in moving the Second Reading of the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill.  That is not the title of this Bill at all.  If it were I should not be opposing it.  This is not only a Bill to continue certain laws which would expire in the course of the next few months; it is a Bill to make permanent five Bills which were hitherto temporary.  That is a principle we should be very slow to admit. How many Deputies have read these five Bills that we are asked to make permanent?  One passed in the last Dáil, The District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, is, no doubt, familiar to Deputies.  The others we have not heard a word about from the Minister.  I wonder if he read them all himself?  Can he explain to us what the Promissory Notes (Ireland) Act of 1864 is?  If he cannot tell me I shall be pleased to tell him.  It enacts that Notaries Public need not keep their offices open until 9 o'clock, but may close them at 6 o'clock.  I fear that is a law more honoured in the breach than in the observance, as most of them are closed about 5 o'clock.  Then we have the Locomotives Act of 1865. That is now to be put on the Statute Book for good.  Does the Minister know anything about it?  Does any <Col N="1132" /> Deputy on the Government Benches know anything about it?  It is not one that I take much exception to.  It covers many things, but it does not cover locomotives on a railway.  It covers the use of traction engines and vehicles of that kind on the public road, and has some very useful and necessary provisions, such as forbidding a driver to let off the whistle or steam if there is a horse in sight.  I think if we are going to make legislation of that kind permanent we should have it before us.  It should not be smuggled through in a Bill of this kind.  If the Minister should bring in a Bill, I should have no objection, in the case of the Bills I have mentioned, to make them permanent, but, I would like them made permanent as definite Government Bills and not as part of a Bill which, most people, looking at, would think was merely continuing these enactments for another year.</P>
      <P>The other two enactments proposed to be made permanent are of a very much more serious and important nature.  One is the Motor Car Act of 1903.  That is an Act which governs the use of motor cars.  I need hardly argue to the Dáil that an Act passed in 1903 dealing with motor cars is by now somewhat obsolete.  The whole trade has been developed, and the whole business has become far more intricate and more widespread.  In 1903 only comparatively rich men used motor cars.  Nowadays every village in the Free State has probably a Ford car, which some young fellow keeps for hire, as a means of making a living.  It is not only the rich who use motor cars now; they are used to a considerable extent by those of moderate means, even if they only hire them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic principle of the Act of 1903 is challenged, and has been repeatedly challenged.  The basic principle is that anyone may take out a licence to drive a motor car without qualifying by examination, or by any physical test of any kind whatever.  A blind man may take out a licence to drive a motor car.  A lunatic may take out a licence to drive a motor car.  The hypothetical person whom the Minister for Justice invented on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, the gentleman who <Col N="1133" /> joined at least three clubs so that he could get drink at any hour of the twenty-four, could take out a licence to drive a motor car.  The Act of 1903 is also concerned with speed limits, and it might reasonably be argued that some of the speeds applicable to 1903 are not applicable now.  Yet we are asked, without discussion, or without the possibility of amendment, to place this Act, amended slightly as it was by a later Act of 1920 &mdash; the Roads Act &mdash; on the Statute Book without having an opportunity of amending it, or of a proper discussion.  I suggest that we should be very unwise to do so.</P>
    <P>It is the same with the other Act, the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904. How much was known of wireless telegraphy in 1904 compared with what is known to-day?  The whole development of wireless broadcasting has come up since 1904.  I do not know if the Minister will tell me that this Act was modified in 1907.  It was.  I looked up the amending Act, and the only purpose of it is to continue the Act of 1904.  Since then it has been continued in the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill, which in other Parliaments is an Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill, and not a machine to put, permanently, measures on the Statute Book.  I propose, on the Committee Stage, to move the transfer of these two Bills from the First Schedule to the Second Schedule. I am not opposed to continuing them for a year.  The Government have had a great deal to do, and might not have had time to draft permanent legislation on this matter, but I say that the Dáil would be very ill advised to let these measures pass out of its control.</P>
    <P>When they come up again in a year's time, if we think the time ripe, we shall have an opportunity of pressing for permanent legislation on either of these subjects.  They are both of considerable importance to the community as a whole.  One governs the use of motor cars, and the other gives the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs all the powers that he is exercising in regard to wireless broadcasting.  He collects moneys for licences under the powers given under this Act, which we are now asked to place on the Statute Book without discussion.  I, therefore, most strongly <Col N="1134" /> deprecate the action of the Government in trying to get this Bill through in this manner, and I ask the Dáil not to agree to surrender its function of criticism and control by allowing such legislation to be made permanent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the attitude adopted by Deputy Cooper, and I would urge upon the Minister the desirability of amending this Bill, or telling us before he takes the Second Reading that he will amend it so as to make all these enactments continue only for the succeeding year.  I think the principle is a bad one, that we should be asked to make permanent, Bills, which we have accepted as yearly enactments, without having had a full opportunity of examining and discussing them.  Since this Bill was introduced we had ten days, and during that time we were told we must not consider the business of the Dáil.  We may have to go into the merits of all these Bills that are now to be made permanent.  That might raise quite a lot of controversy. We may have to move amendments to suggest that in so far as certain things contained in those Acts are concerned, they should not be made permanent. We should have to alter the schedules considerably.  That may be so if we find, on examining the Acts, that there are objectionable provisions.  The method of perpetuating Acts of this kind is, I agree with Deputy Cooper, not commendable, to say the least.  The reference in the Bill itself would, I think, show that there will be simply a perpetuation of the method of legislation by reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will find in future legislation certain references to part of the Act as contained in Part 2 of the Schedule which has been repealed and part of which has been made permanent and so on.  That does not seem to me to be satisfactory.  We are asked to make permanent Section 9 and Schedule 3 of the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  I do not know what Section 9 refers to, but this method of making permanent an Act is certainly unsatisfactory.  I would urge the Minister to agree to place all those Acts in the single schedule of enactments which are to be continued, and <Col N="1135" /> to give us an opportunity during the next year either by Private Member's Bill or by Government measure to introduce those Bills as new Bills so that we may discuss or amend them according to present conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper, I think, is by way of being a purist in parliamentary procedure.  I am sorry I cannot agree with him that there is anything wrong in making permanent Acts of this nature, some of which have been enforced since 1864, 1865 and so on.  The real thing requiring defence is the continuing of legislation like that from year to year.  It is, in effect, permanent.  It would not be possible for the Dáil to refuse to continue those Acts and thus leave the country without suitable legislation for any length of time.  It leaves the Dáil no lever for pressing for fresh legislation. If I had doubts about this Bill they would rather be whether we should continue Acts for another year rather than make them permanent.  I do not know how the practice arose.  It arose in the British Parliament.  It seems to me absurd to have Acts for a long period renewed from year to year and never made permanent.  There are some provisions of these Acts which I will certainly stand for making permanent, such as that in Part 2 of the First Schedule.  That is an indemnity clause in a Temporary Act.  The district justices were appointed in a way which was, perhaps, somewhat irregular.  They functioned as district justices.  We indemnified them.  That indemnity must be permanent.  It would not do to let it fall and let people take proceedings against the justices because the indemnity fell with the Temporary Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But when we are continuing for a year only so many Bills, I would not press, except in that particular case, <Col N="1136" /> for continuing in the first part of the Schedule any Act that there was a strong feeling should not be continued. I would not make it a mere matter of a majority in the Chamber. If there was a strong feeling in regard to any particular Act, I would not try to push it through.  On the other hand, I do not think there is anything wrong in this practice and I would not undertake to proceed to remove all the Acts in, say, the first part of the First Schedule, into the Second Schedule, except some case were made and some feeling shown in regard to these Acts. I do not want to deal with the individual Acts here, because it is really a matter for the Committee Stage.  I am prepared to give a short explanation of each of them, and if any section of the House really feels that a particular Act should not be made permanent, I would not force it through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister promise to submit a schedule showing the nature of these particular Acts, so that we may deal with them in our private moments, away from the Library of the Dáil?</P>

      <P>If we are asked to make permanent a particular Act, we should have the text before us.  At present we can only have the text by taking the Act down in the Library. That is not possible for every Deputy. When we are passing legislation of any kind, we are supposed to have the text of the law before us.  Will the Minister, before the Committee Stage, promise to let us have the text of these various Acts, which are to be practically new Acts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister said it was absurd to keep on passing, from year to year, Acts that were very old.  I think it is equally absurd to attempt to make permanent Acts that <Col N="1137" /> were passed in the very infancy of the matter to which they refer.  Acts that were eminently suitable at the birth of the matters to which they refer, become equally ludicrous years after that stage has been passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooper in most of what he says.  I would ask the Minister to recognise that we are comparative novices in Parliamentary matters here, and a little more information as to what we are asked to do on these Bills would be very valuable.  I think the Minister for Justice, in his Department, has recognised that, because, generally, in his Bills, he has explanatory notes which are very valuable, as a ready means of ascertaining what the contents of the Bills are.  It does seem to me that to make permanent the Motor Car Act and the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1904 is inopportune.  It may be that there is nothing in the Bill that we would object to making permanent. But there, again, is the difficulty. Some component parts of the House have not got the elaborate political <Col N="1138" /> machinery necessary to analyse all these Bills as they come to hand, and if the Minister would recognise that and give us any assistance he could in forming a judgment on these matters, it would be very helpful. There is a whole string of Acts here to be made permanent and it would be a biggish job to examine in detail all these Acts.  For an individual member, or even for a member of a small Party of two, it would be a difficult task.</P>

    <Title>DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL, 1924.&mdash;COMMITTEE (RESUMED).</Title>
    <P>SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>(1)  A board of health may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as they think fit for purposes connected with the exercise or performance of any of the powers, duties and functions transferred to the board by or under this Act which in the opinion of the <Col N="1139" /> board would be better or more conveniently regulated or managed by or through a committee.</P>
    <P>(2)  A committee appointed under this section may be either a general committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties, and functions in relation to the whole of the county health district or a local committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties, and functions in relation to a limited portion only of the county health district.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every committee appointed under this section shall consist of not less than three members, and may be composed either wholly of members of the board of health or partly of such members and partly of other persons.</P>
    <P>(4)  The acts of every committee appointed under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the board of health, save that the board may with the sanction of the Minister empower any particular committee to do any act (including the institution of legal proceedings) within the authority conferred on the committee by the board which the board itself could lawfully do.</P>
    <P>(5)  The quorum, procedure, and place of meeting of any committee appointed under this section, and the area (if any) within which any such committee is to exercise its functions, shall be such as may be appointed by regulations to be made by the board of health with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>(6)  Save as is authorised by this section, it shall not be lawful for a board of health to delegate any of its powers or duties to a committee.</P>
    <P>(7)  The provisions of this section shall apply to every board of health and public assistance in the performance of their duties under a county scheme in the same manner as they apply to such board in the performance of their duties under this Act notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such county scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> (1)  A board of health shall at its first meeting after it has been elected and at each annual meeting thereafter appoint a committee, to be known as a Public Assistance Local Committee, for each area for which a rural district council was in existence on the appointed day and for each urban district within the area of the board of health or for each of such other areas as the board may think expedient.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every committee appointed under this section shall consist of not less than three members, and may be composed either wholly of members of the board of health or partly of such members and partly of other persons.</P>
    <P>(3)  The duty of every committee appointed under this section shall be to advise and assist the board of health in the relief of the poor in the area for which it is appointed.  Save as may be otherwise determined by the board of health, the acts of every committee shall be subject to confirmation by the board of health.</P>
    <P>(4)  The procedure, quorum and place of meeting of every committee appointed under this section shall be prescribed by the board of health.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is optional: this is mandatory. It compels the board of health to appoint local committees for public assistance (Home Help and Poor Relief generally).  The areas of the committee will be urban districts and rural districts or such other areas as the board of health finds more convenient. The inconvenience and delay, resulting in avoidable hardship, due to regulating home help from one centre for a whole county, are obvious, and therefore it should be made obligatory on the board of health to appoint as many committees as may be necessary to look after the interests of the poor.  The exact powers of the local committee are left to be determined by the board itself, which may give them a limited direct authority, or make them merely advisory.  The provision in Section 12, bringing in the Minister in defining the authority of Committees, is omitted from this new section, but the Minister will probably want to bring it in.  I think that <Col N="1141" /> the Minister will see the necessity for making it mandatory on the board of health to appoint committees in their various areas.  Otherwise we will have great hardship amongst the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. To begin with, in the very beginning of the amendment the Deputy uses the expression &ldquo;Board of Health.&rdquo;&ldquo;Board of Health&rdquo; is an inclusive term; it includes the Board of Public Assistance and the Board of Health.  The Board of Health and Public Assistance does provide for home help or for outdoor relief, but the Board of Public Health does not, and accordingly it would have to be amended in that respect, even if I could accept it otherwise.  The amendment also provides for making use of the original rural district area as an administrative area.  One of my great objections to leaving in the District Councils is that as administrative areas they are impossible.  In practice at present the Rural District Council is either too large or too small, and it is impossible to devise any code of rules or regulations that will apply equally and give equally good results to both.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only just drawing attention to that point about the rural district councils.  I am opposed to stereotyping the kind of committee we are going to appoint under this Bill; I want to leave it as elastic as possible.  At the outset it is very hard for us to say what way those committees would work out, and it would be very foolish to lay down any hard and fast lines.  But the main objection to accepting the amendment is that it is really, in the spirit if not in the letter, outside the scope of this Bill.  This Bill is not intended to deal with Home Assistance at all.  It should really come under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, which will have to be made permanent in <Col N="1142" /> another form, perhaps, later on.  I am setting up a Commission to deal with this whole question of Home Assistance and Poor Law in general.  I have the Terms of Reference, and I expect to have it set up in a few days.  It would be stultifying that committee to anticipate its findings by setting up any committee of this kind.  It is essential to leave provisions for Home Help to be dealt with by an Act that will take within its purview Home Assistance and Poor Law in general.  Therefore I cannot agree with this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>To say the least of it, it is rather amusing to hear the Minister talking about leaving this measure as elastic as possible; some of us think that it could not be more rigid than it is.  I want to support the amendment because I think it is absolutely necessary in the administration of Home Help that you should have committees that will know the local circumstances and that will know how the people who apply for Home Help are situated.  It is very necessary for this reason: numbers of people apply for Home Help; some of them who want it badly, some of them, I am prepared to admit, apply for it, but perhaps do not need it, and very often the people who could get on without it get it from the County Board of Health, and those who require it badly do not get it.  The only way, to my mind, that you can decide this matter is by having some committee such as Deputy Colohan suggests, which will be conversant with the position of the people who claim Home Help.  The Minister made a suggestion that I could not understand; he suggested that this amendment was not relevant to the Bill at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that the Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with Home Assistance.  I am more than surprised to hear that.  The Minister then told us that it is his intention to set up a Commission on Poor Law.  It is a pity that the Minister did not think of doing that before he brought in the Bill.  I suppose as a result of this <Col N="1143" /> Commission we will have a Bill somewhat similar to this in a few months' time.  I certainly say, from what little experience I had of local bodies, that if you want to have Home Help properly administered and if you want to prevent abuses in its distribution, it is absolutely essential to have local committees.  I think the Minister, or his officials, should know that as well as anybody else, and there should really be no necessity to stress this point.  I submit that the amendment is quite relevant to the Bill and that Deputy Colohan was perfectly in order in putting it down, and I therefore support him.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of this section shall apply to every board of health and public assistance in the performance of their duties under a county scheme in the same manner as they apply to such board in the performance of their duties under this Act notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such county scheme.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It applies to every Board of Health and Public Assistance, but not to every Board of Public Health. There are two in the present Bill. Provision can be made under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act for a committee such as the Deputy suggests, if it was advisable to do that. It could not be made under the present Bill.  Poor Law is not being dealt with under this Bill at all, it is dealt with under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, but, as I say, we have found that that Act in all respects has not given the utmost satisfaction. We are setting up a Commission to inquire into the working of that Act, and on the report of the Commission we are going to introduce a further Bill.  The following are the terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the object of devising permanent <Col N="1144" /> legislation for the effective and economical relief of the sick and destitute poor.  To inquire into the laws and administration relating thereto, and particularly as regards the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  To inquire into the adequacy and suitability of schemes which have been formulated under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act and make recommendations.</P>
    <P>(2)  To advise as to whether the existing Law and Regulations as regards home assistance require alteration towards securing that due provision is made for the sick and destitute poor in their own homes without avoidable wasteful expenditure on healthy persons who are incorrigibly idle.</P>
    <P>3.  To examine the law and administration affecting the relief of the following destitute classes and to make recommendations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Widows and their children.</P>
    <P>(b)  Children without parents.</P>
    <P>(c)  Unmarried mothers and their children.</P>
    <P>(d)  Deserted children.</P>
    <P>4.  To inquire into the existing provision in public institutions for the care and treatment of mentally defective persons and to advise as to whether more efficient methods can be introduced, especially as regards the care and training of mentally defective children, due regard being had to the expense involved.</P>
    <P>5.  As regards cost of relief of the destitute poor generally to inquire as to whether any change in law is desirable towards securing more equitable chargeability on local rates for persons who, having been in fact normally resident in one poor-relief district, have become a charge upon the rates of another district.</P>
    <P>In these terms of reference the question that is exercising Deputy Colohan's mind will be dealt with.  It would not fit into the present Bill at all.  It would be absolutely out of place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the amendment, I am really at a loss to understand the attitude taken up by the Minister in this connection, because boards of public health are mentioned all through the Bill and public assistance is mentioned all through the Bill &mdash; in Sections 9 and 7 and various other sections.  In view of the fact that the constitution of a public health board is being altered and that the number of people who will form it in the future will be entirely different, I think we should be entitled to discuss this question of local committees at this stage, and I certainly do not agree with the Minister that it is out of order.  It is all very well to talk about Commissions, but my experience of Commissions set up by this House is that the Government have always been against the findings of the Commission and it has taken a considerable time to get any <Col N="1146" /> legislation passed in accordance with the deliberations of any Commission set up.  I think the Minister will find that it is absolutely essential, if he gives this matter the consideration it deserves, that local committees should be formed in order to go thoroughly into the question of home help or outdoor relief, as it was formerly known.  The poor are not getting the attention they should get.  Everybody in the Dáil is conversant with the situation that prevails throughout the country to-day. We have abnormal unemployment.  We have people who think they are humiliated by having at all to apply for what is called outdoor relief.  The constitution of the county board of health in the different counties at present is not really representative of the different areas, and in consequence of that large numbers of people are being unconsciously neglected.  Boards of health have been appointed by the county councils, and the strongest party on the councils saw to it that nominees of their party got the largest representation. It is not by area that the representation is gained on the county board at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister would do well, even it were only as a temporary arrangement, to agree that a committee such as Deputy Colohan suggests, should be set up in the different areas. The proposal in the Bill is that a county council, immediately after its election and at its first meeting, shall proceed to appoint a committee or a public health board, consisting of seven or nine members, but there is no provision made for any particular area to get representation on that committee. The Minister may say it is not necessary. I think he will agree with me that a county committee in any county will be composed of a majority of rural representatives.  That may be right or it may be wrong, but where you have large towns in a county with a population of 11,000 or 12,000, I think these towns ought to have direct representation on the committee, because the rural representatives will not be in touch with the conditions prevailing in an urban centre.  They will be very little interested in the conditions that obtain in one of these towns, because they will <Col N="1147" /> have enough to do to look after the interests of their own area in a scattered rural district.  I urge the importance of giving direct representation on these committees to urban centres.  In many of these urban centres you have a great deal of congestion.  You have hundreds of people unemployed and on the verge of starvation.  Therefore I say it is necessary that these towns should have direct representation on the committees.  In my opinion committees should be specially set up to deal with these cases in the towns.  At present they are not being attended to. The Board of Health only meets once a month, and it is pitiable to see these people, Saturday after Saturday, outside the doors of the places where the relieving officer gives out the relief. If the Minister were in touch with the different areas in the country he would know that it is absolutely necessary that something on the lines suggested by Deputy Colohan should be set up in order to relieve the present situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that when the Minister rises to speak on this matter, he will endeavour, by some means or another, to pick holes in the arguments put forward by Deputy Corish, particularly in regard to the Deputy's arguments in favour of direct representation for urban areas.  As I understand it, towns which have an urban authority to control their affairs are represented on the Board of Health, but there are other towns which are not, so to speak, urbanised, but which are almost as thickly populated as the others, and these have no representation on the Board of Health.  In my opinion, a committee to administer home assistance is very necessary at the moment.  I have a good deal of experience of this, and if the Minister himself has not experience of it, many of the higher officials in his Department have.  I have been acting on a committee that came into being since the amalgamation scheme was put into operation in the county I live in.  Since I was elected on that committee I have found that we could not get the people who are supposed to be the elected representatives of the people to function <Col N="1148" /> on behalf of the poor.  We could not get them to turn up to do their duty in accordance with the mandate that was given to them when they took their seats on a public board, either as guardians or district councillors.  Some of the higher officials in the Minister's Department are, I am sure, familiar with one instance that happened down in the County Meath.  A meeting of the Home Assistance Committee was called on seven different occasions, but on each occasion a quorum failed to turn up.  A quorum consists of five members out of a total of thirty-four. On the seventh occasion only three members attended, and these three decided to go ahead with the business and to ask the Department to sanction the decisions they arrived at.  The Department of Local Government must be familiar with that instance, because of the fact that they sanctioned what the committee of three had done. I happened to be the chairman of the committee myself.</P>
      <P>There is no use in trying to blind people by saying that the committee proposed in the amendment of Deputy Colohan is not necessary.  I say that such a committee is necessary, because of the fact that the people who constitute the Boards of Health at the present day are not people who, in the lowest possible sense, care twopence for the interests of the unfortunate destitute poor who, unhappily for themselves, have to depend on the administration of these men.  If the Minister refuses to accept this amendment then he will be indicting himself in the same manner as the public representatives to whom I have referred. There are thirty-one members of the County Meath Home Help Committee who refuse to come in and do their duty to the destitute poor, men who never come in there except when a job is to be given away.  I repeat that a committee such as Deputy Colohan suggests is very necessary at the present time, and I see no reason why the Minister should refuse to accept the amendment that has been proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a bit of a fix about this amendment.  The Minister says it does not apply to the Bill.  If such is the case, then I think <Col N="1149" /> it should have been ruled out of order and not discussed at all.  As, however, the amendment has been discussed, I desire to say that I support, to a certain extent, but not altogether, the general idea contained in the amendment. That idea is that committees should be set up to deal with local matters.  That is an idea that would apply, not only to home help, but to other matters under the Local Government Bill, such as local roads, cottages and things of that kind.  I maintain that if local work is to be adequately looked after, you must have local representatives on committees such as have been suggested. There is the danger that, with a comparatively small board of health, you may have large districts in a county which will not be represented at all.  It will be obvious to anyone who knows the conditions in a county that, in dealing with a matter of home help, the most important thing is a knowledge of the local conditions.  As things are at present, this matter of home help is left almost entirely in the hands of a paid official.  You have a Superintendent of Home Help whose district covers a large section of a county, in some cases, I believe, a whole county.  The allocation of home help lies almost altogether in his hands, and in some cases it might lie altogether in his hands in certain districts.  I think that such should not be the case, because we have not sufficient confidence in these officials, and particularly in the type of officials who have been appointed to these positions down the country.</P>
      <P>I look at the matter not altogether from the point of view of Deputy Corish.  I recognise that, naturally, people who require help treatment should get it.  But another aspect is to see that the ratepayers' money is not wasted in giving help treatment to people who are not deserving of it.</P>

He does not want people's money wasted, but I do not think that anyone would suggest that I want to waste <Col N="1150" /> people's money.  I am as careful of the ratepayers' money as Deputy Heffernan is &mdash; every bit.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that at all.  Deputy Corish's intention was to look after the welfare of the poor.  I am interested in the welfare of the poor, but I am interested in the other matter as well.  I do not think that the proper hands in which to leave these things are the hands of officials. I think the Minister should consider some system of appointing local committees composed of local people, some perhaps belonging to the county board of health, and others not belonging to it.  I believe if you want home help, and such matters adequately attended to, there is only one way of getting it done, and that is by having local committees appointed.  Whether they be members of county councils, members of county boards of health, or outsiders, is a question which I think the Minister will agree should have his careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I cannot vote for this amendment of Deputy Colohan because I see no necessity for it.  It seems to me that it merely attempts to continue the rural district council representation. I fear, although I am almost afraid to say it, that Deputy Heffernan has not read the Bill because everything that he suggests should be done is, in my opinion, arranged for here under Section 12. Even Deputy Corish's objections are all met with as regards what he wants in regard to local committees.  We have a board of health empowered to appoint certain committees.  These committees may range over the entire county area, or they may be appointed for other smaller local areas.</P>

      <P>Yes, &ldquo;a committee appointed under this section may be either a general committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties and functions in relation to the whole of the county health district, or a local committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties and functions in relation to a limited portion only of the county health district.&rdquo;<Col N="1151" /> That is to say, if there is a town in the county health district there is no reason why a committee should not be appointed by the board of health.  And that is not a thing which is left in the hands of the Minister.  It is left in the hands of the board of health to appoint these committees.  Surely these committees will have in their mind the appointment of the best type of people who will assist them at the committee work in connection with the smaller local areas.  For that reason I say every provision is made.  The number of the committee has been settled.  Not less than three members shall be appointed to deal with local matters in small areas, or there may be a large committee to deal with public matters. Therefore I see no necessity, as far as areas are concerned, to interfere with the provisions made under Clause 12.</P>

      <P>Under the Local (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, these local Committees were appointed, and from what I know of them, far from restricting expenditure in giving help, the complaint was that home help had jumped up to the tune of 300 or 400 per cent above what it ought to be, or what it was a few years ago.  And then when I hear Deputies in this House saying that the poor are neglected and that people are dying of hunger I cannot very well understand how the expenditure has so greatly increased, and all this destitution that we hear of exists.</P>

      <P>They could do that under the county scheme, and in Deputy Colohan's own county home help was administered through the Rural Councils, and that is why the amalgamation scheme in Deputy Colohan's own county was the only one where a saving was not effected.  The average reduction in every other county, with the exception of Kildare, was about 20 <Col N="1152" /> per cent.  There was no reduction in his county, and we had to take it away from the Rural District Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Wilson caught the Chairman's eye before I did, and that he was able to explain to Deputy Sir James Craig the real meaning of the opposition to this proposal.  Deputy Sir James Craig referred to Section 12 and pointed out that the board of health may appoint committees from time to time; that they may cover certain areas or be given certain powers.  What has happened in the case of the county councils?  Deputy Wilson has pointed out they may be animated by anything but a desire to fulfil the intention of any legislation of this kind &mdash; that is to relieve poverty.  The county council may have the authority; it is to be centralised <Col N="1153" /> and remains centralised.  They may refuse to appoint such committees and they may appoint those officers whose instructions will be to save the rates and let people go into another county or die.  They may do these things.  I want the Legislature to say that they shall do something and that the implication when you set up local public assistance committees is that the assistance will be given to the poor.  The proposition in this Bill is that there shall be set up a board of health and public assistance.  That is the title that the Minister wants to give to this Committee, but he says you should not consider the functioning of public assistance committees until the new Commission has considered the whole question and has decided to make recommendations regarding changes in the present law.  If we set up a board of health and public assistance, and if in the minds of the Minister these two thoughts are connected, I presume he has the idea that the main bulk of public assistance is related very closely to the protection of public health and the prevention of disease.  Sir James Craig, at any rate, will agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You ask us to agree to the setting up of these boards of health and public assistance and then say that the board of health must have nothing to do with public assistance until a new Commission has recommended a new system of poor law administration.  I daresay that the Ministry have heard of the Viceregal Commission on Poor Law, and I think that poor law questions have been considered by Commissions time after time.  The schemes of amalgamation set up by the home help committees are all supposed to be emanations from the Viceregal and other Commissions, and why should it be necessary at this stage to set up a new commission into the poor law after all those inquiries, having all their reports in pigeon-holes and pretty well assimilated by the people, and to say that nothing shall be done to alter the present situation until this new Commission has reported and new legislation has been passed.  What is the new proposal?  It is that we are going to set up under the Bill a new board of <Col N="1154" /> health and public assistance committees, but we are not going to make any change in respect of the administration of home help.</P>
    <P>The amendment wants to make it obligatory that there shall be local committees advising the board of health, and the board of health officers, in respect of the administration of home help.  The function of an officer of the central authority will be, unfortunately, in many cases to save the rates, and the thing that will be impressed upon him more than anything else will be that he must act, and that there must be no local committees unless the board of health may decide that such shall be set up.  This board of health is going to be set up by the county council, partly from members of the county council and partly from outsiders.  It may be representative of districts or it may not.  There is no assurance on that yet.  If it is not, the whole authority will reside in the hands of what we will call the local relieving officer, and he is going to be free to act without any consultation with or assistance from any local persons of any kind.  That is not going to aid the fulfilment of the purpose of home health schemes.  It is going simply to bureaucratise the administration.  It is going to put the whole power into the hands of the official, and the inspiration that will move that official will be, &ldquo;save the rates.&rdquo;  The idea in this amendment should commend itself to any Deputies who have any thought of humanising what was known as the poor law.  I dare say it is fairly familiar in the minds of Deputies that we have had urgings from one philanthropist and another of the desirability of associating responsibility for the care of the poor with people of the locality.  We have had ideas of the <i>Elberfeldt</i> system, and other systems of that kind.  This proposal in the amendment is directly in keeping with that, and resistance to it is going far away from that.  It is going to centralise and hand over to the relieving officer all authority in the district in respect of the administration of home help, and going to divorce from that <Col N="1155" /> human function the people of the locality who know the facts in regard to the poor.  I say that the proposal in the Bill, unless it embodies some mandatory provision setting up local committees, is a reactionary one, is a bureaucratic one, and is going to mean a hardening of the heart of the relieving officer against the poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give the Dáil a sort of concrete case which has come within my own knowledge in regard to outdoor relief.  The County Board of Health appointed a Superintendent of Home Help who was, in this instance, a man who had no experience whatever of poor law or no previous experience of home help.  I do not know for what reason he was appointed. For all I know, it was probably for political reasons, or because, I suppose, he had a good record.  The fact, however, remains that he was appointed with a fairly substantial salary &mdash; I say this for the benefit of some of our friends on the Farmers' Benches &mdash; and he made a visit to a town, went to the local relieving officer and demanded his books.  He went through those books and made a visit to the houses of seven or eight recipients of outdoor relief.  He came back and cut down the amount of outdoor relief by one-third, a flat rate, without any distinction whatever, without any proper investigation, and without knowing or caring whether he was inflicting a very great hardship on some people.  That is a concrete case. People will say that an inspector, when he visits the homes of people who are in receipt of outdoor relief, will be able to decide whether those people should get relief or not, whether their circumstances are such that they could not get on without some public assistance. What I contend is, that it is not possible for a man who goes into a strange town, by looking at the houses and their inhabitants, to say whether these people should get public assistance. An inspector may go to one house which may be in a dilapidated condition and the occupants may look in a very bad way.  Taking the appearance of the people and the appearance of their <Col N="1156" /> homes into consideration, he may say to himself that these people are in abject misery.  The next house which he may visit may be clean and tidy, and its occupants may be clean and tidy, while, as a matter of fact, they may have a good deal less money coming in than these other people who lived under dirty, miserable conditions. I think that any Deputy who has any knowledge of the position of poor people in this country must vote for this amendment because it is absolutely necessary to have local committees of local people who know the circumstances of persons seeking outdoor relief.  You are not going to do justice to the ratepayers or to the recipients of outdoor relief under the system suggested in the Bill.  With the best will in the world the county board of health cannot decide whether an applicant is deserving or not because they have no knowledge of the circumstances of that person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to give a silent vote on this amendment.  I think it is necessary that the Minister should accept an amendment of this description.  With regard to the administration of home help, it is not carried out with any satisfaction to the poor, who have to lower themselves to look for it.  In nine cases out of ten these people will have to place themselves in the position of absolute beggars, with their hands out to receive alms before they can get the home help. The Minister spoke about setting up a committee to enquire into the whole question of the administration of home help with a view to relieving the distress of the poor.  Deputy Wilson said that such committees had been formed by the County Boards of Health, and that they had to be abolished by the Minister for Local Government.  I have a fairly long experience of Local Government, and have never yet known of a committee set up by the county Board of Health to go into the question of local administration concerning home help.  No such committees have been set up, but it is essential that they should be.  This amendment, if accepted, will not mean an increase in the expenditure of the ratepayers' <Col N="1157" /> money.  If you take County Boards of Health, which might have 48,000 or 50,000 people to look after, how are these bodies to know the circumstances of probably 1,000 or 2,000 applicants for home help?  They cannot know the full circumstances to enable them to decide whether or not these people are entitled to home help.  What happens is that an inspector is wired to, and he comes and rushes through the town, where there is no representative of the board living.  If the person seeking relief can get to the soft side of the Inspector, he or she gets the home help of probably 12/6 or 15/- per week.  If proper representatives were appointed in that town, such as the committee suggested in the amendment, they would fully understand the incomings and the outgoings in every house, and would know whether the people were entitled to receive help or not, and in that way there would be a saving.  It has been said here that home help has increased by 200 per cent.  It has, and by 300 per cent.</P>

      <P>Owing to the amalgamation of the workhouses in a number of cases, and also to the lack of local representatives.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment, for it is really necessary.  He has stated that he has made a saving in counties where amalgamation has taken place, bar Kildare.  I would like to know whether or not there has been a saving in Westmeath. I do not think there has been a saving there.  It is not the few shillings that you give to the poor in home help that increase the rates; it is the administration that has increased the rates.  It has been pointed out by Deputy Morrissey that inspectors are appointed at big salaries.  I have to say as regards the people I know appointed in the constituency I represent, that they have tried to carry out their duties to the best of their ability, but they are not able to cover the county. For instance, if there is an urgent case requiring assistance there is no representative of the county home in the town, and a letter or a telegram has to be sent to the inspector, who may <Col N="1158" /> live ten or twenty miles away, and the person requiring help will have to live on the neighbour's generosity until such time as the inspector is able to come and look after the case.  A person may fall suddenly ill, and an ambulance has to be sent for, and you have to communicate with the inspector, causing perhaps a delay of twenty-four hours, and in the meantime the patient may die.  Until you have committees set up, as specified in the amendment, you will not have the work carried out with any satisfaction to the ratepayers or the poor.  I strongly support the amendment, and I ask every honest and fair-minded Deputy to vote in favour of it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has placed me in a rather difficult position by suggesting that anyone who opposes this amendment is really opposed to the giving of relief to the poor. I disclaim that entirely.  I am ready and willing to support any proposal by which fair treatment will be meted out to the poor, but I am still unable to see with regard to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; that any great difference exists between the proposal in the amendment and the proposal in Section 12.  The same authority, that is, the public health board, is to appoint a committee and give it a name, but otherwise I see no difference in the appointment of this public assistance local committee.  Surely the same class of people would be appointed by the Board of Health as would be appointed under the committee suggested in the Bill?  Therefore, I do not see, if they can deal with the subject, why the people who are appointed as ordinary committees cannot deal with the matter in the same way as the committee given a special name.</P>

I have no objection to that &mdash; that it shall be set out in the proposals of the Bill that they shall be appointed, but these committees are to be appointed by the <Col N="1159" /> same body, the Public Health Board, and they must be appointed from the same class of people.  If those people are opposed to giving the poor proper consideration, I do not see how the amendment will make them give the proper consideration in the one case that they would not in the other.  That is my position.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to understand the attitude of the previous speaker.  Deputy Sir James Craig says there is no difference between the intention of the Minister, as set out in the Bill, and that of the amendment, as proposed by Deputy Colohan.  If that is so, I do not see why we should have any hesitancy in accepting and supporting the amendment.  Neither do I see why the Minister should not accept the amendment.  I could quite understand why he should not accept it, if these committees were to seek to have plenary powers to deal directly with the poor in connection with home assistance.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  We are making it mandatory on the county councils to appoint committees in the areas to keep in direct touch with the poor, in order that they may get the treatment they deserve. We do not think there is anything revolutionary in that.</P>
      <P>That is as much in the interests of the ratepayers as it is in the interest of the poor, because at the present moment you have Relieving Officers and Superintendents appointed in the different areas and I have no hesitation in saying that it is according to the political colour of those particular people that outdoor relief is administered.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely necessary that committees in each area should hold a watching brief on behalf of the poor and the ratepayers.  Anybody in touch with public life week after week knows what is happening. As regards many of the county councils in this State, they would not set up a committee to deal with outdoor relief until they were up against a crisis, or almost on the verge of something <Col N="1160" /> approaching a revolution, because of inattention to the poor or because of extravagant expenditure.  If the Minister is in earnest in endeavouring to relieve the ratepayers and the poor, he would not have any hesitation in agreeing to the appointment of those committees. We are not asking for plenary powers; we are merely asking for committees to hold a watching brief on behalf of the poor and the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Now, a word to the Farmers.  When the Old Age Pensions Act was going through the Dáil we pointed out repeatedly from these Benches that there were some very dangerous clauses in it, and that there was a little more in the Act than the mere cut of 1/- per week.  We pointed out that the Minister was taking certain powers which enabled him to cut down the pensions of poor people by considerably more than 1/- a week.  The Farmers did not mind that at the time; but I think they found out since that what we said then was true.  There is in this case a parallel so far as the superintendent is concerned, and I would ask the Farmers to consider carefully, in the light of their experience since the Old Age Pensions Act was passed, the purport of this amendment.  They should approve of it.</P>

      <P>Knowing as I do the great necessity for the appointment of those committees.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision and accept the amendment.  It lies with the board of health to use their discretion in defining areas.  I know the Minister has an aversion for anything connected with the rural district councils; but could he not find out some other term, such, for instance, as a dispensary area, and could he not let the committees comprise as small a number as three? I think such committees would be able to look after a dispensary area and give greater satisfaction.  If you leave it optional with the board of health to appoint committees under Section 12 as it stands, I am afraid many areas will be neglected, and many people will die; but, perhaps, as we have been already told here, they may be let die.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word <Col N="1161" /> or two on this matter, because I have heard so many things within the last hour, things which I know myself could not happen in any properly regulated county or properly regulated district.  I have never known yet that any officer of a board of health or any other board could override the decisions of that board: he would have to bring matters before them.  We have heard it said that a superintendent went to a relieving officer and there and then made certain changes in the books without ever consulting the people concerned.  I heard further about glaring instances that have occurred where people were practically allowed to starve, or to die in their homes, because of the callousness of those officers.  I do not know in what part of the country those things have happened; but I do know for certain that in the part of the country where I live those things could not possibly happen.  The officers that are appointed there are at least humane men and they have power to give relief wherever they think it is necessary, pending a meeting of the board.</P>
      <P>The statement has been made here that where a man or a woman would fall sick they could not get relief until a telegram would be sent to the authorities. That is not so.  The officer is there in the district and he has absolute power to give whatever relief he thinks right.  That is at his own discretion, and he can get that remedied at the next meeting of the board.  I am not talking without being sure of my ground in this case.  How can it be that those glaring hardships are imposed in any part of the country?  As far as the amendment is concerned, I do not think it improves Section 12.</P>

It can appoint them partly from members of the Board and from other persons if it so desires.  That, in my opinion, is quite wide enough.  If the men who are to be elected in the future are going to be men of honesty and probity in their districts, I think it would be perfectly easy to see that every district, urban or rural, is represented on those committees.  With proper officers, who will be able to stand the test of public opinion, that system should be quite satisfactory.  As far as I can see, from my experience of boards of this description, I think the section is all right and the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>If the intentions of Section 12 are as stated by Deputy Sir James Craig, I would like to know why were the district councils abolished.  Is it because the district councils had been acting in a manner detrimental to the ratepayers, or does the Minister allege that the reason district councils were abolished was on account of the dishonest manner in which they were administering home help?  If that is what is in his mind, I would like him to state it here and now, so that it would go abroad through the country, and every district council, acting as a sub-committee for home assistance, would be branded as they are branded in the Minister's mind, and it would give them an opportunity to clear themselves of such a blackmailing statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points on which I would like to speak.  The first one is that as far as the county I <Col N="1163" /> represent is concerned, I wish to give an emphatic denial to the statement that politics have anything whatever to do with the administration of home help. There are four inspectors appointed for Westmeath.  They report to the Board of Health.  They are empowered in the interval from one board meeting to another to administer, themselves, emergency help in any case in which serious hardship arises.  They are divided over the county, and if any case of hardship comes up, they are entitled, at once, to relieve that person.  In the ordinary course, at the monthly meeting, or fortnightly meeting, as the case may be, a very large number of home help cases come up for consideration, and a large number of such applications for home help comes before the meeting, and they are generally marked &ldquo;referred to inspectors,&rdquo; because the persons are not themselves in a position to judge as to the position of these people, and there is no getting out of the fact that, in the past, the administration of home help has been grossly abused, to the serious loss of the ratepayers.  There is no person in the Dáil or in any other place who would prefer as much as I would to see any person who absolutely requires help, receive it.  I am aware that private individuals, persons not members of the board of health at all, were issuing orders for home help.  Some of these were giving orders for 15s. or £1 a week to people who already were receiving the old age pension and pensions from the war pensions committee.</P>

      <P>In the ordinary course, other persons, who were in very serious want, did not receive any home help. Money that was ear-marked for a particular purpose was not being spent on the people who were entitled to it.  I would like to ask the Minister, when he is replying, to say if the cases of home help that will come up now at the ordinary meeting of the board of health, will still be considered by the members of the board of health, and whether they will be entitled still to give the <Col N="1164" /> superintending officers appointed assistance or help in deciding on cases where persons should be entitled to receive it?  There is just one other matter that I would like to touch on, and I would like to mention it to the Minister, and that is that I think the superintending officer should be encouraged, in the future, to give emergency help oftener, and permanent help to a lesser extent because people have been put on at 15s. a week.</P>

      <P>Quite so, fortnightly in the town, and monthly in the rural districts.  Deputy Shaw is a sport and I will put a fiver on it with him.  I want the Minister to understand fully that this amendment is really necessary. It does not matter what Deputy may stand up.  Deputy Hughes, a moment ago, said that in his opinion no inspector had to be sent a telegram. I have known telegrams having to be sent to superintendents and inspectors out of the towns.  I live in a town where there is no representative of the board of health.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one living ten miles away.  We have not a home help officer in every town.  If we had, this would not be necessary.  Deputy Shaw remarked, too, that emergency home help was given by nonmembers of the county board of health and that it was a good job it <Col N="1165" /> was stopped, as it was a huge increase on the ratepayers.  I am one of those who had no authority to give emergency forms for 15/- or £1, but I gave the emergency form.  I gave it to a father of twelve children who was lying up for three weeks with nothing coming into his house, and I think were it not that I did that, though I had no authority, not being a member of the board of health, there would be a great deal more loss to the State.  If that man died his twelve little children would go to the county home.  Why these forms were given to non-members is because the representatives of the county home were not acting in their districts.</P>
      <P>Surely somebody must look after the poor.  We are not going to allow the poor people to drop dead of starvation in the street.  I do not at all agree that Section 12 will cover this amendment, but if this amendment is added before Section 12, then I think it will do as much justice to the ratepayers as it does to the poor person.  I am fully assured that every Deputy who has spoken against the amendment realises the necessity of helping the poor.  I think that was the object of this amendment, and, I believe, that the mover of this amendment realises the necessity of helping the ratepayers.  By accepting this amendment you will help both the ratepayers and the poor, and there will be proper, honest administration and supervision maintained over home help administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (An Clár)</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I hear this Bill explained the more I confess I do not understand it.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say that discussing home help on this Bill was irrelevant.  Why?  I think the Bill seems to be drafted more to conceal the Minister's idea of Local Government administration than to express it. If his contention is, that discussing home help at this stage is not relevant, I would like to know what is relevant? What the Minister contends is a virtue is where the Bill just has failed.  He does not wish that the districts should be stereotyped and made definite, and their boundaries fixed.  He said he would be anxious there would be elasticity <Col N="1166" /> as to area.  We consider that that is in itself a fault.  We consider that all the poor in any area should know in what district their home assistance is to be administered, and that they should know definitely where to look for it.  It is quite possible to be so elastic in your arrangements that they will not bear weight.  In that case you would have the position that what is everybody's duty is nobody's duty. If you are leaving one district, to say &ldquo;We have no fixed area; well what is it to us that somebody outside is suffering &mdash; they should have some other Committee,&rdquo; you see under that sort of an arrangement the poor will suffer and suffer seriously in the matter of the system for administering home assistance.  It is very easily conceivable that the representation would not be equitably divided at all &mdash; that is to say, that the districts would not get what one would call adequate and proper representation.  I know from experience of Local Government that most of the poor, and most of those who come in under home assistance, come from the urban areas, and it is very well known to everybody who has experience in local affairs that the urban areas have not a very large representation on the county council from which the board of health will be drawn.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore you will find that these people, who are very well informed as to the conditions of the poor in the urban areas, have little or no representation.  We found that, in endeavouring to administer home assistance under the amalgamation scheme.  In this matter, I must differ with some Deputies who said that there were no local committees appointed. We had to appoint local committees. First of all we appointed the chairmen of the rural district councils, who might give us some information.  We found that was inadequate.  We added the chairmen of the urban councils, and still found we could not get the necessary information as to who was or was not entitled to home assistance. In the end we found it was almost impossible <Col N="1167" /> to get the necessary information. Cases were cropping up daily, as to which we had no evidence either to justify or turn down.</P>
      <P>In this connection it is surprising to hear Deputy Wilson say that he was more inclined to believe the officials than to have committees.  He told us that home assistance soared to a rate which was 300 or 400 per cent. more than at some other time.  I do not know what the other time was; perhaps it was 1914 &mdash; the standard we all go back to.  It is not a question as to what it should soar to.  It is a question of how it should be administered &mdash; the just administration of it.  If it soars let the committee that is appointed be responsible for that.  Let them be in a position to give a proper account of the expenditure.  It is a question of equitable and just administration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig's argument was directed to the question of &ldquo;may,&rdquo; and that hinges also on the statement of the Minister that he wants elasticity as to areas.  We want it definitely stated that the committee shall be appointed, that they shall function in a certain manner, shall consider certain cases and be responsible, not as a body with full powers to take upon themselves definite action, but to advise the Board of Health as to the particular needs of the poor and destitute in the particular district, particularly in regard to urban areas, where representation on the county council is not likely to be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these matters I think it is only right that the Minister should reconsider his attitude towards this amendment. The poor cannot wait until a commission is set up; they cannot wait indefinitely.  Commissions may come and go, but the unfortunate poor, we have good authority for knowing, are always with us.  If this Bill is an attempt to improve the administration of local government, and relieve the destitute, then this is the one provision which would make for equitable administration, not alone as regards the poor, but those on whom the burden of keeping the poor from utter destitution rests.  It is just as necessary for <Col N="1168" /> the ratepayer, out of whose pocket the money to support the destitute poor comes, that these committees should be elected, as it is for the poor who are looking for the proper administration of home assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have launched into a discussion on this question which I was anxious to avoid, and I think the turn that the discussion has taken is sufficient justification for my attitude.  We see here considerable diversity of opinion as to what is the best method of administration of this very difficult problem.  When I introduced the Bill during the last Session, several Deputies were very much in favour of having a commission to consider the whole matter of local government.  I explained at that time that the provisions in this Bill were of more or less a skeleton kind, that they could go through without prejudicing in any way other decisions that might have to be come to later on about other matters.</P>
      <P>This question of home help and poor relief, generally, is one that requires a good deal of consideration, as appears from the discussion we had to-night. Deputy Johnson referred to the fact that we had commissions dealing with this matter already.  We had the Viceregal Commission set up in 1909.  But the problem has changed considerably since that time.  I might mention only two out of very many factors that have tended to change the problem a great deal.  The Old Age Pensions Act was passed subsequent to that, and that has changed the problem of dealing with relief.  You have also got the progress in motor traffic which makes it easier to convey poor people to houses for relieving distress.  The whole problem is very different to what it was in 1909, and it is better for us to set up a commission to decide what is the best method of relieving the poor, rather than jump into the thing in a careless, slipshod manner like this, without having it fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I myself have kept practically an open mind on the matter.  I do realise that there has been considerable abuse of home help in the past.  In very many <Col N="1169" /> cases, where the district councils were set up as committees to deal with this matter, there was abuse undoubtedly. On the other hand, I know that in many cases those committees were placed in very great difficulty.  Take the case of Kildare in particular.  It was a county where, owing to the withdrawal of the military forces, etc., there was considerable unemployment.  Perhaps it is a county which has suffered more than any other county.  These are problems that have to be considered by committees all over the country, and problems that will have to be taken into consideration by a commission. It is much too big a thing for me to be able to come to a decision on, without getting the advice of people who are in a position to give a considered opinion on the matter. For that reason I was setting up this commission and I want to keep an open mind in the matter until I have a report from the commission.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any great danger of the people being left destitute as a result of not adopting this amendment.  At present you have got your home assistance officer in every area, just as you had relieving officers before.  These men should be in a position to know very well the means of the people that they are supposed to relieve.  In some respects they may not act as well without committees. In other respects they may act much better.  It will do away with anything in the shape of wire-pulling, and there was a great deal of that in the past.  As well as that you have your supervising officers going around seeing that these officers carry out their duties in an efficient way.  I cannot see that there is any danger of abuse in the present arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the number of home help officers in County Kildare was reduced from fourteen to nine, and that at the last meeting of the board of health in Naas, notice of motion was given to appoint another officer for Newbridge?  Surely the Minister cannot say that the poor people are looked after in the same way as of old?</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with <Col N="1170" /> the case that the Deputy puts before us.  I know that ample provision is made for the relief of the destitute.  As the Act is now administered there is a very grave responsibility on these assistance officers.  They are obliged in cases of sudden hardship, necessity, or in an emergency to give relief.  If they do not, and if as a result the patient dies, they may be subject to a charge of manslaughter.  That is a very heavy responsibility for an officer.</P>
      <P>I am not now in a position to express a considered opinion on this matter.  I did not think it would crop up and did not intend to discuss it at all.  When we bring in a Bill dealing with poor relief it will be more comprehensive than this, and will deal with different matters.  I wanted to keep my mind free on the subject.  In the meantime, while we have officers with this very heavy responsibility placed upon them, I do not think there is any danger of a serious abuse of home help, either by not giving relief to people who merit it or by giving too much relief.</P>

      <P>The Minister and other Deputies seem to have failed to realise that this amendment is a proposal to ensure that what is suggested in the Bill as likely to be carried out shall be carried out.  The Deputies who opposed the amendment seemed to agree that under Section 12 the board of health, having power to appoint committees, will certainly appoint them.  That is the suggestion made by Deputy Sir James Craig and others who have opposed the amendment.  The board of health is to be given power to appoint committees, and it is assumed that, having these powers, they will appoint the committees.  The board of health is not a body that is certainly going to represent specified areas.  It may have representatives of specified areas or it may not.  We may have the condition that certain urban areas would have no representation upon it.  There may be an officer appointed to administer home assistance. If there is no representative on the board of health from that area there is nothing in the Bill to make it certain that there will be any other authority of any kind except the home <Col N="1171" /> assistance officer in the area to administer this service.</P>
      <P>If there is anything in the argument that Section 12 provides all that is necessary, and on the assumption that what is hoped for in Section 12 will be carried out, why is there any objection to making it mandatory that in every area &mdash; areas which may be rural districts, or urban districts, or may be areas to be defined by the board of health &mdash; there shall be a local assistance committee consisting of three persons who may be members of the board of health or otherwise?  I would imagine that a proposition of that kind should appeal to anyone who wants to disentangle the administration of home assistance from the old conception of the poor law, the relieving officer and all the rest.  The very existence of these county schemes shows that there was an attempt on the one hand to save cost, and on the other to humanise the administration of the poor law.  It was pauperism before; it was poor law relief. The very change of name indicated a desire to get away from the old conception of the relieving officer, and bring into the administration of this service the human influence of people in the locality who know the poor and can say whether such a person is worthy and can benefit by assistance, or whether another person is merely sponging upon the public.  The amendment seeks to make it mandatory that such committees shall be set up for this service, and that they will be functioning even in the time preparatory to this new Bill which the Minister hopes for in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there have been from the benches occupied by Deputies in the Farmers' Party recently a good many criticisms of the substitution of the official in the case of old age pensions for local knowledge.  The official goes into the house, looks around, and finds from his observation what is the condition of the old age pensioner.  That has been protested against as being something not as valuable as local knowledge &mdash; a check upon local knowledge, perhaps a check on any attempt on the part of neighbours to malinger &mdash; but nevertheless it has been objected that <Col N="1172" /> the introduction and the substitution of the official for the human influence is something objectionable.  If that is true &mdash; and I believe it is true &mdash; the setting up of local committees should surely receive the support of any such Deputy.  When the Minister points out that the home assistance officer, if he allows a person to die, is liable to a charge of manslaughter, and that that is the check and the assurance that the home assistance officer will do his duty to the poor, well, it suggests to me that the Minister has not got in his mind the humanising of the poor law.  Surely we are going to treat people humanly who are not at the stage where they may die if they do not get treatment?  Surely the purpose of this scheme is to prevent people getting to that stage where they may die from poverty, or hunger?  If we are to rely on the home assistant officer's fears that a verdict of manslaughter may be his due, and that that only is to be the only stimulus to action, that is all the more reason why we should have a committee of this kind who may be expected to know the circumstances of the person seeking relief, and be able to advise, and, if necessary, check the home assistance officer.</P>
    <P>I claim the support for this amendment of all those Deputies who want to humanise the poor law, and who want to bring some human feeling, as against official feeling, into the treatment of the poor on this question of relief.  I claim the support of the Deputies who want to ensure that there shall be some equity in the treatment of the poor. If any Deputy is relying on Section 12, and the power that is given by that section to boards of health and public assistance, to appoint committees and if any Deputy hopes and expects that such committees must be appointed because power is given to appoint them there, then I claim the support of those Deputies for a provision which makes the appointment of such committees mandatory.  I ask the Dáil to support the amendment and not allow the risk to be run that any area in the country not represented on the board of health will be without anybody but an official to look after the interest of the poor.</P>

      <P>I want to make one point in regard to what the Minister said about the officers.  He made much play with regard to the efficiency and impartiality of the officers who administered those services.  We all know that the principal reason for the amalgamation scheme, which led to the setting up of those county boards of health, was the cry of economy.  I put it to the Minister or any member of this House that the natural tendency of the officials who have got positions under the county board of health will be to try and prove that there is real economy in the setting up of a county board of health.  Therefore, the natural inclination will be to reduce in all cases the outdoor relief, irrespective of the need of the applicant.  That is a fact, because even the Minister himself will tell you that success or failure of the amalgamation system depends on the number of thousands of pounds per year they are able to save.</P>

      <P>Again I am astonished to find that any of those savings supposed to be taking place under the amalgamation of unions are at the expense of the deserving poor. I have not heard that before, and I am sorry to hear that argument now. That argument would not hold water in any civilised community.  The argument in favour of amalgamation that I heard was that there were too many officials and too much waste within those institutions.  That one argument was put forward when this amalgamation scheme was going through, and I think it was the only argument put forward, because where people got what is known as outdoor relief or home assistance it was never thought that they or their families getting this pittance were parasites on the rates.  The people who were always supposed to be the parasites, as far as the arguments here and outside were concerned, were those who formed the large establishment of those institutions &mdash; the masters, the matrons, the doctors, the nurses, and all those people.  Those people were in charge of a very small number of inmates and the argument was put forward in other places that by putting those latter in a central institution you could give them more assistance <Col N="1174" /> at a less cost to the community. believe that can be done without interfering with the people who are entitled to get home assistance.</P>
      <P>If it is possible &mdash; and I believe it is possible &mdash; to give home assistance to people and to keep them out of these institutions altogether, so much the better for the country and for everyone. I have never been in favour of rearing children in institutions or huddling people up in them.  It is much better, in my opinion, to keep those people amongst their friends and to give them assistance outside.  That is the way I look on this matter, and the argument that people will be let die on the roadside because some board is set up is, I think, the greatest nonsense in the world.</P>

      <P>I read this amendment and the section it is proposed to amend and as one who comes from a county where home health has been administered, not quite according to some of the plans or schemes of the Local Government Department, but more or less according to a scheme of its own, I do not see how this amendment is going to improve the situation.  The particular health board I am acquainted with is composed of about 32 members, which is, practicably speaking, a County Council, with a few members of the County Council not acting, and a few others nominated. A District Council area, according to the present system, gives three or four representatives to the County Council. The Bill proposes to give a little addition to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to set up in a district council area a committee of three, to be nominated, not elected.  The House decided on a previous amendment to get rid of the district council and not to fit this elected body into the scheme of home help.  This amendment is designed to mend the position, but I do not think it mends the position at all.  If the district council areas are going to send to the new county councils between four and five representatives, there is no occasion for the committee of three to be nominated to do the work that four or five are elected to do.  The argument falls to the ground.  If those four or five do <Col N="1175" /> not do it, I fail to see how the three will do it.  The county council can nominate the whole of their own members on the board of health.</P>

      <P>I cannot attach to this amendment the importance that Deputy Johnson gives it with regard to the humanising influence.  If the case is that the local people should have a knowledge and take an interest in their local problems, I for one would support that entirely, but as I understand the position, the amendment proposes that under this Bill these boards shall be set up.  The reply on behalf of the Minister is that this Bill is creating a groundwork on which the question of the poor law areas will be considered. I do not think that the Minister or the Dáil contemplates that the poor of any district are going to be allowed to run the risk of not having their requirements attended to.  That being so, I cannot see that the amendment is a valuable contribution to the question, because making it mandatory to appoint a committee would seem to preclude the possibility of opening up the whole question on proper lines to secure that humanising influence which Deputy Johnson advocates as the proper solution of all those problems.</P>

The amendment prejudges the whole question by making it mandatory on the county council, when <Col N="1176" /> elected, to pursue a certain course.  If I were convinced that the amendment would, in any way, tend to people in the country taking a greater interest in their neighbours, so that such cases as have been mentioned here to-day of people dying with hunger could not happen, it would have my heartiest support. But I really cannot see, taking the Bill as a whole, and taking the position as it is, that the amendment is an improvement on the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat is at a loss to know how this scheme proposed by Deputy Colohan will help the poor. As a matter of fact, he goes so far as to say that it will not help the poor, and that without having any knowledge, in my opinion, of the exact situation so far as the treatment meted out to recipients of outdoor relief and home help is concerned.  What I would like to ask the Minister is: Whom does he suggest the poor should approach in order to get home help?  At the moment, none of the relieving officers, so far as I know, has any definite place where he meets the poor.  In the majority of cases the relieving officer appears in the town on Friday or Saturday, and is engaged the whole day paying outdoor relief to a string of people.  The majority of these people are chronic cases, whose names are already on the books.  New claimants have no opportunity provided for them to approach the home help officer. They have no opportunity provided for them to get in touch with the county board of health, unless in the particular area where that board meets.  What we ask to have provided is a medium by which these people can make representations as to their condition in their own area.  Surely that is not too much. If we were asking to have a committee set up with plenary powers, I could understand the Minister's resistance to the amendment.  But we are not asking anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson when he says that this step would humanise the system and would prompt and enable people to take an interest in the poor.  That is not much to ask.  I say that this course is absolutely necessary, because it is not now possible for <Col N="1177" /> people to get in touch with the relieving officer in the same way that it was when we had a board of guardians and a district council.  The Board of Public Health has already too much to do, and the applications that are made there do not get the attention they deserve. The home assistance officer will bring in certain reports to people who know nearly as little about the applicants as the officer himself.  That is primarily due to the fact that there are very few people with local knowledge at present on the boards of public health.  There will be a lesser number in the future, because these seven or eight county councillors who are to be appointed on the board of public health for the whole county cannot give the attention to the poor that their present position warrants. I would ask, in all seriousness, the Deputies here to consider the position which prevails at present, when we have people on the verge of starvation. If the position was normal, or anything resembling what it was during the war, when practically everybody was working, there would not be the same necessity for this amendment. But at the present moment, when we have abnormal unemployment and &mdash; I do not like repeating it &mdash; people actually starving, who cannot get in touch with those who could provide them with relief, it is absolutely necessary that the whole House should support this amendment.</P>

Accordingly, I am opposed to the amendment.  Deputies on the Labour benches have made considerable play with the contention that county councils are not as representative of urban districts as they are of rural districts. I would like to point out to Deputies that under the present Bill county councils will be proportionately more representative of urban areas than in the past.  In the past, the Chairman of every rural council was an ex-officio member of the county council.  Under the present Bill you do away with rural district councils, and accordingly you will not have the Chairmen of rural district councils ex-officio members of the county councils.</P>

There is no reason why they should not. There is nothing further, I think, to be said on this matter.  As I have said, I would prefer not to have it discussed here at all.  But it has been forced on me, and there has been a certain amount of cross-talk.  We have not got any further with regard to the solution of the home help problem.

      <P>I want to call attention to the methods, or I should say the want of method, adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in the matter of the collection of income tax from national teachers.  Of course, nobody likes to pay income tax, and if it were a matter of ordinary complaints or the ordinary grumbles one hears from income taxpayers I would not trouble the Dáil by raising the matter. But it was only when the complaints reached such a stage that it was evident that there was some considerable chaos and confusion in this particular branch of the Income Tax Department that I thought it necessary to bring it to the notice of the Minister and of the Dáil.  There are two methods adopted for collecting tax from the teachers.  First, there is the ordinary way, the ordinary local income tax collector, and then there is the method which is being adopted recently whereby the Revenue Commissioners send an order to the Education Office to stop from the teacher's salary the amount of tax which they say is due. A considerable amount of overlapping <Col N="1180" /> as between the two Departments has resulted from this, and there are cases where teachers have paid their income tax locally, but at the same time the tax is deducted from them at the Education Office.</P>
      <P>During the years 1919, 1920 and 1921 a considerable amount of arrears accumulated in the case of the teachers as in the case of other income taxpayers, and I can only say that so far as this collection is concerned now I am afraid that the Revenue Commissioners cannot hold that the promises given by the President and the Minister for Finance here that the collection of these arrears would be reasonable, and that no undue hardship would be inflicted on the taxpayer, have been kept in the case of the teachers.  I could quote numerous instances where anything from 50 to 75 per cent. of the salary was stopped, instances in the case of teachers whose salaries are from £20 to £25, with anything from £12 to £15 a month stopped.  That was a very great hardship, and I think that a much more reasonable attitude should have been adopted in the collection of arrears.  That promise was given to us, and it has certainly not been carried out in the case of collection from the teachers.  One general complaint that I received, and I received numerous complaints, is that appeals and explanations with regard to wrongful assessments are not listened to.  All the heed that is given is that the teacher generally gets a card saying that the matter will be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of these complaints which have reached me fall into three or four heads.  There is first the class that I have mentioned, of deductions by the local inspector and stoppages of the same amount by the Department. In some cases where arrears are due, the teacher has gone to the local tax inspector, has discussed his case with him, and they have come to an arrangement whereby £4, £5 or £6 per month would be paid.  That has gone on and all parties are satisfied, but suddenly, without any notice whatsoever, the teacher finds that this arrangement has been forgotten, and the amount of arrears due has been stopped from the salary before it left the Education Office.  Then you have the <Col N="1181" /> case of teachers who were assessed and whose tax was deducted, although they had no liability whatsoever. Numerous cases of that kind are turning up, and all the appeals and explanations seem to have no effect on the local inspector; the next thing the teacher finds is that the amount has been stopped at the source.  Then there are cases where the incorrect amount has been deducted, in spite of assessment.  The teacher may have been assessed for one particular sum, or the assessment may have been amended to a particular sum, but quite a different sum altogether is deducted at the source.</P>
    <P>Then you have cases where there is no assessment whatsoever, and no demand or information about the period for which the sum is deducted.  In the first instance, the teacher writes to the Education Office.  They have nothing to do except to carry out the orders of the Revenue Commissioners, and they know nothing whatsoever about the amount stopped, or as to how it has been arrived at.  All they do is to stop the sum they are asked to stop and hand it over to the Revenue Commissioners. The teacher then writes to the Revenue Commissioners and he gets the usual postcard, but very seldom anything else.  I took up several of these cases and there were a few in which assessments were made after very much delay, and things were straightened out. But in the majority of the cases that I brought to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners, as far as I know, nothing has happened, and in all the cases there has been very considerable delay. I will give one or two examples; I do not want to weary the House or the Minister by attempting to go through the file which I have here, but these are a few typical examples.  There was the case of a woman whose salary was £135.  Her husband is a small landholder, the valuation of his holding being £5.  Without any notice of any kind she had £6 stopped from her October salary.  The salary was about £11 a month.</P>
    <P>There was another case where a woman had the same salary.  The valuation of the farm in this case was £4, and they had three children.  There <Col N="1182" /> was £4 stopped from her October salary.  A man with a wife and four children has £278; £10 9s. has been deducted from his salary for a month. A woman with £175, whose husband is an unemployed agricultural labourer, had £9 13s. 5d. stopped from her salary. I have several instances here where the teacher has paid locally and the money has been stopped again at the head office.  One of our branch secretaries, writing to me, says: &ldquo;I met four teachers to-day who paid their Income tax for the last year and who had the same tax again deducted from their October salaries.  There is bungling somewhere.&rdquo;  There is the case of a teacher who is married and has six young children; her husband has been unemployed for over twelve months; she neglected filling up her Income tax forms from 1919 to 1922, but since then she has filled up all forms, claiming deductions for her husband and children, with the result that their income was not taxable at all.  She was notified that the amount due on account of income was £76 5s. 1d., and that £19 a month was to be deducted from her from October until that amount was paid, leaving her £2 a month to keep her husband and six children for the next four months.</P>
    <P>There is another case for the month of July, a case where a sum of £30 was deducted for two months from a woman's salary.  Her salary was £23 per month, that is, £15 was stopped out of the £23 each month, and she has had an intimation to the effect that a similar amount would be deducted each month up to the end of the present year, the total amount to be deducted being £90 15s. 9d.  This woman has two children under 16, and she has other children over that age who are being educated.  Her husband has £40, and yet there is stopped £90 15s. 9d. There is another case of a teacher who was notified in February, 1923, that the total tax due for 1920-21, 1921-22, and 1922-23 was £6 7s., but a few mornings ago, on the 17th November, she received a letter giving her new assessments altogether for this period, which amount to £47 10s.  For instance, the income tax collector had notified her that for 1920-21 her assessment would <Col N="1183" /> be <i>nil.</i>  Now he notifies her that her assessment was £30 18s.  He does not say how that was arrived at, although the original assessments were arrived at after explanations received from the teacher herself.  That is an example of what is happening when tax is deducted, and this is a case of what is happening when the teacher makes an effort to get back the tax which is wrongfully deducted.  There is a case of a teacher who was wrongfully assessed in July with £21 4s. 5d.; there should not have been any assessment at all.  She went to the collector and he promised that the thing would be made right.  There was £11 deducted from her July salary; she found out that she was not liable; the inspector promised to write to the head office about it, and she herself wrote to the head office.  She got a letter on the 6th September telling her that a refund of the £11 deducted from the July salary would be made to her as soon as the relative tax would be received from the Education Office, but when her August salary was paid, somewhere about the 11th September, a further £11 was deducted.  She has made various efforts since to get back that money, which should never have been stopped from her, and she has not got it yet.  Letters received from the Education Department say that the deductions were made as they were ordered by the Inland Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I want to say there is very grave complaint, considerable complaint, all over the country from teachers with regard to the manner in which these things are being done.  I think it is not too much to expect that a special effort should be made to have these things regularly done and without causing such hardship and cause of complaint to the teachers.  The teachers do not wish to evade in any way any tax they are properly and regularly liable for.  They were, as I say, in 1920, 1921, and 1922, no doubt like everybody else, but now that the arrears are being collected they wish to get the same consideration that has been promised to other taxpayers.  I hope the Minister will look into this <Col N="1184" /> matter and see that these cases and such things as these, do not happen. As I say, the complaint is general from all over the country, but I must say there is one particular district, that is the Sligo district, from which the greatest numbers of complaints seem to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is one in which the teachers themselves are not without blame.  It has been found impossible, even since the Treaty and since there has been an Irish Government in existence, when it might be expected that there would be no very considerable passive resistance to the collection of income tax, to get any satisfaction from the teachers.  I think it might be said that there are somewhere in the neighbourhood of 10,000 defaulters.  Certainly, there is an enormous number of defaulters, and they have in general given no information to the revenue authorities which would enable them to make the proper allowances.  That is the reason why in many cases more tax is being deducted than is due to be paid by the person.  It is simply that they have failed until the time of the collection began to give any co-operation or help to the revenue authorities in arriving at the proper amount.  Consequently, there have been these overcharges.  It is realised that we are coming out of special circumstances, and we are now making arrangements where there has been an over-deduction to make repayment as rapidly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been decided that we will not wait until there is any particular communication or any remittance from the Education Office of the tax actually deducted, but that we will attempt to repay what has been deducted even before we have got that from the Education Office.  Special machinery has been set up to deal with these particular cases in an expeditious way.  There may be a certain amount of delay in some cases where there has been an enormous piling up of work, but in general, I think they will be dealt with fairly rapidly; and they will certainly be dealt with a good deal more quickly than the repayments to the ordinary taxpayer.  In the particular districts mentioned by Deputy O'Connell, there <Col N="1185" /> were 1,000 defaulters, and, of course, that great number of people who have not given their returns and who have not assisted the Revenue authorities in any way, led to a considerable trouble and delay in dealing with the cases. It means that the Education Office is severely handicapped.  They are given certain particulars of deductions to be made.  Then people come along and supply information about allowances. We have to supply the Education Office with revised lists.  Then there is a continual revision of these lists and deductions to be made because claims for deductions are now coming in.  That causes great difficulty with the Education people, and it might cause occasionally certain additional delay. Mistakes may occur either on our part, or through the Education people through all these things being now done at once, dealing with a period of several years when they should have been dealt with long ago.</P>
    <P>I am not complaining of the teachers having done nothing after the Treaty, but a very considerable time has elapsed and a very considerable sum was involved.  A sum of £100,000 is involved, I suppose, and it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to collect that.  I would like to be informed of particulars of any case where there is any deduction like the amount of 75 per cent. of the salary.  I certainly think it could not possibly be justified &mdash; such large deductions in any case.  If it was the case of a person of very large, considerable means, it might be justified, but in the case of any ordinary teacher any such sum as that could not be justified, and I would take up any case where there was a deduction that would bear harshly.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get these arrears liquidated in a reasonable time.  We are trying to get, in most cases, the arrears liquidated by the end of this year, that is arrears previous to the current year.  In other cases it is realised that they cannot be got in so soon as that, and the instalments have been fixed so as to allow until about August next year before they are entirely wiped out.  I think it would only be a continuing hardship on the <Col N="1186" /> teacher to make these instalments too small, because the present year's tax is accumulating.  Then when this new system comes into operation next year, the tax will have to be deducted, and it is necessary that we should get the whole thing cleared up in a reasonable time.  The teachers, I believe, will be better satisfied, and will agree with the system of deduction in the Education Office.  They will find that the payment of income tax will be really easier on them, because there is no doubt that people spend money that comes into them, and then find it very hard and very difficult to meet demands for income tax.  They will certainly feel the tax less when it is deducted at the source in future.  Deputy O'Connell has mentioned a number of cases, and I could not reply to him on them.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to look into any cases of that sort if the Deputy will give me information about them.  I believe that some of them could be explained along the lines I have suggested.  These big deductions, in the case of people who have children and who are not liable, are made probably because these persons never filled in any returns, and there was no information in the hands of the revenue authorities that they had children, and that they should have the allowances or that they were married even, and in a very big proportion of the cases it certainly is their own fault.  Mistakes may occur when you are dealing with such an enormous number of cases extending over a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The instructions which were issued to the local collectors, I think, in May or June last, were that they were not to ask for income tax from teachers, that is income tax in respect of salary. Of course, they would ask for it if there were houses or property in question, and in these cases they would collect it in the ordinary way, but their instructions were not to ask for this tax, so that this thing of the tax being paid locally, and also of having it deducted at the source might not occur. If it has occurred it has occurred in <Col N="1187" /> error.  The instructions were definitely issued to prevent it, and I certainly will see that proper arrangements are made in the Revenue Office to see if it has occurred at all, that it will be rectified as rapidly as possible. I do not at all desire that there should be any hardship, but I think it ought to be realised that when the teachers <Col N="1188" /> themselves, for so long after the setting up of the Free State were in the majority of cases utterly negligent, that they should realise that if there is any hardship there is some share of the blame attaching to themselves.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he can state the reason of the delay in sanctioning the payment of superannuation allowance granted by the Balrothery Board of Guardians to their former midwife, Mrs. O'Leary, on July 28th, 1924.</P>

      <P>Particulars of the proposal of the Board of Guardians of Balrothery Union to grant a superannuation allowance to their former midwife, Miss Howard, now Mrs. O'Leary, were not received in this Department until the 3rd ultimo.  The Guardians were then asked to forward to this office the original medical certificate as to the state of her health.  This certificate was received only on the 30th ultimo, and the matter is at present under consideration. <Col N="1079" /> A decision will be arrived at as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what provisions are being made for the old pre-war pensioners of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, having regard to the fact that it was announced in the House of Commons by the Financial Secretary to the British Treasury that the pre-war pensioners of the D.M.P. would not be included in the benefits of the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1924, in consequence of the D.M.P. Department having been handed over to the Saorstát Government, and, if so, whether the Government of the Saorstát will take steps to ensure that the pensions of those pre-war pensioners will be increased commensurate with increases given to the R.I.C. pre-war pensioners and the pre-war pensions of other Departments of the State handed over to the Saorstát Government; also, if he will state by what authority were the pre-war pensioners of the D.M.P. so handed over without their knowledge or consent, and when did such transfer take place.</P>

      <P>As the cost of any increases granted by the British Government under their Pensions (Increase) Act, 1924, is borne entirely out of British funds I regret that I cannot, as suggested by the Deputy, take any steps to ensure that the pre-war Dublin Metropolitan Police pensioners will be granted increases under that Act, but the pensioners themselves are free to make any representation they may desire direct to the British Government. It is not proposed to legislate for similar increases in the case of pensions paid by the Saorstát Government.</P>
      <P>In regard to the last part of the question, the pensions in question, being a part of the Dublin Metropolitan Police Service, were transferred to the Government of the Saorstát under Clause 10 (ii) of the Transfer of Functions Order of the 1st April, 1922.</P>
