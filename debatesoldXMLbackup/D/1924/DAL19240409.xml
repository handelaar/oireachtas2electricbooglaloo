    <Speaker pid="JamesOMara" hpid="Mr. JAMES O'MARA Mr. JAMES O'MARA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMES O'MARA</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether his attention has been called to the fact that the total value of the sea fisheries of the Saorstát in the year 1923 was £211,000; and whether he will consider the abolition of the Ministry of Fisheries with a view either to the relief of the general taxpayer or to the distribution of the £54,000 which the Ministry costs as a 25 per cent. <i>pro rata</i> bonus on the catch-to the fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of fish landed at the principal sea fishing stations in Saorstát for the year 1923 was £211,148.  In addition to this figure, further returns for the year are now being collected in respect of landings at the smaller fishing stations.  This figure does not include the value of salmon and sea-trout caught, which is approximately £250,000.  It is estimated that the value of fish of all kinds produced in Saorstát last year was well over £550,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sea fishing industry during the year 1923 was unprecedently low owing to after effects of the European War, to the disorganisation of our local railways consequent on civil strife, to the continuous stormy weather during the fishing seasons, and to the inability of the fishermen in the South, West and North Coast ports to fit out for the fishing, and also to the lack of enterprise among Irish curers of pickled mackerel, who, at the opening of the autumn mackerel fishing, were deterred from buying the catches by discouraging reports <Col N="2966" /> from interested persons in U.S.A. as to the condition of the American markets.</P>
    <P>These conditions appear to point to the need, if the finances of the State could afford it, for increased rather than restricted governmental action in the interest of what should be one of the most important industries in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the services now administered by this Department include rural industries, and that in the fishery work there are several purely administrative functions discharged, such as policing the waters of Saorstát, and scientific research work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is evident there is a tax of something like 3s. in the £ on the fishing industry in the Saorstát, would the Minister make an effort to induce the staff of his Department to make an effort to justify their existence either scientifically or commercially?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask whether the policing of the fisheries falls under the Home Affairs Department or under the Department of Defence in the case of trawlers coming into the waters of the Saorstát?

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to the destruction of trees in Bray and Delgany, and in other beauty spots of Ireland; if he will take steps to prevent further cutting down of trees for private gain; and if he will see that no person is allowed to remove or cut down trees unless they plant two for every one removed, as is done in other countries.</P>

      <P>The Department's attention has been drawn to the cutting down of trees in various parts of the country, but under the existing law no action can be taken by the Department unless the person responsible for the cutting has rendered himself liable to prosecution under Section 32 of the Irish Land Act of 1909, which provides for the Department's sanction being obtained under certain specified conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation for the provision of powers to prevent indiscriminate felling and destruction of woodlands is contemplated, though to my mind, it is not extremely urgent, but the prohibition of timber felling, when this forms part of normal forestry operations, and is carried out with a view to the replanting of the land cleared of timber, is not proposed.  It is not considered that a regulation for the planting of two trees for every one removed would necessarily lead to the results desired. Similar measures formerly adopted in other countries are now regarded as obsolete, and have been replaced by laws which have for their object the general <Col N="2976" /> upkeep of woods and plantations and the encouragement of planting by private owners.  It is hoped that a measure having these objects in view will be brought before the Dáil as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to ask the leave of the Dáil to introduce the Bill of which I have given notice.  The Bill is one to improve the position of tenants of certain houses, shops and other buildings in Saorstát Eireann.  The short title is the Town Tenants Bill. The main object of this Bill is to apply the principle of the Land Act of 1881 to tenancies other than agricultural ones.  The main principles of that Act are familiar to everyone in this country, namely, fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent, and the object of this Bill is to ameliorate the existing hardships and to remedy the long-felt need of the tenants in the towns.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to apply to all contracts of tenancy from week to week and upwards, and in that way to enlarge the scope of the existing Town Tenants Act.  It will include all classes of holdings, namely, dwellinghouses, shops and other buildings, or parts of buildings, and for the information of the House I may say it does not intend to apply to existing leaseholds.  It will not be until the expiration of existing leaseholds that this proposed Bill will apply to them.</P>
      <P>There is a small amount of public expenditure involved in this Bill, but it is very small, and it is only for the purpose of the setting up of a Town Tenants Commission, consisting, as it is proposed, of a Chief Commissioner and three Sub-commissioners, on the lines of the Land Commission.  I do not think it will be necessary for me to say any more on the subject at this stage, and I ask permission to have the Bill printed and circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I see in connection with that point is, that a contract for additional work might be given before the actual contract is made for the housing.  The whole question of registration is raised for the first time on this section, and I think those engaged in the industry will require a little more information with regard to registration than is conveyed in this amendment.  It is a point that was not raised in Committee when the Bill was going through the Dáil.  I think some <Col N="2989" /> more information and a regulation of some sort will be necessary if this section is to be made operative and useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to cover cases of contracts made before or concurrently with the passing of the Act, there is a proviso that a copy of the contract be supplied to the Minister within a fortnight from the date of its passing or within a fortnight from the date upon which such contract has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say that a copy of the contract be supplied to the Minister. It is all very well to supply copies of contracts after the passing of the Act.  The point I want to make is that one does not know when this will apply and when it will not apply.  A contract may be made for housing, but it may not be accepted.  It may be accepted at a subsequent date.  Then, apparently, if the registration of the original contract on which that housing contract was made is not made and registered in a proper way, it does not become operative.  I, therefore, see great difficulty in the working of this section, unless there is some regulation made whereby there will be an arrangement for regularising these registrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, I think, to some extent because of objections raised here by Deputy Good that Senator Haughton put down this particular amendment in the Seanad. Whatever degree of security there was previous to this amendment being put down in the Seanad, it has certainly been very much improved by this amendment, so that, as far as Deputy Good is concerned, I think this particular amendment is an advance, and to some extent meets a good deal of the criticism urged against this particular section on the Committee stage. If it has not gone far enough, I do not know that without defeating Section 8 altogether it would have been possible to have gone any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment now introduced is certainly an improvement on Section 8.  This section, when it left the Dáil, was a hopeless proposal, and I think it is rendered somewhat <Col N="2990" /> less hopeless by the introduction of this amendment.  With that object I want to try and make the section a workable measure.  Under the section as it stands at present there is no arrangement at all for registration. Provision is made in this section for registration, and what I want to secure is that some regulation may be made so that registration will become a part of the scheme.  If it only appears in this section for the first time, and no regulation is made, contractors and those engaged in the industry will be in some difficulty to know how to act, so that this particular protection that the President refers to may become operative.</P>

      <P>There appears to be an implicit suggestion here that the Minister for Defence shall be responsible direct to the Dáil.  I do not <Col N="2993" /> know if it is intended to place the Minister for Defence in a different position from that of any other Minister belonging to the Executive Council, or what the effect of the explicit statement&mdash;that the Minister for Defence be responsible to the Dáil&mdash;exactly would be.</P>

      <P>There is no change in the position.  It does not affect the position of the Minister, because if he is, as he presumably will be, a member of the Executive Council, the section simply says that there is nothing to derogate from his responsibility, which is the collective responsibility of the Dáil.  As a matter of fact, the substitution of &ldquo;Dáil&rdquo; for &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; was to have been made here, but through some slip it was not actually inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in these two amendments.&rdquo; They go together. The word &ldquo;military&rdquo; is put in there to distinguish as between, say, the Minister for Defence and the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is really meant for the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General and the Chief of Staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the second of these amendments, I am not quite clear as to whether its insertion would mean that an officer who had acted as Chief of Staff for a period of three years, and was, because of that, a member of the Defence Council, could be transferred to the position of Quartermaster-General, and thereby be left as a member of the Defence Council for a period of perhaps longer than three years.  It does seem to me advisable that you would be able to do that if you desired to make the best possible use of certain officers in certain circumstances, and I think it would be inadvisable <Col N="2994" /> if the clause prevented you from doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The only effect of it is that an officer is a member of the Army Council with a limit of three years.  He would then revert to his military position, and he might subsequently go back in some other capacity into the Army Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to make plain is that in the case of an officer who had acted for three years in the position of Chief of Staff, with the experience gained in that position, it might be very advisable, in making a change, that that officer, instead of returning to the Army proper, would become Quartermaster-General or Adjutant-General. If he had shown himself to be a man of particular ability he would have influenced matters to a certain extent in the Chief of Staff's Department, and have had to do with the work of co-ordination arising as between the Chief of Staff's, the Adjutant-General's and the Quartermaster-General's Departments. Both the Adjutant-General's Department and the Quartermaster-General's Department Minister to the responsibility of the machine; that is, a regular military machine should be worked in accordance with the ideas of the Chief of Staff in war time, and it would be most advisable that you would not prevent yourself, by legislation, from passing a Chief of Staff direct to the position of Adjutant-General or of Quartermaster-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the period of three years he may, of course, move about from one of these offices to another within the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite possible, but it is also quite possible that a man might spend his full three years in one of these administrative capacities and that it might be advisable to transfer him direct to another of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Mulcahy rather agreed to a limitation being placed upon the period during which a soldier might be allowed to retain one of these offices and thereby be a member of the Council of Defence, <Col N="2995" /> the Army Council.  The result of the suggestion he is now making might well mean permanence, because there might be a continual rotation of the same three men.  That might be a very good thing&mdash;I am not arguing against it&mdash;it would be quite possible and perhaps reasonable, if this section had not been put in at all.  The whole section seems to me to be very well worthy of reconsideration in view of recent developments, but certainly the view taken previously was that there should be some limitation upon the period during which a member of the Army Council should retain his position on that Council.  Unless some limitation of this kind is inserted there might be a continual rotation and there might be a permanent holding of one of these offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention in putting in this amendment was that, first of all, three officers, however competent, capable or experienced, would not become what we call indispensable institutions, and that while there are enormous advantages to be gained through a good deal of experience and great administrative ability, one must consider that sooner or later one or other of these officers, or perhaps all three, may have to leave their positions. It was not intended, I think, that those three officers would come into office on a particular date and leave office three years exactly from that date; and it was certainly intended that while functioning in the ordinary way in their capacity as members of the Defence Council, they themselves would leave these offices, and enjoy some of the administrative institutions or regulations that they themselves drew up.  In that way greater experience might have been learned by them when again they would take up these offices of Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General, or Chief of Staff, and to that extent I think that the section as amended is better than it was as it left the Dáil. There is a limitation, and opportunities will be afforded to the Minister for Defence of getting other officers <Col N="2996" /> to take up these responsible positions as time goes on.  It would not be necessary to change the whole three at first.  A period might be given for a change, and it would be advisable, in the event of our ever having a war period, to have a number of officers capable of taking up the administrative duties of this particular Council, without giving a jolt to the administrative machinery of the Ministry of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it then what is intended is that an officer shall not be a member of the Council of Defence, in whatever capacity, for a period longer than three years continuously? I would like also if it could be made clear that this arrangement is not made because anybody who previously held any of the offices mentioned in the section developed any idea of proprietorship.  A statement has been made in the Press, as from the Attorney-General, speaking in the Seanad, that it was consequent upon a danger of people developing proprietary ideas that this clause is brought in. The utility of the clause is that it gives rotation of duties, and whatever may be said about the danger, personally I feel very keenly that a statement like that should be made, and I protest very much against the suggestion.  It is strong evidence of the dope that has permeated the discussions, and what went before the discussions, of the last month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">

      <P>As a matter of personal explanation, what I suggested in the Seanad, according to the best of my recollection&mdash;I have not read the Official Report&mdash;was that the intention of the amendment was to permit of rotation, and to see that a number of persons gained this experience. I believe I did use a phrase as to anyone acquiring a sense of proprietorship, but I want absolutely to disclaim any intention of having referred to, or having in mind, any particular individual or individuals.  If I had such an idea I would be prejudging other matters, but I certainly had no person in mind.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 4, which is as follows:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) the words &ldquo;the Minister for Finance&rdquo; deleted in line 21 and the following words inserted in lieu thereof &ldquo;an independent assessor nominated by the President and named in the public notice aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a more substantial one than the others.  It was inserted to meet an objection in the Seanad to the procedure by which the Minister for Finance, having obtained a stop order from a District Justice, could, on his own responsibility, confiscate funds in the absence of evidence being produced rebutting the presumption that the funds were the proceeds of stolen property, or were, in fact, themselves stolen funds.  It was urged that the Courts could be brought into the matter and it should only be done after such presumption had been withheld by the District Justice.  Personally, I see grave objection to identifying the Courts with this procedure at all, which is, in fact, a procedure of confiscation on strong presumption, but still on something short of legal proof.  Clearly it would be objectionable to establish a <Col N="3002" /> precedent of the Courts being involved in that kind of action.  When we decided that it was necessary in the interests of the State, for instance, to arrest, detain, and intern people on something short of legal proof, we did not ask the Courts to throw their sanction over that matter.  Similarly, I saw objection to asking the Courts to sanction a confiscation that would take place on something short of full legal evidence which would, in effect, be based on very strong presumption.  There was that conflict of view, and to meet it an amendment was inserted stating that the Minister for Finance shall not act entirely on his own judgment and responsibility in the matter, but shall act on the advice of an independent assessor, nominated by the President and named in the public notice.  That amendment was accepted by those in the Seanad who were urging that the Minister for Finance should not be placed in what was a <i>quasi</i> judicial position.  I move the amendment, and there are certain consequential amendments to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I just draw attention to what seems to me to be a very thin line of demarcation between the court and a person who holds judicial office.  Theoretically there is an important distinction, but when the Minister raises objections to allowing the court to be the instrument of confiscation of property, and says that he is prepared to name the assessor, who is to be a person holding judicial office, the average man in the street would not be quite able to see the distinction and would almost suggest that the person to be appointed assessor ought to be the man in the street, and not a judicial person at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 25th April. I would like to state, with reference to certain undertakings which I gave on the previous stage, that I promised to consider whether the amount, £15, ought not to be increased.</P>
      <P>I would not like Deputies to assume that because there is no amendment put down dealing with the matter that it was not looked into.  I did consider it and discuss the matter, and have come to the conclusion that it is neither necessary nor advisable to increase the amount because, in fact, no under-sheriff sails at all close to the mark in making a seizure.  It is never a matter of actually seizing down to the pennyworth or shilling's-worth of the £15, and the £15 in the law as it stands is an adequate margin having regard to the fact that it is never just a question of that exact sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave one other undertaking in connection with an amendment which Deputy Heffernan was pressing, dealing with the matter of third party claims. I looked into that also, and directed that Deputy Heffernan would be notified that I was not putting down any amendment.  I am afraid the notification may possibly have reached the Deputy after the time for accepting amendments had expired.  If that is so, and the Deputy has an amendment which he wishes to move, I would ask that the Standing Orders be not rigidly applied against him.  I looked into the matter, and I am standing over the section as it is; and I do not see that there is room for an amendment.  Any kind of an amendment that would be proposed to it would simply mean that the section might as well be deleted from the Bill, and it is considered a very important section.  I am not moving an amendment, and would oppose any amendment moved: but, in view of the <Col N="3006" /> promise given to the Deputy, I would ask that the Deputy's amendment, if moved, should be considered and discussed.</P>

If the Minister says it is outside thinking that an under-sheriff would go to the limit of £15, it seems to me a pity that the public should imagine that the Dáil is prepared to take a man's clothing up to the limit of £15, but that an under-sheriff would not think of doing such a thing.</P>

      <Col N="3007" /> Main question again proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil declines to proceed with the motion pending a full explanation of the policy of the Executive Council in respect to the relations of the Saorstát with Great Britain and the other States members of the British Commonwealth of Nations; and between the Saorstát and States not members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The course of the discussion that took place last week made it apparent to the Dáil, and the public generally, that the mind of the Ministry regarding the relations between Saorstát Eireann and other States is not very clear.  To my mind, it made it necessary that an opportunity should be given to the Dáil to discuss in a general way the position of the Free State in relation to Great Britain and other States comprising the British Commonwealth, and to States outside that community of nations.  I think it is not unfair to say that the discussion rather showed what has been a growing conviction to many, that the Ministry has not been standing for the full value of the Treaty between Ireland and Great Britain.  It has been growing in the minds of some of us that the Ministry has been allowing things to go by default, and has neither recognised the value to the Free State that resides in the Treaty, or has been prepared to concede a milder and less valuable interpretation of that Treaty, which may have been put forward in other quarters.  Consequently, I think the necessity has arisen for a discussion on this matter, with a view to finding out, if possible, the mind of the Executive Council in these affairs.  I am risking the censure of Deputy Magennis, who might well say to me that difficulties, dangers, and perhaps evil results, might arise, as they usually arise, when the uninitiated deal with technical questions.  I am going to risk that, notwithstanding the censure on Deputy Wilson when he, as one not pretending to be initiated, attempted to deal with technical questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My resolve to raise this matter in a general way was clear when, <Col N="3008" /> on Saturday morning, there was placed in my hand a passport that had been issued on the 4th day of April, 1924.  It was issued to a member of Dáil Eireann&mdash;a Deputy of this House &mdash;in the name of George Nathaniel Marquis Curzon, of Kedleston.  It states: &ldquo;Passport&mdash;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; national status: British subject by birth; profession: legislator; born: Ireland; domiciled: United Kingdom.&rdquo; And at the end of that passport book &mdash;which, by the way, was printed in London on the 15th March, 1923, showing that it was a compilation after the passing of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;there is a notification that &ldquo;residents in the Irish Free State should make their applications through the Passport Department, Ministry of Home Affairs, Dublin, and residents of Northern Ireland through the Passport Department, Ministry of Home Affairs, Belfast.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was more than a surprise to me, because, six months ago, I had issued to me a passport which set out &ldquo;Irish Free State&mdash;We, Timothy Healy, one of His Majesty's Counsel, Governor-General of the Irish Free State, requests and requires, in the name of his Britannic Majesty, all those whom it may concern to allow ...................... to pass freely ...............

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is to apply to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Passport Office, Dublin Castle, and the passport is sent from England by post. That, as I say, indicates a very considerable relapse from the status of citizenship of an independent nation, co-equal with other nations within the British Commonwealth, and it requires some explanation.  I understand that there has been, as a matter of fact, since the 4th April, a decision to issue passports in the same manner as they were issued in October last.  But it is evident that some interference has occurred in the policy regarding passports that was taken in October or September last.  It is because of that sign of weakness, failure to take the maximum benefit out of the Treaty, that I want to raise this matter in the fullest possible way.  I fear that it is one sign of many signs which point to the same weakness and failure to make the most of the Treaty.  I take, as another illustration, the failure to ensure the setting up of the Boundary Commission before now.  I understand, of course, that Ministers have made explanations that they have been pressing, explanations of a kind have been made here which for the time satisfied the Dáil, but one cannot avoid the feeling, or refrain from expressing it, that there has been a weakness on the part of the Executive Council in pressing the advantages which the Treaty gave.  Take even the expression of the Minister for External Affairs in the debate last Friday&mdash;not perhaps a carefully-considered statement, but indicative of what I suggest is rather a loose way of thinking of the status of Saorstát Eireann.  The discussion was one around titles.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The relationship of Ireland comes in the later part&mdash;British Dominions beyond the Seas.  It is as British Dominions beyond the Seas we are included, not as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3010" /> Notwithstanding a good deal of popular use of the term, I think we are not justified in speaking of Saorstát Eireann as one of the British Dominions. &ldquo;Dominion,&rdquo; though perhaps it has its new meanings in the Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa, has, as a matter of fact, a suggestion about it of domination&mdash;of superior authority.</P>
    <P>While I think it is true that these States, as well as Canada and New Zealand, have grown out of the Dominion status and the Dominion stage, representing an improvement upon the older Colonial status, we have never rightly been termed a Dominion; we should not be termed a Dominion, and it is unwise and retrogressive on the part of any authority in this country to speak of the Saorstát as a Dominion.  It has been very forcibly stated by, I think, originally, Mr. Michael Collins, and quoted by Mr. Lloyd George, as a very trenchant and formidable argument on behalf of Ireland, that Ireland was a mother country.  The two ideas of Dominion which arise out of Colonial status, and Ireland as a Free State, are not at all fitting one with the other. There is nothing in the Treaty, and nothing in the Constitution, to justify us in speaking of Ireland as a Dominion. Undoubtedly our position is novel and without parallel, but none the less important and strong.  I assert that the position of Saorstát Eireann is not that of a Dominion, but that which its name implies, a Free State representing a mother country, equal in status with Great Britain also as a mother country. I say that Ireland is a Free State which, within the community of nations known as the British Empire, has the same constitutional status as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa.  It is coequal with all the nations forming the British Commonwealth, including Great Britain.  If that is our position, as I maintain it is, it is the duty of the Executive Council of the Free State, of the Oireachtas, and of every citizen to maintain that position on every possible occasion.</P>
    <P>The Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland was entered into, not as <Col N="3011" /> satisfying Irish aspirations.  It was accepted. It was a Treaty signed by two delegations from the two contracting parties.  It was signed by persons acting as delegations.  When we speak of the British delegation and of the Irish delegation we thereby signify that there was a delegating authority. When that agreement stated that Ireland was to have the same constitutional status in the community of nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, and the Commonwealth of Australia, it did not say that Ireland was a Dominion, but that within that commonwealth, that community of nations, Ireland should have that status; that Ireland should be styled and known as the Irish Free State; that Ireland should have a Parliament with powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland, and an Executive responsible to that Parliament.  That is the governing Article of the Treaty.  A Constitution was passed by a Provisional Government that had to be read in conjunction with the Treaty. In so far as it was repugnant to the Treaty it was invalid.  There was a Parliament to be established, or at least one having power to make laws was provided for under Section 1, and the Executive was to be responsible to that Parliament.  A Parliament was established in accordance with the Constitution and in accordance with the Treaty. The Constitution, before establishing that Parliament, declared that &ldquo;all powers of Government and all authority, legislative, executive, and judicial, in Ireland are derived from the people of Ireland, and the same shall be exercised through the organisations established by or in accord with this Constitution.&rdquo; The Parliament was established, all the powers being derived from the people of Ireland.  The Executive Authority&mdash;the &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; which is to be responsible to the Parliament, according to the Treaty&mdash; is said, in Article 51 of the Constitution, to be vested in the King.  The King was to be advised by the Executive Council, which Executive Council was to be responsible to Dáil Eireann.  From that I say it is very clear that the Crown&mdash; that the King, if you like to speak of <Col N="3012" /> the King as the Constitution does&mdash;has to be advised by the Executive Council, and is responsible to the Parliament set up in the Treaty, and not to any other Parliament in this community of nations.</P>
    <P>That being the case, we are justified &mdash;nay, we are bound&mdash;to assert the authority of Saorstát Eireann in all matters connected with external affairs as well as internal affairs.  We have not any right to accept a position of subordination in any degree to any other authority than that set out under the Treaty and the Constitution.  I say that the evidence of that passport issued by Nathaniel, Marquis Curzon of Keddleston, is of a retrogressive movement, and is not taking full advantage of our position and authority.</P>

      <P>It was applied for last Monday week.  Now, it may be said, and quite pertinently, that the law and practice and constitutional usage of Canada in respect to the relations between the Oireachtas of Saorstát Eireann and the Crown are to be applied.  I take it that in the matter of political treaties the Ministry has paid deference to what it may urge is the practice and constitutional usage of Canada.  We were all made aware in recent years of the fact that constitutional usage cannot be defined very accurately as something that is fixed; it is quite variable and grows and develops.  In the matter of treaties I submit that constitutional usage and practice, as defined by Mr. McKenzie King, in the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada last week, is eloquent, and of great importance.  The subject in question was a treaty which had been signed at Lausanne in reference to Turkey, and I propose to read an extract which purports to be from the Hansard Report of the Canadian House of Commons.  The extract is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;We were asked shortly before the present Session of Parliament whether the Government would signify its concurrence with the ratification of the Treaty and Conventions in question. We take the position that, not having been invited to the Lausanne Conference, and not having been represented there, and not having, for <Col N="3013" /> the reason I have mentioned, signed the Treaty, the Treaty does not impose any obligations on Canada, and the parts of the Empire on which it does impose obligations are the only parts that should be expected to sign and ratify it.  As we do not regard the Treaty as imposing obligations on Canada, we do not feel it necessary to submit the Treaty to Parliament for its approval, or in its name to signify concurrence with its ratification.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In saying this we made it quite clear again that with respect to the course pursued by the Lausanne Conference we had no exception to take to the procedure followed.  However, we pointed out it must be apparent, quite apart from any action or representations on the part of the Government of Canada, that a different procedure had been followed at Lausanne from that followed at Versailles and Washington, namely, direct representation and participation by duly authorised plenipotentiaries, formal signing by Canadian representatives approved by Parliament and the assent of His Majesty on behalf of Canada.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to know whether in the negotiations of any of those treaties, and particularly of the treaty which has been the subject of discussion, Saorstát Eireann made any appointments or gave any authorisation to any plenipotentiary to conduct negotiations; whether they were specifically informed that Saorstát interests had been or were affected; and whether they were informed day by day by telegram of the course of the discussion.  Were they also informed in regard to the discussions and negotiations in respect to the Lausanne Treaty, or is it acknowledged by all the other nations comprising the community of nations known as the British Empire&mdash;including Great Britain&mdash;that Saorstát Eireann is not affected and has no obligation under the Lausanne Treaty?  In the course of the discussion in the British House of Commons last week the Prime Minister said: &ldquo;During negotiations telegrams were sent every day to the Dominions and to India.&rdquo;  He then went on to say: &ldquo;The Irish Free State had no difficulty...&rdquo; There was an interruption <Col N="3014" /> there.  The sentence was not finished, and we do not know what was in the mind of the British Prime Minister when he said that the Irish Free State had no difficulty.  Was he going to say that they had no difficulty in giving their assent to the signature?  Has the Executive Council given any assent to the ratification of the Lausanne Treaty? Has it been consulted?  Has it considered all the implications and obligations, or has it been consulted and declined to give its consent to the ratification? Has the British Government been informed that as the Irish Free State is not concerned with the defence of the Straits, or other matters arising out of the conventions of that Lausanne Treaty, that &ldquo;we are not signing and that we are not assenting?  We are expressing no opinion, and we declare ourselves unbound by any such Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We ought to know what the attitude of the Executive Council is in regard to that Treaty and also in regard to any other Treaties which have been made in the name of the United Kingdom, and whether they have formally protested with all the other nations comprising the British Commonwealth of nations, against using this term, &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; as binding Saorstát Eireann? If they have not done that, if there has been no formal protest, if there has been no formal renunciation, then we shall be held to be bound by Treaties of the kind that have been entered into, and we shall be held to be in honour pledged to the fulfilment of any undertakings that may have been entered into.  I am anxious to know, for the credit of Saorstát Eireann, whether, first, the Executive Council has been duly informed of all these negotiations in these matters, or whether they have made it clear that they are under no obligation in regard to any Treaty which they have not formally signed, and that no Treaty has been signed on behalf of Saorstát Eireann, no trading agreement has been made unless the formal appointment of plenipotentiaries or negotiators has been made by the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  It may be said in regard to this Lausanne Treaty that it <Col N="3015" /> was a Treaty of Peace, and that the negotiations began at a date before the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann was passed.  The first Conference was held, and adjourned after a short time, in November, 1922, but a new Conference began in April after Saorstát Eireann had been formally established.  Unless there has been a clear understanding in regard to Saorstát Eireann's position in respect to Treaties, there ought to have been some communications made day by day, and the Dáil should have been informed of what the attitude of the Government has been.  Similarly in regard to the Liquor Treaty, I want to know whether formal appointments were made of any plenipotentiary to negotiate on behalf of Saorstát Eireann. I am not satisfied that all the requirements have been fulfilled by the mere discussion and acquiescence of an Imperial Conference or the reporting of the accomplished fact.  I read in the summary of the proceedings of that Imperial Conference certain resolutions respecting Treaties drawn up by a Committee of which the Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State was a member, and finally agreed upon by the Conference, which contains a paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before negotiations are opened with the intention of concluding a Treaty, steps should be taken to ensure whether any of the other Governments of the Empire likely to be interested are informed, or that if any such Government considers its interests will be affected it may have an opportunity of expressing its views, or when its interests are intimately involved, of participating in the negotiations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was this Liquor Treaty one which the Government of Saorstát Eireann considered intimately involved the interests of the Saorstát?  Presumably that is their view now, inasmuch as they bring forward for approval these Articles of Agreement.  If that were the case, then it was essentially for the fulfilment of this resolution of general agreement that the Saorstát should have been participating in the negotiations. May we be informed whether as a matter of fact, the Saorstát did <Col N="3016" /> participate in the negotiations, and were the participants appointed by the Saorstát?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as opposing or criticising adversely the proposed Liquor Treaty.  Time will come for discussion upon that when the matter is formally before us.  I believe, as a matter of fact, that it is very desirable that we should make clear to the United States of America that an agreement, having for its object the prohibition of irregular traffic in intoxicating liquor into the United States, should be arrived at between this country and the United States. I further believe that we ought to intimate to the United States Government that we rather favour the extension of the limit of territorial waters: that we are not satisfied that the Article which speaks of a three-mile limit is satisfactory to all concerned&mdash; that the matter will be discussed at a later stage.  I am not making this point about the negotiation of the Treaty in any spirit hostile to the Liquor Treaty.  I want to make sure that the Government of Saorstát Eireann did participate in the negotiations or that if they did not that they were kept informed day by day of the course of the negotiations, and that they have disagreed formally with the terms of the Preamble and the assumption that the United Kingdom is a State entity of which Saorstát Eireann forms a part.</P>
    <P>Another point that I want to draw information upon is whether any treaties, in which the Saorstát is involved, have been agreed to by the Government since the passing of the Constitution.  If there have been any such agreements, either Treaties or Trade Conventions or agreements, what are they and why have they not been submitted to the Dáil, and whether it is the view of the Executive Council that the Dáil is not concerned except to agree and bear the cost, if any cost is ever involved?  I take the view&mdash;it is coming to be the settled practice, I think, in Great Britain&mdash;that all treaties, and not only formal treaties, but all agreements, commitments and undertakings which may involve international obligation of a serious character, <Col N="3017" /> even though no signed and sealed documents may exist, should be laid before the Oireachtas.  I want to know from the Minister for External Affairs, or from the President, whether that also is his view, and whether that is the view of the Executive Council, and if not, what objection they have to laying before the Oireachtas the text of all agreements, commitments, or undertakings which they may have entered into.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask for information in regard to the relations of the Saorstát with other States outside of Britain which are members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Has the Government entered upon any direct negotiations with the Government of Canada, South Africa, or Australia? Have we any representative, for instance, in Ottawa?  I suggest that it is very important, in view of the Constitutional position, that we should have a representative at Ottawa.  I think the Dáil should be informed in regard to such matters as that, and as to what is the view of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>Then going outside this community of nations forming the British Commonwealth, where do we stand with regard to representation in Paris, in Washington, in Moscow, in Berlin, or in any other country?  I think it is not too much to ask the Minister to give the Dáil some information so that we shall know where we stand, and so that we shall have some idea of the place that the Free State occupies in the world's affairs.  When a Treaty or Articles of Agreement for a Treaty, are put before us it immediately brings us face to face with international obligations, and I do not think that we can view in right perspective even a treaty of the kind that is being placed before us without having an understanding of the general position that Ireland occupies in the world of nations.  I think it would not be too much to ask the Minister whether there have been any negotiations of a trade character, let us say, apart from diplomatic, with America, with Canada or Russia.  I see, by the way, that the Canadian Government has intimated to the Government of the Union of Soviet Republics <Col N="3018" /> that they are prepared to recognise that Government and that Union.  It has occurred to me, and I think it is worth pursuing, that Ireland might well derive very great advantages by entering into relations with that Union of Soviet Republics, from a trade point of view.  I think it is possible that the Government of Russia would be prepared to enter into understandings and agreements with the Government of the Irish Free State to supply materials of a kind which this country certainly requires, and to supply them on probably better terms than can be got in any other way, and possibly with very considerable political advantages.  Russia has an immense quantity of timber. Russia some day, if not yet, will be an exporter of flax, and I am not unhopeful that the Government of Saorstát Eireann would be able to conclude an agreement whereby all flax coming from Russia to Ireland would come through the agency of the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  That might have very considerable political consequences, and it is well worth while for the Executive Council to try whether some such arrangement could not be arrived at.</P>
    <P>The term that is applied to citizens of the Irish Free State in the British passports is &ldquo;British subject&rdquo;; the term that is applied in the Irish passport is &ldquo;citizens of the Irish Free State.&rdquo; That is in a passport issued in October last.</P>
    <P>A good deal of discussion has taken place in regard to the status of citizens. I think I am right in saying that there are no British citizens; they are all British subjects.  The term &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; does not fit in with the constitutional position of residents in England, and I think it well to draw attention to a statement made by the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa in regard to citizenship, inasmuch as it has some relationship to the question of Irish citizenship and constitutional usage.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no equality,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of British citizenship throughout the Empire. On the contrary there is every imaginable difference.  In some parts British subjects have no political <Col N="3019" /> rights whatever; in others they have modified rights of one kind or another; in others again they have the fullest political rights....  There is no common equal `British citizenship in the Empire,' and it is quite wrong for a British subject to claim equality of rights in any part of the Empire to which he has migrated or where he happens to be living....  The newer conception of the British Empire as a smaller league of nations, as a partnership of free and equal nations under a common hereditary Sovereign, involves an even further departure from the simple conception of a unitary citizenship.... Each constituent part of the Empire will settle for itself the nature and incidence of its citizenship. The composition and character and rights of its people will be the concern of each free and equal State in the Empire.... The common kingship is the binding link between the parts of the Empire; it is not a source from which private citizens will derive their rights.  They will derive their rights simply and solely from the authority of the State in which they live.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That last is a paraphrase from the Constitution, you may say, of Saorstát Eireann, and I have pointed out that in that Constitution and under the Treaty all authority, legislative, political and otherwise, is derived from the people of Ireland; that the Government is in the hands of Parliament, with an executive responsibility thereto; that the Executive authority is vested in the King acting under the advice of the Executive Council, that the King is responsible under the Treaty to Parliament, and I make the assertion that as we assert these rights of equality, other nations within the British Commonwealth will realise that their rights are also equal to ours and that there will be, in fact, a community of free nations, and that it is a Free State, and no Dominion, in which we live.  I think that there has been failure on the part of the Executive Government to assert that position.  I think that in failing to maintain the fullest possible status which was accepted as something short of what was fought for, but as acceptable in the circumstances, and under <Col N="3020" /> the pressure of greater force, we ought to make the best of it as we said we should do, but to be quite certain all the time that while we were making the best of it we were not going short of the best.  I think it may be found that they builded better than they knew, and that some at least on one side gave away more than they were aware of but if we fail to maintain that position we are failing doubly because we are failing, and have failed, to give citizens in this country the advantage which they would have had of the material and social kind had there been no political freedom granted or obtained or secured.  If we are not going to maintain the fullest political rights, and if it had been said we have given away some of our rights in that matter because we are going to maintain all the advantage appertaining to residence in a big industrial country and a wealthy country, that we are going to improve the pensions instead of reducing them, that we are going to enlarge the provisions regarding workmen's compensation, regarding unemployment insurance and the like, then one could have understood it, but if we are going to give away both political rights and these other social benefits, then we are in a very bad state indeed.</P>
    <P>And I would urge upon the Dáil that we are bound to insist upon the Executive Council taking the last particle of value out of the Treaty and asserting in every possible way the freedom from intervention and the full value of the status within that British Commonwealth that was secured.  I think one might fairly argue, without over-forcing, that there is a status outside the British Commonwealth for Saorstát Eireann which does not appertain to any Dominion within the British Commonwealth, but I am not pressing that now.  I feel, however, that it is due to the Dáil to have a full statement of the position internationally, a full statement of the relations between the Government here, the Government in Britain, the Government in Canada, and the Government in every nation of the British community of States, and I would ask that in future the Dáil should be made aware, frequently and <Col N="3021" /> fully, of all negotiations in regard to treaties, and that no treaty should be approved and no agreement entered into unless and until the Dáil has had an opportunity of criticising or rejecting it.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment which Deputy Johnson has put down.  I am very glad that he has raised this whole question.  I think it is high time that this general question was raised.  The present period of depression and, if I may say so, of self-depreciation in this country will not last for ever, and already there are signs that people are looking for some kind of vigorous direction, some kind of leadership from the Government which can inspire them with confidence in that Government. I do not see how the nation can have any confidence in the Government if the Government has no confidence in itself.  We have reached the stage when the clouds of the civil war of the last two years are clearing  and it is high time, I think, that we should take stock of our position, not only as to the policy which is to be pursued in the immediate future, but as to the possibilities and probabilities of the future in general. Deputy Johnson's motion is, I think, very well worded.  It deals with the relations of the Saorstát to Great Britain and the other States of the Commonwealth, and with States not members of the Commonwealth.  I presume that it includes all our relations with these States.  He has raised questions affecting not only public international law, but private international law as affecting this State. Public international law deals with the rights and the duties of States, one with another; private international law deals with the rights and duties and the property of individual citizens of those States.  The status of this country is a matter of public international law; the status of an Irish citizen is a matter for private international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has raised the question of all our relations with these States, and he has raised the question of what exactly is the status of this <Col N="3022" /> country with regard to the outside world.  Have we any right to have any relations whatsoever with any other State?&mdash;that is the question which has to be raised on this amendment.  As far as I am concerned, I entirely agree with the interpretation of our status under that Treaty as it was expressed by one of the Ministers in this Dáil when he advocated the acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty before the Dáil in the Treaty debates of 1921-22.  You will find it in page 63 of the Official Reports. He said: &ldquo;I say again, under the letter of that document&mdash;that is, the Treaty&mdash;we have a legal sanction for sovereign status if we have the pluck and the nerve to go and take it up.&rdquo; The question which Deputy Johnson has raised is whether the Executive Council have had that pluck and nerve.  That is the question that we have to discuss on this amendment.  It is admitted that the status of a Dominion, the status of Canada, cannot be defined accurately, but, as far as I have been able to discover from a perusal of the main authorities, the main jurists who have considered this question, there are certain points on which they are in general agreement.  As far as international law is concerned, it has been generally agreed by modern jurists that Saorstát Eireann is an international person with all the implications of that term; it has been generally agreed that Saorstát Eireann is an independent subject of international law.  Perhaps the Dáil will pardon me if I quote in that connection the views of a very eminent jurist, M. Bluntschli.  In article 40 of his work on international law, he says: &ldquo;There can be no doubt that the Dominions are persons in international law&rdquo;; and on page 321 of the very latest work on international law by the greatest living French authority, M. Paul Fauchille, we find the following statement: &ldquo;Seeing that the Dominions have been called upon to participate directly and individually in the elaboration and in the signature of acts of high international politics, and seeing that they have been admitted into the organised nations, it seems there can be no-doubt that these Dominions must henceforth be qualified as persons in international law.&rdquo;  We have to consider in <Col N="3023" /> this connection what effect upon our status is involved in the fact that we have been admitted formally as a member of the organised family of nations; that is to say, what international lawyers describe as such, meaning the League of Nations, which does not at present comprise all the States of the world.  In the first place, a necessary and inevitable conclusion of that admission is that the fifty-two other States who compose that League of sovereign States, and that League is, in its absence, a League of sovereign States, has recognised this State as an equal sovereign State.  Secondly, the undertakings and the obligations which we have shouldered on entering that League are obligations which, by their very nature, can only be undertaken and can only be fulfilled by a sovereign State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has drawn attention to the question of our relations with the other members of the Commonwealth. I am not one of those who have any objection to any close connection between Ireland and those young nations, in the actual creation and building up of which Irish brains and Irish courage have played so great a part.  But what the Dáil has a right to know, and this question was also mentioned by Deputy Johnson, is whether in our dealings with these young nations we deal directly as an equal State, or whether we deal with them through the medium of only one of the members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  There is a further question of our relations with the members of the League of Nations, and in this connection I must say that the Executive Council and the Minister are not entirely to blame.  The members of this Dáil are equally to blame, and the members of the Opposition as much as the members of the Government Party.  I sat in the Dáil some weeks ago when, for the first time, the Minister brought forward the Supplementary Estimate for the League of Nations, and not one Deputy took the slightest interest in that Estimate; not one Deputy got up to discuss our position in the League of Nations, and the Estimate was passed in contemptuous silence.  I think it is not only the members of the Government who are responsible <Col N="3024" /> for the position we are in today&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was referring to the estimate of the League of Nations, which was passed in silence.  The impression I got was, that it was contemptuous silence.  Of course every Deputy is entitled to his own opinion. We are not only members of the League of Nations, as members of this Commonwealth, but Saorstát Eireann is essentially also a European country attached to and affected by the economic and political happenings in the Continent of Europe.  We will be glad to know what steps the Government have taken to see that this country takes its proper share in the economic, intellectual, and cultural life of Europe. There is the further question of our relations with the United States of America, where the vast majority of the Irish race are settled.  We have heard little here of our relations with that country, and we would be glad to have further information.  However important may be our relations with the League of Nations, and however important may be the Commonwealth of Nations, there is one institution which, in my opinion, transcends in importance even this vast organisation, and that is the Christian Church. We will be glad to know from the Government what steps they have taken in order to defend the interests of this country as the greatest, certainly one of the greatest, missionary nations in the world.  Deputies are probably aware that bishops, missionaries of this country, administer a portion of the globe far greater than the British Empire, and more than five times the total area of the Continent of Europe. But is it not a fact that the interests of <Col N="3025" /> our missionaries are defended in the centre of Christendom by the British Minister at the Vatican?  Is that a fact?  We are entitled to know from the Government what it has done to defend the interests of our missionaries all over the world.  This motion of Deputy Johnson refers to the relations of Saorstát Eireann with all those States. I presume he means all the relations, not only political, but also intellectual, commercial, and agricultural.  I can give no other interpretation of the statement, and presumably the Government has taken steps to administer our commercial relations with these countries.  What steps have they taken to develop our commercial relations with these States?  What use has the Ministry of External Affairs been, let us say, to the farming community of this country?  What has the Ministry of External Affairs done to investigate those countries which are rapidly squeezing us out of the markets which we have held for so many years?  What steps has the Minister taken to see that we have capable men in such countries as Denmark, in order to report and keep us informed as to the methods adopted by the people of that country in marketing, transport, and in all those matters which have succeeded in placing Denmark in the position which we ought to occupy, and which we have lost?</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, but I maintain that sport is one of the most important factors in developing international relations at the present time.  Deputy Johnson referred to the question of our status with regard to our representatives <Col N="3026" /> abroad and the failure of the Executive Council to uphold that status.  I understand that when the present Government came into power there were some twelve offices on the Continent of Europe, but as a result of the Herculean efforts of the Minister, those offices have been reduced to four.</P>
      <P>I was addressed a few days ago by a distinguished German, who asked me why we had no representative in his country.  He said that the people in his country had not yet realised that Ireland was a Free State.  I said that there was nothing remarkable in that, as we had Ministers at home who did not yet recognise that fact.  Now, the obvious duties of a representative abroad are to obtain information for all branches of State activities at home, to keep us in touch not only with the latest developments in other countries, but as regards trade, agriculture, public health and other forms of activity, including sport.  There is also a very important matter that ought to appeal to the Minister for Finance, and that is that several countries pay their whole foreign representation by the fees which these foreign representatives obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there are a hundred thousand Irish-Americans coming here this year from America, and they will have to pay £2 10s. for a visa to come here.  The Minister for Finance is going to throw away a quarter of a million pounds in fees which will go to the British Treasury, because the Government does not think it worth while to see that we should have proper representation in New York, and that our representative there should issue visas and obtain fees for them.  I myself have had experience in seven or eight countries in foreign representation, and I have had enough experience to know how necessary it is that Ireland should have a small but efficient foreign representation.  I have also had enough experience to know what are the requirements and qualifications which an Irish representative should possess and which, I admit, I did not possess at the time.  We will be interested to know from the Government what they have done in the matter of upholding our status.  So far as I can <Col N="3027" /> see, in order to uphold the position which we have won, there are many things which ought to have been done, but which have not been done.  In the matter of trade, it is obvious that this country is in the most unhealthy condition of any country in the world.  The commercial independence of a country and, in a large measure, its political independence, depends on the number and variety of its markets.  We have only one market.  I maintain that we should disseminate our trade so that no nation or group of nations can dictate to us what our commercial policy should be, and we should win the preeminent position in the realm of athletics, to which we are entitled by reason of our physique and prowess.</P>

      <P>Our aim should also be to vindicate our right to what Deputy Johnson referred to, to a moral leadership in the Commonwealth to which we belong by reason of our being one of the two mother countries in that Commonwealth, to obtain an adequate place in the Council of the League of Nations, and in the intellectual and cultural life of Europe; to assume a proper position in regard to America, in view of the exceptional circumstances of this country; and, finally, to make the world conscious of the unity of our racial efforts and of the absolutely remarkable work which our people have performed, and are performing, in the world as a great missionary nation. These should be the objects of our international actions and our national purpose, and we will wait with interest to hear from the Government what they have done in order to carry out and to fulfil in this respect the expectations which they raised in the hearts of the people of this nation when they persuaded that nation to accept this State and the status which we now enjoy.</P>

      <P>I may say that I agree with practically all that <Col N="3028" /> has been said by Deputy Johnson, and with a great amount of what has been said by Deputy Esmonde.  I was very glad that Deputy Johnson made the statement he did make, because for the last two years there has been a campaign to belittle the status that this country actually possesses, and in our attempts to assert and to exercise our status that campaign that was carried on here was undoubtedly a very considerable extra difficulty.  Deputy Esmonde refers to the fact that peace has reigned here for the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I do not believe that I stated that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that that was what the Deputy stated, but it does not matter if he did not.  The two points in Deputy Johnson's statement to which I take exception are his saying that last Friday's debate made it apparent that the mind of the Ministry was not clear in the matter of its relations with foreign States, and that the Executive Council was not standing for the full benefit of the Treaty, and was apparently inclined to take a milder and less valuable interpretation of it.  The Deputy deduced these two things from facts which are indicative of the contrary.  The first fact that he adduced that from was that whereas last year, when the Deputy, as an official delegate to an international body, was travelling, he travelled with an Irish passport, whereas last week somebody got an English passport.  It would have been quite possible for us to have continued issuing passports generally, as we issued them only to people going abroad on actual business.  It would have been possible to continue issuing them had we been prepared not to push things forward, but to be content with such portion of our international sovereignty as has, so far, been exercised by those countries which are generally referred to as the Dominions. It was because we were not prepared to stand still that we did not issue passports earlier than we did.  The passport given to Deputy Johnson was an Irish passport describing him as a citizen of the Irish Free State.  We <Col N="3029" /> gave that to Deputy Johnson, as to ourselves, for definite work, and because we knew that the mission he was going on was sufficient to prevent him suffering any inconvenience by having that passport at that time, because we wanted the bearers of Irish passports to have full consideration and all the amenities, and all the ease, that are enjoyed by the bearers of passports. We actually delayed the issue of passports because we were not satisfied with the exact form of the passports issued to citizens of these other countries of the British Commonwealth.  That was the reason of the delay.  The Deputy said that the passport was issued on the 4th, but that was because it was applied for at an earlier date.  Since Wednesday, Irish people applying for passports receive Irish passports, but the very fact that the Deputy adduces to prove that we were not standing for the full and most complete interpretation of our status, was actually due to the fact that we were fighting and were not prepared to yield on a point upon which we felt that there was a diminution of the status which we have acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one thing, and another thing I gathered was that the Deputy thought we were not pressing our full status owing to the fact that we had not a representative to sign the Liquor Treaty in Washington.  That comes from the fact that this country is in the forefront and has pushed on more than any other country.  The reason, I agree, that we would not send a special representative from here to sign the Liquor Treaty, was because at that moment the full accrediting of an Irish representative in Washington was already in hands, and because I had already some assurance that there would be no difficulty put in the way of the full accrediting of our representative there. Deputies know with regard to Canada's right to an accredited representative in Washington that it was conceded, but actually that right has not been exercised by Canada.  I hope that within a month or within a very short time Ireland will be the first member of the British Commonwealth of Nations other than England to have a fully accredited <Col N="3030" /> representative at Washington.  It was because that matter was in hands and because I had no doubt whatever of its coming into operation in a short time that I did not insist on our undoubted right to have a representative at Washington to sign that Treaty on our behalf. I say the very facts from which the Deputy adduced his conclusion that this Government was not standing for the full interpretation of the Treaty were actually indicative, on the contrary, that this Government more than any other Government in our position, has been maintaining this status we now possess.  The status we possess lacks a certain amount of definition. Before we took over this status there were other countries who arrived at it by a system of growth.  Before we took it over, that growth had arrived at a pitch where it was rightly asserted&mdash;it was asserted by Mr. Bonar Law years ago&mdash;that between the nations of the British Commonwealth there was full equality.  That point had been arrived at when we actually took our place as a co-equal member of that Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>It is true that because Great Britain was the first of those countries to exercise full sovereignty the machinery is not quite up to date.  The machinery, I may say, does throw us back a bit prior to the equality stage.  What was the machinery when we came into existence?  It was practically that all external relations between members of this Commonwealth were exercised by agents and plenipotentiaries appointed by Great Britain, and I believe appointed without reference to the other countries of the Commonwealth.  It is obvious to me that if that system were to continue it would necessitate that before an Ambassador or Minister plenipotentiary were appointed to act, that the various Governments of the Commonwealth should be asked if they concurred in the appointment of such an individual.  I do not believe that has been done so far, but, as I say, the right of this country to have direct relations not only with the States, members of the Commonwealth, but with the States not members of the Commonwealth, is unquestionable and unquestioned, and this country proposes <Col N="3031" /> to exercise that right in one instance at least through the voice of a fully accredited representative at Washington.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made the matter of the passports clear.  We did issue those passports to people going abroad on definite international business prior to an agreement as to their issuing, because we knew the mission they were going on was sufficient to ensure that they would be well treated and given full facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>No such objection has been received; but I may as well say in that regard that we only issued very few last year to people going on definite missions.  Otherwise they are only issued since last Wednesday. I myself have travelled in some three or four countries on Irish passports, and, far from making trouble, they brought me a very courteous reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that some obstacle apparently arose against the continuance or use of Irish pass ports.  Does the Minister think it wise to indicate what that obstacle was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not a cessation of issue, because there was no real issue.  There was a deferring of issue&mdash;I am quite prepared to be frank with the Dáil&mdash;because whereas the other States, members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, described their nationals as British subjects, we felt it was exactly in keeping with the Treaty, and with the status of our nationals, that they should be described as citizens of the Irish Free State and of the British Commonwealth of Nations. That was the cause of the delay.  If we were prepared to yield on that we could have issued them as soon as I last succeeded in getting them made, but we preferred to defer it until we had come to a modus vivendi on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That phrase rather suggests that there was an obstacle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an obstacle, yes.  With regard to the Lausanne Treaty, that Treaty was initiated and to a large extent negotiated, before we came into our present position.  That being so, we were not consulted or invited to be in its negotiation.  We were not consulted as to whether or not we agreed with its signing, and for that reason I assert that the articles of its various clauses are in no wise binding on this country.  Since we came into existence in our present form we were kept during the negotiation of that Treaty in close knowledge of its progress; but, inasmuch as we were not consulted as to its initiation, and as we had no opportunity of having a representative there, I do not consider that the clauses of that Treaty are in any way binding on this country.</P>
      <P>Most of Deputy Johnson's statements as to the full equality of Ireland with Great Britain are, as I say, unquestionable and unquestioned.  Since we came into existence, the only two Treaties, so far as I know, that have been under consideration have been the Lausanne and the Liquor Treaty.  With regard to both of them, we were more or less daily informed as to their progress. With regard to the statement that Deputy Johnson read out as having been made in the British House of Commons, I have no idea as to what that statement was intended to be.  The Deputy asked if we had given consent to the ratification of the Lausanne Treaty. We have not given consent to the ratification of the Lausanne Treaty with regard to Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, may I interrupt.  Are we to take it that the British Prime Minister&mdash;or shall I speak of him as the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;was misinformed when he indicated that the Irish Free State and representatives of other nations comprising the British Commonwealth had intimated their approval of ratification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the British Prime Minister or the British Foreign Secretary made such a statement.  I can assure the Deputy and the House generally that the <Col N="3033" /> Government of the Irish Free State had not indicated their approval of ratification of the Lausanne Treaty with regard to Ireland.  I think that is an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, except that we obviously have no right to dictate as to whether a Treaty shall be signed with regard to any other country than Ireland.  There is no significance in the words except that this Government can only speak with regard to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that you have not expressed any approval of the Treaty in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not expressed any approval or disapproval of the Treaty in any way.  The Deputy asked: Is it the view of the Executive Council that the text of all agreements or undertakings we have entered into that cast responsibilities, that involve obligations on this country should be put before the Dáil?  I certainly wholeheartedly agree with that.  With regard to that, there is only one trade treaty that I can think of at the moment. We have not changed the position with regard to trade relations&mdash; that is to say, that things that existed when we came into existence still exist. They have not been changed.  In that matter I consulted, from time to time, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and they thought that until we actually knew more about our trade, until we had more grip of the situation, it was wiser not to change anything that had existed.  There was an exchange of notes between the Irish Free State Government and Spain, which had the effect of renewing under the new regime here what existed under the old regime.  That exchange of notes took place actually through the Servis Diplomatique of the British Foreign Office. I may as well take this opportunity of giving the exact text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Free State Government are prepared to give an undertaking that they will continue to grant to Spanish <Col N="3034" /> goods imported into the Irish Free State, treatment as favourable as that accorded to goods produced or manufactured in any foreign country, upon the understanding that the Spanish Government agrees to grant to goods produced or manufactured in the Irish Free State, on importation into Spain, the rates of duties specified in the second column of the Spanish Customs Tariff.  It is proposed, on the part of the Free State Government, that this arrangement should continue in force for an indefinite period, subject to six months' notice of its termination on either side.</P>
    <P>The <i>Madrid Gazette</i> reports the terms as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Spain concedes to products emanating from the Free State of Ireland the duties of the second column of the Tariff in force.</P>
    <P>2.  The Free State of Ireland, on its side concedes to Spanish products the most favoured treatment already conceded or which may in future be conceded to any foreign country.</P>
    <P>3.  This commercial arrangement is established for an indefinite period, on the understanding that it shall cease to operate six months after either of the contracting parties denounces it.</P>
    <P>This is made public for general information&mdash;The Under-Secretary, F. Espinosa de los Monteros.  Madrid, March 14, 1924.</P>
    <P>I will have to look up the matter a little more closely.  There may have been renewals of certain other things &mdash;renewals to avoid any definite change when we were not sure whether the change would be detrimental or not to Irish business.  The Deputy referred to a certain discussion on Treaties that took place in the Imperial Conference and spoke of conclusions or agreements.  A certain memorandum was drawn up to give a rough idea as to the methods of working with regard to the negotiation, signature and ratification of Treaties.  That document, as it existed at first, seemed to me rather unclear in certain points, and these points were cleared up by the clause the <Col N="3035" /> Deputy read: &ldquo;The ratification of Treaties imposing obligations on one part of the Empire are effected at the instance of the Government of that part.  Ratification of Treaties imposing obligations on more than one part of the Empire is effected after consultation between the Governments of those parts of the Empire concerned. It is for each Government to decide whether Parliamentary approval or legislation is required before the desire for or concurrence with ratification is intimated by that Government.&rdquo; The net effect of that is that if we wished to make a political Treaty, which affected Ireland and the country with whom it was negotiated only, that the Irish Government would negotiate and sign that Treaty and its ratification would be carried out at the instance of that Government.  But where any one country of the Commonwealth is making a Treaty which in any way affects the other members, this document which the Deputy read from is the suggestion put up for the smooth working of such arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, it was negotiated through the Servis Diplomatique of the British Embassy. It was not a signed Treaty.  It was done by an exchange of notes through the British Embassy.  The Deputy asked if we had any representation at Ottawa in view of the Constitutional position.  We have not a representative at Ottawa.  It is a thing we have under consideration.  But I may say that at the Imperial Conference very close personal relations were entered into by your representatives and the Canadian representatives, so that we are able, as far as the Constitutional position is concerned, to keep in very close touch with Canada on that point.  At the same time, the question of representation at Ottawa is under consideration.  With regard to relations with Russia that might be advantageous from the trade point of view.  In that matter, and in all matters regarding trade, I, naturally, am guided by the advice from the Department <Col N="3036" /> of Industry and Commerce. I have proposed to them with regard to two European countries, that we should make trade agreements with them, and in that matter I shall be guided by that Department.</P>

      <P>The statement by Deputy Esmonde which I referred to at the beginning was that the clouds of civil war are passing away.  Certainly the civil war made our position much more difficult.  It seems to have happened that when the clouds of civil war were passing away a number of other things happened.  There was a mutiny, British soldiers were murderously attached in Cobh, all calculated to make things more difficult.  At the same time I can assure the Dáil that no matter what happens this Government is fully conscious of the rights of this country and of its status and of the implications of that status.  Necessarily things are rather slow.  I have had the matter of accrediting our representative in Washington in hand for a fairly long time.  At the present time he is not accredited.  I can only say that in that matter we are pushing forward with full strength.  The accrediting of our representative in Washington establishes clearly, and in one instance shows, at any rate, we are ready to exercise our right of conducting conversations between a person of this State and a person of another State outside the British Commonwealth.  I admit that we might have gone with a flourish and started right away, trying to have representatives in every country in the world.  We considered that actually the most important for us was America.  In America we have undoubted interests, and it is necessary that we should have there accredited representation.  The other case urged by the Deputy was representation, presumably at the Vatican, to His Holiness the Pope.  That is a matter we will consider <Col N="3037" /> when the representation at Washington is settled.  The Deputy referred to the fact that some time ago we had twelve offices in Europe.  I do not think that is quite correct.  We certainly have less offices in Europe than we had. For instance, we had an office in Spain, and our representative there at the time was Deputy Esmonde.  As far as I can remember, I asked Deputy Esmonde when he came back if our office there was serving any useful purpose.  It must be remembered that I had to live at very close quarters with the Minister for Finance, and I could not, for ornamental purposes, recommend that we should spend money maintaining offices unless I had reason to believe they were serving some useful purpose.  Speaking, subject to correction by Deputy Esmonde, as well as I remember, when I asked him if the office served any useful purpose he assured me that it did not.  I considered it my duty then, and I would consider it my duty again in a similar case, to say that if offices served no useful purpose, obviously we cannot afford to pay for maintaining them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the new regime came into force I think practically every Government Department will admit that our representatives abroad have been of great value to them in getting information of every possible sort.  The Ministry of Agriculture has certainly benefited, and also the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  The Ministry of Finance and other Departments have also got information.  I have tried to answer every point that was put to me as frankly as possible.  I welcome this debate.  I feel that other Ministers, owing to the fact that they are constantly introducing Bills here, do get a certain amount of attention from the Dáil.  There were suggestions last Friday that I was trying to do things behind the back of the Dáil.  These suggestions were not true.  That is all I can say about them.  I am most anxious that the Dáil should be fully informed of all steps taken and of all acts done by the Ministry of External Affairs.  I am most anxious that the Dáil should take an interest in and be fully informed of everything connected with our external relations.  I accept, <Col N="3038" /> as far as I am concerned, the suggestion of Deputy Johnson that all agreements and such things which in any way impose any obligation upon this Government should be put before the Dáil.  It has never been my intention to do anything else.</P>

It was my impression that there should be an office in Spain.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Johnson refuses to commit himself, there is evident some evidence of that lack of leadership of which Deputy Esmonde complained.  I was not aware that the people of this country were suffering from any lack of leadership.  If they are, it is not for lack of leaders. There are at least a half a dozen leaders in the Dáil, and I do not know how many there are outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not touch upon that very delicate point as to what is vigorous or not.  As one who has no pretensions to lead, and who merely occupies a very humble position in an incoherent party, there are just one or two points that I would like to mention on this matter, which is really one of immense importance. I think one thing the Dáil may congratulate itself upon is that on the broad constitutional issue and on the broad issue of our national status, we are really all standing upon common ground.  The Minister accepted Deputy Johnson's definition of what our constitutional position was.  I accept it, too, though I do not entirely accept all the implications that arise from it, and Deputy Johnson will probably <Col N="3040" /> not accept some of the implications that I draw from it.  He said, and I agree with him, that we are not merely a Dominion&mdash;we are a mother country.  I think the implication is that the Royal title should run &ldquo;King of Great Britain, the Irish Free State, and the Dominions beyond the Seas.&rdquo; I am not quite sure whether Deputy Johnson desires that; I am certain that there are some Deputies who do not.  Therefore, I think we had better leave it in the decently-veiled formula which now exists, and which, after all, expresses the position to a certain extent, and it does not, I think, give great offence to anybody.  It is one that we accept, not as perfect, or perhaps what we would desire, but as a working arrangement that we can go on.</P>
      <P>One implication that Deputy Johnson can hardly expect me to accept is the implication with regard to Moscow and the suggestion that we should make an agreement with Russia and send a representative to Moscow.  I am not definitely opposed to that but I should like Deputy Johnson to make out a stronger case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not even imply the necessity for having a representative in Moscow.  I think that agreements could be entered into without having any Ambassador in Moscow.  I am not objecting to an Ambassador there, but I do not see why it should be Moscow before Paris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, I believe, a representative in Paris.  Taking the statement of the trade agreement, Deputy Johnson said Russia could send us timber and flax.  He did not mention their most prevalent industry.  I have no doubt Russia could send us propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>What do we get out of the agreement with Russia?  There are plenty of people who will send us things.  What we want is some place where we can sell.  We want people who will buy from us.  Deputy Esmonde complained that Germany did not know we were a Free State.  Germany <Col N="3041" /> knows we are on the map, and Germany in January last, sent us £69,000 worth of material, and took £200 worth of wool-raw material.  Before entering into any trade agreements, I would like to make sure that they are not one-sided, and I would like to see that other countries would not only send us their products, but also buy our products.  I hope that Deputy Johnson will indicate what Russia is going to buy from us, as well as what she will send us.</P>
      <P>On the broad issue, I entirely accept Deputy Johnson's view.  We ought not to be parties to any treaty in regard to which we are not consulted, and of which we have not full information. On Friday I asked the Minister if he was prepared to put down an amendment limiting our approval in this case to the articles on the Paper.  He said he would, and I see there stands one in Deputy Duggan's name.  Deputy Johnson asks us to decline to approve of it. I venture to think that course is not in our best interests, because this liquor agreement is one of very considerable importance to one of our few industries. We are, as a nation, exporters of very large amounts of alcoholic liquor, and this amendment would make a good deal of difference to our distilling and brewing trade.  It would make it possible for us to send a mixed cargo, for instance, to America.  The ship could call at an American port where it could unload fish or other cargo, and then it could proceed to Canada or South America to unload liquor.  That cargo could be under seal while in an American port, and then it could be carried on to Canada or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been great trouble in conducting direct trade with America because of the difficulty in securing a return cargo.  This will to a certain extent relieve that difficulty, and that is one reason why I am not in favour of Deputy Johnson's amendment.  The other reason is that I do not think it has been fully realised that the fact that we are asked to accept this Treaty does mark the status we have achieved.  That has not been fully realised in the debates here.  The Parliament of Northern Ireland is not asked to accept the Treaty.  They have <Col N="3042" /> to accept whatever is done for them at Westminster and their twelve representatives there have comparatively little influence over what is done.  We have actually more power here, and we have more power over this Treaty&mdash;power to accept or reject it&mdash;than the House of Representatives has in the United States.  The treaty-making power in the United States is confined to the President and the Senate.  We have a right to accept or reject this Treaty. I believe it is to Ireland's advantage that it should be accepted, and to the advantage of our trade and our good relations with the United States&mdash;relations that we must always remember are intensely important to us.  I shall vote against the amendment though I am entirely in agreement on the Constitutional issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make my position clear on this question.  I believe a division was taken here on Friday on a similar matter when I was absent.  I was listening to the debate this evening, and heard the very eloquent speech of Deputy Esmonde.  I want to correct a few impressions that he suggested in this debate.  He asked what has the Ministry of External Affairs done to find markets for Irish produce other than in Great Britain, and why we have not a variety of markets for Irish produce.  As a matter of fact, anyone who has his eyes about him at all will know that the English market is not alone the market for Irish produce but is the market for the surplus produce of all the countries in Europe.  With the exception of a few small things there is no other market outside the English market for the surplus products of practically all the countries in the world. Practically all the countries in the world find a market in England for their surplus produce.  Deputy Esmonde suggests that the Ministry of External Affairs should find a market for our produce outside Britain.  To make such a suggestion as that is merely to show that a man does not know what he is talking about.  I was wondering when I heard the Deputy speaking where he was and what he was thinking of when the Minister, and Secretaries Bill was before the Dáil.  At that time I, and some Deputies on these benches, criticised that part of the Bill dealing with the Ministry <Col N="3043" /> of External Affairs, and we opposed that part of the Bill and opposed the appointment of this Ministry altogether. We alleged that it was of very little use to the State.  A campaign had been carried on in the Press to the same effect, and people in the country had spoken against this Ministry.  Yet, Deputy Esmonde at that time was silent on this question.  I would like to know what has given birth to his activities and concern on this matter now.  What has given birth to his activities with regard to this particular Ministry and its development? When we were criticising the Ministers and Secretaries Bill the Deputy had not a word to say about it. He referred in the course of his speech this evening to Missionary Work.  Some of the events that have happened in Ireland recently would make one inclined to suggest that the Chinese should send a Chinese Mission here.  I will not labour the question any further, but I will certainly vote against this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say very few words on the general question raised by Deputy Johnson's amendment. Personally I feel very glad that this matter has been raised, and that this whole issue has been brought under discussion, even though the manner in which it has been raised may bear the appearance of an attack upon the Executive Council.  The net result of the discussion, at any rate, is to emphasise and underline the status which this country possesses.  It is good that that should be done, no matter how it comes about that it is done, and no matter what the motive behind any resolution which serves to emphasise it may be.  It is two years now, or a little over two years, since a majority of the members of Dáil Eireann approved of a Treaty signed by Irish Plenipotentiaries with the Plenipotentiaries of Britain.  The men who signed that Treaty and the men who voted for it assured their countrymen that they were accepting a status equal to the status of England herself, and entering into a freedom as full and as broad and as real as the freedom which the people of England enjoyed. That claim was denied.  That claim was shouted down.  Those who <Col N="3044" /> attempted to go out through the country and explain that claim to the citizens of the country found themselves harassed at every turn; found their meetings dispersed by red pepper and 303 and other devices of that kind; and generally there were two or three months simply of chaos and babble throughout the country.  When a meeting was called for a particular town, you found the town an island entirely surrounded by fallen timber and broken railways and so on.  And yet all the time the claim was true, and to-day, solemnly sitting in this Parliament, it is the common case that it is true.  The only complaint is that the Executive Council seem to have been remiss or backward in a full appreciation of its truth.  The Minister for External Affairs has answered that.  He has reminded the Dáil that it is not to-day by Deputy Johnson, or on Friday by Deputy Esmonde, that this matter has been properly defined.  It must be five or six years ago now since the late Mr. Bonar Law stated that Canada was equal in status to Great Britain and as free as Great Britain.  Since then he went on to state that the Crown had no authority in Canada; no power in Canada; that it signified sentiment only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty that was signed between this country and England, and which was subsequently approved by both Parliaments, laid it down that the Constitutional status of the Free State would be the Constitutional status of Canada. The first Article of the Constitution which the Provisional Parliament passed, arising out of that Treaty, stated: &ldquo;The Irish Free State is a co-equal member of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;  Article 2 went on to define &ldquo;that all powers of Government and all authority, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial in Ireland are derived from the people of Ireland.&rdquo;  But when we told the people of Ireland that they had their destinies in their own hands, that all the powers in Ireland, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial were theirs to delegate to representatives who would answer back to them for the use of that power, that was scoffed at and shouted down as a lie.  When we told <Col N="3045" /> the people of Ireland that as fully and as really as the people of England they had their Government in their own hands, that also was shouted down.  Yet there is general agreement here about its truth.  And the most useful service, that the Deputies could do would be to emphasise that plain simple truth to the people of the country whose minds have been confused with regard to it, people who have been led to doubt it, who have been led to disbelieve it, who have been led on to believe that the status that was accepted here was a paltry subordinate status, and the people who certainly do not know and do not believe that this country stands to-day equal in status with England, as free as England, and no more bound to England than Canada, Australia, and South Africa, simply sharing with her, membership of what might well be described as a miniature League of Nations, certainly a league of free nations, and certainly a league of equal nations.  But for two years because of the failure to appreciate that fact, because that fact has been successfully concealed from the mind of the people of the country, we have had destruction and turmoil, bloodshed and crime here.  And instead of giving the infant State an opportunity to develop as it should develop, an opportunity of healing up wounds here, of solving problems that were here, people went out and made war upon it ruthlessly; they simply went out in a mad campaign of slander and calumny against those who wanted to give that State a chance to grow and flourish, and develop as it should develop.  They did all that under the leadership of and at the call of a man who before any Treaty was signed, before the negotiators stepped on board ship to go to meet the representatives of England, was fully prepared to accept and recommend to his Cabinet the acceptance of a status that certainly did not differ one whit from the status laid down in the Treaty and in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Now we have Deputy Esmonde's amendment of Friday last and Deputy Johnson's amendment of to-day, and the claim is that the Executive Council fails to realise the length and the breadth and the width of the status which this country achieved by the Treaty, and which it properly enjoys <Col N="3046" /> under the terms of the Constitution. If we had been remiss in enforcing that status, we certainly could not plead that the remissness was in any way due to ignorance. We were the first to announce and to emphasise to the people that that was the position which the country had achieved under the terms of the Treaty which Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith signed.  We claim that there has been no remissness, that on the contrary we have at all times been diligent in pressing the claim for the fulness of our Treaty rights, that there has been no willingness to concede any point which could properly be contested, and that this very matter of which Deputy Esmonde complained on Friday, this omission to bring before the Dáil the Preamble to that Treaty, was to ensure that the Dáil would not be committed in any way to acceptance of a particular description of the King of England, which is the description in the Royal Titles Act not yet repealed or amended, but which is no longer an accurate description of fact, and which is a description to which we could not assent or acquiesce.  So that the very grievance of Friday simply has its roots in that vigilance on the part of the Executive Council and on the part of the Attorney-General to ensure that there will be no acquiescence here on the part of Deputies in that anomaly and in that anachronism of the present description of the British King.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs stated that it was an anomaly and that it was an anachronism.  The Attorney-General stated that he believed that it was a clear and necessary implication of the Treaty that the title should be altered.  It has not yet been altered, and because it has not yet been altered he did not bring before the Dáil the Preamble to this Liquor Treaty, in which that description occurs.  Deputy Esmonde produced the text-books and read an extract from Oppenheim, which stated, if I remember rightly, that a particular procedure was usually observed in the making of treaties, and from these premises he went on to argue that if any one of the four matters which he described and which Oppenheim laid down as usually observed, were omitted, that there was no treaty. <Col N="3047" /> It did occur to me at the time that the deduction scarcely followed from the premises, but that is a matter of opinion.  To say that a particular practice is the one usually observed, and then to say as a deduction from that, if it is not observed, that there is no treaty, is to say something which would not stand the test of logic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>

      <P>I only wish to add that it did seem to me that Deputy Esmonde was not adverting fully to all the implications of the thesis he was advancing.  Deputy Johnson did not answer the Minister for External Affairs just now when he put a query to him as to whether it was considered that a condition set out in his resolution had been fulfilled.  I think the Minister rather invited any further queries that Deputy Johnson or any other Deputy might wish to put.</P>

      <P>I find it somewhat difficult to know exactly what we are discussing, because really a considerable portion of the remarks of the Minister for Home Affairs seem to be utterly irrelevant to the amendment on the paper.  That being so, I wonder whether or not I will be in order in following his example and in wandering into the by-paths through which this matter has taken its course since it was first moved.  I will try, however, to show a better example than the Minister for Home Affairs.  I was somewhat relieved to see him stand up to-day, because on last Friday no Minister came to the rescue of the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Though it is true that <Col N="3048" /> the Attorney-General rushed in where Ministers feared to tread and endeavoured, I thought, with a melancholy degree of success, to extricate the Minister for External Affairs from his dilemma.  I do not know whether this is going to a division or not, but I think that the Deputy who put down the amendment has secured as full a measure of success as he could expect from this discussion, though he has not, I think, secured anything like a full or adequate statement of our relations to other States from the reply of the Minister. I take it that the reasoning of the Minister for External Affairs is peculiar.  The fact that we have not issued passports generally is proof positive that we intend to do so.  The fact that we did not send a representative to Washington to sign the Treaty is a proof that we had the right to do so. If that is the method of reasoning by which our external affairs are conducted, well, it is no longer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to misrepresent, deliberately or otherwise, what the Minister has said.  I am simply quoting his arguments, and if there is misrepresentation, it rests in the arguments he used, and not in my quotation of them.  If this is the kind of method and reasoning by which our external affairs are conducted, then it is not surprising that there should be a rather inordinate degree of curiosity as to what is happening to our external affairs.  He told us that there has been an obstacle in the way of the issue of passports, but he did not reveal the nature, or the source of that obstacle. Has it come from Britain&mdash;our co-equal partner in the Commonwealth of free nations?  Has it come from CzechoSlovakia? Has it come from China? Or where has this mysterious obstacle <Col N="3049" /> that the Minister has so strenuously tried to circumvent or to overthrow come from?  There has also been the obstacle to the registration of the Treaty of 1921 with the League of Nations.  But, again, the Minister has not disclosed the nature or the source of that obstacle.  And after that he asked the Deputy who moved this amendment: &ldquo;Are you satisfied that I have fully met the case that you made out?&rdquo;  He spoke about his close proximity to the Minister for Finance when he came to look after establishment charges abroad.  I wonder was it ever mooted or suggested to the Minister for External Affairs that Irishmen resident in foreign countries might have been able to discharge the office of Irish agents there, or has he received any communication from any such Irishman in exile, offering to undertake such work as that?</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper said that the fact that we were asked to endorse or accept it is the greatest&mdash;I do not remember his exact words&mdash;indication or proof of the status we have achieved.  That I do not deny.  But we have the right to examine that treaty.  We have the right to see that within it there is not embodied that which would to some extent nullify the status we achieved, and that is the point toward which some of us are directing our criticism. But as that is a matter which will be more or less dealt with on the main question, I do not propose to follow the example which Deputy Cooper set me, and which was followed by the Minister for Home Affairs.  I have quite a number of things to say on the main question when it comes along, and I think it would be well if we got on to the main question as soon as possible. Therefore, I would ask Deputy Johnson, having achieved as far as possible what he set out to secure, not to press this to a division, but that we should get on to the main question and discuss there the real objections with regard to the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment was obviously to extract from the Executive Council a statement of its attitude in regard to external affairs.  That extraction has taken place.  I admit it has been a difficult operation, not very satisfactory.  There are still some stumps left, and it has not been quite a clean job.  We know a little more this evening than we did this morning of the attitude of the Executive Council to external affairs, and there would be no good purpose served, therefore, by pressing this motion to a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked whether the explanation has been as full as I sought. I would like it to have been fuller and a little more detailed; but, nevertheless, it has been an attempt on the part of the Minister to deal with most of the points I brought forward and all the points raised; and, while they have not been satisfactorily dealt with, they have at least been dealt with.  As Deputy Milroy has pointed out, one or two points still remain to be answered, and these were the points about the obstacles in regard to passports and the difficulty in regard to a representative in Washington, and as to how it came about that the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland has not been registered at Geneva.  These are questions which might be better unanswered at present.  I hope the latter particularly has not been forgotten or overlooked. <Col N="3051" /> I think it is particularly important that it should be registered.  It was the duty of Great Britain to register it before the Free State was admitted into membership of the League of Nations.  But we have no responsibility for the action of that great Power, but we have responsibility for our own.  We entered into obligations with the League of Nations to register every treaty, and, if that obligation has not been honoured, I hope it will be.  Deputy Bryan Cooper seemed to imagine that the amendment was framed in such a way as to suggest that we declined to consider the motion pending fuller explanation, and that that was directed in opposition to the Treaty itself.  That, I think I explained, was not my intention, and did not follow from the amendment.</P>
    <P>I wonder did Deputy Bryan Cooper ever hear of international trade transactions which were not mere barter in direct trade between one country and another, but were more in the nature of triangular or quadrangular or crisscross purchases and sales?  Apparently Deputy Cooper thinks that nothing we sell can be paid for except by direct imports from the country concerned.  I would ask him to ask himself the question: How do we pay to-day for timber, flax and corn that is imported?&mdash;and I think he will find that his answer to that question will be the answer to his own question.  I am very glad to have it stated by the Minister for External Affairs, speaking, I take it, on behalf of the Executive Council, that the claim I made, and which has been echoed in all parts of the Dáil, regarding the status of the Saorstát, is incontestable and uncontested. If it is not contested then undoubtedly we have gained immensely, and the position is very much more satisfactory than I imagined.  Judging by what one reads of statements, even of British Ministers, the position has not been understood.  I am glad that it is now understood and is not contested. I am glad, particularly, to understand that it is agreed that Saorstát Eireann is not to be held accountable at any time for any undertakings entered into unless specifically signed by representatives appointed by the <Col N="3052" /> Saorstát, and specifically on behalf of the Saorstát.  If that is understood, not only here but in London and in every capital in Europe, then our position as an independent free State is firm and fixed, and the old idea that every State or any State that had undertaken liability or at least had entered into association in this British Common wealth, was equally responsible for all the acts of all the members internationally is finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If that idea is finished it is a very great gain indeed, and I hope that if it has not already been done it will be the accepted duty of our Ministers to make known that position in every capital in the world, so that no longer shall we be considered by anybody to be in any degree responsible for the acts of British Ministers, or British soldiers, or British agents of any nature, in any part of the world. The great defect, the great drawback, to me, against being obliged to become members of this Community of Nations was the fact that it made us participators in Imperialistic acts, made us responsible for mis-government in Egypt, or in India, or in any other part of the world which was under the direct authority of the British Government, the British Crown.  If now it is incontestable and uncontested that Saorstát Eireann is a free State, independent, cannot be held in any way responsible or accountable for any such act unless taken by the direct instigation and with the direct connivance of the Ministers of the Free State, then I say our position is accepted and recognised as much stronger even than I had imagined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question which I did not enlarge upon as much as I had intended to do, but which I did raise, and the Minister passed it over, presumably because Deputy Milroy gave notice that he would raise the Boundary question on the adjournment.  I will say just a word on that, because it may give Ministers an opportunity to answer the point when dealing with this Boundary question in answer to Deputy Milroy.  It is involved in the earlier question as to status.  If my view of the status of Saorstát Eireann is correct, if our Ministers <Col N="3053" /> are maintaining this status, then we ought to let it be known quite clearly and frankly to all concerned that Ireland is the Free State and is to-day the Free State.  I am doubtful about the position of the Ministry in this respect when I read in an official publication&mdash; shall I say semi-official&mdash;I hope I may say semi-official and that it is not really the official mind on this question that is embodied in this handbook.  I read in this semi-official publication that &ldquo;The Treaty presented to Northern Ireland a choice between two courses&mdash;either to remain in the Irish Free State, in which she was included by the Treaty in the first instance, or else to exclude herself from the Free State, in which case a revision of her boundary was to take place The precise character of each of the offers thus made requires to be closely examined.  If Northern Ireland elected to remain in the Free State she was to retain all the powers conferred on her under the Act of 1920.&rdquo;  Then a little later: &ldquo;The second course left open to Northern Ireland by the Treaty was to vote her exclusion from the Free State and retain her position under the Government of Ireland Act.&rdquo;  Further, &ldquo;Northern Ireland had been offered many inducements to remain in the Free State.&rdquo;  I do not believe that we are going the right way to maintain the status of the Free State by allowing it to be suggested, even semi-officially, that Northern Ireland goes out of the Free State.  Northern Ireland was empowered to elect to go out of the jurisdiction of the Government and the Parliament under certain conditions, but the Free State remains as Ireland, and Ireland, for purposes of peace&mdash;the Free State for purposes of peace&mdash;assented to the suspension of legislative and Governmental authority, over that part of the Free State.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some indication from the President, who, I presume, will speak on this matter to be raised on the adjournment, as to what, in fact, is the view of the Executive Council regarding this question.  We have had it stated in the British Parliament by Ministers, or Under-Secretaries, that they are informed that Northern Ireland is still part of the United Kingdom, presumably that the rest of <Col N="3054" /> Ireland is not part of the United Kingdom, and many suggestions are made that there has been a definite and undoubted division between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, and that view is being put forward assiduously and is supported in semi-official publications.  That, I say, is an indication of the failure to realise the true position secured by the Treaty in regard to that question.  I have achieved a great part of my object, and with the permission of the Dáil I would withdraw the amendment so that the discussion on the main question may be taken up.</P>

      <P>I thought I had quite clearly explained the cause of the delay in the passports, but inasmuch as Deputy Johnson seems not to be quite clear still, I had better make a further statement on that.  I wished that the holders of Irish passports should have the fullest possible service abroad.  For that reason I wanted them to have the good offices of the British Consular and other agents abroad, and I asked that the British Government would grant that.  It appeared that for that to be given fully, either the holder of an Irish passport would have to be described as a British subject, or there would have to be an alteration made in the British Consular regulations.  It was trying to get for the holder of Irish passports that service and convenience that caused the thing to be held up.  I actually delayed the thing because I refused to take a step which I thought was something in the nature of an incorrect interpretation of the Treaty, but I wanted them to have the good offices of the British Consular agents abroad, and it was on that point that the British Government were able to interfere.  They had no right whatsoever, and could not attempt to interfere in the matter of our issuing passports, but they had a perfect right, and asserted that right, to refuse to give us any special privileges or services unless we were prepared to meet them.  I hope that is clear.</P>

It is accurately described in the first paragraph as &ldquo;Articles of Agreement,&rdquo; and it is therefore necessary to make an amendment in paragraphs 2 and 3.

      <P>I confess that I am very much perplexed by the terms of this amendment.  I do not understand exactly its significance, but I conclude, and in view of the statement which the Minister for External Affairs made here on the last meeting of the Dáil, in answer, I think, to a question by Deputy Cooper, that the suggestion is that this amendment has been brought in for the purpose of ensuring that the Dáil approves of the ratification of the Articles of Agreement, and by the Articles of Agreement I understand they mean the actual text as it appears on the Order Paper.  If that is the case, if the Dáil are asked to approve of the ratification of the said Articles of Agreement for a Treaty, then they are asked absolutely to stultify themselves. It is absolutely impossible to ratify parts of a treaty.  The very word &ldquo;ratification&rdquo; implies that the whole document is ratified.  I conclude that that is the object of this amendment, and for that reason I oppose it strongly, as it is placing the Dáil in a most ridiculous position, asking it to approve of the ratification of something which cannot be ratified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the indulgence of the Dáil I will again, although perhaps the Dáil is getting tired of my quotations from him, quote from Oppenheim, page 668, in which he states: &ldquo;The contracting States have always taken the standpoint <Col N="3056" /> that a treaty is concluded as soon as their mutual consent is clearly apparent. They have always made a distinction between their consent, given by representatives, and their ratification, to be given afterwards; they have never for one moment confounded the two and considered their ratification their consent. It is for that reason that a treaty cannot be ratified in part, that no alteration of the Treaty is possible, through the act of ratification, that a treaty may be tacitly ratified by its execution, that a treaty is always dated from the day when it was duly signed by the representatives, and not from the day of its ratification.&rdquo;  I maintain that it is impossible, or it is ridiculous, for the Dáil to propose to ratify what is on the Order Paper, because it has no meaning.</P>

I will now read, with the indulgence of the Dáil, the actual document of ratification which his Majesty the King is about to sign if this Dáil will approve, but I hope it will not. &ldquo;George by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.  To all and singular to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting.  Whereas a Convention between Us and the President of the United States of America was concluded and signed at Washington on the 23rd day of January in the year of our Lord, 1924, by the Plenipotentiaries of Us and of the President of the United States of America, duly and respectively authorised for that purpose, which Convention is word for word as follows.&rdquo;  Here follows a copy of the Convention from beginning to end, as in the original, including the signatures and a spot marking the letters L.S. in a circle to denote the exact spot of the Seal in the original.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might explain. This particular motion, I understand, is to substitute the words &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Treaty,&rdquo; implying that the Dáil approves of the ratification of the said Articles of Agreement for a Treaty, but not necessarily implying that it approves of the whole Treaty.  I maintain I have a right to explain what the word &ldquo;ratify&rdquo; means.  Perhaps I may be permitted now that I have read half of the document to read two more paragraphs. After the paragraph I have read there comes the full text of the Treaty, and the document proceeds: &ldquo;We have seen and considered the Convention aforesaid, have approved, accepted and confirmed the same in all and every one of its articles and clauses as we do by these presents approve, accept, confirm and ratify it for ourselves, our heirs and successors; engaging and promising on our Royal Word that We will sincerely and faithfully perform and observe all and singular the things which are contained and expressed in the Convention aforesaid, and that we will never suffer the same to be violated by anyone or transgressed in any manner as far as lies in Our Power.  For the greater testimony and validity of all which We have caused the Great Seal of Our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to be affixed to those presents which we have signed with Our Royal Hand.&rdquo;  That is the document of ratification which is to be sent to Sir Esme Howard, British Ambassador in Washington. That is the result of the motion of the Minister being accepted.  We will participate so far as the Free State is concerned in the issuing of that document and be responsible for the carrying out and observance of what that document contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that it is obviously preposterous that the Dáil should be asked to accept this amendment changing the word &ldquo;Treaty&rdquo; into the words &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty,&rdquo; in view of the statement of the Attorney-General that this was not a treaty until it was ratified.  That is contrary to <Col N="3058" /> commonsense and contrary to the ordinary documents which are exchanged on those occasions, in which the full powers which Sir Auckland Geddes received to sign the Treaty set out that he was to conclude and sign a treaty. The Treaty was concluded once he signed it, but its operation was suspended until such time as the ratification of the Treaty was completed.  Now, the Minister who has a copy of Oppenheim in front of him may say that Oppenheim admits that there are some people sufficiently mistaken as to support the Attorney-General, but Oppenheim, dealing with the Attorney-General, says that his opinion does not agree with the real facts.  In other words, that a treaty is not a treaty until it is ratified; and he goes on to say that the representatives are authorised and intend to conclude a treaty by their signatures.  I maintain that the full powers which they received do state definitely that the representative is authorised to conclude and sign a treaty, and I do not see how, in view of that fact, the Minister or the Attorney-General can persist in his opinion that what we are asked to ratify is not a treaty, but only articles of agreement for a treaty.  For that reason I ask the Dáil not to stultify itself by approving of what I maintain to be a ridiculous amendment.</P>

We have a member of the Ministry asking us to accept parts of this treaty.  Are we accepting this treaty, or are we accepting two or three little paragraphs of it?

That is either the truth or it is not.  If it is not the truth let someone get up, support the Minister for External Affairs, and say that it is not a fact.  There is no such thing as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and because the Minister for External Affairs blundered when he agreed to it, and they could not put the whole text before the House, they put the Articles of Agreement, and I am opposing the Articles of Agreement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde quotes Oppenheim: &ldquo;Many writers maintain that as a treaty is not binding without ratification it is the latter which really contains the mutual consent and really concludes the treaty.  Before ratification, they maintain, no treaty has been concluded, but a mere mutual proposal to conclude a treaty has been agreed to.&rdquo;  Although the word &ldquo;conclude&rdquo; is used, it does not necessarily mean to conclude.</P>

      <P>If the Treaty was concluded by signature, presumably the Governments in not acting in accordance with that Treaty between the time of that signature and ratification would be breaking the treaty, and would be dishonouring themselves by not acting in accordance with the Treaty.  Inasmuch as the Government does not act in accordance with the Treaty until after its ratification the Treaty does not exist as a Treaty until after ratification, and we are bringing before the Dáil this matter.

      <P>A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, there seems to be a great objection to hearing me speak on this matter.  I will try not to keep the Dáil any longer than I can help.  The Dáil is asked to recommend the Executive Council to advise the Crown to ratify Articles of Agreement such as outlined. That is exactly what we have got before us.  I maintain it is not a treaty, and cannot be a treaty, until after ratification; and it is possible that Articles of Agreement may be varied at any time until they actually become binding&mdash;that is to say, at any time up to ratification.  We bring before you exactly what was presented to us, and exactly what we recommended the signature of.  We asked the Dáil to agree just as far as we agreed.  We did not ask the Dáil to agree to anything more than we had agreed to.  We did not bring the preamble, which we got on a later date, before the Dáil, because we strongly objected to a certain phrase in that preamble.  But, perhaps, I had better not speak about a future amendment.  I merely got up to point out that this is accurately described as &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo; at the present moment, and that it is a ridiculous thing to say the Dáil stultifies itself by applying the term &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo; to a certain document which contains Articles of Agreement for a Treaty which is not yet concluded, because it is not yet ratified.</P>

      <P>He was referring to the amendment.  I am not in the habit of trying to play &ldquo;confidence tricks&rdquo; on the House.  I suggested this amendment simply and solely because I did not want the Dáil to give its consent to anything it had not seen.  I should stand for the principle on any ground whatever&mdash;whether in favour of the Government or not&mdash;that we should not be asked to give our consent to things blindfolded.  We are only asked to give our consent to those Articles on the paper.  That is the effect of Deputy Duggan's amendment. I do not care greatly whether this Treaty is ratified or not.  I do care much that we should confirm these Articles in principle, because if we do not, it will go round the world and be used in propaganda that we are in favour of rum-running and all the abuses which have gone on in connection with liquor legislation in the U.S.A.  That was the only reason that I asked the Minister if he would agree <Col N="3065" /> to put down an amendment to this effect. As he has done so, I think it is my duty to support him against the suggestion that it is a &ldquo;confidence trick.&rdquo;</P>

I gather from what has taken place that if the amendment were carried it would be taken to be approval of the motion, subject to that amendment. It almost appears that we are dealing with this amendment as if we were in Committee Stage: that Deputy Duggan had moved an amendment to the Minister's motion on behalf of the Minister.  I think it would be much more satisfactory if the Minister were allowed to alter the terms of his own motion.  Then we might discuss it on the merits.  But I can see, from the way the discussion is going, that if this motion is carried, it will be taken to be an agreement to ratification of these Articles of Agreement, <Col N="3066" /> not a mere acceptance of this form in preference to the other form.</P>

He has recited both to-day and on a former occasion a great many so-called authorities upon Constitutional law.  As often happens those who read those tomes in view of a purpose for which they desire to use them, he has become greatly befogged.

      <P>(reading): &ldquo;In Volume 1, page 666, it says: `The following order in making a Treaty is usually observed.  A first part, the so-called Preamble.' &rdquo; Observe that it is only a preamble, figuratively speaking. It is not a preamble in the sense in which a Preamble in an Act is a Preamble.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;the so-called Preamble comprises the names of the heads of the contracting States, of their duly authorised representatives, and the motives for the conclusion of the Treaty.  A second part consists of the primary stipulation in numbered Articles.  A third part consists of so-and-so.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the Deputy himself becomes interpreter. He says (Official Report):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have on the Order Paper certain Articles of Agreement and certain stipulations with regard to ratification and duration, but we have not got the first part of the Treaty, that is to say, the Preamble.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy should have said&mdash;and I am sure he will correct it&mdash;the &ldquo;so-called Preamble.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;We have not the last paragraph, <Col N="3070" /> that is, the signatures of the plenipotentiaries. It is, as I said, practically the unanimous opinion of all authorities on International Law that these various parts of Treaties are equally essential.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin, always an honest man, has given the accurate answer.  He has discovered a mare's nest, if you like, as well in the search for a King.  The names of the signatories and these other parts which are constituent elements of the Treaty are required, no doubt, to make the Treaty complete; that is to say, in order that this International instrument should be an instrument to operate.  Those elements must be present in it.  What has that got to do with the necessity of their presence when in the new Constitution and development of the British Commonwealth it becomes necessary to have a proposed or intended Treaty submitted to one of the Parliaments for ratification?  What are they to ratify?  Why the very Articles that are spoken of here in Oppenheim's description as the second part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing an amendment with regard to the substitution of the words &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo; in paragraphs 2 and 3, where the word <Col N="3071" />&ldquo;Treaty&rdquo; appears, and Deputy Esmonde argues against that with an argument which contains not merely the implication, but the explicit statement that in doing this we are asking the Dáil to perform a futile act, because what the Dáil ought to ratify, he says, is the Treaty, and Articles of Agreement for a Treaty do not form the Treaty.  Now, I do not hear any murmur of dissent from behind me, and consequently I take it that is an accurate account of the Deputy's position. He says, in effect, that we are called upon by the Minister for External Affairs to ratify a Treaty that we have not before us.</P>
      <P>There is an obvious confusion of thought involved in this argument.  A Treaty, according to Oppenheim&mdash;and he is an international law authority&mdash; to be an efficient instrument and to operate as an internationally-binding instrument, must have these constituent elements in it.  But under the constitutional practice that has developed in very recent years, as regards the interrelation of the constituent States of the British Commonwealth of Free Nations, it is necessary&mdash;though it is the one Crown, and the same Crown is the outward link and symbol of unity&mdash;to see that the Crown is the instrument through which the making of the Treaty, and the dissenting and assenting, is performed.  That is not binding on any one of the constituent members of the Commonwealth until that member has approved thereof, and any one of them can dissent.  Whereupon, it has been expressedly declared and reported, not in the Parliament of one Dominion, but in the Parliament of two Dominions, it will be officially recorded that such-and-such a Dominion has dissented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What must be brought before us, before the Free State can be said to have ratified this Treaty and become the assenting Party, and therefore bound by its provisions, are the Articles that are the very essence of the agreement. The United States and the British Commonwealth of Nations, as regards their constituent members, are to come to an agreement with regard to a certain operation in respect of liquor in <Col N="3072" /> ships on the high seas.  How can we say that we ratify a proposed agreement unless we have the terms of that agreement before us?  And again, what more do we require in order to express our agreement with the United States? Consequently, in bringing these Articles of Agreement before us to be ratified the Minister has done all that he is requested to do.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk arising out of cloudy discussions which has, if you will allow me to say so, become quite a practice here.  I speak feelingly on this subject, because I have been the victim of it no less than twice.  A Deputy starts some misconception of what has been said, and immediately, just like as in the middle ages when there were peculiar popular diseases, such, for instance, as the dancing mania, other Deputies take up the misconception. An example occurred here where a Deputy reminded me that Ireland did not require a Treaty in order to become a Nation.  If the words &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo; are substituted in Clauses 2 and 3, we are then in a position, when we adopt these, to have declared the mind of the Dáil in regard to what is proposed on the side of America.  That is really what America desires, and that is what we are interested in doing, and any supposed idea that something is being clouded and that something sinister is being hidden from view, is purely due&mdash;perhaps it would not be in order for me to say so&mdash;to a diseased imagination.</P>

There will be Article I., which will set out this so-called Preamble, and then will follow what we have ratified, Part 2, namely, these Articles of Agreement.  Consequently we are not in the clouds, we are not ratifying Articles of Agreement, and not aware that they are Articles on Agreement for a Treaty and Articles of Agreement between the United States and us, and not aware of what will be the frame-work in which these Articles of Agreement will be framed.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am like the other Deputies, rather in a fog as to the position we shall be in, in voting for this amendment.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled that the acceptance of this amendment would not affect the main issue.  I had suggested that an easier and a more satisfactory method of dealing with this matter would be for the Minister to be permitted to amend the motion himself so that we could be discussing the motion.  A discussion has taken place upon the motion itself so far as the ratification arises.  I gather that the opinion is fairly general that the question of approval of these Articles of Agreement might well be discussed. But I submit that there is a difference between approving of Articles of Agreement and approving of the ratification of the Treaty of which these Articles of Agreement form the body and basis.  So far as one can see and learn from the Minister's statement, these Articles of Agreement were submitted, and he said &ldquo;We were asked to bring this before the Dáil.&rdquo;  Did the negotiating parties, in negotiating this agreement, act on behalf of Saorstát Eireann?  If so they were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I take it that the negotiating authority was acting on behalf of the Saorstát and that in the compilation of those Articles of Agreement they had in mind the Saorstát. The regular phrases were used, &ldquo;His Britannic Majesty&rdquo; and &ldquo;Under the British Flag.&rdquo;  I can quite understand in the circumstances that that would be quite acceptable, but it might well have been the course to be pursued, if when these Articles of Agreement were submitted to the Minister by the negotiating authority, that we then might be asked did we approve that the Treaty, which we were informed this afternoon we were quite competent to make with the United States of America, should be made by Saorstát Eireann, and in such terms as would satisfy our desires.  I cannot quite read this amendment into the motion: &ldquo;Whereas the provisions of the said Articles of Agreement for a Treaty affect the interest of Saorstát Eireann and it is expedient that the same should be ratified in respect of Saorstát Eireann, Dáil Eireann approves of the ratification of said Articles of Agreement for a Treaty, and recommends that the said Articles of Agreement for a Treaty be ratified, and that the Executive Council do so advise the Crown.&rdquo; Then what follows?  That is what the Dáil would like to know.  What follows when we have approved of the ratification? Presuming the word &ldquo;ratification&rdquo; means confirming the Articles of Agreement, what follows?  What Treaty is to be made and what are to be the terms of that Treaty?  That is, I think, the question raised by Deputy Esmonde.  He asserts that the Treaty which would follow the approval of the Articles of Agreement would be the Treaty containing the preamble and the subscription and the tail and the rest of it that he read out.  That, I do not think, is going to meet with the acceptance of the Dáil.  But I am sure that the Dáil would agree to a Convention and a Treaty being made with the United States of America to assist that country to maintain its laws and to enforce its laws on the high seas.  Is it necessary that we should so approve of the Articles of Agreement as to involve <Col N="3076" /> also the approval of that Treaty in the form in which it has been submitted or read by Deputy Esmonde? I would suggest that the course that the Minister should take should be to ask the Dáil to approve of the Articles of Agreement and then proceed to make a treaty with the United States of America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I now beg to raise this question as to the Boundary Commission, of which I have given notice.  I gave notice of the question in order to secure a statement from the Government as to how this question stands at the moment.  It is now over five months since I last drew attention to this matter. On that occasion I had to make an observation at the beginning of my remarks that I feel inclined to make now, and that is to call attention to how much interest is manifested in this Northern question by Deputies.  I have not raised this question for any other than very serious reasons.  Five months have come and gone since the President, in reply to my statement, said that &ldquo;the Treaty is the law, and that its provisions must be carried out,&rdquo; or some words to that effect.  What has happened in the interval?  On that occasion when I raised this question I quoted from a statement made by the Minister for Home Affairs some time previously, when he said: &ldquo;As far as the Free State is concerned, its case is prepared.  The facts are collated and the relevant statistics are available.&rdquo; There were many reasons up to that time which warranted and justified the delay that had taken place.  I want to be made aware that equally good reasons have existed during the five months to which I have referred.  A Conference was then being mooted, and I think had been agreed to by the heads of the Saorstát&mdash;a Conference between representatives of the Saorstát, of the Northern Parliament and the British Government.  At that time I approved of the Conference, and thought I could construe it, not as a means on the part of certain people to try and evade the <Col N="3078" /> commitments of the Treaty, but as an effort to get Irish representatives from different parts of the country to come together and to meet in good faith, and come to an amicable understanding.</P>
      <P>That Conference met in London on February 1st&mdash;something over two months ago.  I cannot recollect that since it was convened and took place and terminated, that there has been any report to this Assembly as to its proceedings. The responsible Minister in England, Mr. Thomas, stated on February 28th as follows&mdash;&ldquo;They accepted the Treaty in the spirit and in the letter and desired to give effect to it.  They would carry out its provisions for the setting up of a Commission for the settlement of the Boundary between the Irish Free State and the North of Ireland Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is over two months since the Conference met, and so far as we are concerned, or so far as we know, the position remains the same as it was five months ago when I raised this question here.  One begins to wonder what is the meaning of this, and one requires some assurance, and I hope we will get it tonight, that this Conference business is not a manoeuvre to find a way out, and to find a means by which the carrying out of Clause 12 of the Treaty may be evaded by the British and the Northern Parliament.  I hope we will get some assurance on that point.  I think it is pertinent to remark that one Dublin paper to-day suggested that this Conference is to re-assemble again in a fortnight. What is it to re-assemble for? What is it to discuss?  The terms of the Treaty governing this question were explicit and definite.  Clause 12 of the Treaty is known to all here who have taken an interest in this matter.  It commits the British Government to assent to the setting up of this Boundary Commission and to decide the boundary in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants. We have had one Conference over two months ago, and so far as we know it has come to nothing.  Is it going to meet again to go over the same ground to try and find a way out of Clause 12 or is it going to discuss ways and means of putting Clause 12 into operation?  I say we have a responsibility to our people in the North in this matter. <Col N="3079" /> Those of you who read yesterday's papers will have noticed what seemed to me when I read it&mdash;an agonising cry of despair from the North, at the conference of representative men held in Omagh on Sunday.  The reverend chairman at that meeting said, in the course of his speech, &ldquo;We seem to be utterly forgotten, and all our efforts ignored, and now we find ourselves back in pre-emancipation days.&rdquo;  We have a responsibility to these people who have looked to us to see that they were not going to be deserted, and that they were not going to be forgotten.  We have a right to look to our Executive Council to see that that betrayal shall not take place.  Things have been happening up there which are worthy of comment.  As regards the Northern Government, if time allowed I might keep the Dáil for hours discussing matters that have been happening up there, and I think it would not be a waste of time, because information on this point seems to be but little known to a considerable element in this Dáil.  I will not refer now to the pogroms that have gone on up there without anyone being brought to book.  I refer, though, to the thing which is now cutting the great majority of our people in at least Tyrone and Fermanagh out of the pale of civilised life.</P>
    <P>The Northern Government have carried through a jerrymandering scheme which has had the result of practically disfranchising the great majority in both Tyrone and Fermanagh.  In Tyrone a majority of 15,000 Catholics, which is synonymous with the term &ldquo;Nationalist&rdquo; up there, and who were able to have a majority of ten on the County Council, have, as the result of the jerrymandering operation of the Northern Government, had that majority of ten for the Nationalists converted into a majority of fifteen for the minority. Police officers are going round different Orange Lodges making bitter anti-Catholic speeches, and these are men who are supposed to be leaders of the Forces that control law and order.  I wonder what would be thought if some head official of the Civic Guard went down to some part of the South of Ireland and made bitter anti-Protestant <Col N="3080" /> speeches.  I think the world would ring with horror from those now posing as the advocates of law and order in this particular section in this country.  I believe we will have to adjourn this discussion at nine o'clock, and I want to give the President time to make some response to my appeal.  Though I might speak at very great length, and I would like to do so, I shall refrain from saying more than a few additional words.  I believe that the time has come to end anything that might stand in the way of the setting up of the Boundary Commission.  The time for parleying has finished, and the object of any further attempt to waste time will be quite obvious.  We know that the British Government has not got exactly what might be termed fixity of tenure, and we know that the Northern Government are refusing to co-operate with the Free State because they are looking forward to the termination of that Government in order that they may see their friends back in power to stand by them in this matter.  We know they want to keep this thing hanging back in the hope that the present British Government will go out of office.  We know that during all this time since the Treaty was signed they have been digging themselves in, entrenching their position in every direction, and every week that passes by now will only help them in this matter. I wonder are the Dáil and the Executive of the Free State going to acquiesce in that?</P>
    <P>There is one other point I want to mention.  It is something perhaps bigger and broader than the Northern aspect.  This whole question of uncertainty about the North is holding up our whole national economic life.  We do not know what the territory of Saorstát Eireann is that we are to operate on. We do not know what area will be affected by the Railway Bill, or what railways will be in our territory.  We cannot get down to sound principles to frame an economic policy until this question is decided.  I sometimes think that there are influences operating in the Saorstát, posturing as friendly to the Saorstát, affecting to be trying to secure a reconciliation between the Saorstát and the North, but whose real purpose is to play into the hands of the men in the North who will have no friendship with <Col N="3081" /> us, and to make sure as far as reasonably possible that what the North-East Belfast politicians are seeking will be secured, and that Clause 12 of the Treaty will become a dead letter.  I sometimes think there is a north-east wind blowing down upon our statesmen here which is cooling or blurring their perception of these things.  Well, whether that is so or not, certainly the delay and the lack of information on what the position is all appears that this same process of delay is still going to continue.  All this is very disconcerting and very disheartening and very trying, and I have raised this question certainly not with any idea of embarrassing our Government in its negotiations, but in the belief that the time is overdue for a Government statement on this matter, and I sincerely hope that that statement will be one that will be reassuring to us, and that will be a message to those who made that cry of despair in the North a few days ago.  I hope it will be a message to them that their interests and their future are not being forgotten, and that their interests and their future are as dear to the Executive of the Saorstát as any other part of Ireland, and that the Government has made up its mind that the time for delay is past, and that the next move in this matter will be a definite emphatic assurance or intimation to the British Government that no further delay would be tolerated, and that the Boundary Commission must be set up forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not anything to add to what I already said on this subject five months ago.  We attended a Conference by request, and agreed to resume within a month in good faith.  Illness unfortunately overtook one of the members, and illness is a human frailty that even Governments, however independent or incontestible their rights, cannot guard against.  We have expressed much regret at the illness of Sir James Craig.  Had illness occurred to our side the place of the <Col N="3082" /> member so afflicted would have been filled, but we are not responsible for the place of Sir James Craig not being filled on the other side.  We attended that conference, as I have stated, on terms, not by any means giving away any rights that we had under the Treaty.  We are as desirous now as we were then of exhausting every possible means to effect and bring about the unity of the country.  We are prepared to go a long way towards effecting that unity, and we do not regard the Boundary Commission as the last word upon the settlement of this matter between the six, or the four, North-Eastern Counties and the rest of this country.  In the absence of a better method of arrangement we are holding on to it, but we are prepared to do everything in our power to bring about a better solution.  We are satisfied that ours is the responsibility for determining what the people whom we represent want in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are getting, and have got, a good deal of gratuitous advice from certain journals in England, certain prominent people in the Free State, certain prominent people in England, and certain prominent people in Northern Ireland, as to what should be done, and as to how it should be done.  I should say that a good deal of that advice might be reserved by the donors for their own benefit.  I am not impressed at all by any exaggerated statement, and I do not like to hear a cry of despair going up from any part of the country.  If a cry of despair had gone up from the Twenty-six Counties during the last four, five, or six years we would not be in the position to-day of talking about carrying out any particular Article of the Treaty that we entered into with Great Britain.  We accept and are fully conscious of our responsibility to the Oireachtas, and to the Oireachtas we are prepared to answer for every step that we have taken in this matter, for every act that we have done, and for every letter that we have written.  I am sure that on consideration Deputy Milroy will realise that it is not with the Government of the day that any arrangement has been entered into between Ireland and Great Britain in this matter, and that the British <Col N="3083" /> Government of the day, or of any time, realise that it is not with the Government of the day here that they are concerned in carrying out the Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but that does not affect the issue in the least and I say that very advisedly, both on one side and on the other.  It is not with the personnel of the Government of the day here or the personnel of the Government of the day on the other side, that the terms of the Treaty are to be carried out, and I deprecate mixing up the personnel, or the Party feelings, or the Party associations of the Government of the day in England or the Government of the day here with this matter.  If we were to depend on what is accepted in certain circles as to the length of time that the Government is going to exist, I suppose we might say that our existence would not be very long.  I am not saying it is so, or admitting it; I am not a sensation monger, but if we were to accept the interpretation of the sensation mongers the life of this Government, I suppose, would not be very long.  I read of a prominent public man in this country who described himself a short time ago as being an undemobbed soldier, and now I believe he has taken on himself another role.  Not since the time of David have I known of a man being a soldier and a prophet at the same time.  It may seem ridiculous to mention these things, but I mention them for a particular reason.  It is quite <Col N="3084" /> possible there are people in the Six Counties, who have given this peculiar cry of despair, from certain little incidents that happen down here now and again.  As a very clever Press representative said the other day, we never put away one crisis until there is another on hand.  I think it was about the best thing I read for a long time. That cry of despair may have come from the fact that events down here were not like a mothers' meeting.  It is quite possible, also, that the cry of despair came because the life of the Government in another place may not appear to be very long.  That is not the question. We have not given away one single inch of our rights under the Treaty, and we are not going to do so. Our judgement, perhaps, may not be as exact as that of some others.  There are people who may say, &ldquo;You should have done this at a particular time,&rdquo; and we say,.  &ldquo;We did not think it was the best time to do it.&rdquo;  To that extent, I admit, we may have made a mistake. If so, I have the responsibility; I accept that responsibility, and if the Dáil considers that particular action should have been taken at a particular time I will accept a motion to that effect and deal with it.</P>

      <P>One application for dependents' allowance was received from Mrs. Culleton.  She was informed on the 9th July, 1923, that her claim had been disallowed after the investigation on the ground that the amount normally contributed by her son to his home over and above the cost of his own maintenance therein for a reasonable period prior to enlistment was less than the minimum required by the regulations, 12s. per week, before an allowance might be issued.</P>
