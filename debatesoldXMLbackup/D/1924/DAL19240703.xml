      <P>asked the President whether his attention has been called to a statement in the Press that it is intended to introduce legislation to render the Small Dwellings Act, 1899, in conjunction with the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, operative, by providing the necessary powers to enable the Civic Administration to acquire capital for this purpose; and, if so, if he will state when such measure will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Small Dwellings Acquisition (Ireland) Acts, 1899 to 1919, as amended by the Housing Act, 1921, empower local authorities to make advances to persons for the purchase of dwellinghouses in which they reside or intend to reside, and the market values of which do not exceed £800.  The advance in each case is restricted to 90 per cent. of the market value of the premises.  These Acts are still operative, and no further legislation is required to enable local authorities to exercise their powers under them.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to receive applications from local authorities for sanction to the raising of loans in the open market for the purpose of making advances under the Acts.</P>

Bedford-Cameron, on the 20th February, 1922, and for which he holds a receipt, have not been returned to him, and why the letters addressed by Mr. Cameron to the Acting Q.M.G., Chief Ordnance Office, Island Bridge, on the 11th February, 1924, and on the 14th April, 1924, were not answered, and whether, in the event of those guns not being available, he will make arrangements for the payment of compensation to the owner.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that three bicycles, valued at £22 10s., the property of Mr. Patrick Dunne, Greenhills, Kill, Straffan, Co. Kildare, were commandeered by Adjutant Rooney, of Naas Barracks, on July 29th, 1922, and afterwards used by the military for patrol work; whether a receipt for same was given by the Adjutant, which was subsequently lost by Mr. Dunne; whether three applications for compensation were forwarded to Claims Office, from which Office he was informed that no charge could be entertained against Army Funds in respect of this claim, and whether he will have inquiries made with a view to payment of compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In July, 1922, as a result of information received to the effect that a meeting of Irregulars was in progress, troops from Naas raided Mr. Dunne's house.  Four men escaped on the occasion, but four bicycles found on the premises were seized by the troops.  I may mention that two members of this family are Irregulars, and <Col N="339" /> were interned for a time.  One was captured in arms.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances, it is not practicable to entertain a claim for compensation in respect of the bicycles, which cannot now be traced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 repeals an Act to which we devoted some time, though not a great deal of time, in this session.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Elections Postponement Act, 1922 (No. 4 of 1922), shall be <Col N="344" /> and is hereby amended by the substitution of the words and figures &ldquo;31st day of March, 1925,&rdquo; for the words and figures &ldquo;1st day of January, 1924,&rdquo; where the last mentioned words and figures occur in sub-section (1) of Section 1 and subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Act aforesaid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment to Section 2: &ldquo;To delete, in line 16, the words and figures `31st day of March, 1925,' and to substitute therefor the words and figures `20th day of December, 1924.'&rdquo;  I put down this amendment as some sort of security that when the Dáil reassembles in October we shall get on to the Local Government Bill and not have it pushed aside by the Army Bill that has been promised, and possibly by other measures left over from this session. This is a matter which has been crying out for reform for a long time, and there is very grave discontent amongst a large number of ratepayers, that they cannot alter the composition of their local governing bodies.  I think that feeling should be met to the extent of postponing the elections for as brief a period as possible.  I put down the 20th December.  Originally I put down the 31st December, but then I came to the conclusion that during the last days of December peace and good-will should prevail, and that cannot be entirely associated with an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no reason why, if the Local Government Bill is proceeded with in an adequate and business-like fashion, if instead of meeting two or three days in the week and then adjourning for ten days, as we did last Autumn, we settle down to work and tackle the Bill from the day we re-assemble and do a good working week on the &ldquo;work of the nation,&rdquo; as Deputy O'Connor would say, we should not get the Local Government Bill through by the end of November.  Knowing that it is going through, the Minister will be in a position to make all the necessary preparations for this election.  The elections for these bodies have been postponed too long already and it is for the Minister to make a case that we should not have them for another nine months. This amendment of mine would postpone <Col N="345" /> them for six months.  I think that is the longest reasonable period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I contemplated putting down an amendment to insert the 1st December as the date, but I found that Deputy Cooper had, some time previously, put in an amendment for the 20th December.  There was very little to choose between Deputy Cooper's amendment and mine, and I gave way because, in a sense, it was really an equation of converging identities.  There is no doubt that the country is suffering, and suffering very seriously, from the absence of a local election.  It may be strange to Deputies, but it is an undoubted and incontrovertible fact that we have had no popular and free election for ten years. The last election, at which candidates were free to go up, without being charged with the crime of antinationalism, was in 1914.  The elections would, normally, have come around in 1917, but because of the Great War the elections were postponed until peace was proclaimed.  In 1919 the British Government deferred the holding of the elections because they wanted, as they pretended, to give rights to minorities, and they introduced a Proportional Representation Bill.  The passage of that Bill necessitated the postponement of the elections until 1920. When 1920 came the then political party which held power in Ireland determined to make the elections a political issue, because it was felt that they should get control of local administration to help them to fight out the struggle against England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A consequence of that was that many persons, who normally would not be selected, or elected to local bodies, got control.  I am not objecting, in a sense, to that, but I say that the necessity which called forth these men, has long since ceased.  As a matter of fact, we should have had an election, not alone last year, but even in 1922, if it were possible.  The necessity that called forth those men, had, as I said, ceased and their representative right should have reverted to the people rather than be held by men who, in the real sense, had not a representative status. Several Amending Bills have since been passed postponing the elections.  This, <Col N="346" /> I think, is the culmination.  It is proposed now to put the election back to 31st March next, and the reason given for that is that we must have a Local Government Bill passed into law, and that some necessary changes will be enacted which will make a fresh election essential.  Though I am rather suspicious of those reforms, having some experience of their effects in years gone by, I will not, in this case, push it too far.  But I say it is quite possible for the Minister, by accelerating the work in his department to have everything ready for the 20th December. Let us have the elections.  The country is crying out for them and they are long overdue.  There was what I consider a false cry raised here about the question of cost.  The elections were due last year in the normal course of events, yet under this Bill it is proposed to put them off for another nine months&mdash;in other words, to have them practically two years overdue.  If it is felt to be a waste of money to hold elections now, or elections next December, I contend that it is equally a waste of money, taking it strictly from the utilitarian point of view, to have elections even twelve months or nine months hence.  Democracy is something.  Democracy has, I think, reached its adolescent stage, but I maintain that if you pit utilitarianism against democracy, democracy col lapses.  This plea of economy will not hold water.  I feel rather strongly on this matter.  I feel that the chaotic conditions in local administration from which this country is suffering and suffering very severely are due altogether to the absence of elections, and the denial to the people of the right to elect the persons they desire.  Therefore, I strongly press this amendment on the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Deputy alleges that the members of the public boards do not now in reality represent the people.  On some boards, which I had the honour of being a member of, from 1920 up to the time of the Truce, we could never get a quorum.  The only members who turned up were a few of the Labour representatives, and these men did their best to carry on their duties in the ratepayers' interest in the absence of the other elected representatives. I quite agree that the elections are overdue.  I further agree that the winter time is not the time to hold elections. If they are postponed until March 31st, everybody in the country will have become acclimatised and they will not have that nervous feeling in selecting candidates and voting for them.  I am quite satisfied that the elections should be postponed, and I think that this amendment is uncalled for.  I do not say that because Deputy Hogan had thrown in his lot with Deputy Cooper.  In Westmeath the rates in 1920 were 7s. 4d. in the £, and they have not been increased since, as the rates were 7s. 4d. in the £ at the end of the last financial year.  The rates have been reduced by something like 1s. 6d. in the £.  I fail to see how it can be said that the councillors in Westmeath were not acting in the interests of the <Col N="348" /> ratepayers.  Deputy Hogan has referred to the 1920 election.  I do not like publicly to say that the representatives of a certain class of people, who had not the moral courage at the time to come and do their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was pleased with the spirit of Deputy Cooper's speech in favour of his amendment, and I hope that he will maintain that form when we come to discuss the Local Government Bill later on.  He seems to be very anxious to get that Bill through, and I need hardly say that I am also very anxious.  I may repeat that I am not at all anxious for the postponement of elections.  There is nobody in the Dáil who suffers more or meets with greater difficulty as the result of postponing the elections than I do.  It is continually being thrown up at me, if it is necessary for me to take any strong steps in any particular direction, that the obvious remedy is to hold elections.  I would be very glad to get rid of that argument once and for all.  After going into all the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> in this matter we have decided that the only alternative is to postpone the elections.  This Bill is not mandatory, except in so far as it fixed the 31st March as the last day on which elections can be held.  It will be possible to make an order directing that the elections should be held at any intervening period, if necessary. I fixed the 31st March, because that is the end of the financial year, and because I considered that the main thing above all was that the new councils should be in for the framing of next year's estimates.  I do not think that there is anything to be gained by picking out any arbitrary date like the 20th of December.</P>

      <P>They usually frame them in February.  However, that is the end of the financial year, and that is the main thing.  I do not know if Deputy Cooper quite realises the implication of his amendment.  Fixing the 20th December for the elections would work out so that it would leave me very little time to get the Bill through.  The date of the election, in Local Government elections, is the date of polling.  In Dáil elections it is the date of nomination.  Publication of notice of the election should take place thirty-five days before the date of the election.  That would mean that publication of notice of the election should take place on the 15th November.  In the notice of election, the areas of election and the number of councillors who are to be elected, should be specified. These are two doubtful factors until the Bill has been passed through its final stages.  Neither I, nor anybody else, would be in a position to say what number should be elected, because the numbers may be amended up to that particular date.  That will mean, if we allow time for my Department to make the necessary arrangements and to issue the necessary Orders, that the Bill would want to be through all its stages by 1st November.  I hope it will be through, and I will do everything in my power to get the Bill through by 1st November.</P>
      <P>But there are too many doubtful factors to be taken into consideration for me to state definitely here that I can be certain the Bill will be through by that date.  I do not know even at present when the Dáil and the Seanad are going to reassemble.  I do not know what urgent matters may arise in the meanwhile, which may make it necessary to put off this Bill may be for a few weeks, and I do not know how long Deputies will take in discussing the Bill during its various stages.  For all these reasons I think it would be very unwise for me to accept a date of that kind which would really defeat the whole object of this Bill, which is to prevent us from putting the country to the expense and inconvenience of holding two elections instead of one.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech has confirmed my worst fears. The progress of the Local Government Bill is to be a matter of `if's&rdquo; and &ldquo;ands&rdquo;&mdash;if he can get it through by the 1st November; if the Dáil meets, etc.  There is evidently no real determination to press on with it.  I promise him if he does that I will assist, consider and amend the Bill to the best of my ability.  I have great respect for Deputy McCarthy's opinion, and, when he is reinforced by Deputy Lyons, that respect is doubled.  But I have no respect whatever for the argument that it is impossible to hold an election in the winter.  I wonder if Deputy McCarthy ever knew of any election held in July?  The argument that you cannot hold an election in winter is really not founded on any fact.  I have had some experience of it.  I have fought a Parliamentary election over a wide area in December and in January, and one is not really handicapped by the darkness.  One might be, and sometimes is, handicapped by the weather. I do not know if Deputy McCarthy can promise the Minister fine weather in July, if he held the election.  Deputy McCarthy would be wise not to.  The only point on which the Minister did give me some cause to reconsider this amendment was on the point of machinery&mdash;the point of giving notice, and so on.  I did not intend to press him to have his Bill through by the 15th November.  If the Bill got through the Dáil and Seanad before the Christmas Recess, probably then he would be in a position to hold elections at once.  I have not the Bill with me, but I do not remember anything in it about altering the electoral areas.  I do not see why the necessary notice should not be given pending the passing of the Bill.  If that is so, I would be prepared <Col N="351" /> to withdraw this amendment.  But barring that I have not heard a valid argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister's statement regarding the period of notice may have some validity but the effect of it is simply to confirm one's previously expressed view that this Bill ought not to go through in its present form, but that we ought not to allow the Minister to defer the elections until March next.  Everything that he has said rather suggests to me that when we come to December or January next we shall have another Bill for the postponing of local elections. He has no right to count so faithfully as he does upon the passing of the Local Government Bill as he at present wishes that it should be passed. That is a matter for the Dáil.  The Dáil or the Seanad may decide to alter it very considerably, may decide not to accept it at all.  Even he himself might decide to amend it very materially when he has had the reports of those various commissions that he suggested on the Second Stage, and in a general way the question of the future Local Government of the country is quite indefinite, vague and in the air, according to the Minister's own statements. The real remedy is to have the elections at the earliest possible date, and then perhaps in your Local Government Bill, when it assumes the final shape, you can define a day from which the councils to be elected this year would cease to exist in that form, or have some transition clause, such as has been introduced into other Bills, which would cover over the interim period.  But to agree to the 31st March is practically telling the Dáil that the chances of an election during the coming winter are very small indeed.  The estimates ought to be available for the councils by the 31st March.  The Minister says that they would begin to discuss them in February.  Some councils discuss them before February.  But the councils that are to be elected must be elected some time prior to February to get hold of the question of the estimates with anything like thoroughness. That suggests that there must be an election before January if the councils <Col N="352" /> are to do what is looked for regarding estimated expenditure for the following year.  Hence we are driven back either to December or some date after March.  The Minister is contending that the elections should be held some time in the spring, before the 31st March.  I suggest that if he intends that he is asking the new councils to deal with the administration of the year 1925-26 and the expenses of that administration, ignorant of their new duties and of the responsibilities attaching thereto in respect of the estimates, that further confirms me in the view that the Minister does not intend that there shall be elections before next summer.</P>

      <P>Is it not in the hands of the Dáil as to whether or not this Bill is to become law soon after we re-assemble? If the Dáil is anxious that this Bill should become law surely Deputies can put in whatever amendments they have to put in in good time, and they can see that the Minister, or the Executive Council, gives precedence to this Bill over any other measure.  Deputy Cooper said that there was no change being made.  I think there is a provision in the Bill where the membership of county councils is to be increased, and that will have to run the gauntlet of the Dáil and of the Seanad, so that we are making changes, and as the Minister has stated he is not in a position to make regulations unless he has the text of the Bill in its final form before him; there is nothing to be gained by putting in the 20th of December. That, to my mind, is an impossible date, but if the Dáil is anxious that this measure should pass, the elections could be held any day&mdash;one month after the Bill is passed&mdash;and I think the date, the 31st March, is merely put in to give the Minister ample time for making any regulations which have to be made when the Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>Suppose that my amendment is defeated, and suppose that the 31st March is retained in the Bill, I wonder does the Minister propose to hold the elections on the 31st of March on the current year's register, or will he have a fresh register issued?  I think that under the electoral law it would not be possible to <Col N="353" /> have a register ready by the 31st of March, so that that would mean further postponing the elections.  After all, is not the old register the register that the Dáil was elected on, and if it is good enough to elect the Dáil surely it is good enough to elect a county council?  Deputy Hughes wanted to make the point that the Minister should make certain regulations about county councillors.  He is certainly doubling the number of county councillors, but I am not aware that he is altering the areas in which these county councillors will be elected, and as the elections will be held under Proportional Representation very little change is required under the regulations.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputy Connor Hogan is quite right in some of his statements.  We will hold the elections on what he calls the old register, but it is really a new register. It has just been completed, and in fact I am not quite sure whether it is yet completed for the whole country or not. As I said before, the 31st of March is not mandatory.  I could make an order to have an election held at a date much sooner than that if it was found possible to do so, but I do not wish to have my hands tied up by legal restrictions so that I might possibly be in the position of having to come before the Dáil and apply for another Postponement of Elections Act.  Deputy Cooper has accused us of a lack of foresight in our manner of introducing legislation.  It is probably because we see possible difficulties in the way that I am trying to make doubly sure, by allowing ourselves sufficient time, and I do not think there is much to be said between the 31st March and the 20th December. However, if it meets with Deputy Cooper's view I would be willing to make an order to hold the elections on the 20th December provisionally, while at the same time taking power, if I find it necessary, to postpone them to the 31st March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>On yesterday <Col N="356" /> afternoon I listened to the debate on the Vote of £250,000 for these relief schemes.  The criticisms and arguments used in the debate were used to emphasise distress in the first place, and, secondly, to have more money applied to relieve it.  These were the two particular features that were approached by Deputies in considering this Vote.  Now I feel that it is not so much the amount of money as the fact that there is distress, widespread and particularly acute in the congested areas, urgent at the moment.  While other Deputies pointed out the widespread necessity of relief from the point of view of distress, there were very few suggestions made here with regard to the best way to relieve that distress.  Deputy Hewat dealt with it from the point of view of money being given in the shape of a grant which would not be reproductive, and he asserted what I think was quite true, that if such a system is adopted, it will mean that this situation will become chronic and permanent, and that it is likely to be a permanent drag on the State.  I think that argument is irrefutable. Deputy Good made one suggestion, the only one that I think was really of importance, and that was the question of applying moneys from this grant to the improvement of the harbours and landing-places all around the coast in the congested areas.  I think that was a very valuable suggestion.  It will give employment while these works are being done in the areas where employment is most urgently needed, and it will give us, as a result, a chance of being able to develop the fishing industry as it must be developed in this country.  It will also give our people an opportunity of being able to engage in that industry and become self supporting. They will then be able to earn a livelihood themselves, without any aid from relief schemes or from the State.  I would urge that the Ministry should consider that suggestion very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the roads and their improvement is being undertaken.  It is very useful work at the moment, but it only touches the fringe of the question. After all it will not be on the same status as to reproductive returns <Col N="357" /> or results as money expended on the harbours.  In the county that I know best, that is, my own county, the people there are ready and anxious and willing to work.  They are capable of doing good work and are not likely to demand an unreasonable wage.  The industries in that county that were able to provide for the people, pre-war, and keep them busily engaged are at the present time lying idle.  We have the homespun industry, the carpet industry, our hosiery manufacture, our shirt-making industry, our granite industry and our kelp industry all lying dormant and idle.  These only require some consideration and some assistance to be given, not so much in the shape of financial assistance as in the way of arranging markets for the disposal of their products.  Assistance might also be given in the way of arranging for such transport facilities as will make these works profitable, and enable them to be conducted on a profitable basis, the shirt-making industry particularly. Derry city, which is in the Co. Donegal, has become famous as a shirt-making centre all over the world, but up to about 18 years ago, at the time it was earning this reputation, very few shirts were made in Derry.  They were made in the Co. Donegal, and on the basis of the expert work done there Derry earned its reputation for shirt-making. Now what is the fact?  All the shirts are made in the factory in Derry.  The Trade Board we have has actually fixed a wage in the Co. Donegal at a 1/2d. per hour above the fixed wage fixed by the same Board in the City of Derry.  I consider that policy is altogether absurd, and why that should be done to deprive these people of being able to earn a livelihood that they are capable of earning, unless they proceed to do work illegally or to evade the provision of the Trade Board Act, seems very strange.  That is the position that they are placed in, if they engage in work which they are well capable of doing.</P>
    <P>I think the Government should take full notice of those things.  I do believe in the stress of work which has fallen upon our Executive, they have not been able to take into account the circumstances that apply in such areas <Col N="358" /> outside.  They have not had the time. I do urge them to find some means of applying themselves towards discovering what are the actual facts and the difficulties that are making it imperative that we should have to provide money for relief schemes, whereas in the particular areas involved it is quite possible to arrange that the people there can be made self-supporting without any need for grants at intervals, or even continuous grants.  However trifling, I believe a sum of £250,000 would enable a start to be made.  If the Government wish they could proceed in the right direction, and the Dáil will have no difficulty in supplementing that grant and giving the money required to do work so valuable to the nation, work that will save the nation in future from the situation we have to face to-day with regard to unprecedented distress.</P>

      <P>I want to say that £250,000 may seem a fairly large sum, but when it is distributed amongst 80,000 unemployed it will not relieve <Col N="359" /> very much distress.  If it would be feasible, another £250,000 should be added and then it might be possible to get something done to relieve distress.  I see by the Press that the Labour Party proposed £3,000,000, or some large sum yesterday, and they were defeated.  I wonder would the Party support my suggestion to increase this amount to £500,000?</P>

      <P>Some time ago I asked if it would be possible to get a grant for the purpose of reviving industries. There are many corn mills idle in the country and the expenditure of a little money would help to re-start them. Perhaps the Government might see their way to purchase factories that are closed down in several towns for the purpose of giving employment to the people there.  That would be much better than to spend the money through the Labour Exchanges in the form of doles.  It has sometimes been suggested here that the workers go to the Labour Exchanges more or less with their hands out for alms when they are willing and able to work for the money they get.  It would be much better if the Government purchased and re-started factories that have been closed down through labour disputes or otherwise.  Factories have been closed or ruined through trade disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often it does happen that the employer cannot agree with the employees, or the employees do not agree with the employer; the works are closed down and probably they are never opened again.  Then there is a cry out for assistance.  If the Government are really serious with regard to relieving distress, the first thing they should do would be to introduce some measure in order that they may be able to settle such disputes as arise, and that would be detrimental to industry.  They might be able to intervene in cases where employers, through the closing down of their business, would be about to leave the country.  In such a case as that, unless some one intervened, the workers might never be reinstated.  I have in <Col N="360" /> mind a saw-mill that has been closed down for a number of years.</P>

      <P>There are no definite schemes at present elaborated for consideration in respect to this £250,000.  Already £40,000 have been provisionally allocated to congested districts and £10,000 to water works and drainage schemes in Dingle.  Other than those two sums, there have been no special allocations out of this fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the allocation of £40,000 for congested districts.  It is obviously wholly inadequate for the situation that we all know exists.  Let me just briefly state facts I have had communicated from friends to me.  I could give the names of families whom they concern.  Usually these families live on two sources of income.  One is the potato that they sow in small patches, and the other is money earned by harvesting.  Last year's potato crop was bad; the potatoes failed about February or March of this year.  Ordinarily the people would have had, during the period between the going out of old potatoes in February and the coming in of new potatoes about the end of July or the beginning of August, nothing but dry bread to live upon, made from the white flour they would purchase from the shops with money earned in the previous year's harvesting. Last year's harvest was bad, and the majority of those who went away brought back very little&mdash;some of them nothing at all.  The potatoes have failed, and, in villages adjacent to the sea, fishing has been bad.  There has been no money to purchase flour, and the people in many districts were actually starving.  White flour-made bread is a forgotten luxury, and the people are living on Indian meal twice a day.  Cases have been reported to me asking for influence to be used with philanthropists to assist those places where babies in arms are being fed on the white of an egg beaten up with bog water.  I have seen that actually myself <Col N="362" /> in past times, and I am not at all too credulous in believing that it is happening now.  These facts exist from North of Donegal to Kerry.  I could mention the names of families in Connemara, Achill, and Belmullet who are actually starving.</P>
      <P>They are the finest people in the world and some of the best friends that anyone could have.  To speak under such circumstances of £40,000 is to speak in terms of a sum of money that is entirely inadequate for distress that is very grievous indeed.  If the entire sum of money were to be allocated to the congested districts it would hardly suffice to deal with the need that is present there, and which apparently is to get worse, because the latest information is that light has appeared in the potato crop, so that the situation between now and the autumn will be one of great peril.  I hope that enquiry will be made to ascertain what the facts are by those who will be sent down to report upon them, and that, when these have been found, measures will be taken to meet the situation by the allocation of a much larger sum of money.  We heard Deputy Hewat yesterday speak of the necessity of meeting conditions like these by the expenditure of money that would be reproductive. We are all agreed with that, but here is a need and here is distress that exists, and there is no time to deal with it in such manner as to deal with the roots of the origin of the trouble.  The people are now in sore distress, and the only way in which it can be met is by immediate alleviation, even though that immediate alleviation be not of a kind calculated to be reproductive, and the wisest form of expenditure will be, at least, for the maintenance of life in those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support very strongly the appeal of Deputy Figgis that this sum of £40,000 which has been allocated should be very considerably increased so far as the congested areas are concerned. There is no doubt whatever in the minds of Deputies in this House, or in the minds of anybody who knows the congested areas, that £40,000 will go a very small way indeed towards relieving the present distress that exists <Col N="363" /> there.  If that is the sum that is to be expended it is certain there are many areas there which will get no relief whatever.  I would like to press this point which has been mentioned by Deputy Figgis, that this is the particular time of the year when distress is greatest.  Anyone who knows the conditions of life in the West knows that July is spoken of as the hungry month. At this time they have just got in the new seed and are waiting for the new crop, and they have nothing to live on except what they get from friends in America and from the harvesting in England.  I urge that a much greater sum than £40,000 should be allocated. The congestion is greater now than it will be in October or November, when the harvest comes in.  The amount available in this Vote is £250,000.  We hold that it is not enough, even with the allocation that the President has mentioned, £40,000 to the Congested Districts Board and £10,000 to waterworks in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The £40,000 is not for the Congested Districts Board, but for the congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that; it is for the areas covered by the late Congested Districts Board.  That sets free £50,000, and there is still £200,000 available, and I strongly press that a considerable proportion of that sum should be set free now, because the distress is greater now than it will be later on.  Men are there looking for work, and it is easy for Deputies, like Deputy Hewat, to speak of the extension of industry and the need for peace and stability, but that kind of talk does not go down with men who are hungry, and who are willing and ready to work if work is provided for them.  It is not profitable to talk about stability and peace to such men.  I urge as strongly as I can on the Ministry the necessity for dealing with this problem.  I agree with Deputy Hewat, of course, that reform should be permanent reform, but what is going to happen in the interval when we are trying to make it a permanent reform?  We must deal with it in a temporary way.  This is one way, in any case, to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Deputy Sears pointed out very wisely yesterday that if we are to have faith in the measures taken under the Land Act and by the Minister of Agriculture, and that they are to go a long way&mdash; and I am one of those who have that faith that they will go a long way to relieve that chronic distress that does exist in those districts&mdash;we should see that while waiting for the coming into full operation of the Land Act, distress should not be most acute.  That is why I urge, at this particular time, that the Government should use the fund which is here ready to be voted, even though we hold that it is not enough.  They should use all of it to relieve the very pressing distress that exists in those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY (Cork) Mr. T. MURPHY (Cork)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY (Cork)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputies who stated that the amount of this grant is altogether inadequate. I also agree with the Deputy who said yesterday that the Government are really tinkering with this problem. During the course of this debate we have heard a good deal about the distress in different parts of Ireland, particularly in the West and the NorthWest of the country.  I would like to point out that distress, on a scale that is perhaps not much less, exists in other parts of the country.  Portion of the constituency that I represent&mdash; West Cork&mdash;is in a particularly deplorable condition at the present time.  The islands near Skibbereen, the district around Castletownbere, and the whole of the western portion of Cork County, are in a pitiable way.  There are two islands.  These are islands, Hare Island and Shirken Island, where the people have not sufficient food at the present time. There are places where people have not got a square meal for a long time.  A Deputy belonging to the Government Party who lives in the vicinity, Deputy Connolly, if he were here, could bear that matter out.  In Hare Island there is no road, and though the matter has been brought to the notice of the Government on different occasions, nothing has been done.  The people have to go very long distances to the nearest town, Skibbereen, in order to transact whatever business they have to do, and the journey for a good many of them takes a couple of days.  The position in <Col N="365" /> other remote portions of County Cork is equally bad.  I live in a small town in West Cork.  I am able to prove that quite recently within a few miles of that town there were two deaths due to actual starvation.  It ought to be very encouraging to the relatives of the two children who died from starvation to hear themselves described, as they were described yesterday, as ca' canny individuals who wanted to do as little as they could.  It would also be an encouragement for them to know that that was the sympathy they could expect from a well-fed and comfortable member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in a good many parts of the country, and particularly in districts within my own knowledge, is at the present time desperate.  I know of small towns in West Cork where poverty did not exist on any considerable scale until recently.  Within the past three or four weeks children of honest, respectable working men have been looking for bread from door to door, and I know of cases where parents were unable to send their children to school because they had no food to give them.  I put it to the Government that that is a desperate position for people of any civilised country to be in.  The workers of the country had to suffer in order that the measure of liberty that we now have might be attained.  It is a desperate position to find themselves in to-day when they might expect that their condition would improve with the measure of freedom that the people have obtained. The President, speaking yesterday, quoted the Minister for Local Government in regard to the state of affairs that exists in many counties, that people were not willing to avail of the work that was offered.  I am afraid the Minister for Local Government is a very bad authority in that respect. The Minister for Local Government has not given us a good headline in the matter of unemployment all over the country.  I can give a concrete case where his action in West Cork has been the means of hurting a local industry. Within five or six miles of Skibbereen there is a slate quarry, and owing to lack of orders it is in a very disturbed condition.  There or four months ago an hospital in Skibbereen had to be <Col N="366" /> roofed, and asbestos was imported from Belgium to roof that hospital, while 20 or 30 workers in the quarry I speak of were thrown out of work.  When such a thing can happen at the instigation of the Minister for Local Government, I think he is not an authority to be relied on.</P>

      <P>I will not press that point further.  There is just one other matter that I would like to refer to. Yesterday when an effort was made by Deputies on these benches to get this Vote increased we heard very pious sentiments expressed by Deputy Sears, and to-day by Deputy McGoldrick in connection with this matter.  I say that in view of their action in voting against an increase that the sentiments they expressed yesterday and to-day are so much cant.  I think it is not very much use for people to get themselves into the Press by uttering pious sentiments here and by deliberately voting against measures that would give some practical effect to such sentiments. The position, as I say, is very bad in the country, and while it has been somewhat eased by the introduction of the Unemployment Insurance Bill it is desperate still.  I may say that the workers in a good many parts of the country who speak to us are giving up hope.  The position is getting worse and in a short time the Government will be faced with something more <Col N="367" /> dangerous than they have experienced hitherto.  The time will come when some of us will have to go back to the workers and tell them that we too have given up hope and that they must look to other means to right their wrongs.</P>

      <P>All the speeches, so far, in connection with this grant, have been devoted to areas outside the city of Dublin.  I just wish to say a few words, and ask the Minister in connection with the relief of distress not to forget those in the slums of the city of Dublin.  The Deputy who has just spoken mentioned a case of starvation in West Cork.  I can assure the Minister that within a stone's throw of Nelson's Pillar, within the past couple of months, there have been many deaths from starvation.  I would like the Minister to make inquiries from the various women's organisations that are operating in Dublin.  They will tell him of a number of dead-born babies within the past six months that were due to the semi-starvation of the mothers.  Any of the women's organisations in Dublin will give evidence of that.  I hope when this grant is being allocated that all the money will not go to areas outside the city of Dublin. I am perfectly satisfied that the position is bad elsewhere.  I have had letters, too, from people outside my own area.  I am satisfied that in Kerry and Donegal there are many deserving cases for relief.  I am told that starvation exists to-day in Donegal, and while I am in sympathy with the people there I must ask the Minister not to forget those who are eking out a bare existence in Dublin.  To-day it is a case of the poor helping the poor in the slums in Dublin.  I hope they will not be forgotten when this grant is distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, on behalf of the Minister for Finance in this matter, has stated to the House what was in the minds of the Government when they came to the conclusion, as they certainly did, that £250,000 was a fair amount to allocate for the relief of unemployment and distress.  I would like to ask him quite frankly how did they come to the conclusion that £250,000 was an adequate figure for this purpose.  If they gave any consideration <Col N="368" /> to this matter at all, or if they had any information at their disposal as to the destitution and distress that exist not alone in Dublin and in the congested areas but all over the country, they should have known that this £250,000 is quite incapable of meeting the situation.  If they think so, then I do not agree with them.  The President has, as a matter of fact, said that £40,000 was allocated to the congested areas and £10,000 for a waterworks in Dingle.  There must be some intention in the minds of the Executive Council or the Minister for Finance as to how the remaining £200,000 is to be spent. Is this £200,000 that remains to be allocated for the relief of distress and unemployment to be based on certain amounts for a constituency or a county or a district, or for parties or individuals who have the greatest amount of influence with the Government in matters of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that schemes have been put up&mdash;I have been associated with some members in connection with the matter myself&mdash;which would give work to the unemployed, and produce a return for the money expended.  The Government or the Minister for Finance, who appears to be the individual who uses a sledge-hammer in this particular instance, has turned a deaf ear to the appeals I have been associated with in this matter.  We must get some explanation, and that explanation must be given now on the points I have mentioned. I have for a long time taken a serious view of the situation that has arisen, and that is developing in the country, as a result of the distress and destitution.  Even in countries which are normal that is always the result of unemployment.  The worker who has persons depending upon him for support, if he be willing to work, and cannot find work, must blame the Government that is in power.  That occurs in countries that are normal, and this country has not been normal, and is not normal.  In such a case those people are naturally driven into the ranks of the revolutionary movement.  That is the explanation, and take it to heart. People in by-elections are voting against the Government, not because they are anti-Treaty, but because they <Col N="369" /> are driven to it because the Government is not facing the situation in the country.  Limerick, I think, is clear proof of that.  There were 11,000 votes turned against the Government there as compared with the election in August last.  I say that is due solely to the fact that the starving people of Limerick, as elsewhere, are being driven into the ranks of the revolutionary movement.  They are fully convinced that the Government has failed to carry out what they were looking forward to&mdash;to use the machinery of the Treaty to provide work of a remunerative nature for those who are willing and anxious to work.  When I decided with great reluctance to seek election to the third Dáil I said, &ldquo;I am prepared to accept the Treaty as the best available means at the moment to work for the economic independence of this country.&rdquo;  Since I have come into the Dáil I have taken part in the discussion of Bills innumerable, Bills turned out in machine-like fashion, but they had very little to do with the object I had in mind.  I am in agreement with Deputy Murphy that if those of us who came into the Dáil to support the Government, or rather to criticise it when it deserves criticism, are to put up with what we have had to put up with, up to the present time, then we shall have to go back to the people who sent us here and tell them that our mission has been in vain.</P>
    <P>I have put very pertinent questions to the President, acting for the Minister for Finance, as to what is in the back of the mind of the Minister for Finance or the Executive Council in arriving at this figure of £250,000 and in what way the remaining £200,000 is to be allocated.  If it is on the basis of a certain amount for a constituency.  I quite concede that there are some districts where distress and unemployment are more severe than in others.  I can quite understand, though I have not intimate knowledge of the circumstances, that in the congested areas the position may be more serious than it is in other areas.  For the information of Deputy Figgis, I may say that I know, as a positive fact, that people in congested areas have gone in greater numbers to England in harvesting work <Col N="370" /> than heretofore.  I am stating that from a knowledge of the facts, and I can, if necessary, produce figures.  I have seventeen or twenty years' knowledge of cross-Channel shipping companies and of the people who travel in this way, and where they come from.</P>

      <P>I disagree with Deputy Figgis for this reason, that in the areas these people come from the position is not so serious as in the homes of people who are obliged to find bread at home for their dependents.  That is the point I want to make.  If Deputy Figgis wants figures, I can produce them.  I think the first work of the Government of this country, apart from the question of the desirability of this or that Bill or the urgency of this or that measure, is to find work for the unemployed and to relieve the distress that has developed in very acute form throughout the country.  That would be the first work of any Government faced with the conditions that we are faced with to-day. I have practically worn myself out privately and in the Dáil drawing attention to the question of the Barrow drainage.  I am one of a number of Deputies who are deeply interested in the promotion of this particular scheme.  In the British House of Commons this question was actually argued out threadbare.  The people who came along to create the Sinn Fein organisation said: &ldquo;When we have an Irish Government of our own, sitting in our own country, with representatives of our own people making our own laws in our own way, those things which the British Government will not do, will be done.&rdquo;  You have the opportunity now, and if you do not take advantage of the opportunity, particularly for the purpose of relieving the distress caused by unemployment, I cannot say what will happen in twelve months hence.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of extravagance in the language used in dealing with this Estimate. I mentioned yesterday a considerable number of items which appear <Col N="371" /> in the Estimates this year showing the considerable sums given to the relief of unemployment.  I did not mention yesterday the sums of money that were likely to be set loose from the Road Fund, but in the counties which have had close attention paid to them&mdash;the counties of Donegal, Kerry, Mayo, Sligo, etc.&mdash;the sum involved from the Road Board would be £180,000.  That would certainly be considerably in excess of anything that was paid last year.  In addition, we have, within the last two years, an army and a police force drawing away between 20,000 and 30,000 persons who might otherwise be unemployed.  Deputy Byrne mentioned about distress in Dublin.  Are we responsible for the Marino housing scheme being held up? If the Marino housing scheme is held up for the next fortnight or three weeks is the cause of complaint against the Government?  This question of unemployment is not a Government question, and cannot be solved by Governments. Who is making an attempt to get down to stable conditions?  You cannot get stable conditions, or expect stable conditions, when such events as those pass without a moment's consideration from anybody.  Stable conditions mean that value must be given for money.  Business men complain that they are not getting it.  An examination of our trade balances does not show that there is a very sound economic position here just at present.  If there is not, there is only one way to get out of that, and that is to work hard.  The Government during its existence has put at the disposal of the nation more money than any other country in Europe, Asia, America, or anywhere else, has put at the disposal of its people, in proportion to the amount of revenue they are getting. You are not going to work towards stability if you are going to borrow money for and spend money upon schemes or public activities for which there is no value received.  People speak to us about productive schemes. We have always endeavoured to arrange for the distribution of public money so that there would be some real advantage from it.  Taking this £250,000, with the addition of the <Col N="372" /> money that to come into the Road Fund, it will mean that a sum of £2,000,000 will be devoted to providing employment.</P>

      <P>Certainly not.  We accept responsibility to the fullest extent at all times.  I have not examined the figures of the last Limerick election or compared them with those of the previous election.  I am, however satisfied that if those who opposed us in the Limerick election had got our job here and were doing the work we are doing, you would not find them doing it any more satisfactorily.  You might perhaps get a flash in the pan&mdash;great results for a short time, but with ultimate damnable results for the country. We have down here something like £7,000,000 for compensation which will have to be paid.  You are not going to get people to lend money to a Government or a Parliament which shows extravagance in its administration.  The sum of £250,000 is certainly that much more than what was down last year. The proposal to provide that particular sum came from the Government.  We were not asked to put it in the Estimates. It cannot be looked upon as an item by itself.  I put this to Deputies opposite: is it fair to ask the Government in its present position to subsidise housing, a most important service? Is it fair to the Government, or to the citizens of Dublin, that workers should be prevented from going on with the work at Marino?</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a sum, not exceeding £732,899, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1925, to defray the salaries and expenses of the Gárda Síochána [Gárda Síochána (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.]&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an estimate of £1,167,899, the amount required for the year ending 31st March, 1925, to defray the charge for the salaries and expenses of the Gárda Síochána.  The Estimate shows an increase of close on £20,000 as compared with last year.  The exact figures are £19,960.  The principal increases are:&mdash;Sub-head (A), which covers salaries, wages and pay, an increase of <Col N="374" /> £25,984; sub-head (B), allowances, an increase of £16,500; sub-head (I), covering incidental expenses, an increase of £2,900; sub-head (K), telegrams and telephones, an increase of £6,000.  In certain other sub-heads savings have been effected.  For instance, under sub-head (E), covering clothing, there is a saving of £1,950; a saving of £15,000 under sub-head (H), barrack bedding and furniture.  That particular saying is rather apparent than real, because it arises from the fact that the charge for furniture is now borne by the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  A saving has been effected under (J) of £2,800 for transport.</P>
    <P>It might tend to shorten discussion and to give more satisfactory information to Deputies if I went briefly through the various sub-heads under which this Vote is accounted for.  Dealing with (A), last year we estimated for the following strength:&mdash;161 officers, 907 sergeants, and 4,119 Guards; a total of 5,187.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This year we are estimating for 151 officers, 950 sergeants and 4,400 guards, making a total of 5,501.  In the Bill which is at present before the Seanad the following maximum strength is laid down:&mdash;182 officers, 1,200 sergeants and 4,918 guards, a total of 6,300.  On the 1st of May of the current year the strength was as follows:&mdash;143 officers, 929 sergeants and 4,027 guards, a total of 5,099.  A substantial increase in Sub-head A., an increase of £25,984, is caused by the following factors: the increased strength estimated for, which I have just dealt with, and the increments falling due during the current year to all men who joined last year; and these two factors in themselves would account for an increase of £170,900.  As against that a saving has been effected by the reduction of the rates of pay of £145,000, which leaves a net increase of £25,900.  Last year we estimated for a number which we knew to be below the requirements of the normal strength of the Force, but at the same time we considered that those numbers were the maximum which could be conveniently trained and distributed <Col N="375" /> throughout the country over that year, and consequently we did not estimate for any larger number.  The progress in training and the provision of barrack accommodation throughout the country leaves us now in the position where we find it possible to estimate for the current year for an almost normal establishment.  On the 1st April, 1923, the number of stations occupied in the country was 257.  On the 1st May of the present year the total number of stations occupied was 756, and the distribution of these stations in the provinces was as follows: 236 in Leinster, 275 in Munster, 164 in Connaught, and 81 in Ulster.  The number of stations which it is eventually proposed to establish is 837.  It may be that in practice we will find that figure somewhat small, and it may be that from time to time, meeting reasonable requests from the inhabitants of particular areas, it will be necessary to establish perhaps anywhere between that figure and a total of 900.  That figure, therefore, of 837 stations must be regarded simply as an approximation.</P>
      <P>One fact to be kept in mind is that we are dealing with a new Force, and that consequently almost all the officers and men are at low points in their various scales of pay, and the charge for increments will continue to be felt for a number of years to come.  The Pay Order reducing the pay of the Guards took effect as from the 1st March last.  I do not propose, unless it is raised in a controversial way, to go in any great detail into the factors which rendered that reduction necessary, or certainly very advisable.  I think the discussion which has preceded this Vote ought to render any defence of that particular step almost unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Because in a time of financial stringency, in a time of undoubted hardship and undoubted poverty amongst great sections of the people, it was not considered advisable to continue to pay the young men of this Force at the rate at which they were paid previous to the 1st March last.  There has been a reduction in <Col N="376" /> the pay of the members of the Force. There has also been a reduction in the pay of recruits in training, and I think that reduction was justifiable.  There is really no case for paying raw material in training at the same rate as the finished article on duty.  Men come up from the country for training in the Depôt.  The training may take anything from two to three months, and we have established the principle that during that period of training men shall not be in receipt of the same rate of pay as when the training is completed, and when they are actually on duty.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rates of pay, it is not proposed that these rates shall be subject to fluctuation for trifling changes in the cost of living.  The new rates are based on a cost of living figure of 85 above pre-war, and they are intended to be applicable while the cost of living varies, from 70 at the lower limit to 100 at the higher limit, above pre-war.  Consequently before there would be any reduction by reference to the cost of living, the cost of living figure would need to fall below 70.  Recruits during the period of training at the Depôt will be paid at the rate of 50/- weekly.  Generally, on this question of pay I would like to make this clear to Deputies, that the rates now fixed for sergeants and Guards represent increases of 145 and 160 per cent. respectively on the amount paid in 1914 to the corresponding ranks in the R.I.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the rate of 50/- include mess allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mess allowance, strictly speaking.  The recruits mess themselves.  We have prepared a comparison of the cost of the Guards with other police forces in Ireland, and with those in the principal towns in England.  The table is prepared on the basis of the annual cost, per head, of the population in the area which is served.  The Gárda Síochána works out at 8/5; the Metropolitan Police at 15/7 per head of the population served; the Royal Ulster Constabulary, excluding the Specials, works out at 12/11; the <Col N="377" /> Royal Ulster Constabulary, with the Specials included, at £1 10s. 4d.; the London Metropolitan Police at 19/10; the Liverpool Police at 15/8; and the Manchester Police at 12/7.  Taking both police forces together, the Gárda Síochána and the Dublin Metropolitan Police, the rate is 9/5.  That comparison would go to show that it can scarcely be contended that there is any waste of public money in the administration of police forces in the Saorstát. I ought to say that the disparity between the cost of the Metropolitan Police per head of the area served and the Gárda Síochana is accounted for by the fact that the Metropolitan Police figures include very heavy charges for pensions, while the other Vote has not yet become liable for any charge of that kind.  In recruiting for the Guards, priority is given to application from ex-members of the National Forces who fulfil the required conditions, and by the 8th May 831 ex-members of the National Army had been accepted. That deals in a general way with sub-head (A).  Moving to sub-head (B), the increase of £16,500, as compared with the last year, is due again to the greater strength estimated for, and to the filling of vacancies in the higher ranks.  The rent allowances for officers are not set out in detail in the printed Estimate.  They are at present under revision.  The rates which are at present in force are as follows:&mdash;Chief superintendents, £80 per annum; superintendents, £60, and inspectors £36.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rent allowance is not paid to any member of the Force occupying official quarters or for whose family quarters of that kind are available but not occupied. There is an increase in the figure for cycling allowance from £24,000 to £30,000.  That increase is accounted for by the fact that every sergeant and guard who is not engaged on clerical duty is obliged to provide himself with a bicycle.  We hope, by that means, to secure more frequent patrolling and to reduce the charges for subsistence allowance by lessening the time during which men will be absent from their stations.  On that question of subsistence allowance, covered by sub-head (C), I only want to say that subsistence allowance is payable only where absence from a station exceeds <Col N="378" /> 8 hours in the case of sergeants and guards, and 10 hours in the case of officers of higher rank.  Then you have travelling expenses £20,000 under sub-head (D).  The expenses of conveying prisoners are payable either by the county councils or by the General Prisons' Board, according as the expenses were incurred before or after committal.  After committal the Prisons' Board bears the expense.</P>
    <P>The figure for clothing is £28,050. Contracts for clothing are made by the Government Contracts' Committee. The system of issuing readymade suits of stock sizes to the Guards was found unsatisfactory, as they had frequently to be altered.  It is proposed in future to issue unmade suits, cut in standard sizes, with the necessary trimmings to be made up by the local tailor.  Each Guard receives an allowance of 15/- to cover the cost of making up the uniform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know really.  I understand that it is not simply a question of issuing the cloth in the piece.  The uniform is cut and ready to be sewn together at the seams and is issued in that way to the Guard. The work required from the local tailor is something quite trifling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect they would get the 15/- in any case.  In practice we find that it works out at about 6d. per uniform.  In other words, we lose by the change to the extent of 6d. per uniform, but we consider that as a set-off against that, that the men present a smarter appearance.  Occasionally, <Col N="379" /> under the old system, you did meet with men who were rather unfortunate in the fit they got, and whose appearance certainly was not improved. Sub-head (F) deals with accoutrements. Owing to the large quantities of supplies taken over from the R.I.C., it is anticipated that the sum of £300 will be sufficient to meet all the requirements for the current year under this head.  Then we come to barrack bedding and furniture&mdash;£1,000.  Furniture, as I have stated, is paid for out of the Vote for the office of Public Works. It is estimated that £1,000 will be required to supply bedding for new stations and to meet deficiencies, but on the other hand a considerable amount of bedding, which is now in use in the Depôt, will be available for country stations when the training of recruits is completed at the Depôt.  For fuel, light and water you have a sum of £15,000.  Fuel and light allowances are admissible only in respect of the public rooms and offices at stations, and are not payable in respect of the private quarters of the men.  The allowance varies according to the size of the station and the time of the year.  You have a fixed rate for the summer months, and a somewhat different rate for the winter.  Under sub-head (I) you have £5,900 for incidental expenses. The items which go to make up the sub-head are set out in detail in the Estimates themselves.  The sum of £12,200 for transport under sub-head (J) contains a provision of £4,000 for the maintenance and running expenses of the headquarters transport.  Five cars are reserved for the use of senior officers at head-quarters.  The remainder are used for detective work, for the escort and conveyance of prisoners, for the conveyance of stores, etc., and for the carrying out of transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £8,200 is included for repayable advances to officers of the Guard to enable them to purchase cars for the performance of their duties. There is a system of assisted purchase. Officers get advances, and they repay the money in instalments.  The maximum advance is £200 in the case of a chief superintendent, and £130 in the case of a superintendent, subject to those conditions: &ldquo;Advances are made <Col N="380" /> for the purchase of cars only in those areas where the safety of the cars can be reasonably guaranteed.  Each officer to whom an advance is made must enter into a bond to repay within 12 months.  The cars are the property of the officers who are responsible for the cost of licensing, registration and garage accommodation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, you have an item of £11,000 for telegrams and telephones, and that shows an increase of £6,000 on last year.  It is due to the decision to instal telephones in all stations which are situated in districts already provided with a telephone service.  About one-fourth of the existing stations are fitted with telephones.  Deputies will remember that from time to time there appeared in the Press accounts of crimes which might more easily have been detected if there were better telephone facilities for the Guards in the areas in which such crimes occurred.  One case was the Baltinglass bank robbery, in which Guard Halloran was killed. Under sub-head (L), which deals with the escort and conveyance of children under the Children's Act of 1908, you have an item of £600.  The expenses which are chargeable to the Vote under that sub-head are the cost of escort and conveyance of children to certified industrial schools, and the cost of escort and conveyance of children or young persons to and from places of detention, including their removal from such places, and their restoration to the care of parents or guardians, under Section 106 of the Children's Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, under sub-head (M), you have a sum of £1,000 for damage and loss.  That is to meet the loss of private property of members of the Guard, maliciously destroyed in raids on barracks or in some other way.  The sum of £2,000 which was provided for last year for this service was not found adequate, and it is considered necessary to make further provision in the current year for contingencies of that kind.</P>

      <P>It is to be hoped it will not be a permanent charge.  It is to meet the contingencies of members <Col N="381" /> of the Force losing private property through malicious damage, and so on. I have a return here for seven months of the number of indictable offences reported in the Saorstát, exclusive of the Metropolitan area, and the number of cases in which arrests were effected. Taking the seven months from October, 1923, to April last, you have the following figures: October, 545 reported cases, and 228 arrests; November, 492 reported cases, and 201 arrests; December, 554 reported cases, and 253 arrests; January, 558 reported cases, and 291 arrests; February, 517 reported cases, and 244 arrests; March, 374 reported cases, and 141 arrests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In April there were 329 reported cases and 120 arrests.  In that period of seven months you had altogether 3,369 indictable offences reported, and you had 1,478 arrests.  It is gratifying up to a point to note a downward tendency in the number of reported offences and a somewhat upward tendency in the number of arrests made.  Generally, Deputies can take it that there is in the Ministry a certain quiet satisfaction as regards the manner in which the Guards are doing their duty.  They went out in a very difficult period, and it was natural and reasonable to expect that for some time the reactions of their rawness and inexperience would be rather obvious. As a matter of fact, that side of things has not been so much in evidence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking them in the bulk, they have acquitted themselves remarkably well, showing a steadiness and reliability that would do credit to a much older force.  Cases of indiscretion or cases of individual members in any way showing inexperience or want of training, have been very, very few, indeed. We feel these men have definitely established themselves through the country, have won the respect and confidence and good-will of the people, and the amount of friendly co-operation they are receiving from the people is on the increase.  People are coming to realise that those men are the servants of the State, are out through the country in the interests of the people who <Col N="382" /> are not criminal, and are out for their protection and the protection of their property and the vindication of their rights.</P>
    <P>I would like to see that feeling growing amongst the people, the realisation that these men are their officials and their servants, out simply to uphold the laws which may, from time to time, be made here by the people's representatives. I ask the Dáil to pass this Estimate, and I hope the explanations I have given of the increase may be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the method adopted by the Minister in introducing the Estimate, giving such a detailed explanation of the various items, is to be highly commended, especially to other Ministers who leave us to draw upon our imaginations as to what is the meaning of the different Votes.  As one who has always looked upon it as being very undesirable, even under abnormal conditions, for police work to be done by the military, I welcome&mdash; and have on previous occasions welcomed&mdash;the extension and the development of the Guards.  Speaking from my own knowledge of my own area, and from conversations I have had with people in the constituency, I can say that the character and general conduct of the Guards are to be very highly commended.  In two or three cases I have come across complaints, justified, I think, made in regard to prosecutions that have been taken at the instigation of the Guards, especially in cases under the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand that when the Guards were first sent out, without that education which under normal conditions they would receive in training, mistakes were likely to be made.  I would urge on the Minister, however, in view of the new licensing laws that are now being discussed, and that are likely to be passed in some form or another, that it is very desirable that the Guards in every case should have a proper understanding of the licensing laws as they exist, or whenever they are amended.  It is not nice to receive complaints or to see in the Press reports of prosecutions where the Guards have been turned down by the District Justice owing to lack of knowledge of the existing licensing laws.  I think that is <Col N="383" /> a matter, in view of the new Bill, that should be looked into and that directions either by the Minister or by the Commissioner should be given for the provision of facilities for more expert training in matters of that kind.  I have received on some occasions complaints from individuals in my constituency with regard to robberies and, in one case, with regard to a murder. In cases of that kind the Guards may be blamed for not doing their duty.</P>
    <P>In the cases I referred to I went to the parties concerned, whom I knew perfectly well could identify the robbers and could also have given evidence against the murderers in this particular case I have in mind.  It was a case of a man who was murdered by people who wanted to rob him.  He defended himself and was killed.  He was one of the most respectable men in the County of Leix.  The parties whom I approached with a view to getting them to give evidence, began to quake and shiver and could not get up their courage to identify the people who were responsible.  If complaints are made against the Guards for not bringing to justice people who commit robberies and murders the fault and the responsibility are on the people who can give evidence but who will not.  It is only when people have courage to come forward and assist the servants of the Government to punish criminals that these criminals will be taken from the path of the innocent citizens of the country.  The Minister referred to allowances for the making of uniforms.  I am interested in that matter because he said an allowance of 15/- is to be given to a Guard for the purpose of making a suit.  It may be information to Deputy Hewat, who would probably justify items of this kind, that the charge made to me for making a suit, with the cloth supplied, is £3 15s.</P>

      <P>The Deputy usually speaks in that way, as representing either the employers or the profiteers. I am not sure if it is necessary to move a reduction of the Vote, but I feel compelled to draw the attention of the Minister, for I hold him responsible, the matter being one of policy, to a condition of affairs which I do not think is creditable and should not be allowed to continue.  That is the treatment given to members of the Guards who happen to be disbanded R.I.C. men as against the treatment meted out to resigned members of the R.I.C. and who are now in positions in the Civic Guard.  I think that the Minister will agree that there should be the most absolute harmony between these two classes of individuals while in the service of the Guard.  I have, as a matter of fact, the names of a number of individuals, but I will give one, as a case in point, of a disbanded R.I.C. man in the service of the Civic Guard who has a pension which is paid by the taxpayers of this country of £433 per annum, and who is in a position in the Guards which brings in £300 per annum, without taking into consideration the question of his pension.  I believe it was stated by the late General Collins&mdash;I am certain it was, as I have the quotations in my possession&mdash; that members of the R.I.C. who resigned, and who could be proved to have resigned, through national sympathies, would get the same treatment as the men who served up to the time of disbandment.  I suggest that the treatment meted out to the two classes I speak about is not fair.  The resigned R.I.C. men to the number of 100 were compelled to join the Civic Guard. They received no gratuity or no compensation, although in most of these 100 cases the Committee which inquired into them granted a pension. As against that, the disbanded man comes into the Civic Guard carrying with him his full pension, and he is free, I understand, to leave the Force at any time.  I contend that it is not <Col N="385" /> fair to deny to the resigned R.I.C. man, whose case has been passed by the Committee and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance, the receipt of his full pension and give a pension to the disbanded man which he receives under the Treaty, without taking into consideration the service in which he is now employed.  I quote one case for the information of the House to show the treatment which is meted out to disbanded men as against the resigned men.  If any service has been rendered to this State by one or other of these sections, it has been rendered by the man who resigned and who gave up everything he had, to respond to the call made at the time.  I do not want to develop this, as I do not think it right to go too far into the matter, but that distinction should not be made.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance are, however, responsible for this matter, which seems to me to be bad policy on the part of the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated at one time in this House&mdash;I am not sure whether it was by the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance, but it is immaterial&mdash;that pensions would not be granted to members of the R.I.C. who resigned for the reasons I have given, if suitable occupation could be found for them.  I cannot trace, and I have looked into the matter very closely, any regulations issued by either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance that the Civic Guard was considered a suitable occupation for resigned members of the R.I.C.  If it is a suitable occupation, and if disbanded men are in the Civic Guard, as I am sure they are, for the development of the Civic Guard, surely resigned men are entitled to the same consideration and treatment.  It is bad for the Force that resigned members of the R.I.C. should be called out in the Depôt Square to be drilled by disbanded men who are receiving pensions, while the resigned men are denied pensions, although it was admitted they were entitled to them.  I propose to pursue this matter to the bitter end.  I propose to raise it also on the Vote of the Minister for Finance, if satisfaction is not given and if the promises that were made by honourable men are not carried out in the letter and the spirit.  I <Col N="386" /> first drew attention to this question simply because I was associated in my school days with three individuals who resigned from the R.I.C.  Deputies on this side of the House, including myself, are daily in receipt of communications complaining about the methods adopted by the Ministry of Finance&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is one matter that I particularly want to draw attention to on this Sub-head A, which I presume is now under discussion. Before doing so I would like to say we all have heard from various parts of the country of the doings of the Gárda Síochána, and we know that the praise that has been given to that body, specially in the circumstances, by the Minister for Justice is a praise that has been more than well deserved.  The body has created in an abnormally short time a measure of trust and a measure of confidence in the people.  It is a remarkable fact that this young Force, established under such painful circumstances, and under such difficult conditions, should so quickly have been able to put themselves into the position that the Minister can say here truly, and say to the knowledge of Deputies who are familiar with the conditions in the country, that this body is receiving the friendly co-operation of the people practically in every part of the country.  That has been a credit that has been earned by the members of the Force themselves, both by those who have been in command, and not particularly by those who have been in command, but by the rank and file who have associated themselves with the people, and in carrying out their duties have shown a very considerable sense of discretion, coupled with discipline. I would like to join, in expressing my own personal appreciation, with the Minister who has chosen this occasion, <Col N="387" /> in giving his introduction to this Vote, in according a praise that has been so highly earned.</P>
      <P>The matter that I wanted to draw particular attention to on the first detail, &ldquo;Salaries, Wages and Pay,&rdquo; was in regard to the Commissioner.  The Commissioner, as we know, owing to troubles that have occurred in connection with the Army was moved over, and has been acting as General Inspecting Officer in the Army.  I had rather expected that the Minister would have taken the opportunity to let us know how he stood in relation to the Civic Guard, and when he was likely to return to that work.  I do not think that it is conducive to the discipline of this excellent body, and I do not think that it is conducive to the best interests of the State that the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána should be taken over for so long a time, while still being looked to by the Gárda Síochána as their Chief.  I do not know what uniform he wears, but I presume he is wearing the uniform of the Army, and wearing the uniform of the Army in executing his work, if he is still executing his work, as I understand he is, in connection with the Gárda Síochána.  I think that is not a good thing for either Force.  The Minister himself, in moving this Vote, communicated that it had been judged desirable by him&mdash;a very courageous decision and a wise decision that has justified itself&mdash;to keep this Force as an unarmed Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bold to say but for that decision he would not have been able to have stood up in this Dáil and claimed that the Force was receiving the friendly co-operation of the people.  I think that that friendly co-operation has been exercised very largely, because, for the first time, they have seen a Force that is in the true sense a police force, an unarmed force, depending upon the co-operation of the citizens for its effectiveness.  That having been achieved in the way in which it has been achieved, I think it undesirable that the head of that Force should, while continuing to be the head of the Force, and looked to as the head of the Force, at the same time be the head of the Army.  I think that will be appreciated, <Col N="388" /> and I am sure it is the desire of the Minister that an anomaly of that kind should be ended at the earliest possible moment.  I think this is the only time that we will have the opportunity of raising this matter.  The Minister would, I think, be wise if he stated, now that the peculiar circumstances that called for the transference of the Commissioner to the special duty that he was called upon to exercise in the Army are ended, and we hope they have finally ended&mdash;in any case they have considerably mended&mdash; that occasion would be taken advantage of to call the Commissioner back to the Civic Guard and let the Commissioner of the Civic Guard be the Commissioner of the Civic Guard, not wearing military uniform and exercising military duties, so as to end the anomaly that has been created.  If trouble should ever arise&mdash;we hope it will not&mdash;it should be remembered that it is not the best thing to do to call upon the Chief of one Force to become the Chief of another Force, while still maintaining his original position.  I would like the Minister to state when that position is to be ended, and I would urge upon him that it be ended at the very earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a question and I am not absolutely certain whether it should come up on this Vote or on the Vote for the Ministry of Justice.  I refer to the failure to apprehend the perpetrators of the outrage at Cobh.  I think that as the Gárda are responsible for the prevention of crime and the arrest of offenders outside the Metropolitan area, it probably should come up on this Vote.  But if the Minister would prefer me not to raise it on this Vote and to leave it over until the Vote of his Ministry comes on, I will comply.  Has the Minister any objection to my going on?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The outrage at Cobh did a very grievous injury to Ireland. Looking at it merely from the material point of view, it has cost us large sums for compensation, and it has inflicted enormous harm on our credit. Looking at it from the spiritual point of view, the harm is far deeper, and <Col N="389" /> it is thrown in our faces by the enemies of Ireland.  They throw that deed in our faces, and also the fact that the men who did it&mdash;the murderers&mdash;are still free and have not been arrested. I do not want to make anything in the nature of a party point or petty point against the Minister or the Gárda on this matter.  We realise here some of the difficulties that attended them in dealing with this matter&mdash;the difficulties of apprehending criminals in a remote and wild district which they knew intimately and where some sections of the population, owing either to intimidation or to a mistaken sense of what they believed to be patriotism, were on their side.  But the world does not know that, and I think it would be well if on this occasion the Minister could make some statement explaining why his hopes that these criminals would be arrested have not been fulfilled.  I think everybody has felt a sense of deep responsibility in this matter and has not wished to press the Minister. But now it is more than three months since the thing happened.  It is more than three months since the reward was offered.  It is more than six weeks since the names of the men who were alleged to have committed the crime were published.  Yet nothing has been done.  Until those criminals are arrested and have been convicted in fair trial, there is a blot on the escutcheon of Ireland, and I know the Minister is as anxious as I am, or as any Deputy is, that that blot should be wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I leave that question in the hope that the Minister will say something about it, to associate myself with all that has been said in praise of the general conduct of the Gárda.  For a young force they have done most amazingly well. They are smart, they are courteous, they appear to be efficient.  The only criticism I have heard of them is that in one or two places they are not quite sure of themselves and are a little slow to act. That is a fault that time and experience will mend and in a policeman it is a better fault than excessive zeal.  The only thing I am a little afraid of is that the Minister has placed a somewhat embarrassing burden on them by the regulation he spoke of, that every member of the Gárda must possess a bicycle.  A bicycle is an excellent thing <Col N="390" /> to pursue a criminal on and to apprehend him.  But if you proceed to take the criminal to the barracks with one hand and to take the bicycle with the other if the criminal is at all fractious you will find yourself in a difficulty. I agree that there should be a bicycle or two bicycles in each barrack, but cycling, without a certain amount of foot patrol work, would be a mistake. Otherwise I think nobody in the Saorstát has anything but praise for the Gárda.  They are already making their tradition.  They have already, unfortunately begun a Roll of Honour, and we may be confident I think, from their past conduct, that the men who come into the Force in future will live up to the standard set by the men who died doing their duty.  If I were asked to define the general conduct or attitude of the public to the Gárda throughout the Saorstát I would say: &ldquo;Well the little children get on with them very well.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two small points in connection with this Vote that I would like to have an explanation on.  One is the question of Pension.  Pension deductions appear on page 96 of the Estimate.  I understand that there is a 2½ per cent. deduction made from the salary, or wages, of the Gárda for the purpose of a pension fund.  That amount is estimated for this current year to be £24,781. Last year it was £24,000.  I want to know whether this sum of £25,000 this year and £24,000 last year has been set aside and paid into a particular fund. I am speaking with a certain knowledge of an analogous case&mdash;the case of the teachers, who contribute 4 per cent. of their salaries for pension purposes. That sum is paid by the Education Department into a State Fund, from which the pensions of the teachers are afterwards provided.  I do not see any such provision for the Gárda except it is shown in some other portion of these Estimates.  As it appears here, it is simply a deduction and nothing more. I take it that it is the intention of the Department that this £24,000 should be used as the nucleus of a fund for providing pensions later on for the Gárda.  I am not quite sure whether any pension scheme has yet been devised. <Col N="391" /> I take it it is the intention of the Minister to devise a suitable pension scheme for the Gárda.  They are young still.  None of them is coming up to pensionable age, and none of them has pensionable service, but now is the time to make the provision.  The matter touched on very briefly by Deputy Cooper reminds me about making an inquiry as to whether any provision is made in the case of men who are injured or who are killed in the execution of their duty.  Is there any provision made for compensation in their case?  There was a particular case I was interested in which was known very well to members of the Dáil.  That was the case of Guard O'Halloran, killed at Baltinglass in the execution of his duty.  He was a native of Gort, and was one of my constituents.  I understand that application was made by his mother for some compensation, but that the Department was not in a position to award any compensation.  I would like to know what is the position exactly in such cases, and also what provision, if any, is made in this Estimate for meeting even such necessary things as the funeral expenses in such cases.  I have been looking over the Estimate casually and I have not been able to discover any such provision.  I think it is only right and reasonable that such provision should be made.  I should like to ask whether the Minister has had any complaints on that head as to the non-provision of such necessary expenses as I referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that the Minister himself cannot escape from a very considerable share of the praise which all sections of the Dáil give most willingly with reference to the outstanding success of the establishment and working of the Gárda Síochána, as he has been mainly responsible for the success of what has been one of the outstanding accomplishments of the present administration.  There is another matter which I would like to raise.  That is, the present inadequate provision for the health and comfort of the Gárda.  We have here in this Vote under sub-head (H) a sum of £15,000 for fuel, light and water.  I know of stations where there is really <Col N="392" /> no necessity to pay for water, as it not only comes in through the broken windows and roofs, but it also comes up through the floor.  In these places, where, as the Minister said, the Gárda have already established themselves and have won the confidence of the people, the fact that they are not adequately provided for is looked upon as a local grievance by the people of the district.  I would urge upon the Minister that he should exert all possible influence upon the other Departments concerned, such as the Office of Public Works, to see that, as soon as possible, they should get the Gárda permanently and adequately housed, particularly in the winter.  In very many parts of the country it was not at all pleasant for the Gárda during the last winter.</P>
      <P>There is another point which has often been mentioned, but how far rumour is true one cannot say; that is, whether the present personnel of the Board of Promotion is such as to inspire confidence in the Force.  There have been rumours that there was not confidence in the personnel of that Board, and we would be glad to receive an assurance from the Minister that these rumours are not well founded.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister will not believe me when I say that the appreciative references made to his presentation of this Estimate are very well deserved.  However, I mean it.  There are a few points in the Estimate which I would like to make reference to.  The first is the method by which the Gárda acquire premises.  I will give an instance to illustrate what I mean.  In a town I know of, where the Gárda were stationed, they were housed for a considerable period.  Then a house put up for auction was bought in the open market for £500 by a young man recently married.  Within a week or fortnight the Gárda came along and took possession of the house, and this young couple had to go and seek accommodation elsewhere.  That is clearly a grievance. I think there ought to be some other means adopted besides this reckless commandeering, shall I say, of premises required by the inhabitants of a district.  I wish to emphasise what has been said by Deputy Davin regarding <Col N="393" /> the exceptional treatment of the disbanded R.I.C. men as opposed to that given to resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men in the Gárda.  I think that is one of the most glaring cases of bad policy evident in the management of the Force.  It is peculiar that the men who risked everything to make the Gárda Force possible find themselves in inferior positions, and get inferior treatment to the men who did everything in their power to make the Gárda impossible. I think there is no member, either of the Government or of the Dáil, who would think that that should be allowed to continue.  Deputy Davin and I have much evidence that that is existing at present, and I would like the Minister to go into it very minutely to see that it is not allowed to continue. There is one item under &ldquo;Incidental Expenses&rdquo; in sub-head (I), &ldquo;Advertising.&rdquo;  I should like to know what that is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the approval that has been given to the wonderful capabilities, good conduct and capacity of the Gárda Síochana. As one living in the country I have had an opportunity of being in touch with them from time to time. Considering the circumstances in which they were raised, and the youth of a great number of them, those who are responsible for their training have every reason to congratulate themselves. At the same time, I would like to make a few criticisms which may be of use to the Minister, or those responsible for their training.  I would say that the tendency of the Gárda is to be a little bit too anxious to pay attention to petty crimes.  They devote what, in my opinion, is too much attention to detecting the smaller and minor crimes taking place in towns, and to over-emphasising the value of the detection and punishment in such cases. On that account they do not devote a sufficient amount of time to the detection of the larger crimes which take place outside of the towns, and which are very much more difficult of detection. In short, I would say that the people in the country would like to see the Gárda oftener out in the country districts, and to hear a little less of <Col N="394" /> their activities in connection with minor crimes in the towns, such as absence of lights on cars, small children playing football on the streets, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question in connection with the Gárda Síochána that I would like to ask the Minister.  I have been informed&mdash;I do not know if it is correct &mdash;that no deduction is made from the salaries of any of the members for income tax.  I think it is not right if that is the case, particularly as far as it applies to the senior officers.  I think it is only right that they should be expected to pay income tax like the ordinary citizens and civil servants.  I would like to support Deputy Hogan regarding his complaints as to the taking over of houses.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the Gárda in this regard, on account of the bad and insanitary houses they had to occupy in certain places, but I think it hardly justifies the Ministry in allowing them to cause great inconvenience to people by taking over their houses.  I have been in communication with the Minister in regard to one particular case. where I think the action taken was hardly justifiable. In this case they have taken over the residence of the manager of a local co-operative creamery.  This residence was built by the local cooperators and is within the walls of the creamery.  Owing to a dispute which took place with the former manager, the house was temporarily unoccupied. Recently the manager of the creamery received notice that the Gárda were going to go into occupation.  The Gárda should have been aware that the new manager, who had formerly been the assistant manager, was about to go into occupation.  I think it is most undesirable that a residence of this kind should be taken over, because in the working of a creamery it is desirable that a manager should live close to the creamery.  As a result of the commandeering of these premises the manager will have to live half a mile or a mile away.  Apart from everything else, I think the very fact that it has been built as the result of co-operation makes it undesirable. This house is not the property of one man; it is in the ownership of hundreds of members of a co-operative creamery.  Further, I might mention <Col N="395" /> in connection with that that the company with which the creamery was insured has now refused to continue its policy unless the committee absolve it from all responsibility with regard to incendiarism.  That is, the company, apparently, considers that in the occupation of the Gárda it is much more likely to be burned or injured than when it was in the occupation of the creamery manager.  I would also like to support Deputy Davin in what he has said regarding the resigned and dismissed R.I.C.  I understand that there are considerable grievances in regard to their positions in the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right that these men should be placed in a position not worse than the position of those who have been disbanded.  They should at least be in as good a position, and I say they should be in a better position, and I believe that the Government has not kept its word of honour in regard to these men.  I have heard&mdash;I am not quite sure about this, but I think my information is correct&mdash;that a resigned R.I.C. man who joins the Gárda Síochána does not get the advantage of his years of service in the R.I.C., or of the time which elapsed between his resignation and his joining the Gárda Síochána, as regards pension rights, that is, that he only gets the pension rights of a newly joined recruit.  If that is so, I maintain that it is not right.  Resigned R.I.C. men should at least get the benefit of the years they spent in the R.I.C., and also the period between when they resigned from the R.I.C. and when they got employment in the Gárda Síochána.  I am very strong on this matter, because I believe firmly that it is much more desirable that men who have resigned positions and who are eligible for pensions should, if possible, be offered alternative employment which would give them salaries better than a pension would be, and give them useful employment, rather than to place them as a charge on the country.  There is one other matter to which I would like to call the attention of the Minister.  I notice in the Estimates that the salary paid to the editor of the official newspaper of the Gárda is £320 a year.  I <Col N="396" /> am not quite sure that that is a genuine charge that should be borne by the Exchequer.  I rather think that the upkeep of the official newspaper of the Gárda might reasonably be borne by the Gárda themselves.</P>

      <P>There is a matter in connection with one of the duties of the Gárda Síochána which I would like to call the Minister's attention to.  He was kind enough some time ago, in answer to a question of mine, to say that he would bear the matter in mind. It is the regulation of and the issuing of rules for the carrying of guns, and for game licences generally.  I think that regulations are very badly needed, that in many parts of the country there are still a very large number of people who have not any licences.  This matter comes under the Gárda Síochána. It is a very important matter, and I think that there is a great loss of revenue and a considerable leakage.  I am sure it would be advisable, and it would pay the Government well, if the Minister issued fresh regulations, as I understood him to say some time ago that he would, and if the Gárda Síochána were given orders to pay strict attention to the question of licences of people who are carrying guns.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Cooper in his references to the failure of the police authorities to make any arrests in connection with the Cobh murder.  The matter is perhaps more difficult to account for by virtue of the action of the Minister in publishing certain names, which seemed to indicate that the Government had positive proof of complicity.  Now, when there is such an assurance as to warrant the Government in publishing names, one would think that it would have been quite within reach of accomplishment to arrest such persons.  I wonder whether the Minister is now as confident as he was when he published these names that he had good grounds for such publication.</P>

      <P>The Minister says yes.  Again I say it is more difficult to account for than ever that after so long <Col N="397" /> a time no arrests have been made, although persons are so confidently alleged by the Minister to be the guilty persons.  It is not believed by the people in the county or the city of Cork.  The matter was raised by the Minister of the reductions in pay which took place in March, and the Minister justified that by referring to the previous discussion and the state of the national finances.  I do not want to enter into any very long discussion upon the method that the Government has adopted of spending the public money to justify the reduction in the pay of men who are doing the kind of service which the Minister and the Dáil generally have praised, which, in the main, is spent in the country, and the same Ministry which will justify the payment of excessive sums for land purchase, of interest on borrowed money, and the like, and justify both on the ground of the state of national finances.  But the real complaint that I would make in regard to the reduction in the pay of the Gárda is not that they are now receiving too little or that they were receiving sufficient, but the manner in which this action is accomplished. The method is to issue advertisements and call for recruits for this Force.  You publicly avow a certain rate of pay and you get several thousand men to join on those terms.  Then, although you have set up, or allowed to be formed, an association of the men to discuss terms and conditions of service and to make complaints, a sort of spoon-fed union, there is no sort of consultation or conference or discussion with the men concerned before you issue an order for the reduction of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, I say, is in effect a breach of faith and a breach of contract, and it is that method in respect of the Gárda, as in respect to other associations of men, that will cause discontent and dissatisfaction and make men lose faith in their Government.  The point raised by Deputy O'Connell regarding the deduction for pensions is not very far removed from this point that I am making.  There have been three years' deductions from pay for a pensions fund.  It is important, I think, that we should know that the actual money has been set aside as a pensions fund.  Otherwise the men concerned <Col N="398" /> may be told in five years that the example that is set in regard to pay is followed and that the Government has decided that &ldquo;this is no longer to be available, that they have already used it and that it is not now a fund which belongs to you.  We have deducted this from your pay, but it is to be called a reduction of pay and not a pensions fund.&rdquo;  I say we should have some assurance that there is set aside as a pensions fund these sums of money which have been deducted for two years and some months, and make sure that these sums are really set aside and that a pension scheme, if not yet definitely decided upon, is being prepared and will be prepared in consultation with the representatives of the men affected, and that the matter of the pensions which the Minister, I think, has power to regulate, will be laid before the Dáil at not too distant a time.  We should have an assurance that the money is, as a matter of fact, set aside and will be available when the time for calling upon it arises.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would state the number of disbanded R.I.C. men who have been taken into the Gárda Síochána and if they are still drawing their pension under the Treaty and also their pay from whatever positions they hold in the Gárda.  I would like to know if they are inspectors, superintendents or commissioners, and if he will give their names?</P>

      <P>Neither Deputy Davin nor any other Deputy who raised this question of resigned R.I.C. <i>versus</i> disbanded R.I.C., in what I can only regard as a thoroughly mischievous manner ever broached that topic to me personally.  It is raised here on the Estimates.  Deputies ought, before doing a thing like that, to try to form some kind of appreciation of its possible reactions, and try to realise how undesirable it is to stir up a spirit of dissension as between one class of men and another, both being members of a disciplined organisation such as the Gárda is.  A little contact with me on the matter could very easily have disposed of things that were said here to-day. There is no R.I.C. pensioner in the Gárda drawing the pension, an <Col N="399" /> that is a basic misunderstanding which seems to underlie the references of every Deputy who spoke on that matter. There is in the Gárda no R.I.C. pensioner whose pension has not been suspended.  No man draws pay as a member of the Gárda and a pension as an R.I.C. pensioner at the same time. Resigned members of the R.I.C. who have been accepted in the Gárda Síochána were recommended by the Committee of Inquiry which was set up under my Department, and these men will have their compensation assessed by the Minister for Finance.  There will be no discrimination against them simply because they are in the Gárda Síochána.  The only point is that the pension, as in the case of the other men, will be suspended while they are serving in the Gárda.  As it has been referred to&mdash;and I very much dislike myself referring to this matter at all, or referring to one class of men and another class of men&mdash;from the day they went into the Gárda Síochána they are simply members of the Gárda Síochána, and they are neither ex-R.I.C., or disbanded men, or resigned men, or anything else.  As the matter has been referred to, I think it is not safe or right or proper simply to take it as a general assumption that the men who remained on in the R.I.C. until such time as that Force was disbanded, were, from the national point of view, any less worthy than the others who quitted it at an earlier stage, the fact being that in particular cases, which I could mention, the reverse is very much the case.  Deputies ought to realise that these are not matters that can be thrashed out here or that individual cases can be gone into.  I want to stress this, that no Deputy who got up here in a light-hearted, irresponsible way to-day and talked about this matter ever talked to me about it.  As regards Income Tax, it is paid by all members of the Force, officers and men, on the same basis as any other salaried public official. Pension deductions are not set aside, and there is no special fund. When the permanent Act, which is at present before the Seanad, is passed, a scheme for the Force will be inaugurated similar to that at present enjoyed by the Metropolitan Police.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, as I say, no fund at the moment.  When the permanent Act is passed, a pensions fund for the Force will be inaugurated similar to that at present enjoyed by the D.M.P.  Pensions will be paid out of voted moneys, irrespective of the amount of deductions.  The source from which police pensions will be paid is not any special fund.  The pensions will be paid out of voted moneys, as is the practice at present for the D.M.P. and the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Pending such a pension scheme, the Minister for Finance has, as a matter of practice, given <i>ad hoc</i> sanction in suitable cases for grants such as would be made under a pension scheme.  For instance, if men resign or die, refunds of pension deductions are given as a matter of course.  As regards Guards killed in the course of their duty, the Minister for Finance sanctions payments similar to what would be paid under the D.M.P. Pension Order.  In other words, in the case of Guards killed on duty the relatives receive the same treatment as would relatives of the D.M.P., relatives of police in Northern Ireland, and relatives of police in England.</P>

Deputy Esmonde made some reference to the personnel of the Board of Promotion. He said there were rumours.  The rumours in that case did not reach me. If they had, I would have had some consultation with the Commissioner as to whether there was any basis or any real justification for them.

      <P>Deputy Heffernan speaks of steps taken for the acquisition of premises.  That would more properly have been dealt with under the Board of Works Vote.  Of course it is a natural mistake for the Deputy to have made.  The Guards do not acquire premises, but the Commissioners of Public Works acquire premises for the accommodation of the Guards.  The Deputy mentioned a special case.  I do not know whether there is much to be <Col N="402" /> gained by entering into a controversy on the subject of special cases.  As a fact, I have gone with some care into the special case which Deputy Heffernan mentions, and, like a great many other special cases mentioned here, it is not a case of simply an overwhelming array of facts and merits on one side, and an overwhelming array of wrong and injustice and plunder on the other side.  It is just one of those doubtful cases.</P>
      <P>There is an empty house.  It has been empty for many a long month. The Guards are seen inspecting or looking over it, or a superintendent from headquarters is seen looking over it. Immediately people get busy, and the rumour spreads that such and such a thing is going to happen.  To give an appearance of genuineness to the thing, a camp bed or a sofa is put in and a man walks into and about the house a couple of times a day.  Then he is in occupation to keep out the enemy.  I do agree with the Deputy that it is not a good thing that the house of any private individual, even a creamery manager, should have to be taken over for the accommodation of the Guards. But there again you come up against it that you have public requirements needing to be satisfied.  There are times when public requirements are so great and overwhelming that they have to cut across individual rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You may want to build a railway and some stubborn old man along the desirable route says: &ldquo;You cannot have my land; you cannot run your line through my land, and as I hold a considerable amount you will have to take your railway some other way.&rdquo;  It is then we have to come to the Dáil, and you must steamroll him by legislation. There was a situation when 837 odd stations had to be established through the country, and it was desirable that the distribution of the Force should take place in the shortest space of time.  The public interest dominated the situation and there was no alternative but to come to the Dáil and to say that in the last resort we must have compulsory powers of acquisition.  The number of cases in which these powers were used was extremely limited; but the fact that we had the powers was of <Col N="403" /> very practical value and importance in negotiations.  It speeded up things.</P>
    <P>Special cases have been raised from time to time by Deputies with me, and I have tried to give every possible consideration to them.  The principle is clear, that if the requirements of a particular area indicate that a station should be established there, and established without any unnecessary delay, then we must in the last resort use those powers which the Dáil gave us. No doubt it is a question of angles and of a sense of proportion.  Whether it is more important that the creamery manager should be left in free and unmolested possession, or that a Guards' station should be established in the district, is one which the Deputy and myself might quite naturally hold different opinions about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper and Deputy Johnson have referred to the failure to apprehend those who are believed to have been guilty of the crime at Cobh three months ago.  They will, of course, accept it readily from me that their regret on that subject is not greater or any keener than mine.  It is unfortunate that in matters of this kind one cannot go into details.  One cannot say, &ldquo;We did this and we did that, and it did not come off, and we hope to do such another thing.&rdquo;  I know that Deputies and private citizens find it disappointing to get the reply week after week, and even month after month, that there has not been success.  It is a national disgrace that such a crime should occur at all, and it is a very <Col N="404" /> genuine and a very keen national disappointment that there has been, up to the present, a failure on the part of the police authorities to make the desired arrests.  I do not know whether Deputies would expect me to say what steps have been taken or what steps are being taken.  The area, as has been stated, is a wild one, in more senses than one, and it is true and disappointing that in that area there is a good deal of blind, misguided hostility to the policy which prevents the successful detection of crime and the successful apprehension of criminals.  Somewhat the same story was reported from one particular area in Kerry, where men who had been guilty of the murder of Sergeant Woods many months ago, were known to be in hiding to the knowledge of very many of the inhabitants. These things are, unfortunately, true and we can only hope that time and the responsibility of self-government will work a change and bring a more mellow and more mature outlook among the people, and that the negative attitude towards justice and the administration of justice will disappear. There is, of course, the explanation that that situation has its roots in the past in the history of the country, and certain features that have been developed through a condition of things which prevailed here in the past, will not disappear in a week, a month, or a year, and may not entirely disappear until a new generation grows up in a different atmosphere and with a different outlook, and assumes an adult responsibility for the affairs of the country.  I could, in private in my Department, go into some details with the Deputies who are particularly concerned. We are all deeply concerned, but if Deputies were anxious to be personally satisfied that nothing had been left undone, I would ask them to see me on this matter in my own Department, and I could go into the reports and soforth with them.  I agree that the delay is a grievous disappointment. I believe myself, and from some cases that have happened Deputies may perhaps believe, that the arm of the law is getting longer and is getting stronger.</P>
    <P>I think that these men will ultimately <Col N="405" /> be arrested and will ultimately be brought to account, or, at any rate, to trial for the crime with regard to which suspicion lies heavily upon them.  Men were placed on trial some weeks ago for the murder of a District Inspector in Clonakilty after the Truce in 1921 or early in 1922. The case was dismissed owing to insufficient evidence, but at any rate the fact that men were brought to trial for that offence, an offence committed so long back as that, ought to show that there is no complaisance, no equanimity, in the administration either in the Ministry or at the headquarters of the Gárda, and there is no feeling that there is a statutory limitation with regard to heinous crimes of that kind. I am not sure whether I have covered all the more important points raised in the debate.</P>

      <P>Before the discussion closes altogether, I would like to say that I have examined these accounts with a naturally critical eye with a view to criticising them as far as possible. The reason for my not having done so before is, I would like to admit, that I have not found anything in the accounts which I could really criticise with any effect so far as the figures are concerned, but I do think also that as a representative of a section of the people I should not let this Estimate pass without expressing what I think is the opinion of men like myself in the community, of the sense of obligation that we feel, and must feel, towards this Force and to express a recognition of the extraordinarily good work that has been done in connection with the reorganisation and development of this Force in very difficult circumstances and over a comparatively short time.  I <Col N="406" /> think it is remarkable that a new Force of its dimensions, entering into the atmosphere that was prevalent over the country at the time, have been able to adjust themselves to the new conditions and to do such effective work in such a comparatively short time.  In surveying the situation as we find it to-day, I think it is not out of place for me to say that the progress that has been made in connection with the establishment of law and order throughout the country has been very great and has enabled many of us to look to the future with a great deal more confidence than not very long ago we could have done.  As far as the accounts are concerned, at the present time at all events, I think we must recognise that the force is not being extravagantly administered, and as we find the Estimates to-day, there are no serious grounds for criticism.</P>

I want to say that the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance have been acting jointly in regard to the action I complain about.  I am in a position to state that a deputation from the organisation that looks after the interests of the resigned R.I.C. men have been on several occasions to the Ministry of Finance.  I have a written statement in support of everything I have stated, and I certainly say, in spite of what the Minister for Justice says, that this matter was not brought forward by me in a mischievous manner.

      <P>This Vote is very important.  It is important because of the subject with which it deals, and it is important because it is one of the largest Votes that we will be called upon to discuss during the Committee on Estimates.  There is a particular reason why this Vote should get a very thorough examination.  Some of us have been complaining from time to time that we were treated to an avalanche of legislative measures emanating from the various departments of the State.  That is a charge which we cannot level at the Ministry of Education. Most of its activities are carried out by way of administrative work, and that is a particular reason why the administration of this department should receive a good deal of attention from the Dáil.  The Dáil is at a disadvantage&mdash;a considerable disadvantage&mdash;in discussing this important Vote, inasmuch as for a reason which has not been vouchsafed and for which we are entitled to demand an explanation, no report has been issued during the past two or three years.  Certainly no report has been issued since the present Ministry took charge of the administration of education.  We are, therefore, at a loss because we have not before us the vital statistics concerning education, which would help us to form some proper idea of the work which the department is concerned with.  For instance, we have no report supplied to us, as was done in this department under the old regime, giving us the number of children under instruction <Col N="408" /> in the schools, the ages of those children, their classification in the various standards according to their ages, the number of schools in operation under the Ministry and the number of teachers engaged in those schools.  All these, as I say, are vital statistics.  The statistics are collected and supplied to the department quarterly and annually as heretofore, and I think it is right we should say that it is highly advisable that the public should be made aware, through the publication of the annual report, of these statistics.  I think it was Deputy Cooper who a few days ago complained of the &ldquo;dignified deliberation&rdquo; of the Board of Works because they had not issued a report since their report of 1922-23.  I wonder what would Deputy Cooper say in this case if he were here?  On the last occasion on which the Votes for education generally were under discussion, I called attention to the fact that no move had been made up to that time to bring about a proper scheme of co-ordination between the various departments engaged in educational work.  That has been done to some extent under the present Ministry and I hope it will be carried on to a greater extent under the powers given to the Ministry under the recent Ministers and Secretaries Act.  We are in this position, that the old complaints which were made in pre-Treaty days about the various departments of education working in watertight departments and more or less independently on one another are more or less true up to the present time.  I think anyone who knows anything about educational administration or educational matters must admit that that is not a satisfactory state of affairs and that it is a state of affairs which ought to be remedied.  In pre-war times there was issued with the annual report an appendix which contained the reports of the divisional or senior inspectors.  These were long, detailed reports in which the state of education in the particular districts was discussed at very great length. These reports were very valuable and it is a pity that the practice of compiling them and issuing them for the information of the public generally should not be revived.  I hope it will be possible to revive that practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> They were, in my opinion, very valuable for what they contained, and sometimes instructive for what they did not contain.  What I have said with regard to the report, applies to the rules and regulations of the Department, and what I might call the code.  In the old times it was possible for a teacher to be supplied with a code of rules and regulations so that teachers, managers and everyone else knew exactly where they were.  That is not the case now. The teacher who knows all the rules and regulations under which he is carrying out his duties at present is a rarity.  I doubt even if there are many at the headquarters of the Department who are in a position to know these, because, for the past five years or so there has been no regular publication of the code, no codification.  What rules and regulations have been made are issued to the schools and managers by way of advertisement in the newspapers. It is not a matter of surprise that these circulars get mislaid and that the advertisements are forgotten. The rules and regulations, consequently, are not always observed, and somebody gets into trouble.  I strongly urge on the Minister the necessity of immediately codifying all the existing rules and regulations and putting them into one volume.  That is one of the things which call for immediate attention. If somebody took up the old code they would find regulations that have been deleted and abolished for the past seven years.  There is, in consequence, a good deal of confusion.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to draw attention to.  I am not quite certain whether it is within the administrative powers of the Minister, but I rather think it is.  It is the question of the setting up of an advisory council or some form of council, consultative or advisory.  Personally I am of opinion that such a council should have more powers than mere advisory or consultative ones.  In any case, I believe there is a tendency to centralisation, and bureaucracy, if you like, in the fact that there is no machinery at present whereby bodies naturally interested in education are in a position to be consulted and give direct advice to the Ministry.  It is highly advisable <Col N="410" /> that steps should be taken in that direction, if, as I believe, it is within the present powers of the Minister to set up such a body.</P>
    <P>Our whole scheme of education centres around the child.  It does not matter very much what kind of machinery you have, or how perfect that machinery is, if the child is not there to be taught.  One of the most common complaints at present, and one which has been continually made during the past two or three years, has reference to this question of attendance. I do not want to be ruled out of order by being told this is a matter which must be dealt with by legislation.  I admit that.  But as the Minister's salary is on this Vote, I think we might draw attention to the fact that the Minister has not been as active as some of us would like in pushing on this legislation, and I think we are entitled to criticise him for that.  It is admitted on all hands, it is not a question of dispute or discussion any longer, that the position whereby 30 children out of every 100 on the school rolls are absent every school day in the year is not a satisfactory one.  I say on the school rolls, but that does not include all who are absent, as any one acquainted with the problem knows.  I will leave that particular question by saying that there is considerable disappointment amongst those who are keenly interested in education that the Government has not taken steps long before this to deal with this very vital problem.  In speaking of that I would like to say, more or less in opposition, if you like, to the views which are naturally held about compelling children to attend school, that it does not seem to me to be just to compel children to attend who are either hungry or ill-clothed.  Nor does it seem to be just to compel children to attend and spend a great part of their youth in buildings which are unhealthy and insanitary.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the present school buildings.  Again I must complain that I am not in a position to say how many schools there are in the country.  I am not in a position, except from my own experience in going through the country and seeing the schools, of saying how many of these schools are suitable for the purpose for <Col N="411" /> which they are used.  I do think it is necessary and advisable that the Ministry should take steps at the earliest possible opportunity, through their inspectors, to take a census of the school buildings and give them at least a rough classification.  Some could be classified as satisfactory, more would be decidedly unsatisfactory, and you might have a middle classification such as &ldquo;tolerable.&rdquo;  But it is essential that we should be in a position to know definitely how many of the present school buildings are entirely unsuited, from the point of view of health and sanitation generally, for purpose to which they are being devoted and which are in fact a danger to the community, to the children, and to those engaged in teaching.  I have seen some of these schools.  I know there are some very fine schools, splendid institutions that cannot be bettered in any country.  But we also have hovels doing duty for schools, the like of which would not be found in any country.  That is a problem that the Ministry ought to deal with, by finding out first of all what is necessary in the way of providing new schools or replacing unsuitable, insanitary ones, and then, by pressing forward for the necessary supplies, to make good that necessary accommodation.</P>
    <P>And in this connection I would like to point out that we have a very primitive method indeed for the maintenance of our schools.  Our schools are maintained, heated, cleaned, furnished and repaired largely by voluntary effort and voluntary contributions.  It is well known that the vast majority of our schools are under clerical management. The local parish priest or the local rector is the manager.  Sometimes&mdash;the number is few&mdash;they are under lay managers, but I would like to say this, that these managers have been in the main struggling against great difficulties, and in the main, they have done their best and done good work towards raising the funds which are necessary to maintain the schools in a more or less satisfactory condition. There have been exceptions, of course. There have been schools which were totally neglected in that respect, but in the main, the managers have made <Col N="412" /> great efforts to raise these voluntary funds.  But in my opinion the system of raising funds by voluntary methods for the upkeep of the schools has broken down.  The managers find it a task that is too great for them to face. It is impossible to continue much longer raising these voluntary funds, and we know that no matter how earnest they are and no matter how anxious they are to do it, the amount they have been able to raise in the past has not been at all sufficient to meet the necessities of the case.  I do not know whether or not it is within the power of the Minister, without seeking fresh legislative authority, to make arrangements for the proper maintenance and upkeep of the schools. My own opinion is that legislative powers are needed.  I think that the school-house ought to be the care of the locality in which it is.  It ought to be the duty and not only the duty but I should say the privilege of the locality to look after its school buildings and to keep them in the state that they ought to be kept in.  In this connection I would like to say that some of our school buildings, even where they cannot be said to be unhealthy, can certainly be said to be ugly, and some of them seemed to be built, as somebody said, like fortresses which would withstand not only the ravages but the improvements of time.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the supply of teachers, and on this point I would like to criticise the policy&mdash;the want of policy, rather&mdash;of the Ministry.  At one end teachers are being trained and turned out for the service.  At the other end teachers are leaving the service, and there does not seem to be any proper relation between the numbers admitted and the numbers who may reasonably be estimated to leave in any particular year.  Teachers were trained and they are still trained in private institutions, subject, no doubt, to a certain amount of control by the Education Department.  If these got appointments in this country, well and good.  If not, they sought appointments in England or Scotland, or in Canada, South Africa or somewhere else, and perhaps it might be argued that at that time it did not matter very <Col N="413" /> much whether the relation between the entrants to the profession and those who were leaving would be observed. But that is not the position now.  It has changed, and teachers trained under the new conditions and the new provisions will not be in a position to get employment outside the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I always held that it was a wrong policy that we should train teachers for export, but that will not be the position now, and it is essential, I think, that each year the department should estimate&mdash;and there is no great difficulty about estimating&mdash;the number of teachers who are about to retire in any given year and the number of vacancies which will thus be created, making allowance for those people who leave the service for any reason other than simply retiring on pension, and that a corresponding number of vacancies should be announced, that the number who would enter the training colleges in any given year should correspond as closely as possible to the probable number of vacancies.  In this way there would be no wastage and no unemployed teachers.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to stress that the Ministry should not in future appoint teachers who are untrained. Some women teachers are still appointed who are technically called untrained.  They have a certain standard of education, of course, and they must pass a certain examination, but they have not the hall mark of training, and I think it is no longer necessary that they should be appointed, because so far as women are concerned a sufficient supply of trained teachers is available.  In connection with the matter of the supply of teachers I would like the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, to give us some information regarding the conditions which were complained of a few years ago, and complained of with very great reason and on very good grounds, namely, that the students coming forward for entrance to the teaching profession were not all of the type which one would wish to see. When some years ago a new and approved salaried scale for teachers was introduced, it was hoped that as teaching was being&mdash;anyhow was then being&mdash;adequately remunerated there <Col N="414" /> would be a marked improvement in this direction.  I did not hope that the improvement would come rapidly.  Others thought that students would be knocking in crowds at the doors of the training colleges for entrance.  I would like the Minister to tell us what is the decision on that matter.  I think the time has come when the Government should make plain what exactly their position is with regard to the programme which is taught in the schools, or which they have introduced.  We hear a good deal about the programme from time to time, and I think there is a considerable amount of misunderstanding with regard to the aims and the objects of the Ministry.</P>
    <P>I take it that, candidly, their object is, at a future date, to make this country largely, if not entirely, an Irish-speaking country.  If that is their intention, in my opinion they should say that distinctly and clearly, and let the people understand, because there is a considerable amount of doubt among people as to what their children are being taught in the schools, and as to the value of what the children are being taught in the schools.  Therefore, I think it is highly advisable that the Minister should avail of an opportunity of this kind to say what exactly is the object aimed at by the changes which have been made, the very revolutionary changes that have been made in the curriculum which is now being taught in the National schools.  I may say right off that I do not for a moment agree with those who put it this way very bluntly, that the children are learning a few things in the way of education, and that Irish is thrown in &mdash;as much as to say that the Irish language in fact is not education at all, but is something outside of that.  That is not my view, and I do not think there is any necessity to argue that matter here.  I will, however, say this much, that let their aim be what it is, the Ministry must recognise that we are in a period of transition, and that they will not reach their goal any sooner by trying to rush towards the goal.  That is my candid view of the matter. There are complaints, and some of them substantial complaints, that there is a tendency to undo in a year or two what <Col N="415" /> has been the work of forty, fifty or sixty years.  I do not believe that we can revive the Irish language in a year or in two or three years.  I would be very satisfied if I felt that we could revive the Irish language in twenty or thirty years.  A period of that length is not very much after all in the life of a nation.  I do believe that there is a tendency to try and get ahead in a spirit of enthusiasm possibly, but in my opinion that is a wrong line to take. I say that especially in reference to the idea of using the Irish language as a medium for teaching other subjects.</P>
    <P>In the case of a teacher who is a native Irish speaker, or who has acquired a good speaking knowledge of Irish, a man who can speak Irish as freely as he could speak any other language, and who has to deal with pupils who are able to speak the Irish language, and understand quite clearly what the teacher is saying to them, I agree that in such a case there is no reason why the ordinary subjects of the programme should not be taught through the medium of Irish as the ordinary language of the school.  But it is nothing but the height of foolishness, apart from anything else, to expect a man who has only a half knowledge of Irish, who may be only struggling through it, and possibly only able to read it, having to pause now and again for a word or term, to teach the ordinary subjects of the programme through the medium of Irish, and to teach pupils who, possibly, do not understand a quarter of what he is saying. I think if that is not only asked for, but if it is allowed to go on, a very grave injury will be done, not only to education but to the Irish language itself. I believe that the Ministry recognise that fact, but I think that they have not made it sufficiently clear to those who are engaged in the ordinary work of the schools, either to teachers or inspectors.  I know teachers who, in their enthusiasm for the language, or in their anxiety to carry out what they believe to be the wishes of the Ministry, are doing what I have attempted to describe here, and in that way they are not doing a service to the language, and are certainly not doing a service <Col N="416" /> to education.  I think it is the duty of the Ministry to call special attention to the fact that only is such a thing not expected but that it should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I must apologise for taking up so much of the time of the Dáil in dealing with this matter, but the subject is such a wide one that it is hard to condense what one has to say on it.  There is only one other question that I will deal with at the moment, and that is the question of inspection.  Now, inspection is necessary, and no matter how much people may object to being inspected, and I suppose that is a natural feeling, there is nobody but must admit that inspection is necessary.</P>
    <P>While that is so there is inspection and inspection.  In the old days, under the education system, the inspector was really a policeman or a detective who came into the school.  He visited the schools to find out what was wrong in them, not to find what was being done, whether it was good or otherwise, but rather to catch the teacher as it were in some little breach of the regulations, and much was made out of these breaches of the regulations.  I readily and willingly admit that that spirit has now decreased very considerably, but it is hard to kill an old tradition, and there is, to some extent, evidence that that tradition has not been finally killed in our schools.  There is first in this matter the question of the spirit which should underline the system of inspection.  I have no hesitation in saying that the main object of an inspector should be to act as a co-worker with the teacher, to be what you might call the guide, philosopher and friend of the teacher, a man who, from his wider knowledge, wider experience, higher scholarship and higher attainments generally, should be in a position to direct the teachers in the various schools which he visits as to the best method and best way of getting on with the work which they are charged to perform.  I would prefer that instead of being called an inspector he should be called a Director of education for his particular district, a man who is charged primarily with seeing that the education of his district is up to the standard, and a man who would <Col N="417" /> be the first to be blamed by the department if education in that particular district was not up to the standard. But that is not the conception which the ordinary inspector of National Schools has of his duty.  I am afraid that all the blame, if anything is not up to the standard, is put on the shoulders of the teacher, and that is supposed to be the last word.</P>
    <P>I do not think that should be the spirit underlying the system. Both Inspector and teacher should regard themselves as co-workers, and it should not be so much that the Inspector is the boss or Commanding Officer, as that he is the general director or general manager of the schools in his particular area.  He should be a man to whom the teacher would be always ready and willing to turn for advice and help in any difficulty in which he might find himself.  You cannot have that when the Inspector has, as part of his duty, to go round to all the schools in his district, and in the classrooms examine every subject that is taught by the teacher, and then stick labels on each particular subject&mdash;&ldquo;This is good,&rdquo;&ldquo;this is very good,&rdquo;&ldquo;this is fair,&rdquo;&ldquo;this is very fair,&rdquo;&ldquo;this is middling,&rdquo; or &ldquo;this is bad.&rdquo;  While that may be all right in theory, it is really beyond the power of any man to go into a school and spend two or three hours, and at the end of the visit to take up seven, eight, or ten subjects taught there, and label them, making the very nice distinction between &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;very good,&rdquo;&ldquo;fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;very fair,&rdquo; and &ldquo;very fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these things bring with them definite rewards, if you like, and a definite benefit to the teacher.  The question of his annual increment might depend on whether the report for a particular subject is marked &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good.&rdquo;  I think that is trying to shave the matter altogether too much.  The Inspector should be in a position to sum up in a broad, general way his impressions of the school, whether it is satisfactory, whether the man is doing his duty in a satisfactory manner, or in a highly satisfactory manner.  He should be in a position to detect negligence or inefficiency where there is negligence <Col N="418" /> or want of skill on the part of the teacher, and he could give directions as to how such a state might be improved or reformed.</P>
    <P>To think that the Inspector can stick labels like you would on a lot of jam-pots, around the room, and do that justly and fairly, and leave no sense of irritation behind, is expecting too much from an ordinary mortal whom we must trust for our inspection work. There are several other matters which I would like to mention, but perhaps I would get an opportunity later, and I do not want to monopolise the time of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell has dealt with the general question, and I would like if Deputies followed on those lines, confining themselves, if possible, to one speech.  The Minister could deal with that matter, and then we could take details under the different sub-heads.  If we get the general question and the question of details entangled, the Minister will <Col N="419" /> be making constant replies without any really satisfactory conclusion.

      <P>I would like to touch upon some matters referred to by Deputy O'Connell.  He is very conversant with educational matters, and no doubt he has dealt fully with subjects of great importance which I am sure will commend themselves to the favourable consideration of the Ministry. There is one matter I am anxious to refer to.  That is the growing demand for some system of compulsory attendance of children at school.  Before that would be undertaken I think it very advisable that better school accommodation should be provided, particularly in the City of Dublin, where at present there is not sufficient accommodation.  I am not in a position to speak for the rural districts. I think that this is a matter which ought to commend itself to the Ministry. In the matter of teaching Irish, I think the results are not at all satisfactory, and that is a matter that should also receive consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether the educational expenditure on national schools is as economic as he would wish.  I refer particularly to the national schools in rural districts.  If he would say that it is not, I would agree with him.  I would agree with him for two reasons.  The first reason has already been mentioned, the irregular attendance of the children.  It is a well-known fact that because we have no compulsory attendance in the national schools the children are kept away for various reasons. It may be a wet day, and they might not be sufficiently clad to go a distance which might extend beyond the limit of that required for a <i>bona fide</i> traveller, and they would not have <Col N="420" /> the advantage, if it happened to be wet, of having that draught for anti-sickness which senior members are allowed. Then, again, the programme has no relation to the education of the pupils in after life.  It is largely intellectual or artificial, and is out of touch with modern advance.  As a result of this, the training and preparing of teachers are largely wasteful.  They are more or less on a false basis.  I do not complain of the expenditure itself, but that it is spent on a system which yields very little result towards raising the economic life of the country and making it one in which skill and capacity are demanded, and reducing the amount of clerical work.  In this respect our educational system shows poor results, because the love of labour is lacking in a number of our finished pupils.  This should lead to a thorough investigation of our present educational system, and to a demand for its reform.  Technical instruction also needs investigation, and, from my experience of the present system, it is also lacking in satisfactory results. This is also the case with the primary system, which is on a false basis, and, perhaps, we may attribute the same reason to higher education.  A thorough investigation of this problem would probably lead to economy and the cutting off of wasteful expenditure, and lead, perhaps, also to a settlement of the just claims of our secondary teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who owes a lifelong debt of gratitude to the present Government for having relieved him of the interesting but weighty responsibility of helping to look after National Schools, I should like to make some general remarks.  I will keep off details altogether, and I can do that somewhat easily because I agree with Deputy O'Connell in wishing to protest against our difficulty in getting hold of any details to make actual use of them. One of the troubles, in fact, in discussing this Vote is that we have such little real knowledge as to what is the present standard of education that is attained in National Schools.  We do hear unsatisfactory rumours that the standard is not high.  I think it is regrettable <Col N="421" /> that we are not in a position either to deny the rumours and say that the standard is better than it used to be, or give an explanation as to why the rumours exist.  I wish in the first place to say that what seems to me to be the most striking thing about this Vote is its enormous magnitude.  I suppose that this country is unfortunately one of the most badly educated countries in Europe, and I suppose that at the same time we give a larger sum for this purpose in proportion to our revenue than probably any other country in Europe&mdash;very nearly at any rate. I know that it is quite true that the present Government are not to blame for that state of things.  We, old Commissioners of National Education, might have the very same thing said against us, and the present Government have very largely carried on the old system&mdash;perhaps disimproved it in certain respects, and, perhaps, improved it in others&mdash;but there is no great change.  I think it is interesting to try to consider what is the real cause, and if there is any real cause for that serious blot in our national system, what is the remedy.  Many of us, I think, tried on other occasions to make this point, and to get the Ministry of Education to admit that our present system is unsatisfactory and that they are determined to find out the cause of this dissatisfaction, and also that they are determined to bring into the country a better system of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing we want above all others, and that is, a proper and thorough primary system.  We have not got it.  Why?  I know there are difficulties and that one of them is the scattered population, but after all that is only a small part of the real trouble. The whole country is badly educated, both in primary and secondary education. Will the Ministry undertake to inquire into this enormously important question?  Will they undertake to treat it as a big problem and say that, though it is bristling with difficulties, they are determined to get over these difficulties and give us a sound economic system of primary education?  I am convinced that if we spent half as much again on primary education we would not get half as good results as we ought to get.  This is a big question, and I want the Ministry to face it.  Will they go into the <Col N="422" /> question and bring out a sound economic primary system?  It is the most important thing that could be done for this country.  Whether you look to one branch, that of industry; to another, that of commerce; or to any technical branch of work, and last but not least, to our friends on the adjacent benches who are interested in the agricultural industry, one thing that is wanted above all others is a system of sound primary education backed up by a system of applied education for use in ordinary life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with all the matters raised by Deputy O'Connell.  I do not intend to discuss the education problem in all its phases. There are enough educationalists here who will do so, and who know more about the subject than I do, but there is one subject about which I know something&mdash;though I have no doubt the Minister will say that I know nothing about it&mdash;and that is the teaching of Irish in the schools.  The instruction, implied or otherwise, from the Ministry of Education, is that all subjects are to be taught through the medium of Irish.  Did ever anyone hear a more ridiculous thing?  The English-speaking children are to be taught English, Euclid and other subjects through the medium of Irish.  It would be more reasonable in England to teach English through the medium of Low Dutch, Latin or any other language that English is derived from.  Then there is the subject of the summer school.  I dare say nine-tenths of the teachers of Ireland are English-speaking.  Those men of forty, fifty or sixty years of age are trotted off to summer schools every year at an enormous expense&mdash;a waste of effort and a waste of money&mdash;and presumably they are taught Irish.  One-tenth of them who know Irish will probably return with some literary knowledge of the language.  Others of them who will have to teach Irish will be unable to do it for years.  If they do teach it, it will be Irish without a soul.  The Compulsory teaching of English-speaking children, through the medium of Irish, is nothing more than the method of the stone age, or the stone axe that we hear so much about from the Ministerial benches.  I hope to goodness there will be some effort made in order that the <Col N="423" /> children will be taught Irish properly and also taught English; that is, that English-speaking people will be taught English properly and not through the medium of Irish by any means, but just as ordinary common people of this country and other countries are taught, through the medium of the language they speak from their childhood.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear such a recognised and well-known authority on Irish education as Deputy Professor Thrift speak so strongly on the importance of primary education.  I join with him in deploring that this Dáil has done nothing whatever to deal with this most important of all problems.  We in industry find the very feature that Deputy Professor Thrift has complained of one of our greatest difficulties.  A little while ago a conference was held amongst the commercial men and educationalists to find out why so few boys were offering for apprenticeship. We found after a very superficial enquiry that the reason was that the standard of education was so low amongst the rising generation that seventy-five per cent. of those who were anxious to follow industrial occupations were unable to pass a simple qualifying examination in order to get into a technical school.</P>

      <P>In Dublin seventy-five per cent. of those anxious to follow industry were unable to pass a simple qualifying examination in order to obtain the advantages to be derived from our technical schools.  That point was supported by a statement made by an educationist a short time ago, Professor T.D. O'Rahilly, when he stated that the Irish people were probably the most ignorant in Western Europe to-day. That is a shocking state of affairs. Notwithstanding that state of affairs, this Dáil has done nothing.  We have dealt with all subjects, but we have left this one, as Deputy Thrift has termed it, the most important of all subjects, alone, and it seems to me that we are determined to leave it alone, because amongst the Bills that have been slaughtered there was one and only one that attempted to deal in any way <Col N="424" /> with education.  It was a Bill dealing with school attendance.  That has been slaughtered.  So we stand to-day, in this Dáil, face to face with the accusation that during the whole of our term we have not attempted, in any way, to deal with this most important subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two reasons have been put forward for the low standard of education to be found amongst our young people to-day.  The first is the need for a better school attendance.  We are supposed to have a compulsory school attendance system established in the Free State.  Owing to the laxity of our school attendance system we find to-day in our own city amongst girls&mdash;it has come before me&mdash;that there are in certain classes ten per cent. of illiterates. The other reason that has been assigned why our standard is too low is that our leaving age is too low.  The school-leaving age to-day is, as Deputies know, fourteen, quite irrespective of the standard that the pupil has reached, and the average standard reached by the average pupil to-day at the age of fourteen is somewhere between the fourth and fifth standards. The fourth and fifth standards are so low that in some cases they do not mean a knowledge of reading and writing. How can we hope to progress in industry when this is the material you are giving us to work on?  This matter is within the knowledge of the Minister for Education and of those in his department. Again and again attention has been directed to the necessity for raising the school age and thereby raising the standard of education. There is one feature in connection with this standpoint that I would like to draw attention to and which almost amounts to a scandal.  Boys and girls are allowed to leave school to-day at the age of fourteen.  Those of them who are entitled to unemployment grants cannot get those grants until they reach the age of sixteen, and in order to get those grants at the age of sixteen they have to attend certain classes in certain schools for a number of hours per week.  What is happening? There is no employment, or very little employment to-day, owing to bad trade and other causes, for boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16 <Col N="425" /> years.  We are letting them run wild in our city.  At the age of 16, when they apply for the unemployment benefit, we say that in order to get it they must attend certain classes at school.  Owing to the low standard of education when they leave school at 14 years and the two years of idleness following on that between the ages of 14 and 16, when we get them to attend these classes at the age of 16, their education is so deficient that it is almost impossible to do anything with them.  It has, therefore, been urged on the Minister on more than one occasion that it would be in the interests of these boys and girls I have spoken of and in the interests of the nation that they should be kept at these schools up to the age of 16 years.  We even went as far as to state that any of them who could get employment should be freed from the qualification of attending a school.  That was all set aside.  Nothing could be done.  That state of things exists to-day.  It is a most unfortunate state of things.  I would plead with the Minister that this is a matter that ought to have immediate attention.  As I said at the outset, there is nothing of greater importance to industry to-day than the raising of the standard of education.  I go further and say that much of the bad trade and much of the unemployment that we suffer from in the Free State to-day is attributable to the bad system of primary education which we have.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have heard the forceful appeal from Deputy Good as to the necessity for an improved standard of education, and an extension of the school period.  I hope that the Minister who is responsible for the administration of the education system in this country will answer the questions that are being put to him, and will state as clearly and as definitely as the occasion calls for what is the Ministerial policy in regard to education. It has been said by Deputy Thrift and Deputy Good that this Dáil has not done anything for education. There has been something more since the new administration came into force.  Primary teachers are being put into a position, perhaps, on which a foundation <Col N="426" /> can be laid.  But it is now two and a half years since you took over responsibility for the administration of educational affairs and I think that is sufficient time to allow to the Government, notwithstanding their preoccupations to be able to state where they are going, what course they are taking, what end they hope to arrive at and, generally, what the Government policy regarding the education system is.  I want to hear from the Minister much more than his view regarding what is called primary education.  I think the time has come to hear from him what he hopes to accomplish, what his general intentions are regarding the education system as a whole, whether the various sides are to run independently of each other or whether there is to be a coming together and a co-ordination of the primary, secondary, technical and university systems; whether it is intended to retain for ever the difference between the education of the child of the poor man and let that finish at primary, and to encourage another section of the community to expect what is called a secondary education, some of them going to universities and some of them refraining from universities; or whether it is the policy of the Ministry to encourage as large a number as profitably can to take advantage of education right through from primary to university, and to give them the opportunity of taking advantage of all the educational facilities that may be available.  I also want to know whether the Ministry has any policy in regard to adult education&mdash;in regard to the adults of the present day who, having learned from experience what they have lost through lack of education, may have been stimulated to take advantage of educational facilities offered suitable for adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the opportunity ought to be availed of by the Minister to state as clearly as he can what has been the decision&mdash;assuming a decision has been arrived at&mdash;in regard to this general question of the educational policy which is henceforth to be pursued in the Saorstát.  I am one of those who believe that there should be a single education system, and that we should not have the sharp distinctions between primary and technical and <Col N="427" /> secondary and university education.  I think we will require to make up our minds whether it is intended that the man or the boy who goes from the primary to a secondary school shall set himself apart from the rest of the community, and go through this secondary school because he is going in for a profession, and whether there is any intention to use the secondary education system for the training of people for industrial occupations.  On this point, I think we should understand the general mind of the Dáil and the Ministry, particularly as to whether there is any sense in conducting a secondary, or even a university system, which aims at turning out people accomplished in literary subjects, suitable to professions, when the country, if it is to be a prosperous country in any true sense, will not, in future, find place for the exercise of those professions.  While we ought to recognise, and all the people associated with higher education should recognise, that the opportunity for those people, who have gone through a higher educational course, in professional careers will be very much less than hitherto, and that we ought not to spend large sums of public money, at any rate in providing education for professions which would be only used in other countries, we ought also to have as wide a system of higher education as possible, to cater for a much larger number, perhaps, than ever before, who will return to the ordinary occupations of life in a country which is carrying on productive labour.</P>
    <P>I do not want it to be thought that referring to the limitation of opportunity in future for highly educated people, I am, therefore, suggesting that there should be less higher education. On the contrary, I want to see a greatly increased number of people enjoying the advantages of higher education and returning to the ordinary occupations in commerce, industry and agriculture. We have heard something about the question of school attendance.  Undoubtedly it is very little use talking about higher education or of a highway from the primary schools to the university for large masses of the people <Col N="428" />&mdash;not for the selected pupil, but for all who can avail themselves of the opportunity, if we have failed to lay the foundations for education in the primary schools.  We cannot lay those foundations unless we take steps to ensure a very much higher average of school attendance than we have yet attained. That, of course, is largely a matter for the enforcement of the law, but it is probably even more a matter of public opinion regarding education.  I am forced to admit that the working people in the country, not less than and, perhaps, not more than, any other section of the community, have not realised the importance of education for their children and the necessity of taking advantage of the opportunities that are available.  We have not obliged our children to go to school as we ought to have done.  There is a great fault to be charged against the working man and the working woman, the farmer man and the farmer woman, and the professional man and woman, inasmuch as their children have not been induced to attend regularly at school.  But we are providing those people with a direct excuse, as has been expressed by Deputy Doyle, and, I think, by Deputy O'Connell, when we have said that the schools were bad and unhygienic, that they are overcrowded in some places, that classes are too large and that children cannot learn when they are only half-fed.  All these things undoubtedly react against good school attendance.  But I believe that there is something to be done by the Ministry, as well as by every public man and woman, to stimulate that interest in education.  Having done that, you may then, with much more effect, endeavour to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>I am told that, as a matter of fact, so far from the legal school-leaving age of 14 being given effect to, that the average school-leaving age is more like 12 or less than 12.  If that is a fact, it is a very sad state of affairs, especially when you bear in mind that from the age of 4 to 12 you have an attendance of those children 30 per cent. lower than the maximum.  You cannot expect those children to be fit to receive technical education, and, so far as secondary education is concerned, it is <Col N="429" /> out of the question.  Then there is no leaving certificate.  Deputy Good has spoken of the inability of so many boys and girls leaving school to take advantage of the technical tuition because of their failure in the primary schools.  I gather that while 14 is the legal leaving age, very large numbers leave before that.  There is no enforced attendance, and there is no leaving certificate required. There is no standard of efficiency or of educational qualification required before a child may leave school.  That, of course, is a defect, and I suppose it is a defect that everybody admits ought to be remedied.  We want to know, and I hope we shall learn to-night, what the Minister's view on that particular aspect may be.</P>
    <P>The statement of Deputy Good&mdash;I do not want to be cynical&mdash;that the failure of industry in Ireland may be largely attributable to the failure of education in primary schools one might say gives hope.  When industrialists come to realise that education in primary schools will be profitable, then I think we can look with greater hope to the future than if it were merely a hope that the manhood and womanhood of the future would be better, nobler and freer.  Robert Lowe, a Minister, I think Chancellor of the Exchequer, in England many years ago, before the Public Education Act of 1870 was passed&mdash;said what has become historical. After dealing with the extension of the Franchise he said: &ldquo;We must educate our masters.&rdquo;  Now we have from Deputy Good the contention that &ldquo;we must educate our servants,&rdquo; and if we are convinced that for the future industrial progress and benefit of the country the people must be educated, I think we have good grounds for hope that the Ministry will be obliged, shall I say by the force of pressure from the industrialists, to devise ways and means whereby children shall be educated.  I hope that the Minister will give us a full explanation of the educational policy of the Government as it has been evolved up to date.  Perhaps it will induce a fuller explanation if I were to say that we will assume that the outline of policy which he gives us tonight is the policy which the Ministry <Col N="430" /> has determined upon, and so far as his statement falls short of an explanation of that policy he will assume that no policy has been evolved.  That, I think, would suggest to the Minister that he should be as full and as detailed as it is possible for him to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>The MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. F. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is due to me that I should say something on this matter, and I am looking at one aspect of the question only.  There are many aspects of the question on which I could speak.  I am going to look at the one aspect that I have to accept a certain amount of responsibility for, the aspect that Deputy McBride referred to, that is that we are forcing Irish unreasonably into the schools through the summer courses.  I at least have to take responsibility for the Irish courses for teachers being established. But while I do that I do not accept responsibility for insisting on an attitude that contradicts everything that I ever learned of educational policy, that is, the first axiom of education that I learned was to proceed from the known to the unknown.  I do not accept responsibility, therefore, for insisting on the teaching of subjects through Irish when Irish is not the language which students best understand. I do not advocate that.  I do not think I ever did, and I am entirely opposed to attempting to teach subjects through Irish where Irish is not the known language.  You are killing Irish and you are not teaching the subject that you purport to teach.  That is my attitude.  The only contribution, therefore, that I wanted to make to this discussion was to appeal to the education authorities to revise their attitude on this very important matter. It is a fact that at present higher physics cannot be taught even through an English text book.  The most modern up-to-date book, if the subject is to be taught properly, is a French book.  You have not an English book. You very certainly have not an Irish book.  I therefore ask the education authorities to revise their attitude on the teaching of subjects in Irish when there are not text books available, and when the students are absolutely incapable of absorbing lectures in Irish.</P>

      <P>When these Estimates were before the Dáil last year I think the hope was expressed in several quarters that we would not have them again before us in the form in which they then appeared.  That is to say, that we should not have before us three separate Estimates, one entitled &ldquo;Public Education,&rdquo; one entitled &ldquo;Intermediate Education,'&mdash;and another entitled &ldquo;Universities and Colleges.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The view was expressed, and, I think, if my recollection serves correctly, the Minister himself joined in that view, that the correct method of dealing with this subject was to deal with education as one subject from beginning to end. That, of course, required the statement of a definite policy: it required certain legislation which the previous Dáil confidently expected would be one of the first and earliest charges upon the Dáil that came in at the end of last year. But here we are now a year after with Estimates coming before us exactly in that same fragmentary form that was adversely criticised last year, and the cause of it is that nothing has been done in the meantime.  No definite policy has been enunciated; no legislation has been sought to put the whole question of education upon a unified, simple, co-ordinated system.  The matter is more important than it appears at first sight.  It is important because it is fundamental to everything else. Earlier to-day the Minister for Justice was referring to the fact that there had been a very considerable measure of co-operation with the police force of this country but that that co-operation was not uniform.  It was unexpectedly large for the short time, but it was not uniform, and there were some serious gaps in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, here was the Minister for Justice dealing with a purely police question. Certain matters were definitely referred to, but actually what he was talking of was not a police question at all but an educational question.  Because, it is not until there be a people who have been trained from that point of view from their youth in the schools that there can be expected that conception of the State existing as the corporate <Col N="432" /> body of all the citizens of the State, that they can be made realise that they were not asked to help the police as somebody outside themselves who sought their assistance, but were asked to give the assistance of their own selves in their corporate existence. Until that principle has been brought into the mind at the earliest stage, as it is in other nations, that we can expect to have the Minister for Justice rising in the Dáil and saying that when crime occurs that crime is regarded by the people not as offence against the Free State, or as against the police, or certain authorities, but as an offence against the people themselves.  That is the educational point of view.  Similarly, take the point of view that Deputy Good has mentioned.</P>
    <P>We are talking about unemployment. Now I happen to know one or two definite cases which may be of a restricted and humble scope, but I have two instances before my mind where foreign enterprise, that is to say, enterprise not definitely of Irish origin, had wished to establish factories here.  Previous to doing so inquiries were instituted as to what prospects were available for the technical workmen necessary for the conduct of that business.  In each case the decision had to be come to that if the enterprise had to be carried out, certain important parts of the enterprise would have to be conducted by imported workmen, and in these two definite cases that I have in mind a decision was taken not to make a start, because it was felt that that kind of importation might arouse serious prejudices and not lead to smooth and frictionless working.  There is the case where technical brains are sometimes used for technical education.  I conceive of education from rather a different point of view, and I therefore very much admire the precision and the accuracy with which Deputy Johnson used the phrase when speaking on this subject a little while ago, of technical tuition.  We lack that technical tuition. It is so everywhere in politics, and in every other matter.  Difficulties are encountered, and the conduct of this State in the curing of many evils that we hope and hold to be transient is not to be found by an appeal to some one or other Minister whose immediate responsibility <Col N="433" /> it happens to be.  The real answer must be in the educational policy of that country.  The educational policy of this State, though the State has now been in existence for about two and a half years, has yet to be enunciated, and waits yet to be framed in some legislative measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is better aware of this, I am sure, than any Deputy can be.  The Minister for Education is himself a historian of considerable distinction and standing, and even while I speak he could give instances of nations that during the past fifty or sixty years have, within one generation in their schools, recast and refashioned the whole nation.  Germany is an outstanding example.  Within less than one generation it was not by statesmen that the whole outlook of that nation was changed, that the nation was built up and in its fibres re-created.  That was not done by political thinkers; it was not done by protective policies, but it was done by teachers in the schools, teachers who were chosen for their work, and teachers who took their part in a definite policy that was clearly understood by them and clearly known to be such by the entire nation.  I am not now dealing with the ethics or the morals of the kind of result that was achieved.  I am merely dealing with the fact that whereas at the beginning of one generation a country, a nation, and a State that held an inferior position in practical material achievements, though perhaps very high in the intellectual world, at the end of that generation its material achievement was so great and substantial that the whole mind of the nation had been changed, and the whole nation had been enriched in a purely material sense.  That change had come as the result of the change wrought in the schools of the nation, and that change was wrought in the schools of the nation by a clear, co-ordinated system of education.  It took the child early, and did not conceive of education as being a matter of class or a matter of convenience, but it regarded every citizen as being trained and taught in the schools to play a part in the national development and the national development resulted.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of the difficulties <Col N="434" /> that the Minister for Education has had to contend with, and that the members of the Executive Council have had to contend with.  There has been a pressure of legislation, and even if a fraction of the rumours one hears be true, it would appear that pressure for economy and other pressing matters of legislation have caused legislation in respect to education to be pressed to one side.  If that be the case, and whether it be actually the case or merely circumstantially the case, I say it is a mistake, because the chief matter of importance, more important than any other matter, is a clear statement on educational policy and of a beginning to put it into practical effect.  Again I say what I said last year, that I hope this is the last time that this Legislature will have presented before it not one Estimate in respect of education, such as is required, but these fragmentary matters that deal with a thing in a fragmentary fashion simply because we are still waiting that mould and form as the result of an imaginative grasp of the questions to be dealt with.  I hope that such an Estimate will be laid before this Dáil in the piece of legislation that was promised to us last year, but which we have yet to await.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that from these benches some expression of opinion should be given on this all important subject.  In passing, I want to make reference to a statement by Deputy McBride with regard to the teaching of Irish in national schools. That was also referred to by the Minister for Fisheries.  I want to say that in whatever way, or by whatever steps, the Minister for Education seeks to reestablish the Irish language as the national language, a good deal of success has been achieved.  I am not going to say it is right that subjects should be taught through the medium of Irish where that is not possible.  I am going to speak on what I know.  I think it has been generally conceded throughout the country that very considerable progress is being made with school-going children in the teaching of the Irish language, and to those who recognise that Ireland is a distinct nation, and that the chief mark of distinctive nationality <Col N="435" /> is the language, that is something that we are called upon to record our appreciation of.</P>
      <P>As regards the system of education in the country generally, I regret I must say that the agricultural industry is, perhaps, suffering to a greater extent than any other industry through lack of education and through lack of the knowledge that we should have obtained in the past through a proper educational system.  I regret steps have not been taken by the Ministry of Education to set things right. I agree that perhaps the time has not yet come when the Minister would be in a position to unfold his plans and to give the country a system that will be most suited to its needs.  The Minister, perhaps, may be thinking out what he means to do, but I submit to him it is time the country saw what the Ministry of Education means to do for the Ireland of the future.  Those who have been, or are connected with agriculture have it borne in on them that through lack of education and knowledge it is practically impossible to do for agriculture what we seek to do and what agriculture needs.  If we suffer, perhaps some of the fault may be attributed to ourselves, but not all.  The fault lay in the system and that system had not yet been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that the attendance of children at rural schools is and has been very bad, and that the attendances are not improving.  I know that in many districts in my county, when instructors attend to give classes in agricultural subjects, it is a common complaint that it would be essential that many of the pupils would get a course in primary schools before they could hope to leave the agricultural classes with improved knowledge, and before they could benefit from the time they spent there.  That is the situation. It is regrettable, but it is nevertheless true.  It is common, not to one district or to one county, but to practically all the country from one end to the other.  What is the result?  It may seem quite good for Deputies here to speak and point to what agriculturalists ought to do, to lecture us on our faults and weaknesses.  We are conscious, <Col N="436" /> many of us, of those faults and weaknesses.</P>
    <P>What do we find when we try to improve our position?  The truth is that the people with whom we come in contact, the people with whom we have to deal, have had so little chance of having their brains trained in their early youth that to-day when we go amongst them and suggest what ought to be done by way of improvement in methods of business or in the management of their farms, or in the tillage of the soil, we find the very same situation amongst the old, the middle-aged, or the grownup farmers, as confront the agricultural instructor.  That is the weakness and that is the disability that anyone can observe, who goes amongst the agricultural community in Ireland, helping to improve by some act of his the position of agriculture, of agriculturists, and the country generally.  That situation has got to be changed before progress can be made, if we are to accept&mdash;and it is generally accepted&mdash;that agriculture is the mainstay of the nation. Whether or not Deputy Milroy or other Deputies may change the conditions, and make other industries the basis on which a new State may rear its head, the fact is to-day that agriculture is what we have to rely on.  The prosperity of that industry will mean the prosperity of the country, but prosperity can never come to the industry if those who are managing and controlling it have not such efficient training through a system of education as that they will be capable of making the most out of employing other means to permit them to face competitors either at home or in foreign countries.  When we are placed in that position the nation will then be so situated that those in charge of its main industry will be able to bring prosperity to it, and consequent prosperity to the country, because all will benefit from the prosperity of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The position all along has been the same.  In the report of the Agricultural Commission we are told that the prevalent idea is that the end and aim of all education in the National Schools is to prepare pupils for a seat at a desk in a city office, or for a minor appointment in the Civil Service and that that <Col N="437" /> must be abandoned.  It is true that that has been the end and aim of education in this country.  What is the result? Go down the country, and take out even the most intelligent pupils, and you will find there in the schools children who have been brought up in the country.  Take them to the fields where they spend their days or hours. Try and find out what they know about the things around them.  Ask them about the plants, trees and flowers, and see what they know of those things. The bias has been all the other way. They know nothing of the beauties of the country, or what life in rural Ireland means.  Their thoughts are turned to the towns and the cities and to the things that are there supposed to be beautiful.  They do not consider the beauties of their native districts.  The result is that everywhere throughout rural Ireland we have the idea in the minds of our growing up young men and women that they must get away from country life.  They feel they must get to the town or city, if not in Ireland, in some foreign land.  If that is to be the policy of the future, and if the minds of the rising generation are to be trained and turned into such a groove as that, what will be the inevitable result for the Irish nation?</P>
    <P>I hold the Irish nation has survived the trials and the persecutions of the past because our people as a whole were an agricultural people.  The country gave us a strong race, physically and mentally, and even if many left others came to take their places.  The physique of the Irish nation withstood all the shocks of centuries, because the people lived on the soil and away from the towns and cities.  If we continue as we are and if the trend of the Irish mind and of education is that all the beauties and perfections of life are to be got amongst the industrial populations in towns and cities and that there is nothing worth admiring in the country, that agriculture is only a secondary industry and that it has very little in it but hard work and little recompense, then I say that the basis on which we are going to re-establish this nation will not be sound.  The sooner we make up our minds&mdash;whether we live in the towns or in the country, whether we are <Col N="438" /> engaged in industrial pursuits, and whether we are workers or owners of factories&mdash;that in the best interests of the Irish nation, its life physically and nationally, that the agricultural industry and the people interested in it must be kept alive, and that they must be taught that agriculture is a bigger thing than any other industry in the country, the better for us all and for the country.</P>
    <P>The sooner people are taught there is more beauty in Irish rural life than in the towns and cities, than the sooner will we be able to create conditions that will make it pleasant for people to live their lives in rural districts, and the sooner will we be making absolutely certain that the life of the Irish nation will be secure.  In our day we find the prejudice in favour of professions.  The man who has been brought up on the land is never given credit, or rarely given credit, for having real worth.  The professions in this country have undoubtedly established themselves.  I find no fault with that.  What I do find fault with is that agriculture has not also been able to establish itself and raise itself up to the standards of other professions.</P>

      <P>If the mass of our people are to be trained in such a groove, if the bias of our educational system is to be such that agriculture is to get a back seat, and to continue to be given the little consideration that has been given to it in the past, then I cannot see that the future of this nation is going to be what many hoped it would be.  It is absolutely essential that an institution like the College of Science should be raised up in this country and be given the very same standing as the National University or Trinity College.  It is essential that we should have such an institution as that, where men can go in and after a number of years spent there can come out and be in a position to give service to the country's main industry, and not to be exported like many of those who unfortunately <Col N="439" /> attend many other institutions and come out after examinations and are exported to give their service in their professions to the people of another country.  We expect from the Minister for Education in this country that he will recognise that education, at least in the rural districts, will be given a rural bias and that the subjects taught in our schools in the rural districts will be taught in such a manner, in such a way, under such a system as will be beneficial to the children sent there&mdash;the reading of books, and the studying of arithmetic, mensuration and other subjects such as will be taught to pupils to make them understand that there is a connection between these subjects and their life at home.  That has not been considered in the past, but we hope it will be changed very soon.  I am all with those who argue that the attendance at our schools is certainly a disgrace, and that no progress can ever be made if the children are not sent regularly to school.  However capable teachers may be and however earnest they may be in their labours, the children who are not sent regularly and punctually to school can never hope to attain to a standard of knowledge that is desired or to which they would have attained had they been sent regularly to school. I have come to the conclusion that parents will not voluntarily conform to these regulations.  The reason largely is because they themselves are not capable of valuing what education means.  Unfortunately it is so, and we have to take cognisance of that fact, and if they do not appreciate the value of education there is only one alternative, and that is to insist that they shall send their children to school. The sooner the Minister takes steps to do this the better, and if he has to go on with the present system while the change is being made, the most should be made of the present system and children should be compelled to go to school whether parents like it or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to state what the educational policy of the Ministry as a whole is.  That raises a very large issue.  I agree with those who say that it is the most important one that faces the people of this country and their representatives.  Fault has been found with me for not having presented you with some legislative programme with regard to legislation.  I am not at all certain that the fact that this Committee on the Estimates has resolved itself this evening into a Conference on educational matters is not much more valuable than a dish of legislation, much more valuable for the purposes of educational development in the country. Before we proceed with reforms, at all events, reforms that can be expected to bear fruit, we have to get the minds of the people turned in the direction of those reforms.  I have been reproached with being bureaucratic.  In some matters, at all events, I feel very little bureaucracy inside me.  I feel myself altogether free from the bureaucratic desire to drag the country behind me, in any sense, or to drive it in front of me.  I should rather be moving with it, or rather, if I could move in the right direction, that it would be moving along with me.  It is a very valuable thing, I think, to find that from all quarters of this Assembly addresses have been given this evening which deal with the general aspect of the question.  I hope that the members of this Assembly will bear in mind when they go out among their constituents that they also have an educative power and that it is in their power to bring into people's minds the importance of the whole question of national education, the importance of it to the people themselves, to the children, the generation that are to rise up after them, and to the country which <Col N="441" /> we all claim to love and to serve.  I do not know whether reminding people of their duty in that respect will be a means of increasing the number of votes that any Deputy is likely to receive the next time he goes to the polls, but I am quite sure that every Deputy here recognises that he has other interests and deeper interests than saying things that will be sweet and popular to the voters, and that will induce them to give him stronger support the next time that he goes before them.  Deputy Johnson, I think, has rather challenged me to make some sort of a general statement.  If I have to make a general statement now I think I can promise you I will give you something to live up to.  We inserted in our Constitution an Article dealing with education.  Really I think it was a piece of pious window dressing; it may as well have been left out. It is &ldquo;That every citizen of this country is entitled to free elementary education.&rdquo;  In these days we may as well have made it that every citizen in this country was entitled to air and water, and the statement would have been as valuable.  With regard to the rights of citizens in education I hold that the child of every citizen is entitled to equality of opportunity with regard to all education which is administered by the public authority.</P>
    <P>It is not merely that I should like to sweep away the gaps that exist.  It is better to avoid Latin, but it is what I might call a damnable inheritance&mdash; these gaps that exist in our educational system, and that cause it to be divided into primary and secondary and higher, with technical education for a side-show.  For my part, I never could understand why there was not tertiary and quaternary and quinary and several other divisions as well as primary, secondary and higher.  These divisions do not exist naturally.  They are purely artificial.  It is one thing to recognise them; another thing to remedy them.  The strange thing is that no matter how artificial and how arbitrary some of these things are you find the public mind accepting them in the most passive way.  Not only that, but I make a prophecy that, except myself, the first person who comes along to this problem will be surprised at the <Col N="442" /> amount of irritation he will create by asking the public to depart from those things they have been accustomed to. Then again it is not merely that the public have been accustomed to them, but a structure has been built up and a personnel has been built up, and in education everything depends on personnel. There is no good education possible without good teachers, and with good teachers everything is possible.</P>
    <P>Everything depends upon the personnel, and we have the personnel there ready.  It is brought up to a certain stage.  It has been passed on to us, and unless you are prepared to spend a rather fabulous sum on pensions you cannot expect to change it suddenly. We have to work on with the material we have, and, consequently, no matter how anxious we are to achieve results, we must work patiently.  As to the general aim to be achieved, I am not going to dwell on that feature of 75 per cent. we have heard of so often.  But I do admit that this is a country the life of which is mainly rural, and from that point of view I ask myself what should be the aim of education?  In my opinion education with regard to the rural community in Ireland should aim at nothing less than building up a condition of rural civilisation as high, to say the least, as any urban civilisation, and I believe that to be possible. Whether it is possible or not&mdash;and it would be better for us not to have any controversy on that&mdash;the aim of education with regard to the rural community should be to build to the maximum height the rural civilisation of the country.  That means a great many things besides having in view the industry of agriculture.  On that point, Deputy Baxter said we had taken no steps.  Well, again, I say it is not easy to take the steps.  He said the system was not yet changed.  It is not.  I am the unfortunate inheritor of the system, and I cannot change it&mdash;certainly not quickly.  With regard to the steps taken, we have at all events made a commencement this year by introducing lectures on agricultural subjects in the training colleges.</P>
    <P>That is a modest beginning, but it is meant to be a beginning and not to stop there.  Further, I had the good fortune <Col N="443" /> to be present to see some work that was being done by a university professor in Dublin, and, again, I would remind you of a truism which I expressed when we were discussing these Estimates last year, that the foundation of education is not the primary schools but the universities.  The more clearly we are convinced on that subject the more we shall be on the right line towards getting such valuable reforms in education as we desire.  This Professor had inaugurated, of his own motion, instruction in horticulture, and the instruction was mainly attended by candidates for the profession of primary teacher.  I was glad to see that.  I was glad to see also that these candidate-teachers were most enthusiastic students.  It occurred to me at the time, and I said it when I was speaking to these students, that I should like that every school in Ireland&mdash;I was not thinking of primary schools only, because I do not like to think in terms of primary schools&mdash; that would be capable of making use of it, should have a sufficient plot of ground for the purpose of horticultural education.  I myself believe that a great deal that would be valuable for agriculture in the ordinary economic sense, could be taught by means of horticulture, and I believe, besides, that apart from agriculture we can teach through horticulture a great deal of civilisation. You can teach people to have a proper reverence for their own homes and for the exterior of their own homes, and to treat them with a proper worship and respect.  There are many other things&mdash; habits of order, habits of observation, habits of study of the immense, inexhaustible mystery of nature&mdash;that can be taught in the same way.  These things have the deepest civilising effect on those who receive such instruction.</P>
    <P>The result of having put myself into that condition of expressing the wish that schools should have those horticultural plots was that I made enquiries from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and he told me&mdash;and I wish to impress it on every Deputy and on everyone else interested, if my words can go out&mdash;that under the recent Land Act it is possible, wherever land is being taken and divided and is sufficiently <Col N="444" /> conveniently situated for the school&mdash;whether that school be what is called primary, or secondary, or any other label that may be attached to it &mdash;to have sufficient horticultural plots set aside for the use of schools.  I should like to think that advantage would be taken of that provision.  It will imply some not very considerable financial charge, but the amount of annuity that will be charged against a plot of the size that will be taken for a school will be very small indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not see any necessity for in any way or to any degree setting up any rivalry between, or canvassing the relative merits of agricultural life, agricultural industry, rural civilisation and the life, industry and civilisation of the towns.  They are not enemies to each other, but a complement to each other. The agricultural industrialist is very glad to visit the town and to take away from it whatever advantage he can. The town dweller in like manner is very glad to get in touch with country life and industry, and to derive from them whatever advantage he can. These two things are complementary to each other.  Both of them are concerned in this question, which practically every Deputy has spoken of, and that is school attendance.  I am glad it is recognised that I am not the principal criminal in the matter of school attendance.  I am glad it is recognised that there is not a high standard of sense of duty, where there should be a high standard, on the part of many parents in this country.  What more natural duty is there than the duty of parents to their children?  Yet there is no doubt that at all events, in far too large a proportion of cases, parents are gravely culpable in this respect and that, as Deputy Johnson said, public opinion is to blame.  Public opinion should make the parent who keeps his children away from school see that he is disgracing himself, whether he does it through mere carelessness, as happens undoubtedly in some cases, or, what is worse, through greed, as in other cases, through placing the immediate interest of the parent above the ultimate interest of the child.  The parents in these cases are to blame and the public opinion of those around them <Col N="445" /> is to blame.  But it does not stop there. Other authorities have a certain power to enforce the law of attendance, and they did not carry it out.  They did not do their duty in that respect.  I did not hear that brought up on the different occasions on which local government has been discussed here lately.  In that respect we may take it as proved, because everyone here is unanimous that school attendance has been below what it ought to be, and there is no doubt that the powers that the local authorities had, and which they ought to have exercised, they failed to exercise.</P>
    <P>Further, the local tribunals which have the duty of enforcing school attendance, if I am not mistaken, also in many cases, and to a large extent, failed to rise to the level of that duty. I told the Dáil last year that so far was I from being bureaucratic in this matter, that it was with the utmost reluctance that I would consent to having the enforcement of school attendance left in the hands of the central government and enforced through the police authorities, who are the servants of that Government.  I must say that under the circumstances, and for the time through which we are passing, I have become convinced that that is necessary. I say with regret, and with apology, to the representatives of the country here, that I am sorry that the measure which I prepared for that purpose has not been brought before them at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>Deputy McBride and the Minister for Fisheries have brought an accusation against me, and I am going to ask with regard to those two Deputies that the age for leaving school be extended up to 90.  Deputy McBride held me up to odium as a barbarian who was teaching all sorts of subjects through the Irish language to children that do not know Irish.  I understand&mdash;I am not quite certain whether I am right or not&mdash;that the Minister for Fisheries echoed his complaint.  The fact is that it is only in Irish-speaking districts, and where the bulk of the children know Irish, that any such method of teaching is carried on.  It may be pointed out that in a school where it is carried on there may be two or three children, or a certain proportion of <Col N="446" /> children, who do not know Irish and who are placed at a disadvantage.  It came to my knowledge that in a court in a certain part of Ireland some time ago a case arose in which the plaintiff was Irish-speaking.  The defendant was Irish-speaking, the magistrate or judge was Irish-speaking and the professional man on one side was Irish-speaking, but on the other side the professional man could not speak Irish.</P>
    <P>It was coolly suggested that in that case the language of the district and the language of all the people in the court except of one professional man should be set aside and that the case should be carried on in English for the benefit of this one exceptional gentleman. If it is suggested that in schools in an Irish-speaking district the Irish language is to be put aside, is to get a place of inferiority, because a certain accidental number do not use it, I cannot consent to that.  That is not my plan.  Perhaps it is better to leave it at that.  With regard to the Minister for Fisheries, as he is so anxious that children should be effectively taught, I hope that he will prove his own efficiency in securing that fish will be effectively caught.</P>

      <P>And as for the picture of unfortunate teachers of 50 and 60 years of age being trotted off&mdash; I think that was the expression&mdash;I would strongly recommend Deputies to take a little elementary trouble in finding out the facts before they make statements.  I do not like these phrases which I hear repeated so often.  The oftener they are repeated the less people seem to think of them, and one of the faults I have to find with education in this country is that it has taught so many thousands of people the use of words and phrases, and to lose sight, apparently, of the realities behind them.  I am a little bit of a realist and a little bit of a materialist in the matter of education, and I do believe that the education, both for country and town, both for Deputy Baxter and for Deputy Good, should be turned away <Col N="447" /> from this phraseological style which we have been accustomed to in the past, and made to face towards the facts of life, the agricultural facts, the rural facts, the industrial facts, the commercial facts.  I believe, further, that from every point of view, from the point of view of mental training and from the point of view of mental development, as much can be obtained from directing the mind towards the facts of life, the facts of nature, the facts of business, the facts of industry, the facts of technology as can be obtained in any other way.  It is all a matter of how the teacher uses the material upon which he is engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our old system of education of which I am the joint heir, with the rest of the Deputies, was undoubtedly directed and its main character shaped by the supposed desirability of producing clerks, professional men, people in various clerical occupations, people whose business was to read things and to write things and to speak things, but not to make things, and with regard to the country especially&mdash;and this applies to the secondary schools, so called, more than to the primary schools&mdash;I believe that the effect of education has been to root people out of the country, to pull them up by the roots, and that that education has had no facing towards the community to which those people belonged, that it was not for the benefit of the community. It arises from a selfish individualism. This parent and that parent thinks that a certain line of life would be the best for Johnny or Tommy, or whoever else he may happen to be, and the rest have to fit in to the plan of education that is sketched out for these particular persons.  An English Commission inquiring into the question of Civil Service education sat in Dublin some years ago, and I was sent from the Gaelic League to give evidence before it.  I told that Commission that the Civil Service was exercising an influence in Ireland even right away to every primary school on the Western seaboard.  They could not believe that, and they wondered that there could be such an effect.  I said: &ldquo;I cannot bring evidence to you, but I can tell <Col N="448" /> you an anecdote that is well known in every part of Ireland.  A child was born; the neighbours turned in to congratulate the parents, and one of them, looking at the child in the cradle, was heard to say, soliloquising to herself, `What a grand sorter he will make!' &rdquo; Yes, that is the destiny that was held by the kind of education we had in Ireland before the typical child, the member of a rural community in Ireland. Is it any wonder that education should have failed to have any favourable reaction whatsoever, in a first place on our agricultural industry, and in a second and a higher place on the whole life and civilisation of our rural communities?</P>
    <P>The people were taught to regard things surrounding the place in which they were born and in which their parents lived as not to be improved at all, to be thrown behind their backs, to be discarded.  I do aim at changing that, and I do admit that I do not see the way, and do not expect to see the way all at once.  The way has to be explored, and I do not expect and I do not cherish the illusion that a Ministerial Department will be able by itself to shape out the way.  I want, first of all, the people of the country to realise that such a change ought to be made, and I am certain from the discussion we have had this evening that their representatives will do all that lies in their power to impress it on the people that such a change ought to be made, and when we have the expectancy of the change, the will for the change, and the reason for the change understood it will be a hundred times easier for the Ministers who are your servants to make changes of that kind.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies, in the same proportion, with regard to city life.  I believe there is a great deal of waste in our education at present, but I should not like the Minister for Finance to be present if I were echoing the most dangerous thing that Deputy Thrift let fall during the course of his speech, that our education at present was about 50 per cent. too expensive.  I do not agree with him in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I said that.  What I said was that we <Col N="449" /> should get twice as good results for half the money, which is a rather different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>When I have to do battle I will not even tempt the Minister for Finance with the statement in that form.  If it is true that in proportion to our revenue we are spending more money than other countries on education, well, then, taking that fact by itself, we ought to be proud of it.  As for the results achieved, that is another matter.  We should certainly see, if we are spending more money than other countries on education, that we are getting better value.  That, as I said, will take time.  I know I have been very general, as general as possible, in putting before you the view of education that I think I ought to have and that I actually do hold.  As to the detailed working out of it, I do not feel myself in a position to place it before you.  Many points have been raised by Deputy O'Connell which, I think, would come under the details of different portions of the Estimate.  As he touched on many points, I suppose I should have given him a more or less detailed answer, but perhaps following the Chairman's ruling at an earlier part of the proceedings, it would be better for me to take these things up later on.  As to the absence of reports, I think we may take that as general. That, on the face of it, is a just point of criticism, and I will endeavour to have the necessity for that criticism removed as soon as possible.  I hope to have adequate reports containing statistical information available.  The codification of rules, I suppose, also may be regarded as a general matter.  I thing it is right that the rules governing the conduct of primary schools should be reduced to one body, and that point shall have attention.  As to the setting up of an Advisory Council, I honestly think that the time for it is not yet, especially if we are going to have reforms and a different orientation for our education in the future.  I think it would be a good thing if the ideas expressed here this evening by a number of Deputies from different sides of the Dáil, by Deputy Good, Deputy Johnson, and Deputy Baxter, with regard <Col N="450" /> to how our education should work out for the benefit of the nation and the whole community were allowed to ferment for a short time.  I have seen no sign of them at work, and I would like to see them at work for a short time before setting up an Advisory Council to direct the Ministry in its policy. With regard to school buildings, it seems to me that this country, considering its taxation in the past, should long ago have been provided with school buildings far in advance of those which it possesses at present.  The absence of satisfactory buildings for school accommodation in the country must be charged to a grievous neglect of the public interest in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that this is a difficult and inopportune time for making up deficiencies in that respect.  Building is more difficult at present than ever it has been in our time, and the state of things which formerly existed has almost passed away in the country. It used to be that if a school had to be built in a country district there was a great deal of what I might call co-operative work, almost gratuitous work, and work, when it was not gratuitous, was semi-gratuitously done in erecting buildings of that kind.  I am afraid that, over the greater part of the country, that can no longer be expected, and that where school buildings have to be erected they will have to be erected pretty much on the same business footing as buildings erected in town areas.  With regard to the towns, and to Dublin especially, Deputy Doyle pressed the point about school accommodation in Dublin.  If we had an improved school attendance in Dublin, according to the information I have if school attendance were normal in Dublin at present the schools would be very much overcrowded.  The school accommodation in Dublin at present is about equal to meeting the needs of the bad attendance that exists at present.  If the attendance were raised to a normal level there would be at once the problem of overcrowding in the schools.  I mentioned that some time ago to the President, and I must say that it met with his hearty co-operation. If any public premises, such as barracks in Dublin are to be handed over or to be passed over from the <Col N="451" /> State authority to the urban authority, I trust it will be made a condition, and that everyone interested will help in seeing that that condition is observed &mdash;that sufficient of these buildings for school accommodation will be reserved. I believe that places of that kind, such as barracks which are likely to be evacuated in the future and which are already in existence, would be fairly suitable, although not originally adapted for school purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not think, with regard to what Deputy O'Connell said&mdash;as it belongs to a point which I touched on already &mdash;that I can be fairly accused of rushing matters with regard to instruction in Irish.  In any regulation of that kind that is made, a certain proportion of those who have to accommodate themselves to the new code will be under a sense of grievance, and not only will they be under a sense of grievance, but they will feel actual hardship.  I cannot help that; that must happen.  So far as I am concerned, it is not willing; it is a necessary consequence of the change that has to take place.  With regard to inspection, that is also a general matter, but I think I can dispose of it at present. There is no doubt that the inspectorate understand it is the desire of the Minister that they should act, not in a spirit of censorship, and not as censors, of the work that is being done by the teachers in the schools, but primarily to assist and encourage and develop that work.  That is the primary business of an inspector.  When I say that, I should not like anyone to run away with the idea that it is any part of an inspector's duties to hut his eyes towards delinquencies.</P>

      <P>I do not know myself; I have not sufficient experience to base judgment on that question of the classification of teaching, as it is done in the schools, into &ldquo;very good,&rdquo;&ldquo;very fair,&rdquo;&ldquo;fair,&rdquo; and the rest of it or to say at the moment what system of appraising the work that is done in the schools could effectively be substituted for it.  It has been pointed out <Col N="452" /> by Deputy Figgis that certain works which might have been established in this country were not established on account of the absence of technically-trained workmen.  That is not one of the faults of our educational system. It has plenty of faults, but that is not one of them.  If, say, any time during the last ten years we had technical schools in Dublin, and imparted technical training for works that do not exist in Dublin, the result would be that these workmen would emigrate. No other result could be contemplated. I do not lay that down as an absolute doctrine, but the basis of technical training and education is the industries which exist, the industries with which the person who receives the technical training can come immediately into contact.  If we technically train people, as we have done to some extent, for industries which are not there, we train those persons for emigration, and as the demand for them is at present so pressing in other places, their emigration is almost an inevitable result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that on the motion for the adjournment I would call attention to, and ask an explanation from the Ministry regarding a statement made by Prosecuting Counsel, Mr. Carrigan, K.C., in a case which appeared in the Central Criminal Court on Tuesday.  A man was charged with the theft of goods at the station at Dun Laoghaire.  He was prosecuted and found guilty.  In the course of the charge Mr. Carrigan, speaking, no <Col N="454" /> doubt under instructions, instructions which must have gone from the State Solicitor's office, stated, according to the report in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;: &ldquo;The station and pier had become notorious for larcenies from passengers' luggage,&rdquo; and further, apart from the criminality of the affair, he said &ldquo;it was a disgrace to Dublin and the country that strangers on their way to Dublin should have to pass through a file of rogues.&rdquo;  One may take up a matter of that kind from the point of view of the effect upon passengers from other countries coming to Ireland via Dun Laoghaire, with the authority of the State Solicitor behind it.  That would be bad enough, but I will leave that for other people to deal with.  I am interested primarily in this matter because it is a charge against a considerable number of men, some of them State servants, others of them railway servants, who have been engaged at work on the station and pier at Dun Laoghaire for a long number of years and against whom there is not the slightest ground for such a sweeping charge made on the authority of the State Department. When a State Counsel speaks of passengers having to pass through a file of rogues he must be referring to the men engaged on their daily occupations on that pier.  These men are seamen, railway servants, and Customs officials&mdash;that is the file of rogues referred to by the State Counsel. I am given to understand that so far from there being any basis for such a charge there has very seldom, if ever, for ten or fifteen years been any charge against a railwayman in that station. Perhaps one might go much further back than ten or fifteen years, but I for the moment, will leave it at that. The case in question could not have been brought to the courts except for the activities, and the assistance given in the detection of this offence, of the very railwaymen who are charged with being a file of rogues.  For a statement of that kind to go out with the imprimatur of the Government, the Minister for Justice and his Department, is a libel on, and a slander against people concerned, and is a statement that will do great harm to the country because, as sure as anything is in journalism, that <Col N="455" /> statement will be repeated in the English and American Press, and unless it is repudiated on behalf of the Government by a Minister of the Government and given the same publicity, then I say these men are going to suffer under an unfounded charge and the country in general is going to suffer a bad reputation, entirely undeserved.  I hope not only will the Minister repudiate the statement, but that some call will be made upon those responsible for making it, whether it was on the definite instruction of the Solicitor's Department, or whether it was the action of initiative of the Counsel himself, and that some demand will be made from the Government benches that that statement shall be publicly withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I can claim to have a very close and personal knowledge of the working conditions both at the pier and station at Dun Laoghaire, and from twenty years' experience of railway men, to have a good knowledge of each one of these 120 or 130 men upon whom this reflection has been cast as a result of the statement that has been made.  I never in my experience read a statement that was made&mdash;and I am assured by officials who were in court that this is a correct report&mdash;with less justification that the one which Deputy Johnson has complained about.  The fact of that statement being published in the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; or &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; or the American papers would have a very disastrous effect on the tourist traffic in this country.  I have gone very closely into the statement, and I am assured, both from my own examination of the records and by people who have been working on the pier and station, that a prosecution has not taken place for forty years.  There has not been any complaint worth speaking about from passengers, and surely there cannot be any complaint from the gentleman who made this unfounded charge under the protection of the courts of the Free State.  I have very personal knowledge that Mr. Carrigan has received a degree of courtesy and consideration which ordinary passengers would not receive in the ordinary way.  He is the last man in the world, from what I know and can <Col N="456" /> prove, who should make a statement of this character.  The railwaymen, like everybody else in this country, pay their share of taxation for the upkeep of the State, and part of the taxation paid by them goes to the prosecuting counsel who made this statement.  I say that the funds of the Free State Government should not be paid to a man who makes such an irresponsible statement as the one I complain of.  This charge, unfounded as it is, is a charge not alone against employees, who are responsible for the working of the station and pier to two companies, but also against the companies and their principal officials, and I think it is due to them that some reason should be given for the making of such a statement. I know it to be a fact that officials of those companies were in court on this occasion.  Mr. Carrigan, in the course of his work as prosecuting counsel, could have called these officials and examined them as to what happened regarding this alleged pilfering, and he could have got evidence on oath to counter the statement he made.  He should have taken that step, to make sure that there was some justification, before making that statement.  I demand, on behalf of 130 men who were working there, and on behalf of the railwaymen as a whole, that a public apology should be given by the individual who made the statement or that some justification should be given to the railwaymen, and to this House, for making that statement.  I hope that the Minister will repudiate that statement in fairness to all concerned, and that a public apology will be given for making this very slanderous and lying statement.</P>

      <P>I admit that I missed reading this particular extract that appeared in the papers about this case and which has been read by Deputy Johnson.  I must say that I regret very much that such a statement has been made in court, if it has, and I take it has, when it appeared in the Press.  I do not know that any instructions were given by the chief State Solicitor that such a charge should be levelled.  I do not think that instructions would have been given but if it was the case, I think that that <Col N="457" /> would not be the method of dealing with it, but that other steps should be taken in regard to it and that you ought not brand every man, even if we concede for the sake of argument that there was more than one dishonest man there.  It is in the interests of justice that the man who is guilty should be charged, but in justice to the rest of the men no such general statement should have been made about them. So far as my own experience goes, as well as that of others with whom I have come in contact, who have travelled by the boat and across the harbour way to the train, I have never heard any complaints concerning loss of property.  It is inevitable that there should be loss, but that it should go out that there is such a condition of affairs that a person has to pass with <Col N="458" /> property through a file of rogues is a gross exaggeration.  I regret that the statement has been made and I will undertake to look into the matter and see what can be done to do justice to the men engaged there.</P>

      <P>I have this reason, and the President himself knows, that since the Customs arrangements came into operation passengers must pass through a file of railway servants and customs officials and this is the file of rogues referred to.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he has received <Col N="341" /> a claim from Mr. B. Dwyer, late Army No. 37140, of 94 Upper Leeson Street, and if he can state why a soldier living out of barracks does not receive billeting allowance, and why he is stopped 9d. per week for washing and hair-cutting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No claim appears to have been received at Headquarters from Mr. Dwyer.  The usual form has, however, now been sent to him, and on its return, properly completed, the claim will be duly considered.  If a soldier elects to live outside barracks when quarters are available he is not entitled to lodging, fuel and light allowance. Where quarters are not available a claim for such allowance would be allowed.  It is customary to make deductions from a soldier's pay when not on active service for laundry and hair-cutting.  In respect of these services a General Routine Order authorises a stoppage of 9d. a week from the pay of a soldier.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a number of claims for arrears of pay from men formerly serving in the 22nd Battalion, Western Division, have been rejected on the grounds that they were paid early in April; whether the men concerned state that this is not the case, and that they can produce the testimony of officers under whom they served to prove it, and whether, under these circumstances, he will have enquiries made in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Claims of certain men of the 22nd Battalion for arrears of pay have been disallowed on the ground that the relative pay rolls show that the men referred to were duly paid for the periods covered by their claims. I am not aware that these men dispute the evidence of the pay rolls.</P>
