      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether, in view of the fact that on the 12th December, 1923, he expressed a hope that the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General would be presented before the 31st January, 1924, and the Public Accounts Committee as provided for in Standing Order No. 100 then appointed, he is now in a position to state when this Report will be presented and when the Public Accounts Committee will be appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The rendering of accounts has been delayed by the circumstances mentioned in my reply of the 12th December.  I understand, however, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will almost certainly have received completed accounts by the end of this month, and that his report will probably be available in about three weeks from now.  It is proposed that the necessary steps for appointment of a Public Accounts Committee should be taken on the receipt of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the President realised that if there are to be Supplementary Estimates it would be very desirable to have the Public Accounts Committee in existence; and might it not be necessary to appoint the Committee even before the Report is received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Supplementary Estimates <Col N="1166" /> would be the subject of any consideration by the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
      <P>The Public Accounts Committee would deal with accounts up to March of last year, whereas the Supplementary Estimates would be in relation to this year.  In that case I do not see that the Public Accounts Committee should have any control or supervision over the Supplementary Estimates, which are entirely of a different character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that that is the practice elsewhere, and that when the public estimates are submitted the Public Accounts Committee, in England at any rate, go into the manner in which the money has been expended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not aware of that, but last year we had some Supplementary Estimates, and there was no objection on the ground that they should have been submitted to the Public Accounts Committee.  I will bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Finance, who will see whether it is necessary to have any such action taken.</P>

No permanent appointments to the Customs Preventive staff have been made since April, 1923, and the number and conditions of such appointments as may be necessary in the future, cannot at present be determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>TADHG UA DONNABHAIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will state what steps his Department has taken to see that a supply of suitable fibre-producing flax seed is available for the flax growers in the Saorstát this season; whether he will be in a position to furnish flax growers in the Saorstát with definite information as to the quality of same, as to germination and purity of available brands of seed, and, if so, how soon this information will be circulated amongst growers; further, whether he is aware that this information has already been circulated amongst flax growers in Northern Ireland, <Col N="1168" /> and if he will state the number of Flax Instructors employed in the Saorstát, and publish reports as to work done by said Instructors, with particular reference to arrangements as to supplying of seed, marketing of fibre, and results of experiments on retting; if he will publish a statement showing the acreage under flax in the Saorstát for each year since 1919, and, further, whether he will state the causes of decline and give a definite pronouncement on the prospects for the coming season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have received reports from the various countries whence supplies of seed of fibre flax for sowing in the Saorstát are imported. They have also made inquiries through, and obtained bulk samples of seed from, the chief importers who supply seed to retailers in the Saorstát, and hope at an early date to communicate to growers, through the medium of the Flax Instructors and otherwise, the information so obtained.  The Department are aware that the Ministry of Agriculture, Northern Ireland, have already published a leaflet entitled &ldquo;Flax Seed, 1924.&rdquo;  Eight Flax Instructors are at present working in the Saorstát, and reports on their work are published in the Department's annual reports, and reports dealing with the experimental work conducted by these Instructors, are published in the Department's Journal and in the Press from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas under flax in the Saorstát since 1919 were as follows:&mdash;22,180 acres in 1919, 34,218 acres in 1920, 7,413 acres in 1921, 4,915 acres in 1922, and 8,066 acres in 1923.  The decline in flax-growing is attributable to the low yield and poor quality of the 1920 and 1921 crops, consequent upon unfavourable weather, and to the fact that before the 1920 crop was scutched, the linen trade, in common with many other industries, had entered on a period of very severe depression which continued for some time, with the result that prices for scutched flax fell to a very low level.  The prospects for flax-growing are now much brighter, for the linen trade is improving; high prices for cotton still obtain; better prices are being paid for scutched flax &mdash;the improvement during the past few <Col N="1169" /> weeks being very marked; and ample supplies of flax seed of good quality are available.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that answer, would the Minister state why the Department has been dilatory in sending out information with regard to seed?  The seed-sowing season is now on, and farmers require that information immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

      <P>The Fermoy Urban District Council received a tender for the erection of eight houses in November last for the sum of £6,462 10s., or £807 16s. 3d. per house.  This tender was considered quite excessive, and I refused to sanction it.  On the 21st January a fresh tender was received by the Council for £5,402 14s., or £675 6s. 9d. per house.  Subsequently the contractor amended this tender so as to make the cost £4,918 14s., or £614 16s. 9d per house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Several such claims are under consideration.  The rule of the Dáil Courts was, however, that the Clerk was paid on the spot out of Court fees, and, consequently, such claims as are now being made are usually founded on the plea that the Court fees were inadequate to pay the Clerk's salary, which in turn means that the Clerk's work was by no means heavy.  It may, therefore, be taken that such claims will be very closely scrutinised, and will be admitted, if at all, only in exceptional circumstances and for strictly moderate amounts.</P>

      <P>Might I ask for permission to bring before the Dáil the consideration of a proposal to adjourn somewhere about 6 o'clock for one hour, for either tea or dinner, as the circumstances of the Deputies may decide? It has been rather a long sitting for Deputies, particularly for those who do not take refreshments in the meantime. We might then sit until 9 o'clock, if the Dáil was so disposed, instead of up to 8.30.  The proposal has been put before me by some Deputies.  I have not consulted my friends about it, but I think it is a matter that should be left to the free consideration of the Deputies. The suggestion, I am sure, would meet with approval, and if there is no objection to it I propose the adoption of that course.</P>

I think that would suit the general convenience of Deputies.  There is a certain hiatus between mid-day <Col N="1178" /> meal time and the sittings of the House at 3 o'clock, and that time is wasted, and I think a good many would sooner get home earlier than 9 o'clock.</P>

      <P>The position is that we will take it now, that on the motion of the President, the Dáil will sit until 9 o'clock this evening if necessary.  The President undertakes that about 6 o'clock he will move an hour's adjournment.  The other question, to meet at 2.30 o'clock, would come on for consideration by the Committee on Procedure.  If I recollect aright that was at one time tried, but the Committee recommended 3 o'clock, and 3 o'clock was adopted.  The conditions may be different now.  The question raised by Deputy Wilson would also come up for consideration by the Committee, but it is one that should be decided every week.  Even at present we could meet on Monday under the Standing Order if we chose, although we do not do so.  I take it that agreement is now reached to sit, if necessary, this evening until 9 o'clock.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which I take it will sooner or later have to be decided.  The practice in another place is in the case of a vacancy for a member of the Party to which the deceased or resigned member belonged, to move the Motion for a new Writ.  Now, whatever rights or privileges there are in another place in regard to what we would call the right of the Party to which the resigned or deceased member belonged, I think that right is much greater in a country where the system of election is conducted under Proportional Representation.  My view of Proportional Representation is that if a member, say, of Deputy Johnson's Party resigns, then, in all fairness, there should not be opposition for the return of a member who would represent views similar to those held by the late occupant of that position.  That view may not be shared by my friends. I do not know whether it is or not; I do not know whether Deputy Johnson shares it or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think that if you are to work on the principles of Proportional Representation that is the real essence of it.  It is unfair, in my view, when the whole country returns a certain organisation of representatives that that organisation of representatives is upset, as it must necessarily be upset, where a single election takes place.  It would certainly be to the advantage of my Party, or the Party to which I belong, that we should have the right to contest every vacancy that occurs.  In that case it would be open to any member of the Dáil when a vacancy occurred to move for an election, although it might not be for the convenience or might not suit the Party to which the deceased member, or resigned member, belonged.  Therefore, I do not think that this particular method of dealing with these two vacancies should be taken from the Party to which deceased did belong, at <Col N="1182" /> any rate.  I suppose that will not be objected to.  I find myself constrained to vote against the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of constitutional practice in other places the practice is such as has been stated by the President, subject to one condition, and that is that the motion for the new Writ should not be unreasonably delayed, and unreasonable delay, if my memory serves me right, is held to be one month from the creation of the vacancy.  In this case we have delayed considerably more than a month.  I am afraid if we were to take it on the ground of strict constitutional practice I should be compelled to vote for Deputy Johnson's amendment, but there is great force in the President's argument which will add enormous comfort and solace to my death-bed.</P>

      <P>I desire to make a personal explanation, if I am in order. I am reported in the Press as having stated here on Friday last that builders' <Col N="1184" /> profits were abnormal.  If I said that I would like to correct it.  I think there is some doubt as to whether I said it, but my statement was to the effect that an examination of or comparison between the prices charged by building guilds and the prices tendered by builders does not make out the case that there had been abnormal profits by builders.  I think that we agreed that these prices should be brought down. Even though the building guilds may not have been the most favourable comparison with builders, it cannot be excluded from our consideration that the builders have had an opportunity of organising their business.  They have had a great number of years of experience of that organisation, and although the percentage in difference between the price for which the house was built by a building guild might not show an abnormal profit, the comparison is against the building guild.  I am satisfied that a little more attention and a little more application on the part of the building guilds might have produced much better results.  In one case I think the result was not at all favourable to the building guild.  In the other case there was, as I stated here I think on the 25th of January, a difference between the two of something like 7½ per cent.  That would not be an unreasonable profit for a builder to charge, but bearing in mind the better organisation on the one hand and a new service on the other, that 7½ per cent. might have been a great deal more.</P>

      <P>Amendment 44 to Section 8 was before the Committee.  The amendment had been proposed by Deputy Johnson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seems to be to enlarge the scope, or to tend to do so, of the inquiries based on the main clause.  Personally, I see no objection whatever if the main clause of the Section were accepted.  The real damage, in my judgment, is in the Section itself standing at all.  In proposing his amendment Deputy Johnson introduced the question of the organisation of the Light Casting Association, and I think he tried to show that the operations of that association were detrimental to building costs.  Unfortunately <Col N="1185" /> I am unable to follow him with regard to his facts as, in the absence of Deputy Good, I have nobody to consult on the subject.  But at all events the charge was that there was an organisation of employers for a certain purpose, that because the employers organised it was very wrong of them, and that they were very wicked people to do any such thing.  Of course we all agree with that.  It is a shocking state of affairs that employers come together to do anything of that sort.  It would have been more helpful to us if Deputy Johnson had brought his information more up to date and had told us what was the position of the Light Casting Association to-day rather than thirteen years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension.  I said the organisation was formed in 1911, and was operating up to date.  The figures I gave were quite recent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I have no intimate knowledge of this particular organisation, and nobody has been kind enough to supply me with any information second hand, so that I have to accept that that is the position for better or for worse.  But even supposing this bad company is operating in that way, it does not in my judgment shut out competition in that or any other form of business activity.  The world is large, and you always find people who are willing to come in and try to take other people's business.  It is a common failing, but it is a human failing, and as against machinations of those bad employers, might I draw Deputy Johnson's attention to the fact that on the other side, the opposition side of the Dáil, they represent perhaps the greatest combination that the world has ever seen.  Trades Unionism is certainly a very effective organisation, a very complete organisation, and what is its object?  I do not think that Deputy Johnson will hold that its object is for the general good of the community by reducing wages or by increasing the hours of work, or in the one hundred and one activities that the unions play in the lives of the people; nor do I think he will stand for the opposite position of the Light Casting Association. The principal charge against <Col N="1186" /> them was that they tried to prevent other people buying outside themselves; in other words, that they refused to sell to people if they bought outside their organisation.</P>
      <P>What do we see to-day in connection with the Trades Union Movement?  Is it not in that direction a very close borough?  Does the Trade Union Organisation to-day even give full recognition to the rights of the unemployed? Does it give full recognition to the right of a man to get work?  Certainly, if a man is a member of a Trades Union he gets the full benefits that could be conferred on the individual by that Union.  But under certain circumstances, such as being in arrear or being out of the Union from one cause or another, what is that man's position? I think one must recognise that there is a very grave interference with the liberty of the subject in these matters, so that I do not think that the complaint by Deputy Johnson as against an organisation of employers, stands on quite as firm a footing as if we were in the happy position of every man being told to take up his activities in any direction he wished.  As far as the amendment itself is concerned, and the bringing in of those different words, or changing the sense of the clause, so as to enlarge it by putting in other words, I would not really see any objection to it, although on principle I will vote against the amendment, as I will vote against the Clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat has shown that he is quite in favour of the inquiry into the activities of the Trade Unions in the building trade, because he would like to have an inquiry into the operations of the Light Casting Association, or the Cement Trust, or any other combination; at least I think that might be deducted from his remarks. Personally, I have no objection, but may I say that while he tries to draw comparison between the position of workmen combined for the purpose of preventing employers playing one starving man against another, and reducing the wages of one man by pitting against that man, another man eager for a job, another unemployed man looking for a chance to earn a livelihood; if he tries to compare that position <Col N="1187" /> with the position of the Trusts we have spoken of, then he is welcome to all that he can take out of it.  If the Association, Light Casting, or others, will be as frank and as free in regard to the rates of pay and the costs of the things they are selling, as the workman who is selling his labour, then I am quite satisfied.  If Deputy Hewat will advocate that everything connected with the price of the articles to be sold is to be made public, I am with him at once.  We all know what goes to make up the price of the labour power which a man sells his employer, and it is easily arrived at.  Can we say the same thing about articles which the Light Casting Association, or the Builders Providers' Association, or any other association of employers or capitalists, do with the things they have to sell? Deputy Hewat wants to put them both on the same level.  I am agreeable.  I want to put the other Associations on exactly the same level as the labour organisations and the workman who is selling his labour are on.  I have not heard whether the Minister is prepared to remove these words which limit inquiries to local inquiries.  I hope there will be no objection to removing those limitations, and that the Dáil will agree that it is desirable that they should be free to make such inquiries as they think well, whether local or national.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in this position. I am not yet able to appreciate the value of the amendment.  It takes out in every place where it is mentioned the word &ldquo;local&rdquo;&ldquo;in any county borough, district or other area,&rdquo; and it takes out &ldquo;that area&rdquo; in two lines lower down.  We are not restricted by reason of this Clause from holding an inquiry into the general prices for the whole country, but if we do not have power to hold a local inquiry into prices, reasonable in Dublin, and unreasonable in Skibbereen, Wexford, Enniscorthy, Kilrush or any of those small towns far away in the country, the case to be made in an inquiry which would include two or three small towns would not appear to be justified. A local inquiry in those small places would be better.  We can hold the inquiry only in the City of Dublin.  If <Col N="1188" /> there are undue charges loaded on to the prices of building materials, say from Dublin to Naas, Kildare or Kilkenny, those exceptional charges which are added on by reason of transport from here to there may be the subject of a local inquiry, prices could not necessitate the holding of an inquiry for the whole country.  Putting in the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;that area&rdquo; gives very much more power over every particular part of the country than if you were to say for the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he reads the Bill in the form in which it has been printed and in the form in which it would appear if the amendment were accepted he would recognise that if the amendment were accepted he would not be prevented from holding any local inquiry anywhere, but that if the Bill passes as it stands, it may be read as a limitation. It may be read as a necessity to hold a local inquiry, and any possibility of an inquiry into the condition of things as a whole is prevented.  If the President will look into this matter with a view to ensuring that no limitation is placed upon the powers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a national inquiry, I am satisfied, but I think it is subject to the interpretation that any inquiry contemplated is only to be a local inquiry Every area in the Bill may include the whole country, but it suggests in its conjunction that it is a local inquiry.  If you remove the localising terms the powers would then apply to an inquiry wherever a Minister may deem it well to hold such an inquiry.  If the Minister undertakes to look through this with a view to ensuring that the powers are not limited I shall be satisfied.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) after the word &ldquo;transport&rdquo; on line 47 to add the words &ldquo;and with particular reference to railway charges.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether practical effect can be given to this amendment or not; whether the existing laws regulating the railway rates would not prevent the Ministry from instituting an enquiry solely confined to the charges of railway companies with respect to the materials to be supplied for the purpose of this housing scheme.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister concerned to the high railway charges that contractors and those desirous of building will have to deal with in the provinces.  If the enquiry could not compass an enquiry into railway rates with reference to materials supplied for building purposes, then I would suggest it might be possible for the Minister to approach the companies with a view to getting an agreed rebate on all building materials required for the purposes of this Bill. A few evenings ago I gave two instances to show the extravagant charges that people associated with the building industry have to deal with in the provinces.  One was the case of a Dublin-produced article, an item of absolute necessity in every house, that is, plasterers' slabs for ceilings.  I showed that the carriage of those slabs from Dublin amounted to nearly 50 per cent. of the price of the slabs, plus the cost of delivery to the railway station.  By the time a contractor handled them and had them on his job the price was increased by more than 50 per cent. over the figure that they can be purchased by the people in Dublin.  I gave a second instance with regard to a product of the Midlands in England.  An article there was manufactured in the Midlands, carried to the seaport, and transported to Ireland. It was then taken from the seaport in Dublin, and deposited in the builder provider's store.  It was taken from the store and carted to the Kingsbridge. <Col N="1190" /> Of those accumulated charges, over 35 per cent. were subsequently added in transit charges to the South.  In those circumstances, everyone can understand the great difficulty there will be in building houses outside large centres such as Dublin, Cork, and Limerick.  Railway charges are prohibitive. If the President, under the existing law, cannot give effect to the amendment, I feel the Minister should ask the railway companies if an all-round reduction on building materials could not be made by them before the scheme is undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the word &ldquo;transport&rdquo; covers railway charges.  If, on examination, I find that there is any weakness, I will consider before the next stage the matters referred to by Deputy O'Mahony.  I would say that particular reference to railway charges would pre-suppose something which we have not pre-supposed against anybody else, and that is that a particular body or Corporation was responsible for the very high cost of this particular service.  I do not know that it would be altogether fair that it should be put in in this way, so far as the railway companies are concerned. It might prejudice us with regard to other charges, and might prevent the cutting of unusual charges by reason of the fact that we stressed the railway charges in the Bill as one of the main causes for the high cost.</P>

      <P>The following amendment stands in my name:&mdash;Before Sub-section (2) to insert a new Sub-section as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;An inquiry may be held and an order may be made under this Section, either generally or in respect of a particular county, county borough, town, district, or other area.&rdquo;  It will be seen on reading this amendment that it was contingent upon the acceptance of the last amendment of mine.  If we had deleted all reference to local inquiry, then the following Sub-section of which I had sent in notice, was to be inserted: &ldquo;An inquiry may be held and an order may be made under this Section, either generally or in respect of a particular county, county borough, town, district or other <Col N="1191" /> area.&rdquo;  It will be seen that the two amendments would have made it quite clear that a local inquiry was not precluded, but that a national inquiry might be held.  In view of the President's undertaking to consider this matter for future reading, I shall withdraw this amendment also by leave.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;In Sub-section (3), line 8, page 5, after the word &ldquo;director,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and manager.&rdquo; The object of this amendment is obvious.  The idea is that the official on the spot should be made responsible for any default there may be.  Therefore, I move to insert the word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; after &ldquo;director.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that this is scarcely a clear amendment.  A manager may have no authority whatever in the matter of price.  He may be simply an employee of the company directed to carry on the works, to supervise the construction, to regulate the disposition of the various articles and their distribution, and so on, and he may be quite an innocent person.  If it should occur that I am right in that description of a manager, I am sure it is not the intention of the Deputy that he would be liable for a fine in the event of the director or managing director fixing a certain price over which the manager himself had no control whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>And vice versa.  I take it if there be a managing director the word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; is simply an indication that the manager may advise, but unless culpability were clearly brought home, I think the inclusion of the word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; might do more harm than good.  In any event, I do not think that the clause is much weaker by reason of the fact that the word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The final words of the clause would apply if what the President says were the case.  That is if the act takes place without his consent or connivance, there is no <Col N="1192" /> offence committed.  But there may be, and I am informed that there are, cases in which the manager is an Executive Officer who has the right of fixing prices.  I think that case would not be covered by the clause as it stands.  That was my reason for moving the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit&mdash;and it is important&mdash;that the person actually responsible for overcharging is, in the case of limited companies, neither the Chairman, managing director nor other director of the company.  If you leave the responsibility on the managing director and every other director of the company, he may live outside the country or he may live in Dublin or Belfast or Cork, when the offence is being committed in Wexford or Waterford, and he will easily prove that the offence took place without his consent or connivance.  As a matter of fact, it is very unusual for the directors or managing director to know what price is being charged for the separate items that go to make up the building materials of a house.  A manager is running a branch of the business in certain towns, and he fixes prices according to the arrangements he can make with his local competitors.  I imagine that in nine cases out of ten he is responsible, and all his directors require is a return in cash.  How he gets it they do not care.  If you leave the manager outside liability, then the absentee directors will plead to the satisfaction of any Court that the offence took place without their consent or connivance, so that in the case of a company if this clause remains as it is, nobody is responsible and nobody will be punished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that it is a very severe blow.  I think in the case of a manager who stood to make 10 per cent. and charges prices which are not moral prices or which exceed those allowed by the Act, the liability is scarcely his.  I know that Deputy <Col N="1193" /> Johnson in other instances would subscribe to that, and it is fairly obvious that the manager is almost bound to charge these prices.  I will, if Deputy Johnson agrees, have this clause examined also to see if we have made it fool-proof.  If there is culpability on the part of a manager he should not be allowed to go scot free.  My concern was that if culpability could not be brought home to him it is not right that he should bear a burden which apparently he has not a free election to bear or not bear as he so desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The object is not quite to make this Section so much foolproof as knave-proof.  If the President will recollect I think he will admit himself that quite a considerable number of businesses in this country are very general.  They will sell paraffin oil, turnip seeds, butter and slates.  If the whole concern had returned a general profit, say of 10 per cent., it would be satisfactory to the directors, but if, by virtue of the Bill that the Minister is telling the country is to be brought forward shortly, the grocery department fails to return a 10 per cent. profit, then it might be necessary to make it up out of the slates, light castings, mortar and boards.  It is not quite the way the business is done.  I suggest he is told he must return a certain rate of profit on the building side. But whether he is told that or not, he will have a right to defend himself in the courts, and if he can show that he is not responsible but some other person, I am sure any Justice will take the facts into account.  If we leave the Section as it stands, the manager is not responsible and the other people can prove non-connivance and non-consent, that they did not know anything about it, and consequently no one will be made amenable.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Everett, I move amendment 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3) the words: &ldquo;and the stock of such materials or appliances in the possession or under the control of such person shall as from the date of the offence be forfeited to the Minister for disposal as he shall think fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the contracts are big enough a fine of £50 to a big business firm will be a mere flea-bite and may be winked at. The object of the amendment is to ensure that there shall be something substantial in the way of a penalty, and that the material in question shall be forfeited to the Minister, to be disposed of as he may think well.  I think it is obvious that something more than a fine not exceeding £50 is required in the case of a serious offence being proved against a managing director or every other director of a company.  I suggest that the forfeiture of the materials in question is the best way of meeting such an offence.  The materials then can be used for the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to agree to this amendment.  After all, if the fine is not enough, a sum which would be sufficient ought to be inserted. The fine may not succeed in arresting this evil.  I do not think that jurists generally subscribe to the idea that the penalties inflicted for disobeying the law are in the last resort the best security that society has got for the preservation of its laws.  In this case, if you forfeit huge quantities of material, do you think that it is likely to impress every other person in the country with the necessity for keeping prices within a regular figure?  My view of the situation is that you want to get general acceptance of your regulations.  The more general acceptance there is, the less likelihood will there be of having to impose enormous penalties.  I do admit that there are times when very stern action has to be undertaken.  I subscribe to that very stern action when it has to be taken.  Here, however, you are considering a case where you are not actually satisfied at present that there is a real justification <Col N="1195" /> for even a penalty of £50.  We have heard of individual cases of over-charging. Is there a general impression that the profits of those companies are so colossal as to justify a penalty such as this?  If you are going to go in for the forfeiture of property, the last stage may very well be worse than the first. There may be ways of evading those regulations very easily thought out which would more completely disturb the &ldquo;fool-proofness&rdquo; of this Bill than anything you might put in to make it certain that it would not be evaded.</P>

At all events, putting the Government in the position of going in and seizing goods is ridiculous.  In the first instance, I presume the Government would have to take some legal action to show that they were justified in doing anything at all.  In the interval, if the man felt that he had been breaking the law, and that the verdict was likely to go against him, naturally, I presume, all the material likely to be seized would have disappeared long before the verdict would have been given.  The thing is wholly unworkable and ridiculous, and the Section altogether is wholly unworkable.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 52:</P>
      <P>To delete in Part 1 the figures opposite the words &ldquo;Maximum rent on weekly letting&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;2s. 4d., 4s. 10d., 7s. 3d., 3s. 3d., 6s. 1d., 8s. 10d.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That would mean a reduction of 5s. all round in rents in Part 1 of the Schedule. I pointed out before the necessity for having some reduction in these rents, as the average working man is not in a position to meet them at present. These rents, in my opinion, are worse than any the rack-renters in the Saorstát charged tenants.  Possibly, we will hear that some tenants in the City of Dublin are paying 12s. 6d. and more for one room.  The same might happen in some of the country towns.  Houses are so scarce in some towns that the only way to get one is to wait until the tenant dies.  I notice by to-day's newspapers that the Minister for Finance is inviting the public, particularly the poorer classes, to buy Savings Certificates, and that at the end of five years an investment of 15s. 6d. will become £1.  I want to know how can such people buy Savings Certificates and pay the rent demanded here on a wage of 30s., which is the rate the Government allows?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot possibly ask tenants in the country to pay the rents demanded in Part 1 of the Schedule.  In the city of Dublin I doubt if there is a worker with 50s. a week who would be able to pay a rent of 13s. 10d., at present, for a five-roomed house.  In the country, how can a man earning 20s. weekly less pay a rent of 12s. 3½d.?  I ask the President to consider this question of reducing the rents.  I visited three towns in the constituency I represent on Sunday last, in all of which the people were crying out for houses.  I told the people, and I think I was right, that to my mind, when the houses contemplated <Col N="1197" /> in the Bill are built, or reconstructed, in the city there will be nothing left for the country.  At the same time the Government may think it necessary to give a further grant without introducing a new Bill.  Even though I am alone in urging that these rents be reduced, it is my intention to press the amendment as far as I can, and to a division, if I do not get some guarantee from the President that the rents will be reduced.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons evidently does not want any houses built. He offers to a person who invests £240 interest at the rate of 28s. a year.  If the money was invested in National Loan an investor would get as much as the Bill is providing.  In one case the investor would be making a present to the tenant of £12 or £14 yearly, and at the same time have to collect the rent weekly.  If Deputy Lyons wishes the public to invest money in house property, at least a reasonable return must be given for the money invested.  Investors must be given more than they are given by bankers or under the National Loan.  I consider the figures set down in the Bill are fair and reasonable.</P>

      <P>So far as Deputies on this side are concerned, we are absolutely in favour of the rents being fixed as low as possible, but at the same time we realise that when you capitalise the money proposed this is asking the Government to do an impossible thing.  As I pointed out before, we consider that if the Government go more minutely into this scheme and enable local authorities to go into it houses can be let for a lower rent than is set down here.  I understand that the President had a discussion yesterday with representatives from the Council of Municipal Councils.  I know that the discussion did not materialise to the advantage of the representations put forward by the Council of Municipal Councils, but I know that this Council has thought out a scheme, which, I think, may be acceptable to the President. The Council asked me to put it before the Dáil this evening.  I would like to know if it was acceptable could an amendment be brought in on <Col N="1198" /> the Report Stage to enable local authorities to take advantage of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I take it that if it is possible to agree to the proposals about to be submitted that they could be dealt with on the Report Stage.  Deputy Corish and Deputy Wilson have dealt with the business end of this particular amendment.  I think Deputy Lyons fails to realise the whole structure of this Bill.  The Bill provides something like £300,000 as a contribution towards the construction of 3,000 houses, and the reconstruction of a certain number of others, between 500 and 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seeks to make it possible for private enterprise to enter into this particular service; private enterprise that had been divorced from it now for a number of years.  The sooner the Deputy and his friends realise that it is not by putting in an amendment of this sort that you are going to reduce the rents, the better for himself and for his friends.  If I were to say &ldquo;yes, I will accept this amendment,&rdquo; not one single house would be built under this Bill.  I do not know whether it is the Deputy's intention to effect that purpose. I rather think that it is not.  Very well; the problem that we are trying to solve is the problem of a particular commodity which is at an exorbitant price and which cannot apparently be produced at anything but an exorbitant price.  That is the information we have got.  Various schemes have been entered into within the last two or three years.  Various local bodies throughout the country have interested themselves in this, and the result of all their efforts has been that the cost is still an exorbitant cost.  Even in cases where during the last two years we subscribed two-thirds of the cost from the State and the local authority put up a quarter of the remainder by striking a rate equivalent to a quarter of the other portion of the cost of the house&mdash;that is one-twelfth of the whole cost&mdash;complaints were made to us that the service was uneconomic, and that the rents to be charged could not be borne by the people.  Now, what do you want?  Do you want homes handed over to you furnished and ready to go into at no rent at all, because if you do, <Col N="1199" /> it cannot be done.  No other State does it.  I have never heard of any other State doing it, and if the Deputy is putting up that proposition he is admitting bankruptcy of intellect and bankruptcy of idea on the part of the Party he speaks for.  But I am sure he would not subscribe to that.  The Deputy has not explained how he is going to formulate a scheme which will enable his proposal to be carried into effect.  The sum in question here, the maximum price on sale, or the maximum fine or lease is £240 for the cheapest house, and he wants to charge a rent for that of 2s 4d a week.</P>

      <P>This question of housing is only a question that can be solved by cordial co-operation between all the persons interested in it.  During the last two years we put up close on one million pounds, and our proposal was that we would give £2 for every £1 put up by the local authority. In addition, we allowed the local authority to strike a rate of 5s.  What has been the result?  Out of ninety authorities, twenty stood out altogether. They would not take that money.  What do they want?  They want spoon-feeding apparently, or they do not want houses.  But I think we have come to this stage, at any rate, that if there is going to be any good done in this country, we will have to do it ourselves, and the sooner we realise that it is not by talk but by constructive work that any good can be done, the better.  The Deputy has the Bill before him.  He made no proposal to reduce the cost of the houses, and now he comes along to ask to have a price inserted that would ensure that not a single house would be constructed during the next twelve or eighteen months.  That is not constructive, and I cannot subscribe to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to vote against this amendment, and I am going to state my reasons.  I would like to see houses built to be let at these rents, or less.  But my attitude to this Bill has been that, while I have little faith, or no faith, in its efficacy as a Bill to provide houses for the weekly wage earners, it may provide houses to the extent of two or three thousand in the coming year.  I am not going to be a party to any amendment that will have the effect of preventing houses being built, no matter for whom.  I am not going to be a party to any action which would even be construed into an attempt to prevent houses being built. In dealing with the measures that have been proposed, and to which we have sought to promote amendments, we have always tried to be constructive and to move amendments conforming to the plan and principle of the Bill once it received its Second Reading. This amendment does not conform to the plan of the Bill and is not consistently moved by any person who has <Col N="1201" /> already assented to the sections which go to make up the Bill.  So that in refusing to support this amendment, we are not opposing the desire for houses at a low rent, but are leaving the responsibility for building houses under this Bill to those to whom the offers of the Government are made.  As I said, I shall not do anything to prevent or militate in any way against houses being built under this Bill.  To vote for this amendment would certainly have that effect.  Consequently I shall vote against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Johnson has expressed his opinion on this matter.  It shows completely and clearly what he thinks of the workers of Ireland outside of the City of Dublin.  I certainly agree with the remarks of the President.  I agree that the State has given one million pounds in connection with the housing question in order to facilitate the people, and to house them in a proper manner.  I further agree that it was not an economic proposition for the different local authorities who erected those houses. In some of the larger towns in my constituency, houses erected as a consequence of this grant are not yet finished.  I know there are up to 200 applications for 12 or 14 houses.  I would like to touch upon the point made by Deputy Wilson.  Deputy Wilson, to my mind, is one of those gentlemen who are out seeking salvation under the false wing of Labour, and is one who would like to place himself in such a position that he could act as an electric magnet in the next election, to draw Labour's No. 1 vote to his ballot paper.  Deputy Wilson is going the wrong way in his effort to try and capture those votes, when he states that the person who invests the sum of £240 in the erection of a house will get in return only £1 8s., or 12/6 interest, in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rentals mentioned in the schedule of the Bill are more than the average worker can pay.  A rental of 2/4 is quite enough for a three-roomed house in the country.  Years ago labourers' cottages were erected, and some Deputies tell me that they increased the expenditure of local <Col N="1202" /> authorities.  There may be two sides to that question.  These cottages can be let at 1/3 a week, although they have an acre of ground attached.  If a cottage which cost from £75 to £120 to erect in 1910 can be let at 1/3 a week, why cannot a house which now costs £240 be let at 2/4, which is really only 1/1 a week more?  Besides, there is no acre of ground attached to the house built now.  Speaking for the constituency I represent, I congratulate the Government on the way they have tried to facilitate housing for the people.</P>
    <P>This amendment of mine will not in any way incriminate Ministers.  It simply aims at having the houses rented at a fair figure, one that the workers will be able to meet.  I invite Deputies to go down in the country and stand on a platform and ask the people what rent they can pay with the wages they receive.  If Deputy Johnson is powerful enough to get the workers in the country a better wage than the present starvation wage they are receiving, I quite agree with him that the rent suggested in the Bill would be fair; but until he can get them a better wage, let him not talk about imposing those rents.  He, himself, states that if these rents suggested in my amendment are charged, there will be no houses constructed. That is merely a story that flew in through the keyhole, so to speak. I would suggest to the President that he should have the opinion of local authorities in regard to rents before the Bill passes into law.  He could do that, or otherwise allow the local authorities to fix the rents in their own localities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lyons either wants the houses or he does not want them.  He does not want them if he wishes to have effect given to his amendment, because no one is going to build houses in order to let them at the absolutely inadequate rentals that he proposes.  He challenges people to go down the country and seek approval for those rentals.  Will he put up on the same platform as an alternative to those rentals that no houses will be built?  You have to deal with a very difficult situation.  You have to deal with the accumulation of circumstances, <Col N="1203" /> lucidly explained by the President, that combine to make it impossible to let these houses at anything less than the rentals proposed.  The Deputy draws attention to labourers' cottages being let at 1s. 3d.  He also reminds us that these cottages were built at sums varying from £75 to £120.  He forgets, however, to tell you that the experience of every public body that erected houses is that the rental of 1s. 3d. covers less than half the outlay connected with them.  He also forgets to tell you that these public bodies that have suffered such a loss in connection with the cottages got money at £2 1s. 7d. per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy very conveniently forgot to draw attention to it.  He forgot to tell the Dáil that even though the houses were built through the borrowing of money at £2 1s. 7d. every public body is paying considerably more than twice the rental to maintain the cottages.  The Deputy referred to the contribution that may be given from local bodies. In the event of such a contribution being made by the local body, he overlooks the fact that further down in the schedule provision is made that the maximum rental suggested here will be reduced; so the rentals stated in the schedule are not the actual maximum rentals that will be asked in the event of the local body contributing a sum equivalent to the Government contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President very properly drew attention to the fact that one million pounds of public money was made available during the last few years for the erection of this type of house in the country.  The result was that though one-third of the money was provided locally, the houses could not be let at an economic rent.  If a house is erected, two-thirds of its cost being borne by the State and one-third by the local body, and if the local body is unable to let it at an economic rent, how does the Deputy suggest it will be <Col N="1204" /> possible to private enterprise to erect houses with the relatively small contribution that they are going to get.  How can such houses be let at a rental less than what is mentioned in the schedule? If the Deputy succeeds in carrying his amendment the net result will be that no private person could erect a house for the purpose of letting it on the scale that he has suggested as an equitable one.</P>

      <P>I think it is only right I should express my very deep appreciation of Deputy Johnson's statement on this question.  Nobody knows better than I do how easy it would have been for Deputy Johnson to have supported this amendment, because at elections people could easily say: &ldquo;You voted against charging a low rent,&rdquo; leaving outside consideration all the factors that are involved. In recent years this practice has, I think, developed to some extent, and it would be a good job if in public life the same honesty in approaching subjects were adopted generally as was adopted by Deputy Johnson in this particular instance.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a question regarding the method of inflicting punishment adopted in this Section. I think it requires some justification that this method, adopted before in certain Bills, should be repeated, of imprisonment plus fine, and if the fine is not paid within a certain time there should be further period of imprisonment. <Col N="1210" /> I think it is objectionable that this dual method of punishment should be inserted in this Bill, and I would like to hear from the Minister in charge some justification for the dual process of inflicting punishment.</P>

      <P>The purpose aimed at is, of course, to deter people from taking the risks involved by a breach of this particular law.  There are some people who have become inured to imprisonment. It has no particular terror for them, possibly, by reason of the fact that they have been through it before and found it congenial, and these people would be deterred, and very seriously deterred, by a money penalty.  There is the other case of people who would take the risk of incurring a fine, but would be seriously deterred by the prospect of a period of imprisonment.  Now, we aimed at catering for both mentalities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We more or less aimed at a cumulative effect which would cover both mentalities.  This provision was a provision that was in the late Public Safety Act, and it was simply inserted, as it stood, without alteration in this Bill. If the Deputy is inclined to urge this point very strongly I would look into it between this and the Report Stage, but, personally, at the moment, my view is, that having regard to the extreme necessity of bringing the lethal weapons of the country under proper legal control so that the State at any time will know exactly the where and the why of every such weapon, it is not too harsh to insert in a Bill that the people who break this particular law break it at the risk both of a period of imprisonment and fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's justification of this does not carry much weight.  It is intended to deter in the one case the person inured to imprisonment, and who would treat it lightly. That person will also consider the extra two months lightly, and will not pay the fine.  But there is a second class of person who, the Minister says, will be deterred by a fine.  But a fine is not <Col N="1211" /> imposed in lieu of imprisonment.  It is an alternative which he may accept if he likes in lieu of two months' imprisonment. If the Minister were defending a case of fine or imprisonment I could understand his reasoning, but in the case which is in question his reasoning is not very valid, I think.</P>
      <P>It is true, no doubt, that this Section is taken bodily from the Public Safety Act, and is one of the many bad provisions in that Act.  But that Act was passed in an emergency, and many things might have been passed by the Dáil in these circumstances which would require justification in the present more settled and more leisurely times.  I think it is desirable that we should have provisions of this kind carefully thought over before we get into the way of embodying them in legislation of a punitive character. After all, an extra two months' imprisonment may be cheap to one citizen at the cost of £20, but it may be dear to another citizen.  A man with much money and certain antecedents will pay £20 to get off two months, while another man could not find £20 if he sold up all his property, but he is reckoned to pay the penalty in two months' imprisonment.  There is a distinct disadvantage to the man without money in a provision of this kind.  I suggest that the Minister should think it over carefully, with a view to deleting this alternative before the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertake to give further consideration to the Section between this and the next Stage. I do not agree with Deputy Johnson that the Section, as it stands, constitutes a distinct disadvantage to the man without money, because it is purely an enabling power, to be used according to the circumstances of each particular case and presumably to the circumstances of each particular offender. I rather think that it enables the Justice to impose, in addition to the sentence of imprisonment on a person whose circumstances he considers warrants it, a fine plus a period of imprisonment. In any case the whole thing is permissive and discretionary and not on any mandatory basis.  I will, however, <Col N="1212" /> consider the Section between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will also take note of the relative value of money in relation to punishment. Under paragraph (a) &ldquo;a prisoner may, in addition, be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding £20&rdquo; which, if he is a wealthy man, he will do, but, in the default of payment of such a fine within one month after conviction,&mdash; that is while he is in gaol&mdash;he is to suffer for another period not exceeding two months; that is to say £20 equal two months.  Under paragraph (b) he might have, in addition to his sentence, to pay a fine not exceeding £100, or to suffer for a further term not exceeding 6 months; that is, £100 equal 6 months. I suppose the ups and downs of the market for francs might be child's play as compared with this kind of bargain.  That anomaly just shows the folly of this kind of provision.</P>

      <P>(3) &ldquo;Nothing in this Act relating to firearms shall apply to any firearm which is carried or possessed by a member of a theatrical company for the purpose of a dramatic performance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a very unimportant amendment, with which I shall not delay the Dáil very long.  It is intended to exempt from the provisions of this Bill weapons carried by members of theatrical companies for the purpose of dramatic performances.  As the Dáil will remember, almost ever since their invention, firearms have been found indispensable for theatrical performances. You will find in Shakespeare that there were explosions, and the Minister, no doubt, will remember that Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was burned down as a result of one of these explosions during a performance of &ldquo;Henry VIII.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather doubt whether Shakespeare ever conceived the Minister for Home Affairs, even in his imagination.  Going on, we find, through the range of the drama, firearms constantly employed on the stage. It would hardly be conceived that the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the Gárda Síochána would suddenly appear on the stage in &ldquo;The Rivals,&rdquo; and interrupt the Duel Scene on the ground that firearms are being used, not for the purpose of display.  It would certainly be impossible to perform any modern American crook drama, which depends almost entirely on the production of guns and on people holding up their hands, unless some provision such as this is made.  If the Minister says he is prepared to make provision under Section 2 (b) to exclude such persons from the Bill, I should accept that, or if he says that this amendment will hamper him in carrying out his main purpose, on the ground that the persons in possession of the arms are only play-actors, <Col N="1214" /> I shall not press it, but I would like to hear his views on the subject.</P>

      <P>If it was considered advisable to give this exemption it could be given, as the Deputy points out, under Section 2 (b) of the Bill.  But I am not convinced of the necessity or the desirability of any such exemption.  I am informed that instruments are now turned out, resembling very closely revolvers and rifles, which are not capable of firing a shot, but which, in some way that I have not examined into, are capable of creating the explosion necessary to have the proper effect on the audience.  No permit of any kind would be necessary for instruments of that nature, and I think it is better simply to take the stand that such instruments should be used in theatrical performances.  The suggestion of the Deputy opens up possibilities of people being found with arms and giving the very plausible and elaborate explanation that they were on their way to some amateur theatrical performance, and that a gun was a necessary part of the equipment for their piece.  All that might be difficult to disprove, and I think it is rather recognised now that the instruments used on the stage ought not to be real firearms, capable of transmitting a bullet.</P>

      <P>When I asked leave to have this Bill printed and circulated. Deputy Johnson very definitely suggested that this was a breach of some bargain, expressed or implied, in connection <Col N="1215" /> with the passing of the Public Safety (Powers of Arrest and Detention) Bill, which became law some weeks ago.  I intervened to correct the Deputy, and he more or less waived aside my intervention and continued his line of argument.  I would not wish that Deputies should seriously entertain the suggestion that I got any Bill through under false pretences, and if Deputy Johnson will look up column 1942 of the Official Report of the 14th December, 1923, he will see that I stated explicitly that other aspects of the late Public Safety Act, the Act which expired on the 1st of this month, would be dealt with in later Bills.  It struck me that a proper division of the matters dealt with in the Public Safety Act of last year would be one Bill dealing with powers of arrest and detention without trial, one Bill dealing with the matter of firearms&mdash;the Bill we have just considered in Committee&mdash;and another Bill dealing with the punishment of certain offences which are rather rife as the result of the exuberance of the last two years, that is the Bill which I now ask the Dáil to consider and to read a second time, a Bill providing special punishment for particular offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson said that no doubt the Minister would attempt to justify this Bill by references to the condition of the country.  That was quite an intelligent anticipation on the part of the Deputy.  I do propose to justify this Bill by references to the condition of the country.  Sometimes, in introducing Bills of this kind, I find myself in this difficulty, that the facts and the figures that could easily be produced in justification of the particular measure that happened to be advocated, are not facts and figures that would redound to the credit of the country, or of the country's citizens.  One is rather in danger of being considered as an ill bird who fouls his own nest, when one is most desirous of a cleansing process. I was in this difficulty in regard to this Bill: I could produce for Deputy Johnson, or for any other Deputy, facts and figures and official reports abundantly calculated to justify a measure of the kind that I am now presenting to the <Col N="1216" /> Dáil, but I do not know whether it would be considered a good or a wise thing, or sound public policy, to present these in all details to the Dáil.  But it seems to me that when I am pressed on the matter, when it is rather suggested that there does not exist a situation calling for a measure of this kind, that I have no option, and, consequently, I have decided to give to the Dáil certain figures with regard to the indictable offences reported in the Civic Guard area for the month of January.  There were 545 such offences reported to the Civic Guard for the month of January, and Deputies will recognise that there is necessarily a gap of unknown dimensions between the number of serious offences which actually occur, and the number of offences that are reported to the police.  It would be too much to believe that the police secure information about every serious offence that occurs within their area of operations, or, indeed, to believe that they secure information about nearly every serious offence that occurs.  I would be sorry to regard that situation as a normal situation. It is not a normal situation, and I am not prepared to accept the view that it is a situation which should justify me in refraining from asking the Dáil to renew the provisions of the late Public Safety Act, which are covered in this Bill.  Section 1 prescribes penalties for particular offences.  I have endeavoured to select the offences which are most rife in the State, most common and most serious.</P>
    <P>With regard to Sub-section 4 of Section 1, which prescribes the penalty of flogging for two specific offences, the offences of arson and robbery under arms, I kind of feel in my bones that all the conventional things which we said so well on both sides of the question, when the last Bill was under discussion, will have to be said again. Deputy Johnson, somewhat hoarse with emotion, will brand this sub-section as revolting and reactionary; Deputy O'Connell, I have no doubt, will give impassioned support, and it would be too much to hope that Deputy Baxter will not add his plaintive protest. Only the treble of Ex-Deputy Gavan Duffy will be lacking from the chorus. I would be quite open to make a deal. <Col N="1217" /> I would be quite open to take all these inevitable things as said, and in return to spare the Deputies my equally inevitable reply, and I would, perhaps, be strengthened in that decision by my own conviction that I could not possibly improve upon the exposition of the necessity for these provisions which I gave on the last occasion.  I remember rising from these Benches about 3 a.m. on the morning of the 13th July, and saying what I then felt and still feel ought to be the very last words on this whole subject.  Most of the Deputies were asleep.</P>

      <P>Since the 13th July last my opinion on this matter has not changed.  I am more than ever convinced that society must meet the armed criminal lash in hand, and I am not at all moved by the argument that the form of punishment prescribed by this sub-section is ignominious.  It is intended to be ignominious.  It is the deliberate policy of the Ministry to stigmatise this crime as a cowardly and disgraceful crime, and it is the deliberate policy of the Ministry to remove every vestige of a halo from the head of the man who goes out with a gun to rob his neighbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 2, I feel that it is still necessary to ask for a continuance of the power of seizing cattle which are found in wanton and deliberate trespass.  That form of organised robbery which consists in people combining to deprive an individual of the use and enjoyment of his land, and of their using it themselves for the feeding and fattening of their own stock, is still not uncommon, and it will be recognised that if the operations of the Land Act are not to become extremely difficult, are not to be made almost impossible, we must relieve people's minds of any idea that they can stake a claim by methods of violence and by methods of illegality.  It is right to say that within recent months the more spectacular aspect of rounding up cattle and training them away to some other place and selling them there has largely ceased.  It has become more and <Col N="1218" /> more a matter of holding the trespassing stock to ransom, as it were, and allowing the owner to redeem them on payment of a fine sufficiently large to act as a deterrent against future breaches.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 are transplanted, I think, literally from the late Public Safety Act.  They deal with the restitution of stolen property, and I think the Deputies will agree that they are reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. Section 5 is an extension to the country of provisions which were current in Dublin of the powers which were exercised by the Divisional Magistrates in Dublin since the passing of the Metropolitan Police Act.  It is considered necessary to extend these powers to the District Justices.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that Sections 3, 4 and 5 deal with property that has actually been stolen, but Sections 6 and 7 deal with a slightly different aspect of the same problem.  They deal with the proceeds of stolen property. Money may be stolen from a bank or other place, and converted into land, and similarly chattel property may be stolen, converted into money, and lodged to an account in a bank.  It will not be denied by Deputies that a substantial problem of this kind exists throughout the country.  I hold out no great hope that it will be easy to deal with that problem even with the powers asked for in this Bill.  It will not be easy.  I stress the point that without these powers it would be utterly impossible. No one, I take it, will take the view that it is not the duty of the State, in so far as it is humanly practicable, to compel the robber to disgorge his ill-gotten gain.  That is the object of this Section.  Only in a few cases have these powers, given in the late Act, been successfully used, but they have been successfully used in a few cases. It is advisable to renew these powers so that the Executive in definite, well-authenticated cases, may do something towards compelling evil-doers to shell out their gains.  Section 8 is a Section which also figured in the late Public Safety Act.  I think I remember a certain amount of criticism of this proposal that it should be possible to change the venue of criminal trials on <Col N="1219" /> a certificate of the Attorney-General so that a more fair and more impartial trial could be secured elsewhere. Deputies took it for granted that it was a section which would at all times weigh against the prisoner.  I do not know whether Deputies have changed their views since the recent occurrence in Tralee, where a prisoner arraigned on a certain charge, was mobbed and assaulted in the street when committed for trial to a District Justice.  I take it it will not be seriously suggested that a fair, impartial trial could be secured in that case in the county where the crime occurred.  It was a case in which the power to change the venue should have been used.  There will always be certain cases concerning which local feeling and local prejudice run so high that it will become desirable to remove the case for trial out of that heated local atmosphere, and bring it elsewhere where it will be tried by jurors not subject to local influences of that kind.  That is the proposal in Section 8.  I do not think that there is anything in the remaining portions of the Bill which calls for comment.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed that in part 2 of the Schedule, 12 different offences are set out.  We have endeavoured to insert in the Schedule the crimes and offences which are most prevalent in the country which are viewed most seriously by the department responsible for order, security and decency of life in the country. It is proposed that the Act shall come into force on the 1st day of February, 1924, shall continue in force for one year, and shall then expire.  I think that there is very little to be gained by applying for a six months' lease of life for this Act.  We might as well face the fact that the country is suffering from the aftermath of revolution, and that the country will not be completely normal within, or at the end of, six months.  I am asking for a year's lifetime for this Bill, and I can only express the hope that it will not be necessary at the end of that year to apply for its renewal.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in <Col N="1220" /> opening his statement, referred to some remarks of mine on the First Reading, and rather corrected certain things I said.  I am going to quote in answer to these remarks what appears in the Official Report, and I ask the Dáil to judge whether I was right in my interpretation, or whether he was right in his. On December 11th, the Minister, in introducing the last Bill, said:&mdash;&ldquo;It will be merely an Internment Bill.  It is not proposed now to bring before the Dáil all the Sections of the Public Safety Bill.  The idea rather is to break up that Bill into three distinct Bills, one dealing with the question of internment, another being a Firearms Bill which will be permanent, and a Criminal Law Amendment Bill, which will be introduced early in the next Session.&rdquo;  On the Second Stage of the previous Bill, he said:&mdash;&ldquo;This Bill deals only with internment.  In regard to other portions of the Public Safety Bill, these will be covered in other Bills.  I propose to introduce a permanent Firearms Bill and a Criminal Law Amendment Bill.  The Bill I am asking Deputies to give favourable consideration to, continues these two Sections dealing with detention and arrest without trial.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I ask anybody to judge of the effect of statements of that kind.  When referring to the Firearms Bill, he spoke of it as a permanent Bill, which, by the way, turns out to be a temporary Bill. He also spoke of a Criminal Law Amendment Bill.  Who would imagine, then, that the two Bills which were to succeed the Emergency Detention Bill were to be two other temporary Bills, breaking up the old Public Safety Bill into three temporary Bills with emergency powers.  We were promised a Criminal Law Amendment Bill.  I suppose any Bill that deals with criminal law is a Criminal Law Amendment Bill. When dealing with the Emergency Public Safety Bill of the last session, and noting certain crimes in that Bill to be dealt with after the then temporary Bill was passed, one would undoubtedly come to the conclusion that what was in the Minister's mind was a permanent Bill dealing with criminal law.  When the present Bill was introduced as another temporary Emergency Bill, I submit I was justified in <Col N="1221" /> saying that that was not a fulfilment of the understanding which could be reasonably taken from this statement I quoted, and which the Minister made on the early stages of this present Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister pleads with deputies not to keep him up until three o'clock in the morning.  I assure him I have no desire to do so.  I have no intention to harrow his soul with descriptions of the divine process of flogging, notwithstanding the fact that many members of the Dáil are not aware of what this means.  I am going to oppose the Second Reading on the general ground that no case has been made to justify another Emergency Bill dealing with criminals, and that there are provisions in the Bill which are objectionable, no matter against whom they may be intended to be applied.  I think, when introducing a Bill of this kind dealing with penalties, especially a Bill which is a temporary Bill, we ought to be informed what the penalties under the normal ordinary law are.  We are told that it is proposed to inflict certain punishment for certain offences, and are left to try and ferret out the position under the ordinary law.  Few deputies have the advantage which, of course, the Minister must have, of corelating the new proposals to the ordinary law.  I think it is due to the Dáil to have some explanation of what the ordinary law provides for and what the new Bill intends to substitute.  I make the assertion that with regard to robbery with violence, and I think also with reference to arson, there is no occasion for new penalties, and I urge that the ordinary law is quite capable of dealing with most of the offences which are dealt with in this Bill.  The Dáil ought to have complete justification for emergency legislation of this kind before agreeing to pass a Bill of a temporary character.</P>
    <P>I hope, by the way, that the Minister will consider the argument used in relation to the last Bill referring to the mixed kind of punishment, a fine and imprisonment, the fine being paid off by an agreement to undergo a further term of imprisonment.  The Minister has not cared to tell the Dáil the state of the country fearing it may be taken as <Col N="1222" /> fouling the nest.  I have no desire whatever to lay bare all the horrors that there may be but I submit that before we are asked to pass emergency legislation, which is to take the place of the ordinary criminal law, we ought to be informed of the facts.  We ought to be informed as to whether the ordinary law has failed and why it has failed and if the conditions which led to its failure still continue.  In answer to a question to-day, the Minister told us that the number of offences under Section 5 paragraph 4 of the Public Safety Act had fallen from 1,502 to 738 in the period from August, 1922, to February, 1923, as compared with the period August, 1923, to February, 1924. That is, the number of offences of a particular character dealt with have fallen by one half.  The offences dealt with were robbery under arms and arson, both of which I believe&mdash;certainly one &mdash;may be punishable by flogging under the ordinary law.  Comparing the two periods, the period of August, 1922, to February, 1923, with the period during which what might have been called a state of war prevailed, every house burned, every bank robbery or seizure under arms was an offence and very many of them were alleged to have been committed under instructions. They certainly were committed at a time when armed strife prevailed and men defended themselves by saying that they were doing this as an act of war.  In the latter period after this Emergency Bill passed the number fell to 738.  That second period ran concurrently with the period during which this armed strife had not continued.</P>
    <P>I submit that the effect of the special provisions of Section 5, which is copied with some slight emendation in this new Bill, was not such an effect as was expected or desired.  As a matter of fact, the special punishments did not deter; the advertisement of the fact that these punishments would probably follow the offence, would certainly follow the offence if the prisoner were caught and convicted, did not have the deterrent effect which was promised.  As a matter of fact, the culprits pitted their wits and their ability to escape against the forces of the State.  I submit that the real deterrent in these matters is not the weight of the punishment, but the <Col N="1223" /> certainty of arrest.  If you can provide for practical certainty of arrest, there is a much more deterrent effect than any punishment that you may prescribe where the chances of arrest are less. Even as late as the third week in December we had a newspaper writing a leading article in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A disquieting number of these offences (that is, robbery under arms) has been reported during the last few days.  We report this morning no less than four cases of robbery, or attempted robbery by violence, in this city and suburbs.  In every case the robbers carried revolvers, and in every case they committed their depredations without interruption or arrest.</P>
    <P>There may have been subsequent arrests, I cannot say, but, as a matter of fact, we know that many cases have been reported and no arrests have been made.  I venture to say, without any statistical knowledge, but just by observation, that the Minister will find that there has been a decline in the number of such offences with the increased certainty of arrest.  With the greater efficiency of the police forces will come a lessening of these offences. That lessening will not come as a result of increasing the weight of the sentence. The Minister pins his faith to the State facing the enemies of society lash in hand.  He is welcome to his view of the relations of the State to its enemies.  He may defend it by saying that it is mediaeval, and that modernism is a failure; mediaevalism in this, if also in other things, ought to return. Again, he is welcome to his views!  I do not think that that is a true conception of the relation of the State to its citizens, even though they are bad citizens. We are asked to decide a question of very great importance, as to what ought to be the principles on which an offender is punished.  The Minister says &ldquo;Vengeance plus deterrents.&rdquo; I dissent, and I say that it is not a right attitude for the State to adopt to its offending citizens to say: &ldquo;We will be revenged upon your body for your offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To take an offender and to place him in a position of absolute impotence, and <Col N="1224" /> then wreak your vengeance upon his flesh by a whip may satisfy the conception of the Minister as to what ought to be the relative positions of the State and its citizen, even an offending citizen, but in my view it is degrading, not to the prisoner but to the State. When the Minister uses the word &ldquo;ignominious,&rdquo; and says they intend that it shall be ignominious, I retort, &ldquo;I have no objection to the ignominy put on an offender who uses violence against an inoffensive citizen, but I have an objection to the ignominy in which the State is placed when it is asked to use this particular method of punishment.&rdquo;  I say it does not even give the results which the Minister would desire, and which we all would desire.</P>
    <P>I say again, what I said when this matter was discussed before, that it is not the prisoner or offender I am thinking of; it is the credit of the State, of society, of the community and its good name.  I believe it is a bad principle to adopt to say that wrong-doing shall be met by vengeance; vengeance wreaked upon the flesh and the nerves of the offender.  You may frighten him, but you do not make a good citizen out of him.  The Minister has told us that the state of the country is such that these emergency powers are required.  He has given us the information that 545 indictable offences were reported in January.  I wonder whether many of these offences would have been indictable under the ordinary law, or whether they are brought into this category because of the existence of emergency legislation?  I do not know.  I suggest that it would be well if his colleagues in the inner and the outer circle had some idea of the state of the country, and made sure that the facts are such as to warrant the introduction of further emergency legislation.  We have one Minister, when asked the question, &ldquo;What is the general state of the country?&rdquo; replying, &ldquo;Tranquility itself; the only noise we hear of is that of a drunken row that is soon over, and, in fact, the country is so quiet that it is getting dreadfully monotonous.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I suggest that if it is so bad as the Minister now says, so bad as to justify new emergency legislation, it would be well to call into counsel not only the inner circle but the outer circle.  Notwithstanding the fact that active war-like measures have ceased for seven of eight months we have this state of things.  It suggests the necessity for close counsel so that Ministers would be able to confer with each other and devise means for dealing with a condition so lamentable as stated by the Minister.  I am not convinced that it is necessary to outstep the ordinary law.  I think the Dáil should hesitate until a case is made for passing emergency legislation of this kind.  It is on these general grounds that I intend to vote against the Bill. I promise the Minister that I am not going to trouble him very much in an endeavour to amend it.  I simply will record my protest whenever occasion arises.</P>

      <P>However much we regret the circumstances, most of us will agree that the Minister for Home Affairs has made a case for this new Bill.  Those of us who live in the country cannot but be aware, unless we go about with our eyes shut, that there is an undoubted case for these extra powers.  It is well known that in many parts of the country gangs of ruffians are going about working in and out with one another, committing robberies and other offences, who are not brought to justice.  There are other cases that are not reported where unfortunate old people living alone, even old women, have had their houses broken into and their property taken from them.  Some of these offences were formerly very foreign to the nature of the Irish people.  I am sorry to say that such offences are becoming more common than they were.</P>

Unfortunately Ireland is not now the place it was described as being in one of Moore's melodies, &ldquo;Rich and rare,&rdquo; where a lady could walk through the land with her jewels and never be attacked.  I am afraid these days are gone.  As I say, any of us who are in active touch with the country, even the quiet parts, cannot but be alive to the fact that extra powers are needed, as a great many cases of a revolting nature are occurring.  These cases are not reported, because people do not like to do so, and because they are afraid there will be no conviction.  Hating as I do the idea of extra punishment, or extra powers, I recognise the necessity for such powers now.  I am sure there are a great many living in lonely parts of the country who will agree that there is an absolute necessity for such powers as the Minister has asked for.  I hope these powers will be used, as some of these ruffians deserve all the punishment that could be inflicted upon them.  I shall certainly give my support to the Minister for Home Affairs in every way I can on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that Deputy Woulfe had not a consultation with the Minister for Home Affairs before the Schedule of this Bill was drafted, as he might have been able to suggest to him what the Schedule should contain, at least the second part.  It might make some of us have a different point of view if what he has in his mind were there.  As to the Bill itself, the Minister for Home Affairs has a very peculiar way in drafting his measure of including in the offences that will be punishable under the Bill, when it passes into law, those of a political type, and also another type that may be designated as criminal. This Bill is like other temporary measures, for which the Minister has been able to secure a favourable decision in the Dáil.  For that reason I will vote against this measure.  I agree that there is much truth in what Deputy Woulfe said that there are types in the country that should be severely punished.  I am not satisfied that it is impossible to punish these <Col N="1227" /> types under the common law.  I believe that it is possible to do so.  I do not think it is necessary that any temporary or emergency powers should be given the Minister to secure that these people will be treated as they ought to be treated.  But when the Minister comes on, and along with his intention of punishing people for crimes that are being committed and that deserve punishment, he makes up his mind that other people will be punished if certain crimes are committed that are not being committed in the country, I must say that I cannot understand the point of view of the Minister at all.  The Minister says in the first part of the Schedule to this Bill, &ldquo;inciting persons to engage in an attempt to overthrow by violence the established from of Government of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can never contemplate that the Dáil should spend its time in passing legislation to deal with a situation that does not exist.  I think we could be better engaged in attending to matters that are demanding attention, and passing legislation to remedy defects the State is suffering from, and I do say there is no necessity for giving these powers to the Minister.  There is no attempt being made to overthrow the established form of Government by violence; there is no attempt in that direction, and I do not think the Minister has any occasion to seek powers to prevent or stop what is not taking place, nor is there any evidence that such an attempt will be made or that it will take place in the future.  I cannot see why the Minister should ask for such powers.  As I said on a previous occasion, it would be much better for the Minister to recognise the State as it really is, and as some of his colleagues in the Ministry have stated elsewhere it is.  We will accept the statement that was made by that other colleague in another place as being the truth, because we know and believe it is the truth.  I do not think any case has been or can be made by the Minister for Home Affairs to show that he should have powers to punish people for offences that are not taking place, or on the assumption that they may take place.  If, in the future, offences are committed that the Minister <Col N="1228" /> thinks should be rendered punishable, or if there are preparations to commit such offences, the Minister will then have time enough to seek such powers.  Until there is that necessity I think and I feel that such powers should not be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MICHAEL HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose the motion which stands in my name in the Order Paper to-day and which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that special measures should be taken by the Government to recompense the suppliers of milk to the creameries of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland for the losses which they suffered owing to the seizure of those creameries in May, 1922, by unauthorised persons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to explain to the Dáil the matters which led up to this seizure, and the happenings which took place in connection with that seizure, and which, in my opinion, justifies me in proposing <Col N="1229" /> this motion.  In the early days of 1922 negotiations were going on between the Directors of the Condensed Milk Co. of Ireland, commonly known in the South as Messrs. Cleeve's, and their workers. These negotiations, I believe, were with regard to wages, and also, I believe, with regard to the number of employees. But as the farmers, whom I represent, were never taken into the confidence of either the workers or the Directors of the Company, it is not my intention to deal with the rights or wrongs of the dispute.  The only thing we do know is that the members of the Government should be perfectly well aware that this dispute was going on, and that something out of the ordinary was likely to happen, because I understand that one of their representatives acted as Chairman in those conferences which took place in the early days of 1922.  The first indication that the farmers got that anything serious was about to happen was on the 12th May, 1922.  All the creameries belonging to that Company in Tipperary, Limerick and Cork were taken over by bodies of men, armed, I believe, in most cases. They were taken over forcibly, and the employees and managers who remained loyal to the owners of the creameries were expelled.  Simultaneously with the taking over of the creameries, red flags were hoisted in each case over these concerns.  This gave a clear indication to anybody who wished to realise the situation that the intention of these people was revolutionary.  The methods which were adopted by the workers were not the methods used in ordinary disputes about wages.  Well, then, all the property in the creameries having been taken over by those men, their lorries were sent out the following day&mdash;sent out, I wish to inform the Government, in my district, and I believe in other districts&mdash;manned with men openly carrying revolvers.  What the intention of carrying revolvers was I am not in a position to state, but it must be perfectly evident to anybody giving the matter his or her consideration that the intention was to intimidate the suppliers of milk to the creameries, so that they would not refuse to give the milk, and that thus the farmers would be frightened into doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> We in the organised Farmers' Body were placed in a very difficult position. We had to act in a hurry.  The action which we took was that we sent out instructions to our members that they would not supply those red flaggers or revolutionaries with milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time that we sent out those orders, and when a good many of us had ceased to supply the milk, we sent a deputation up here to Dublin to the Government&mdash; that is the part of the Government that had remained loyal to the Treaty, and who were then in control of the country. On certain statements which, I believe, were made at that interview, I largely base the claim which I make here, that compensation should be granted to the farmers.  I have the word of one responsible member of the deputation on behalf of the farmers. One of the Ministers, when asked if the Government could see their way to compensate the farmers if the farmers refused to supply the milk, said: &ldquo;We are in a position to compensate.&rdquo; Relying on this partial promise, these men went down to the country, and word was spread that if the farmers did cease to supply that there was a reasonable chance that the matter would be taken up by the Government, and that compensation would be granted.  Meanwhile, the matter went on.  Those workers, or revolutionaries, or Irregulars remained in possession of these creameries and continued to work these creameries, working them with the supply of milk they got.  They continued to interfere with the sale of the milk and the milk products of those farmers who had refused to supply them.  I saw, myself, in the streets of Clonmel, butter taken in by the farmers' wives, seized by the Red Flaggers, and strewn about the street.  I say that the farmers were prevented and intimidated so that they could not sell their butter.  All kinds of efforts were made to prevent the farmers carrying on their business in the usual manner. Night raids were made on farmers' houses, their separators were broken, and their dairy utensils were smashed up.  Armed men in lorries appeared in <Col N="1231" /> the markets in Co. Waterford, and elsewhere, and intimidated the farmers.</P>
      <P>The question may be asked: was that movement an Irregular movement; had it any connection with the movement of the Party that called itself the Republican Party?  There are Deputies here who are in a much better position than I to give the inside view in that regard; but my view is, that it was connected, and directly connected, with the movement of the Irregulars.  We do know that some of the responsible leaders in my county had given it a good deal of their moral support.  We do know that those men who took over the creameries were supplied with coal and other articles from the Barracks, which were then under the command of the Irregular leaders.  In justice to some of those leaders&mdash;some who have since died for the cause they supported&mdash; they repudiated it.  At the same time it is evident to anybody that some of the Irregular leaders were willing to support any movement which might make it difficult for the Government then in power to control the country, and if they did not give the taking over of creameries their active support they, at least, gave it tacit support.</P>
      <P>The creameries remained in possession of the men who took them over forcibly, and the farmers in practically all cases had to leave their milk at home.  Some of them manufactured butter with the object of using it; others had to spill the milk in the fields. It is a fact that in the neighbourhood of some farm houses, on account of the milk being continually spilled on the ground, nuisances were caused, and the thing became a danger to the health of the farmers.  This claim which we are making is not one that we cannot substantiate with figures.  We have got an accurate account from all the farmers of their losses.  We have detailed accounts from each farmer stating the loss suffered and the number of gallons of milk that had to be wasted.  I am willing to submit that statement of losses to the Government if they will receive it with any kind of intention of dealing with the matter in a genuine fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The state of affairs I have described <Col N="1232" /> continued until eventually, at the time those counties came under the control of the Government forces, the creameries went back again into the hands of the original owners, not before, however, as was the case in some places, they had been destroyed.  A creamery in Tipperary, valued at £100,000, was burned down.  It is well known that this creamery was in the possession of the Irregular forces, and was being used as a munition factory.  It is known that munitions were manufactured there, and large quantities of arms were stored there.  Incidentally I might mention that the lives of those connected with the farmers' movement were endangered during this period. Serious attempts were made to take my life, and a serious attempt was made to take the life of one of the managers in Clonmel, Mr. Reidy.  He was taken prisoner, and was held for several days. The condition of affairs was that the farmers who suffered those great losses were in many cases purely dairy farmers. They lost their produce for one whole dairy year, and the year following was not much of an improvement, because some of them lost the value of a certain proportion of their products owing to the closing of Messrs. Cleeve's creameries, which was possibly due to the Red Flag menace of last year.</P>
    <P>Now, the Government insists that these men shall meet their obligations to the State; they insist that they shall pay the annuities that are due, and pay also the local rates.  The Government has taken special powers to see that these annuities and these rates are enforced.  I admit the farmers owe an obligation to the Government, and they are under an obligation to pay taxes and rates.  But if the farmers owe an obligation to the Government, the Government owe an obligation to the farmers.  The Government has an obligation to protect its citizens, and if it does not find itself in a position to protect those citizens, I maintain it has a moral right to compensate them for the losses they have suffered owing to lack of protection.  I think that is a perfectly genuine, legal, moral claim.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair for the Government to hide behind any case such as the Compensation for Property <Col N="1233" /> Act, and to say that this is not a direct loss, or that it is only a consequential loss.  It is very hard to differentiate between a direct loss and a consequential loss.  If people came out and spilled the farmers' milk, that would be a direct loss because it happened in a direct way; but, because the loss happened in an indirect way it is only a consequential loss.  I know those farmers are in a bad way.  Many of them are not able to meet their obligations. Processes and other legal proceedings are being taken against them, and I ask the Minister and the Government is it fair that while the Government, unwilling or unable to come to their aid in dire necessity, they should now force these men to pay what they have not got because of the failure of the Government to support them.  I ask the Government, therefore, to accept this motion, and hold out some hope that compensation or recompense will be made to those farmers for the loss they suffered, and suffered in support of the law and order and good government against the efforts to establish Socialism and perhaps Bolshevism in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion moved by Deputy Heffernan. The Government should seriously consider the position of men who, because of their civic spirit and their wish to uphold law and order, have been penalised through the neglect of the Government to protect them.  It is the duty of the Government now to recompense these men for their loss.  We do not ask that men who suffered loss by reason of supplying the Red Flag factories should be recompensed, but we ask that those men who, on the strength of the promise made by the Government to stand by them, withheld their supplies of milk from the Red Flag factories, and were compelled to destroy their milk, and to see their butter destroyed because of the Government's failure&mdash; we ask that the Government should recompense them for the loss they have suffered.  Deputy Heffernan pointed out that these men are called upon to pay land annuities and to pay their local taxation, and that by reason of failure on the part of government they are unable to do so, and surely, it is <Col N="1234" /> scarcely fair to ask them to carry out their obligation on their side, when the Government, on its side, failed in their obligation to those people.</P>

When Deputy Heffernan sat down, I was inclined to rise and support his motion, but the speech of Deputy Wilson suggests that there is difference of opinion between the mover and the seconder. I am not familiar with the details of this case but, as I understand it, a number of people supplied milk to the Creameries after the closing down by the Condensed Milk Company and owing to certain action taken in the Courts, by Messrs. Cleeve and others, the suppliers of milk have not been paid and cannot be paid.  I think that the motion certainly justifies some consideration of their case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to turn this statement to any particular section in this matter, but I am very much surprised that the Deputy should <Col N="1235" /> put himself in the position very much more serious than those who seized the creameries.  The seized creameries all belonged to the Condensed Milk Company. They did not belong to those by whom they were seized.  However, I leave that with Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Wilson, and I take it that if the Dáil passes this motion it does not mean what the motion says.  The position, as I understand it, is that in the view of the people engaged in the factories it was to the mutual advantage of all of them &mdash;milk suppliers, farmers and creamery operatives&mdash;that an outlet should be maintained for the milk.  If the creameries had been closed, as Messrs. Cleeve desired, what would be the position of those who hitherto supplied the milk? What would they have done with their milk?  What would they have done with the milk which they were not compelled to do afterwards?</P>
      <P>In some cases, as Deputy Heffernan pointed out, butter was sent to the market and scattered about the streets. There was definite loss there, and I think I may be right in saying that such loss would come under the Compensation Clauses.  But in the other cases what would have become of the milk if the company had closed the doors of the creameries, and the men had left them closed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this information.  As I stated, I am not fully aware of the facts, and I would like to be informed fully as I go on.  If further Deputies go on informing me, I should be quite a wise man when this debate is finished.  According to Deputy Heffernan, the majority of the suppliers, or, at least, those who <Col N="1236" /> are organised, decided that it was better that the creameries should remain closed.  Deputy Wilson says that if they had not been interfered with they would have found an outlet in the co-operative creameries, and that the co-operative creameries would have been glad to receive their milk.  No doubt co-operative societies are a very useful stand-by for farmers.  Whether they would have been so appreciative of the difficulties the farmers were in at the time as to relieve them of their difficulty I do not know.  Deputy Heffernan is in a better position to say that than I am.  Unfortunately for the co-operatives, in too many cases farmers who ought to be supplying them in normal times only come to look to them in times of trouble.  They leave them to go into bankruptcy because Messrs. Cleeve and the others tempt them to leave their true allegiance.  Then, when difficulty arises, the farmers look for an outlet through the co-operatives.  Because something has interfered with the free movement of the non-co-operative farmers, who desire to take advantage of the existence of co-operatives, complaint is made.  It seems to me that the position of these farmers, while, no doubt, unenviable, is no worse than that of many people who were interfered with in other businesses in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the proportions are of those who supplied and those who refused to supply.  I would certainly think that a case is made in favour of those who supplied and were not paid.  But, after all, there was a not unreasonable way out in this case. If my information is correct, the farmers were invited to assist in maintaining the outlet.  By refusing to do that, they practically said &ldquo;We stand by Messrs. Cleeve &amp; Co. in sabotaging this industry.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;We must have thirty-three and a third per cent off wages.&rdquo;  Because that reduction was refused, the factories were closed.  It was suggested to the farmers that they should be kept open, and that a full account of every item should be rendered to Messrs. Cleeve.  The farmers refused and, of course, disintegration set in and, if the accounts of Deputy Heffernan are right, certain demoralisation <Col N="1237" /> set in, and that caused very serious troubles.  I am not pronouncing any opinion upon the merits or morality of the proceedings.  I think there was the possibility of maintaining the suppliers of milk in reasonable prosperity, of keeping the factories working and the men engaged, and that a due return to Messrs. Cleeve or the Condensed Milk Company would have been rendered of everything brought into action, had the farmers during the operations maintained&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the President says whether he is inclined to accept this motion or not, I would like to state why it is my intention to vote against it. Until I heard the explanation of the mover of the motion, I would have been inclined to vote in favour of it.  He has gained the credit for changing the opinion of one Deputy who was in favour of the motion before he heard the explanation.  In one portion of his speech, he said that the farmers in Clonmel and Waterford had to spill the milk out on the grass, and that for a time they endangered their health.  I think it would have been more charitable <Col N="1238" /> if those farmers had looked around and distributed that milk to the workers' families in Bansha, and Cahir, and Oola, and other places.  That would have been better than to spill out the milk and endanger their health. It is all very well for any Party in the Dáil to ask for compensation.  Of course, the Minister for Finance will want to know where this money is going to come from.  I am sure the President will not be willing to instruct the Minister for Finance to float another loan to pay these demands.  I was told the other day in answer to a question that it was not the intention of the Minister for Finance to give grants to mill owners in order that they may reconstruct their mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope that it is not the intention of the Government to give compensation to those farmers who had an opportunity at the time of settling with their workers.  As other Deputies have explained, if a strike took place, and the creamery owners locked the gates, the employees were out, and I doubt very much whether the little co-operative creamery in Piltown would be able to deal with all the milk down from Clonmel, which is about fourteen or fifteen miles away.  Deputy Heffernan spoke about Irregulars.  I am not speaking against the men who took over the charge of those creameries.  Their action may have appeared to be irregular from the point of view of some Deputies, but when one comes down to bare facts one finds that if they did not act in this manner they might have been compelled to commit crimes that would be far more serious, and not alone endanger themselves but others. If these people had been paid a living wage at the time, I am sure this trouble would not have taken place, and it is, to my mind, very peculiar kind of tactics to adopt at this stage, that, simply because the masters and men did not agree among themselves three or four years ago, they must now go to the Government to be compensated for any little losses they sustained, simply because at the time they refused to pay wages that would keep the bodies and souls of the workers and their families together.  There is a factory in Carrick-on-Suir that was taken over by the <Col N="1239" /> workers, and I am informed it was worked and managed in a proper manner.  The farmers were invited to send their milk in.  They would have got the same price as was given to them before the factory was seized.  When I was living in Carrick-on-Suir the employees numbered up to about 114 girls and 40 or 50 men.  All these people were to be removed.  The gates were to be closed on them, and they took it into their sensible heads to take on this factory, get the work done, and pay the same rates as were paid by the company who owned it.  I would like to inform Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Wilson that the workers were forced out of it by an armed party, whether Irregulars or regulars I do not know.  I am surprised to hear from Deputy Heffernan that a creamery that has been turned into a munition factory still remains, and that it was not blown up, either when it was evacuated by what he calls Irregulars or in a battle.</P>

They are more or less suffering from nightmare, that the flag might come in the shape of some awful object at night and they would be removed out of their homes through the key-hole, or something like that.  I am surprised that they did not ask the President a question as to changing the colour to green.  The red flag, to some of those who spoke about it, is just the same as showing a red flag to a bull.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion proposed by Deputy Heffernan, and I think the Dáil will agree that he has made a very fair case for his constituents.  We are all aware that this occurred at a time when the <Col N="1240" /> life of this State was in jeopardy, and when a number of our citizens went out, each with a Constitution in his pocket, prepared for the future of the State, and who was prepared to go behind the barricades and fight for that Constitution.  I never heard during all that fight between men who called themselves Free Staters and Anti-Treatyites, that ever an Irregular fought under the flag that we are sitting under.  The reason I rise to support the motion is because of the fact that those incidents occurred under the red flag.  God knows, we have had enough of battles of flags in this country, and I am not one of those who wishes to change any flag until such is the decision of the majority of the citizens. I feel that this red flag is the flag of revolution, and I disagree with the statements made by the leader of the Labour Party.  We all know that it was the flag of revolution in Russia, and there is no use in mincing words. When the Government had a very difficult task to perform in trying to restore law and order, these men went out under this flag, took advantage of the situation, and caused further trouble to the Government.  Deputy Lyons says that there is nothing dangerous about the red flag.  Well, the first time I saw it was stopping an engine.  We all see it on the railways every day in the week in the guard's hand.  I might get under the engine if it was not there.  I have no objection to any flag being used in a constitutional way, or waved in a constitutional manner, but I have a very strong objection to any citizen of any State leading a number of men under that flag to smash up machinery which it took years to put there, and to destroy and injure what was maintaining the lives of the people in the district, and I say that such tactics should be put down with a firm hand.  So far as I am concerned, I hope that the evil roots of that tree will not extend to this country until the tree is as dead as the man who hoisted it in Bolshevist Russia.  I like a man to be a man.  Leaders of men and of parties in this country must not be backboneless leaders, but men who will speak out and tell their followers to act in a constitutional manner.</P>

I think that if there is any sense of duty in the Government they will hearken to the appeal made my Deputy Heffernan and grant compensation to the men who have sustained these losses.  I have no sympathy, any more than the Deputy, with the men who went and bent their knees to those who hoisted the red flag.  I think that was weakness on their part, and I think, further, that the men who sustained these great losses and had the courage of their convictions to stand by while their machinery was smashed should not be forgotten by the State.

      <P>The Damage to Property Act lays down the terms which have been passed into law, under which compensation can be paid in respect of losses sustained from the 11th July, 1921, until the 12th May, 1923. That Act was before this Dáil and before the Seanad.  Its introduction, I think, took place somewhere about December, 1922, and the Second Reading passed the Dáil, I think, on the 8th February, 1923, and it occupied a very considerable space of the time of Parliament in formulating proposals which, in the light of all the circumstances, seemed the best to the Oireachtas to provide compensation for those who had lost. At this stage, something like eight or ten months after the Act had passed, it is a little disappointing that a case should be made in respect of, I am sure, a relatively small section of the community, that either this Act did not cover them or that special legislation should have been passed in respect of them.  If they cannot be compensated under the Damage to Property Act&mdash;<Col N="1242" /> and I would like to stress the fact that there were representatives in both Houses of the interests of the people who now claim compensation&mdash;it is rather strange that we should be asked now to extend in respect of one particular section of the community what we have laid down all along we could not compensate for, and that is a consequential loss.  This is either a consequential loss or it is not.  If it be not the claim comes under the Damage to Property Act; if it is, and that we are to open the door here, where can we close it?  Deputy Johnson made a case in respect of men who had lost their employment by reason of the troubles. A very good case he made, but it was ruled out on the very same grounds we ruled out the claims of business people in respect of losses sustained by reason of the hostilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of revolution does not arise.  We did not raise that question in connection with any of the other compensations that we were paying, and the fact that revolvers were used does not arise either, for provision was also made for that in the Damage to Property Act.  The deputation which came here, I suppose in May or June, 1922, saw a Minister.  If I took correctly the statement made by Deputy Heffernan, the Minister said:&ldquo;We are in a position to compensate&rdquo;&mdash;a very safe statement that.  I am examining it now from quite a number of different angles.  First of all, if he were standing on his cash-box at that time he was in a position to compensate as compared with his position standing on his cash-box now.  On the other hand, there was certainly no undertaking to compensate.  Reading the resolution one would take it that, if the Deputy has correctly interpreted that promise, every person who had been a supplier of milk to this creamery, whether during this particular period he sent in the milk or not, would be entitled to compensation. If the Minister said:&ldquo;We are in a position to compensate,&rdquo; he could not have had in mind that he was going to compensate those who, in the mind of Deputy Heffernan, were helping to keep a particular colour of a flag over the place, or those who, in agreement with Deputy McKenna, refused <Col N="1243" /> absolutely to supply.  When people speak about Government protection they ought at least to examine the circumstances of that particular period.  A government had only just, one might say, come into existence with immense responsibilities; with no police force, and one might almost say, an unorganised army.  At the period in question it is more than possible that we had no more than three thousand troops, if we had so many, under arms, and while the ordinary citizen could say, &ldquo;I am called upon to pay my Land Commission Annuities, and my rates, but I must get protection or I will not pay one or the other,&rdquo; these were not the terms into which he entered when he purchased his land. He purchased his land on the condition that he would pay that Land Commission Annuity, and by reason of his agreement he got a considerable reduction in his rent, which a great number of other citizens have not got yet.  With regard to rates, that is a liability which is common to mankind, much the same as measles or scarlatina.  If they say they will not pay, I am afraid they are taking up much the same lines, but maybe in a gentler way, than the gentlemen who raised the obnoxious flag on the premises in question.</P>

      <P>I am hearing that from almost every section of the community, from the working people up to the so-called rich.  The latter tell me they cannot pay their Income Tax, and the others say they cannot live because of the cost of living.  I discount all these statements, perhaps, unreasonably, but I am in much the same position myself, as I find it difficult to pay also.  The difficulty in this case, is that this is made a special case for compensation, on the grounds that they were unable to help themselves in this neighbourhood, and that they suffered severe loss.  Who is there in the country who did not lose during that period in business, in labour, in any walk of life? Take the case of the railways.  If ever there was a case which could reasonably <Col N="1244" /> be sustained for compensation for disturbance, it is the case of the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway, which lost three quarters of a million in revenue that year.  We are not paying that, and, as a result, quite a number of widows and orphans, and other people like that, suffered.  Their property is depreciated, and there must be a very severe loss to be sustained.</P>
      <P>There are people in business who, during the period of the attack on the Four Courts, lost their business. Some of them lost very much more than their business during that period. We were not in a position to compensate a single one of these people for consequential losses.  We were not in a position, and we are not in a position to compensate a very large number of people who, during the last 4, 5, or 6 years, entered into this trouble to secure the position we are in now, and to make it almost certain that those farmers in future will not suffer the losses that they suffered during that period, from May to September, or whatever the time was.  If the basis of compensation that is laid down in the Damage to Property Act is not a good basis, at least, it was long enough before the people for them to have pointed out to us what its defects were.  The Deputy, I take it, is representing the same constituency as the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government went down to that constituency after the passing of that Act, which did not compensate these very worthy constituents of his, and who, according to Deputy Heffernan, ought to have been compensated, and he topped the poll.  Submitting it to such an extensive jury as that, he got a verdict for good service in his county.  His constituents rewarded him for good service, and they marked their appreciation of that Damage to Property Act, and of him, by a majority of something like 12,000 votes.  I think, in the circumstances, it would not be possible for us to agree to this resolution being passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Heffernan replies, I would like to say a word or two in connection with the statement made by Deputy McKenna.  It is perfectly easy to indulge in platitudes in <Col N="1245" /> discussing a matter of this kind, platitudes which, I have no doubt, will be in leaded type in the newspapers in the morning.  In any movement that the workers may make in this country some people always like to hold up the Red Flag in defence of that particular movement.  Deputy McKenna says that this country suffers from backboneless leaders.  One might infer from reading his statements in the morning that the Chairman of this Party might be looked upon as a backboneless leader but there is one thing this country and this Dáil will have to give Deputy Johnson credit for and that is that during the last 12 months he said the right thing at the right time in connection with sabotage in this country.  Deputy Johnson has always been a fearless leader of this Party and he has said what he thought fit at the proper time and has saved this country, I think, a lot during the past 12 months.  So far as I am concerned, I have always advocated that the workers should move constitutionally.  I deprecate and I disagree with anything such as has been done in County Tipperary where machinery was destroyed, because I do not think it is in the workers' interests or in the country's interests that such a thing should take place.  I have a distinct recollection that during the passing of the Compensation Act through this Dáil Deputy Johnson moved an amendment which would give consequential damage and which would embrace claims of this kind.  I have a distinct recollection of the Party to which Deputy Heffernan belongs having voted absolutely against it.  I want to know what the particular Party that Deputy Heffernan belongs to would think if we, on behalf of the workers in factories that were burned down in this country, during the last 12 or 18 months, advocated that the workers should be paid for all the hours, all the minutes, and all the days they lost. These men who were dependent absolutely for their livelihood, day after day, on these factories had no chance of getting anything by way of compensation for their losses and I think that they had a better claim than the landed people of this country, who had something to fall back upon.  As I said before <Col N="1246" /> I do not think that it is a good thing for anybody to indulge in platitudes in this Dáil in a matter like this. I think that Deputy McKenna went a little too far.  The Labour Party are able to look after their own interests. So far as the flag is concerned, it is merely an emblem.  The flag will not make any man do anything.  As Deputy Johnson said, there were things said about the flag that is flying over this building, but that flag survived it all, in spite of what many people said.</P>
      <P>We advocate Constitutionalism.  I do certainly.  I do not want to see anybody breaking up machinery in this country.  I want to see everything done in a constitutional manner.</P>

I was very pleased to hear Deputy Corish say that he, and I think his Party, were prepared to support Constitutionalism and to carry on the agitation for their ends by Constitutional methods.  From my knowledge of the Labour Party, and from the attitude which it has taken up in matters in this Dáil, I had expected that he would not have attempted to boister up or to suggest that this movement should have been supported by the farmers, or that the farmers should have become partners in the illegal seizure of these creameries. I have refrained from entering into any acrimonious discussion with the Labour Party.  I thought the Labour Party, or the leaders of the Labour Party, would have taken advantage of this occasion to repudiate any connection, direct or indirect, with what happened on that occasion.  I am sorry to say, judging by the remarks of Deputy Johnson, that I cannot come to the conclusion that they repudiated that connection.</P>

There were at least three parties to that matter.  There were the workers, the owners of the creameries, and the suppliers.  The suppliers were not considered, and the property of the owners of these creameries was taken over and they were not consulted, and they were not parties to the taking over of that property.</P>

      <P>They were consulted with regard to the wage matter, but, I am sure, they were unwilling parties to the taking over of the Creameries.  Now, with regard to the President's defence of the action of the Government in not bringing this matter within the Property Compensation Act, I am rather inclined to think that this particular matter differs greatly from the many different matters which would be brought forward in an attempt to get compensation for consequential damage.  We know of the many ridiculous claims that have been made for consequential damage&mdash; loss of trade, loss of different things which occured owing to the Irregular régime.  This is a definite, feasible claim which could be substantiated.  It deals with a section of the community, but not a small section of the community, and it took from them not a small portion of their earnings, but the full portion of their earnings during one full season.  I do not agree with the President when, to a certain extent, he repudiates the liability of the State to give protection to those farmers. When those farmers purchased their land, and bound themselves to pay the annuities, it was, I am sure, tacitly understood that the State took up the obligation of protecting them, and keeping them in a position whereby <Col N="1248" /> they would be able to meet these annuities when they fell due.  I do not think that it is fair to make a comparison between the little farmers in Tipperary and Waterford, and other places, and the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway, or to say that they are in a position, or suggest that they are in a position, to bear the losses they suffered equally as well as the shareholders of that railway.  I assure him that there are many farmers down there who are in a bad position and not able to pay their annuities.  They are now being writted, and they are being forced into the courts of law to meet the demands which the Government are making for those annuities.  I think it would not have been unreasonable, in view of the promises which were made, or the implied promise when the Minister said: &ldquo;We are in a position to give compensation,&rdquo; that some steps should be taken by the Government to give compensation to those who suffered losses by not supplying milk during that season.  I am sorry that in wording my motion it was worded in a manner which, to a certain extent, is misleading, but I am sure that the Dáil will accept my intention when putting the motion down.  I would suggest to the Government that there is another way out of this matter.  There are many things in connection with this seizure which have not been cleared up, and many things have not been accounted for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, for instance, the butter which was sold and the money which was got for it&mdash;these are things that have not been accounted for.  These should be returned into the hands of those who were, in the first place, responsible for the supplying of milk which produced this butter.  I suggest that the Government should consider the advisability of appointing a small Committee of Inquiry, or an Inspector, to inquire and get hold of all the facts in connection with this case.  It is hardly fair to ask a great number of small farmers to enter into complicated law cases with the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, with, perhaps, the owners of Messrs. Cleeves' creameries, and with many other parties throughout the country to elucidate to <Col N="1249" /> whom these moneys belong.  In view of the statement I have made, and my obligation to my constituents, I cannot see my way to withdraw my motion.</P>
    <P>I would like to say with regard to the President's remark with reference to the Minister for Local Government at the last election, that when the Minister went to Tipperary to contest this election it was not contested on the issue of compensation to those who lost money owing to the Red Flag regime.  It was contested on other issues altogether, and I am perfectly sure if the Minister for Local Government went to the people of South Tipperary and said: &ldquo;I am fully prepared to tell the Government not to compensate you for the losses you suffered owing to the Red Flag regime,&rdquo; he would not have got in by a majority of 12,000 votes but, if he got in at all, he would have got in by a very narrow majority, indeed.</P>
