      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY (for Mícheál O hIfearnáin)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he is aware of the present backwardness of statistics in the Saorstát, and if, in view of the absolute necessity for comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date statistics in dealing with the problems, both economic and social, of a new State, he will take steps to have a special enquiry into the present methods of compiling statistics in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the fact that prior to the Treaty very little statistical information relating specifically to Ireland was available.  The value of such statistics in considering economic and social questions is fully recognised and a great advance has been made since the Treaty, notwithstanding serious difficulties, in providing statistical information.  I refer, for instance, to the periodical cost of living figures and to the statistics of imports and exports, railways and shipping which have been published.  Many other statistics are in course of preparation, including such statistics relating to agriculture, as conditions have allowed to be compiled.  The compilation of statistics relating to agriculture, trade, railways and labour matters has been centralised in one Department, to enable the most modern tabulating machines to be used.  The question of how these statistics can most usefully be published is now being considered.  A Bill is in preparation <Col N="1532" /> providing for a census of production next year covering industry, agriculture and fisheries.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that adequate attention is being paid to this admittedly important matter, and that the suggested special enquiry is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that there are considerable tables of statistics that have been prepared and only require publication and would these have been published if there had been no change in the form of Government?  They are statistics that are already available; they are of value to the public, and are being withheld from publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I mentioned in the latter portion of the first paragraph that the question of how these statistics can be most usefully published is now been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give a promise as to how soon a decision can be arrived at, because this question is being considered for the last 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not in a position to give an answer as to that. It is bound up very much with other matters of pressing importance, such as industry, agriculture and fisheries.  We have to deal with an enormous bulk of legislation, and the strain that is put upon the various Departments owing to the special circumstances of the times, is heavy.  The matter is certainly not being lost sight of.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether that question has not been given very grave consideration.  I believe it has, and I believe the matter has been considered as to what would be the best form of publication that might be adopted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether Laurence Mooney, Unemployment Book No. 2224, Droichead Nua Office, has his cards fully stamped for the last three years, and, if so, if he will state on what grounds he has been refused benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that the book No. 2224 does not relate to a man named Laurence Mooney, but a man of that name to whom it is thought that the Deputy's question refers made a claim to unemployment benefit at Droichead Nua on the 13th May last.  It has not been possible to pay benefit because he is disqualified under Sub-section 4 of Section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, no contribution having been paid for him in the 1922-23 insurance year.  The disqualification will last until 12 contributions have been paid for the claimant, exclusive of those paid prior to the 1922-23 insurance year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1535" /> for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to a report presented to Kildare County Council by Dr. Joseph P. Daly, County Tuberculosis Officer, in which he states that in his opinion the recurring flooding of the River Barrow is a serious menace to the health of the people living in the vicinity of that river; that medical men working amongst these people are convinced that the large number of chest and rheumatic cases they meet with are largely due to the unhealthy conditions brought about by the floods, which are grave predisposing causes of pulmonary tuberculosis, and if he will take steps to have the statements contained in the report verified by a member or members of the medical staff of his Department.</P>

      <P>The Chief Engineering Inspector from my Department visited the locality last week, accompanied by Deputy Colohan, the County Surveyor, and a representative of the Board of Works.  I understand they are agreed that no satisfactory results could be obtained unless at a very considerable cost.  I have brought my Inspector's report to the notice of the Ministry of Finance and the Board of Works, as they will be jointly concerned in taking any further action which they may deem necessary.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as its title shows, aims at regulating the export of eggs and makes provision for the registration of premises concerned in the export of eggs.  The Bill is confined exclusively to the regulation of the export trade.  The Bill, which is at present passing through the Northern Parliament, makes provision for the registration and regulation of all wholesale <Col N="1543" /> dealers in eggs.  It is considered that it would be impossible to administer efficiently here a Bill so wide in its scope, and hence we have confined ourselves to the regulation and registration of exporters.  It is not generally realised that the egg and poultry trade is one of the most important items in our export trade of agricultural produce, but that is the fact.  The following are the figures for the export of agricultural produce from <i>all Ireland</i> during 1921:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It will be seen that in 1921 eggs and poultry ranked in importance next to cattle and beef, and above either bacon or butter.  The figures for 1923-24 show that the egg and poultry trade is not as valuable as the pig and bacon trade, and is about as valuable as the butter trade.  It must be remembered that the exports of eggs from Northern Ireland ports include about twenty per cent. of eggs that are produced in the Free State.  These figures show the possibilities of the Irish egg trade, and definitely establish the fact that it is well worth our while to take whatever measures are necessary to arrest the decline that has set in in that trade, and to improve and develop it in the future.  We must be careful not to read too much into these sets of figures.  It has to be remembered that the first set of figures are all Ireland figures; and represent 1921 values, and in addition, that as Russia and Denmark were cut off from the English market during the European War, Irish exports would, <Col N="1544" /> naturally, increase automatically.  On the other hand, the European War is now over for about five years, and we can now fairly compare the position of Ireland with the position of Denmark as a supplier of poultry products to the English market.  The chief pre-war suppliers to that market were Russia, who supplied approximately 10,500,000 hundreds&mdash;they count in hundreds in the egg trade, I understand&mdash;Ireland, 6,300,000 hundreds, and Denmark 4,000,000 hundreds.  It will be seen that Russia was far the largest supplier. Russia does a large trade in cheap eggs, and out of a total market of about 23,000,000 hundreds, about half is for low-priced eggs.  The principal suppliers in 1923, omitting Russia, were Denmark, 6,757,000 hundreds, and Ireland 6,440,000 hundreds.  Of the Irish supply, about 4,400,000 hundreds were produced in the Free State; while about 2,000,000 hundreds were produced in Northern Ireland.  It will thus be noticed that Denmark has displaced Ireland. Before the war the Irish export was more than fifty per cent. greater than Danish, now it is less, and getting steadily less.</P>
    <P>It is to prevent this process continuing and, in fact, to reverse it, that this legislation is introduced, and when it is remembered that we are dealing with an export trade which, under favourable circumstances, should be worth six or eight millions to us, we must realise that it is worth while taking drastic measures to deal with the present unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    <P>It is admitted that Irish eggs, if marketed in a fresh condition, are superior in point of flavour to any other eggs to be found on the British market.  This stands to reason.  We have every natural advantage, and yet, in spite of these advantages, the present position is that our trade displays practical stagnation, while that of our principal competitors has steadily gone forward.  The reasons for this are admitted.  It is because a very large percentage of our eggs reach the English market carelessly packed in unsuitable packing material, sometimes in a dirty condition, sometimes short in number, and sometimes with good eggs and stale eggs, fresh eggs and preserved eggs mixed in the same case.  In this way the reputation of Irish eggs, as a <Col N="1545" /> whole, has been depreciated; and the very large number of efficient farmers and efficient exporters who sent their eggs to market, as they should be sent, find that their produce suffers the same fate, gets the same reputation, and fetches the same price as the second-class produce which I have mentioned, and which has depreciated the reputation of Irish produce as a whole.  We cannot allow this state of affairs to continue any longer.  To my mind the function of the State in regard to trade is to look after the producer who looks after himself; to put a premium on efficiency, and to see to it that the producer who is either too lax or too careless to do his business properly, is not in a position to rob his more hard-working and more intelligent neighbour of the fruits of his work and organisation.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, eggs will not be allowed to leave the Free State, except in small parcels, unless they have been tested, graded and packed in premises registered by the Ministry of Agriculture for this purpose, and no premises will be registered unless they are suitable and are properly equipped for the business of an export trade; that is to say, unless they are kept in a state of cleanliness; unless they are graded, and unless the premises have the appliances necessary to enable the testing, grading and packing to be properly carried on.  This is not going to be an expensive Bill on the exporter.  It never was a good excuse for inefficiency in this trade that the particular exporter was only in a small way.  Cleanliness in the premises and in the packing costs nothing and the appliances required are of the simplest and most inexpensive kind.  There are ample powers of examination and inspection of officers of the Ministry, and there are substantial penalties provided for contravention of the provisions of the Bill.  The industry, it is hoped, will benefit by this legislation, and it is being asked to contribute a fair proportion of the cost. Arrangements are made under which each exporter will pay an initial registration fee of £1, and an annual fee of one penny on each complete thirty dozen eggs.</P>
    <P>As already stated, we have concentrated our efforts on the exporter.  It would be impossible to deal with all <Col N="1546" /> wholesalers.  There are too many small wholesalers, and while we might take power to regulate their trade, it would be impossible to administer these regulations. Moreover, the exporters are the principal wholesalers for the internal trade, and we regulate their trade, whether it is internal or external.  All exporters will be required to observe the same regulations as regard testing, grading and packing for the home trade as for the export trade, and finally, it is made an offence for anyone in the country to seal or expose for sale any dirty eggs or eggs unfit for human consumption.  Less than one-third of the eggs produced in Ireland are consumed at home.  The industry is mainly an export industry, and it is quite certain that if the export trade, which represents the greatest volume of the industry is set right, the balance will automatically become right also.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been prepared in consultation with the Associations, which number about half a dozen, which represent the trade, and they are in agreement with us in regard to the main lines of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In provision 5 (d), line 50, to delete the words &ldquo;three years next before the 3rd day of April, 1924,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;year next preceding the happening of the event which gives rise to the claim for compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to meet a possible contingency. <Col N="1547" /> Provision 5 (d) reads: &ldquo;for the purpose of the calculation of the compensation under this schedule the remuneration and emoluments of an existing officer or servant shall be taken to be the average amount of remuneration and emoluments received by him from an amalgamating or absorbed company during the three years next before the third day of April, 1924.&rdquo; If we consider the possibilities in respect, say, to the Railway Clearing House, whose work will be greatly increased for the next year or two, then there may be, as a direct effect of the application of the Bill, a redundancy; but notwithstanding the position a man may have arrived at by the time of his dismissal, he is only to be taken as having earned the average of the three years prior to 1924, notwithstanding that his dismissal may only have arisen after two or three or four years of extra work which directly arises out of the activities consequent on the Bill.  Hence the proposal to substitute the one year next preceding the occurrence which leads to the claim being made, the year preceding the dismissal if we speak in plain terms.  I think it will be apparent that there are possibilities in the case I have mentioned, and possibly in other departments, where the redundancy will not be found until a period has elapsed, perhaps in the case of the Clearing House two or three years hence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe it is only just and fair that compensation should be calculated not at the date of the introduction of the Bill, but at the date when a man is dispossessed from his employment, and, therefore, compensation should be payable on the basis of the year preceding the happening of the event which gives rise to the claims for compensation.  This schedule is intended with modifications to apply to Ireland the provisions of the third Schedule of the British Act.  Evidently an error has been made in the drafting of the Irish Act, as in Great Britain the compensation is based on the final year's salaries and emoluments.  If the Minister agrees that it is an error <Col N="1548" /> in draftsmanship, I hope, for the reasons stated, that he will agree to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point in the Clause which seems to have escaped notice.  As drafted it was intended to meet the cases of men who have been appointed permanently after the Government had suggested only temporary appointments were to be made.  To meet that particular type of case this Clause had to be drafted. You then had to take the average of three years.  That would ensure that appointments made for some time back after the suggestion had been made that permanent appointments should not be made, would be ruled by this three years' clause.  That was the intention of the sub-section.</P>

      <P>I think it is carried out; I am not quite sure that it does not go further.  I would prefer to hold this over for further consideration; it is intended to meet the particular type of cases I have mentioned.  I think there will be no disagreement that it is a proper clause for a particular type of case; it does appear to me to go beyond that case, and it would rule the ordinary man and not exceptional cases.  Would the Deputy consent to withdraw the amendment and to have this point considered on Report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that if this clause is allowed to stay as it is the ordinary man would be ruled by it, and I am seeking to avoid that.  I think the clause, as drafted, goes beyond the exceptional case.  We shall have to consider how the ordinary man is affected by it and what is the attitude with regard to the ordinary man, and I suggest therefore that it had better be left over for the Report Stage.</P>

It comes to this, that certain claims shall be considered; that is the effect of it.  I do not think that that advances the position very much.  The fact of the matter is that appointments should be decided by merit, and if the company is not going to allow merit to weigh with it as a consideration this amendment does not advance the position one step; it leaves things very much as they were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has not given any good reason as to why a direction of this kind should not be included in the Bill.  There is a general fear amongst the staffs employed in the comapnies to be absorbed, and in one particular company that apparently has not agreed to be absorbed up to the present in the amalgamation scheme, that they will be placed in a rather prejudiced position <Col N="1550" /> because of the attitude of the directors of their companies in not falling into line with the general demand of the Government in regard to this scheme.  Quite apart from that I think it would be very advisable that a direction of this kind should be given to the directors of the newly amalgamated company so that they may have this to guide them in whatever may happen as a result of the amalgamated scheme being put into operation. It is not an uncommon thing to hear since this amalgamation scheme was first mooted that so and so is to be general manager, and so and so is to be cashier, and so and so is to be accountant, and so and so is to go on the scrap heap for such and such reasons.  I think if you put in a direction of this kind, although it may not have any great effect upon some of the people who will dominate the new company, still it will show that there was in the minds of the Dáil at the passing of this Act a feeling that the directors of the new company should treat their staff fairly and squarely as a result of whatever reorganisation may take place.</P>

      <P>Another aspect of this amendment is that it may go further than the mover intended.  It says: &ldquo;That the respective officers and servants of the amalgamating and absorbed companies shall have equal claims.&rdquo; The men in the lower grade shall have equal claim with men in the high grade.</P>

      <P>Upon consideration. If it is only consideration it means nothing.  If you seek to give a direction or anything of that sort you could give such a foolish direction and they can disregard it.  Equal claims&mdash; high and low, are to be equal.  And on the point generally I come back to what I previously said.  I do not start off. if Deputy Davin does, with suspicion of the amalgamated undertaking, and I do not think it is feasible to insert every possible type of direction that you can give to a body of whom you are very suspicious.  I prefer to have a Bill surrounded by a general atmosphere where equitable and just <Col N="1551" /> claims shall have consideration, and to leave that to the company.  If you start issuing directions to provide against all sorts of contingencies that may happen on the basis that the amalgamated company is not to be trusted, then there will be no end to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The general atmosphere should be charged, it is suggested, with a little aroma of justice and without this general direction, if you like, that flavour may not be present. But the Minister has so faithfully followed the British precedent in the Bill in general that it might be well to inform him that the form of this amendment has in fact been inserted by the amalgamation tribunal in England in some of the schemes of amalgamation that were presented to that tribunal.  This section in its actual phraseology has been transferred from such schemes as passed and were inserted at the instigation of the British Railway.  Amalgamation Tribunal, and apparently it was thought necessary there, and it is believed to have had some good effect there, and because of that it is suggested it may have the same effect here and that it is equally necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, referring to me, started off by assuming that I am generally of a suspicious nature in regard to everything that has been done, especially in a matter of this kind.  I think it was Deputy Bryan Cooper, when speaking in the Dáil some time ago, rightly said that we were living in a country amongst suspicious people.  Suspicion is created by something or other.  It is created in this case, amongst the staffs generally, by a want of confidence that they will be dealt with fairly under the scheme that is to come into operation as a result of this Bill.  If there is that suspicion, and if there is good reason for it, as I think there is in some cases, then I do not see that there is any justification for the Minister not putting into the Bill words of the kind suggested, although he has stated that they do not mean very much.  If they do not mean very much, I do not see how there can be much objection to the insertion of particular words in the Bill.  I have <Col N="1552" /> fifteen or seventeen years' experience in dealing with English and Irish managers, from a staff point of view, and I am sorry to have to say that nowhere have I found a greater suspicion, or one that is more justified, than there is in Ireland as between the staffs and the railway companies.  I am sorry to have to say that.  I hope, as a result of the passing of this Bill, that a new atmosphere will be created, and that the new Railway Lords, charged with the responsibility of making a success of this scheme, will create a greater spirit of confidence than has existed hitherto between the staffs and the companies.  It would be well if we could start off with that new spirit, and if any advance has to be made in that direction, I say it must come from the top and not from the bottom.</P>

      <P>I approach this subject with no suspicion of the good intentions of Deputy Davin in putting forward this amendment.  I unwillingly say, in connection with this Bill, that I intend to support the Government against my friends on the Labour benches.  The Schedule appears to me to afford complete protection of the rights of the staffs connected with all the amalgamating companies, and I do not think, unless the element of suspicion which Deputy Davin introduced into the matter arises, that the amendment is of any particular importance. You know that Labour men and labour generally are not above making use sometimes, to their own advantage, of particular sections, and I can quite imagine certain disgruntled employees making a lot out of this amendment. I do not think it adds anything to the protection of the servants or employees of the company as a whole.  I do think its introduction might work against what Deputy Davin is advocating: the spirit of harmony that he proposes to introduce when this Bill is passed.  I am not so clear that this Bill will do anything in that direction. However, I hope that my anticipations of the Bill as a whole will be disappointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have from the Minister a statement for the purpose of reassuring some of those railway employees who are suspicious that &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo; does as a matter of fact include not only clerical staffs and the higher grade officers but employees in general.  It seems so obvious that it should not be necessary to make a pronouncement on the matter, but I invite the Minister to make quite clear that this term, &ldquo;officers and servants,&rdquo; means officers and servants.</P>

      <P>Following what I said last night on the subject of the shopmen, I had in preparation an amendment to make this matter clear which I had hoped to have ready for the Committee Stage and which the Minister is ready to keep open for the Report Stage.  The trouble, I understand, is that shopmen say that, according to usage, the term &ldquo;railway servant&rdquo; does not include them.  Here the phrase is &ldquo;any existing officer or servant,&rdquo; and their fear is, if the matter came to be construed by a court, that the established interpretation of the expression &ldquo;railway servant&rdquo; might be held to exclude them.  I understand that is not the intention.  There is an amendment in preparation for the Report Stage which I understand the Minister will favourably consider and which will make it quite clear that shopmen are included in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>The explanation given by the Attorney-General will, I think, meet the point raised.  It seems to be generally accepted that the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; means every employee in a railway company.  Such is not the case. &ldquo;Railway servants&rdquo; applies simply to those who are employed in the running of trains, such as drivers, firemen, etc. Shopmen are distinct, and apparently are not included in the Bill in that respect. Shopmen are the men employed in the manufacture and maintenance of railway rolling-stock and roads.  As to the roads, there is a section of men, such as chairmen, who would also require to be included within the term &ldquo;shopmen.&rdquo;  If that were provided for I think it would satisfy the employees in the various railway works that they are being included.</P>

      <P>The chairmen and permanent-way men referred to by Deputy Doyle are, without doubt, included within the scope of this particular <Col N="1555" /> Schedule.  If it will ease anybody's mind that I should make a statement now, irrespective of what the Dáil may afterwards pass on the Report Stage, I may say that it is my intention to have &ldquo;employees&rdquo; in the widest sense taken as the basis of this Schedule.  The words &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo; were put down because it was thought that they included all types of employees. <Col N="1556" /> However, if an amendment is coming forward to make explicit what I believe to be implicit in this Schedule, it will be favourably considered on Report.</P>

    <P>* Service Terminals not to be charged when work is performed by consignor or consignee.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister will rule this out of order as being technical, but the object is to simplify the rates so that the ordinary public may know exactly what they are being charged for the carriage of goods.  In the Schedule itself there is a charge first for so many miles, which is not specified, then for the next so many miles, and so on. What I wish is that the charge be stated for the first 50 miles, so that a trader will be able to calculate without going to the railway company to know what the carriage on his goods will be.  If my amendment be adopted it will be possible for Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good to be in a position to say exactly what the carriage will be on any goods they may be selling.  If they rely on the railway rates they will always be in a mist.  As nearly every article which is being sent by rail will be going a distance of 50 miles or over, I think there is a good deal to be said for the amendment.  With regard to the animal classes, I wish that the farmers should know what they are being charged per head, per half truck or per truck for the carriage of animals. If we have to go on the Schedule in the Bill it would be difficult to know what is being charged.</P>

    <P>* Service Terminals not to be charged when work is performed by consignor or consignee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather amazed to find that I have been ruling things out of discussion.  I suppose what the Deputy means is that there are certain things which I have refused to consider because they were highly technical, and I urged that they were matters for the Tribunal which is to deal with these technical things, and not for this Dáil, intelligent as its members are.  I do urge that argument here. This is a very technical matter.  I go further and say the amendment is going to defeat certain objects that the Party, of which Deputy Wilson is a member, has set before it.  He is going to rule out a very important principle upon which these charges depend, what is known as the tapering principle. That decides that the charge per mile decreases as the distance increases.  Deputy Wilson's amendment would make the same rate for the first fifty miles, or part thereof.  That is to say, he would not have this graduated application of the tapering principle.  If Deputy Wilson will look at the Schedule which he seeks to defeat by his amendment he will see that the mileage is left blank.  That is to say, we have left an opportunity for Deputy Wilson's Party to go before the Tribunal and argue this point.  We have not in any way prejudiced any application that may be made by giving directions to the Tribunal, and we do not ask the Dáil to express any opinion.  These are specimen forms in the Bill, and are to be implemented as a result of argument before the Tribunal by interested parties. No doubt Deputy Wilson will make his case there with great vehemence. It is not for the Dáil to determine technical matters of this kind. These are specimen forms to form the basis of discussion, and it is for the expert tribunal to decide the point which Deputy Wilson puts forward for consideration now.</P>

      <P>Is not the main consideration that a man when paying freights should know what they are based on?  He should know that the freight would be so much per ton per mile.  If a person goes into a shop to buy goods there is no such thing as a <Col N="1559" /> tapering rate.  On the score of simplicity, I maintain that merchants who are members of the Dáil ought to support this amendment, as it will enable them to know railway charges and rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson has put forward his amendment on the grounds that he aims at a simplification of the tables submitted in the Schedule.  There is not very much difference between Deputy Wilson's form and the one in the Schedule, except that in his there are less columns. The general outline aimed at is one of elasticity in connection with the control and management of railways.  The Committee ought to be quite clear that the handling of goods by railway companies does not necessarily, nor as a rule, depend on mileage at all.  There are various considerations operating in connection with the fixing of a rate. Supposing you take a distance of 50 or 100 miles, and that the consignor was prepared to send large loads, say hundreds of tons, which is usual in many cases, it is certainly to the interests of the railway company that a large volume of traffic should be sent, and the inducement is often made by the railway company in the form of concessions for long hauls and heavy loads.  When you come to stereotype tables on the basis of mileage, such tables do not appear to me to deal with the big question at all.  That is largely my criticism of the working of this Bill.  I suppose the tribunal must have latitude in coming to decisions in matters of this sort as regards the different rates for different articles, but when the tables are compiled they will be very complicated, and much more so than in the case of the individual railways that operate at present.  The individual railway has a very considerable amount of latitude to-day in dealing with the volume of trade in which it is particularly concerned.  I think this proposal is not going to help traders very much when there is no real latitude for meeting special cases in a special way.  It may be said that it is not desirable that there should be special cases and that the charges should be operated on a sort of flat rate where no one is going to get an <Col N="1560" /> advantage over his neighbour.  Business cannot be carried on on these lines because the volume of traffic must not only be beneficial to the man able to handle the big volume of traffic, but also beneficial to the railway company that arranges to carry it.  Economy of working is very necessary.  The Minister for Finance deplored recently the number of small parcels that came into the Free State.  In the same way, if a railway is going to operate on a basis in which it does not matter whether a man sends a big or a little parcel, as he is going to be charged pro rata, that is bad for the railway company and bad for trade generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping we would hear from Deputy Wilson or Deputy Hewat the reason for the recommendation in respect of the fifty miles radius, which is taken as the standard, and I take it there would be a gradual reduction in the price.  We have heard no reason why that should be done.  I do not know whether either of the Deputies has ever seen the rates book belonging to the railway companies.  I understand it is exceedingly complicated, and I observe that Deputy Good, who is supposed to be the last word in wisdom, in this matter especially, nods his head in a sort of mute acquiescence in what I say about that.  He has, apparently, some experience of it.  With regard to this question of stereotyping, in a way different from what we propose that the tribunal should do, I should certainly deprecate that.  The tribunal will certainly require to be expert, expert in its knowledge of the subject itself, expert in its analysis of the charges that should be made, and expert in its comprehensive survey of the needs of the country.  I think Deputy Wilson, having regard to the amendment that was down previously and which would seek to give advantage to that particular profession or calling he represents here so ably, would defeat his own purpose were he to press this amendment, or at least he would endanger the purpose of the previous amendment which sought to give a preference to agriculture.  The economic condition of the country is one of the considerations the tribunal <Col N="1561" /> will require to have in its mind.  I do not know if one fixed the fifty mile run as a standard that that would suit the precise interests of the agricultural communities.  I learned, in the matter of housing, that there was always a mean in the matter of the size of a house, and below that size one did not get value for the money, and above it one had to pay a little more than might otherwise be charged.  That is what is sought to be set up in this matter of the fifty-mile run. Has it been considered from the point of view of the mean?  If so, I would have no objection to accept that part of the amendment, but I think in the absence of expert information on this point that the Dáil would be ill-advised to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>After the speech of Deputy Hewat, which professed to help me but left me worse than I was in the beginning, and after the President's <Col N="1562" /> remarks also that it is a technical matter, I have only to say that the outstanding feature I had in my mind was the mean of an average run, and it is calculated on that, but as it is so technical it might not be a very good thing to tie the hands of the tribunal, and I am willing to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In line 7, before the words &ldquo;traffic department inspectors,&rdquo; in the group &ldquo;supervisors,&rdquo; 3rd column, to insert the words &ldquo;traffic controllers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be asked if I could point to any particular place where traffic controllers are at present employed, and to be quite candid, I say I cannot. But the designation of railway officers and servants, and their classification, is so difficult to determine and so often changed, that if it is more convenient or cheaper for a railway company to designate one of its employees who to-day may be a stationmaster or supervisor, a traffic controller, then we have no doubt the officials of the company would do so in order to lighten the burden of their finances.  It is <Col N="1564" /> thought desirable that this particular body of traffic controllers should be catered for, and in the absence of any good reason to the contrary, I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>&ldquo;To amend Part II. by altering the figures &lsquo;1934&rsquo; where they first occur to &lsquo;2023.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this I feel I am at a disadvantage, because when the amendment of mine referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan was under consideration yesterday I had to be elsewhere, and I asked Deputy Hewat to be good enough to move it for me.  When I came back I asked him what success he had met with, and he said that he got up, but he did not understand it, and he added that neither did the President understand it.  I am sorry that I was not here to try and make the Dáil understand it, though when two such expert accountants as the President and Deputy Hewat could not see the object of it, I am afraid my poor efforts would have been unavailing.  However, the point arises to some extent under this amendment.  It proposes to amend Part II. by altering the figures 1934 where they first occur to 2023.  Now, the object of that amendment, A Chinn Comhairle, is that instead of limiting the contribution of the baronies which will be paid to the Minister, and by the Minister to the amalgamated company &mdash;instead of limiting that contribution on the part of the baronies to ten years as the Bill proposes, this amendment seeks to extend that liability on the part of the baronies up to a period of 99 years.  When we were discussing in the early stages of this Bill the liability of the baronies it was pointed out that in addition to limiting this liability to ten years, as I have pointed out, the whole amount of the losses accruing from the working of the baronial railways was estimated by three of the amalgamating companies; and in their statement they say that it is only an estimate, but that it is a carefully considered estimate; and they estimate the losses on these undertakings at £90,000 per annum.  Of that loss the Government proposes to contribute £48,000 for a period of ten years; and the balance of £41,000 is to be made up by the amalgamated company, and that after the period of ten years that contribution from the Government of £49,000 and the liability for it practically ceases, and the whole liability is then to be borne by the <Col N="1566" /> amalgamated company.  Now, that strikes one as being rather unfair to commercial interests, because it is obvious that liabilities which should in the ordinary way be borne by the ratepayers concerned are transferred at the end of ten years to the backs of the amalgamated company.  I have yet to understand why it is fair in the first place to burden commerce to this extent. No reason has been given why it is a reasonable attitude to adopt.  But apart from any question of reasoning, it appears to me to raise a rather important and dangerous principle&mdash;that is, the lifting of the liability off a series of areas and transferring that liability on to the amalgamated undertaking. These liabilities were undertaken by these baronies with the full knowledge of their responsibility; and if these enterprises have turned out unsatisfactory in these areas, that is no reason why they should not be called upon to carry on the burden arising out of an unsatisfactory enterprise in which they are engaged.  Yet, that is the principle that this Bill sets up.  Now, arguing from that point of view yesterday afternoon in connection with the Dublin and Blessington Tramway, or Railway&mdash;I am not sure which it was called&mdash;I am not sure that it was not called both&mdash;Deputy Johnson pointed out, and I think very properly, that you had done certain things for certain baronies, and that you had done nothing for others.  That is a fair argument, and that is a fair inference to draw from the principle that this Bill sets up.  There is no reason if you are going to relieve liability in one barony why another barony should not come forward and say to you: &ldquo;What are you going to do for us?&rdquo;  And once you enter upon that line of argument there is no reason why it should be confined to baronies, why it should not go to other areas.  There is no reason why people in the municipal area in which we live at the moment should not come forward and say: &ldquo;Why don't you do something for us?  Why, for instance, don't you take off us the liability that we are under for losses in connection with the Stanley Street Workshops?&rdquo; Once you get to this argument there is no end to which it could not be applied and applied with reason.  Therefore, I <Col N="1567" /> hold that it is unfair to relieve these baronies of this burden at the end of ten years and, as I said, cast the burden on to the backs of the amalgamated group.  Therefore, I propose this amendment that the baronies should continue to give their contribution for a period of 99 years, and that instead of the liability becoming extinct, as the Bill proposes, at the end of ten years, it should continue altogether for a total period of 99 years.  And I move accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I owe Deputy Good an apology for some of the insinuations I uttered yesterday in connection with the motion standing in his name.  And I must say that, for my part, I realise the ability with which Deputy Hewat dealt with it.  I think Deputy Good did not give him any instructions, and I relied upon my memory, which is not perhaps the last word in reliability, in the matter of figures.  I understood that the amendment yesterday proposed to increase the payment which we have set out in the Bill by 50 per cent.  I believe I may have misled Deputy Hewat, and I want to apologise to him, because I assured him yesterday that the amendment would not effect the purpose that he had in mind.  But I think now that it would, and it is due to him that I should say so.  We should deal with the merits of the proposal in the Bill, and to some extent this amendment enables us to do that.  We fixed, for many reasons, on the 1913 burden which was borne by these baronies.  It was taken as a sort of standard year. It was accepted as a standard year by the British Government in the period of control.  And, generally speaking, it would be difficult to get a more normal figure in considering this question of liability.  Two years ago the loss on these undertakings was something in the neighbourhood of £107,000.  Last year that loss was down to £30,000. That is a very remarkable reduction in loss in one year.  The figure which is circulated by the three companies mentioned by Deputy Good is only an estimate after a careful examination. I do not think any businessman would accept a figure surrounded with such <Col N="1568" /> terminology as that.  I think one would be prepared to say that is was &ldquo;more or less.&rdquo;  Deputy Good does not agree with that.  I should like to know what his opinion would be, if he were the person immediately concerned, about taking an estimate of that sort, if he was selling these baronial lines.  The Deputy does not shake his head at that, and therefore I take it that I have scored a point there. These baronial lines were constructed with the guarantee of the persons in question.  And all these persons who were in a position of authority to give that sanction anticipated, I am sure, that there would be some sort of efficient management both in the construction of the lines, in their management, and in their working, and that their liability, although they were prepared to guarantee some sums on the capital and on the working, would never be called on to the extent to which it has been called.  Now, those lines under the Bill assume a new character.  They become part of a unified undertaking.  Yesterday I had to resist from Deputy Hogan a most ingenious amendment, which I think a good deal could be said for.  That amendment suggested that separate accounts should be kept, and that if the losses were reduced, the baronies in question would get the advantage of the reduction, and be called upon to pay a lesser sum.</P>
      <P>I take it the new unified undertaking would scarcely subscribe to that proposition, because of the expense involved in getting the exact figure.  The expense of management, the fact that they were separate undertakings, and all the circumstances of the case, must be viewed in relation to this particular loss of £30,000 last year, which, in the opinion of experts, will gradually become less and disappear.  In these circumstances, and bearing in mind the fact that the baronies have uncomplainingly paid their share in respect of these losses for a great number of years, we think that ten years is a fair measure of time to determine this particular liability on the part of those baronies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success or the non-success of the Stanley Street workshops does not come into this except to this extent: <Col N="1569" /> In the case of the Stanley Street workshops there are overhead charges of a variety and number which would appal Deputy Good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In my time an effort was made to find out the cost of each article.  No business man would do it, because of the expense.  That is what, to some extent, was suggested in Deputy Hogan's amendment yesterday&mdash;this intensive method which would give us particulars of balances and charges and so on, and so enable us to form a correct picture in ten years' time.  The year 1913 was a fair year to fix on.  These liabilities were borne long before 1913.  The advantages to be derived from amalgamation, and the cutting off of all incidental expenses inseparable from the management of thirteen or fourteen or fifteen companies, would unquestionably enable these undertakings to present a very different picture at the end of ten years than they do present to-day.  In any case I think the baronies themselves still regard with horror such an idea as that.  They do serve a purpose to the unified undertaker. They are feeders.  That could not be said for the undertaking we discussed yesterday.  They do contribute some quota to the general advantage of this unified undertaking.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary to go into the question of whether they benefit any concern at all.  Those concerns do bring business, and they do bring advantages to the other railways.  I think that particular advantage was not in mind at the time when the proposition was put up that these particular lines should be constructed.  It is a question of a bargain, a question of weighing up the advantages and disadvantages on both sides, the general trend of affairs, and the fact that these particular out-of-the-way places ought not to be placed at a still greater disadvantage by reason of isolation from big industrial or business centres.  There had to be some consideration for them, having regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole.  I think the proposal in the Bill is a fair and most equitable one which will not burden commerce. <Col N="1570" /> Commerce must remember that this Bill has been entirely designed in the interests of commerce and the business of the country.  I think an examination of the return that is being issued by the Minister, showing the relation of their working expenses to receipts, will indicate that there is room for much more efficient management, and the doubts of Deputy Good with regard to the management of these lines under the unified undertaking will be removed in time, and they will show a better relation to the costs, even though no actual figures are submitted at the end of five or ten years to prove that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather knotty problem, but the amendment as now explained by the originator takes a very different form to what we were considering in another amendment which I passed by as not being quite comprehensible to me.  Deputy Good's amendment objects to relieving the baronies within ten years of the liability which accrues to them under the amalgamation of the railways.  One has to ask why should they be relieved?  Any one of the railways was built for a specific purpose on specific terms, and if this Amalgamation Bill was not before the Dáil, as an ordinary business transaction any one or other of the bigger railway companies might reasonably be expected to absorb lines running with their systems into a bigger system. That is what has been in operation all over the country for a number of years. Why have they not done so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume it is that the terms that could be arranged as between the two companies were not satisfactory to the bigger concerns, taking everything into consideration as feeders to the main line, etc.  At all events, if it is necessary for the Government to come along and say to the railway companies: &ldquo;No matter what you think of this proposition, you must shoulder it,&rdquo; you are calling upon them to shoulder a burden which, commercially, they are not bound to undertake at all.  You place these unsatisfactory baronial railways on the amalgamated railway.  That according to your Bill does not matter to the amalgamated companies because of the financial arrangements which <Col N="1571" /> provide for their receiving a revenue. Consequently, as Deputy Good says, you are throwing the burden on the traders to pay for the loss that accrues on these railways.  The President has said that there is hope, under more efficient management, of these railways doing better. I quite agree with that.  In connection with the amendment that was proposed from the Labour benches yesterday, they seemed to anticipate that with better management the lines would do better, and they claimed that returns should be given to them of better results from the better management. I ask, why has not that better management been put into operation long ago, and who is responsible?  As far as these baronially-guaranteed lines are concerned, I think the people who pay the piper have representation on the railways.  If the loss is due to bad management, surely the baronies, through their representatives, must take the blame for that loss fully and completely. Now, what happens to any undertaking that does not pay its way? Is a railway company, because it is a railway company, in any different position from any other commercial concern? For years the electricity undertaking in Dublin was chargeable on the rates.  If it continued to be a charge on the rates, would it be reasonable for them to call upon the Government to take it over, or get somebody to take it over by compulsion?  I do not think that would be sound, and it would not be entertained at all. Therefore, the proposition compelling the amalgamated company to take over those railways, must be based on some particular aspect of the question, applying to them only, and not on a general principle.  Supposing I built a railway and ran that railway at a loss, commercially, what would happen? I would come to the end of my tether, and in the ordinary business course of events I would go into liquidation.  Somebody would buy the railway company, and somebody, I suppose, would get it at a price at which it would pay them to run it.  In this case, what we are doing is: we are compelling the amalgamated company to take over those baronially guaranteed <Col N="1572" /> railways, run them at a loss, whether it is £90,000 or £30,000 does not affect the principle.  It is only a different figure.  At all events, it appears that the prospect of making a profit out of the railways is very remote, and we are going to make not the whole of the country pay but the commercial community.  You are going to make the commercial people pay for it. Obviously the amalgamated company are not going to pay it out of revenue.</P>
    <P>Whatever the charge will be, it is going to affect the rates at which our goods will be carried through the country. It does seem to me that that needs a very special case made out for it.  I fail to see that there has been a special case made out for it.  Certainly it is a hardship on the baronies to be made pay for what they guaranteed. It is a hardship on any of us to pay debts.  I find it a hardship to pay rates, and I do not see that there is anybody coming along with a kindly spirit that would relieve me from the necessity of paying them.  I do not see where the argument comes in when you say, &ldquo;You big railway companies amalgamate; we are going to saddle you with this, but you are not going to be at a loss, you are to get back the money from the traders, and meantime we will give you a sop towards the expenses of these railways.&rdquo;  I think it is unsound, and, carried to its logical conclusion, would mean a very big thing for the country generally.  I think it would go very far on the road to the Socialism that our friends on the Labour Benches look forward to as the happy climax in which we would all be happy.  We are going to relieve the baronies; we are really going to rob Peter to pay Paul, and do not make any mistake about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat says that the amendment objects to relieving the baronies.  But what does it propose to do?  To fix the burden on the baronies for ninety-nine years, to pay so much for ninety-nine years to the amalgamated company. If the loss is decreased, that does not matter.  The burden must continue for ninety-nine years.  If, as a result of the increase of trade, there is improvement and a gain in the running <Col N="1573" /> of the line, and on all that particular portion of the line, the baronies derive no benefit, and they must pay. This is the moral argument that has been put up by Deputy Hewat, that we have listened to now.  They are quite safe when the baronies are paying for ninety-nine years, notwithstanding the fact that for the past few years there has been a decreasing loss. If you keep to the strict letter of the law, there is only one real alternative, and that is the one that Deputy Hogan put forward yesterday, namely, the setting up of a costing system.  What will be the result of that?  It would be an inducement to continue the inefficiency in the working of the lines.  That would not be good for the amalgamated companies, and certainly not for the baronies.  It would be no use for the management to do that.  Why should they trouble to make an effort at greater efficiency, because they need not do it, being already guaranteed?  What the amendment now proposes to do is not to continue that old system.  What it does is to fix a certain loss on the baronies, no matter what the trade is. The baronies must pay that for ninety-nine years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat seems to have a false conception of the reason the management did not work wonders on the baronially guaranteed lines.  He talks about representation on these baronially guaranteed lines.  But it was the majority that was responsible for the management.  The representation was as three to five.  The five were responsible for the management of the line and for the loss.  I expect they were businessmen, seeing that they were securing a dividend of four per cent. upon the money that they, or the people they represented, had invested in these lines.  Of course, as Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, there is also another reason why the management was not good.  The four per cent. was guaranteed, and the rates had to bear the burden of the loss and also the burden of the dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good is horrified at the idea that any burden should be put upon the unified company.  He does not seem <Col N="1574" /> to think that there was anything horrible in putting a burden upon the ratepayers for 40 years, and to add on another 99 years.  They have borne a severe loss for 40 years, and that burden, as I pointed out yesterday&mdash;and it cannot be repeated too often&mdash;was put upon them by people who were nonrepresentative, absolutely non-representative. If you take the opinion of the people who now do represent the districts through which these lines pass you will find that the concensus of opinion is in favour of taking this burden off.  I disagree with the Government's proposal to keep it on for ten years; it will be unnecessary, because these lines ought to pay for themselves in a shorter time, and that should be found out early, but to impose it for ninety-nine years is a great absurdity.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to discuss the question of Grand Juries at all.  If we were to do so we would need to start earlier in the day.  We are dealing with those obligations that were voluntarily undertaken by the baronies. I do not like to call this matter a blot; it was called yesterday by a member of the Government &ldquo;a blister placed on the back of the amalgamated company.&rdquo; When this blister is exposed we hear other things with regard to these obligations that we have not heard before.  As I understand it, and <Col N="1575" /> I have to be convinced to the contrary, these obligations were voluntary, undertaken by the baronies in order to get these railway enterprises established. When these enterprises have turned out commercially unsatisfactory, they want to get out of the burden. It would be delightful for every commercial man, for other local bodies if you like, to enter enterprises of this character and if they did not turn out satisfactorily, to come to the Dáil with a poor mouth and say: &ldquo;Oh, you must take this burden off us; we went into the enterprises with the best intentions, but unfortunately they have turned out badly.&rdquo;  Then the President comes along as a result of such <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeals, and by means of a Bill like this transfers this blister from the baronies to the back of the amalgamated company, and from the back of the amalgamated company on to the unfortunate commercial community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has dealt, as he did on a previous occasion, fairly fully with this question of the estimates.  This estimate of £90,000 is a figure that has been troubling the President; in fact, I think it was troubling him before the Bill was introduced, and it has been a serious trouble to him all the time that the Bill has been under discussion.  We are informed by three companies, three responsible companies who are parties to this document&mdash;I will give you the whole paragraph so that there shall be no doubt about it: &ldquo;The annual liability&rdquo;&mdash;speaking of the baronially-guaranteed lines&mdash;&ldquo;including interest on capital and loss on working involved in the ownership of the 19 undertakings in question amount, according to a careful estimate, to approximately £90,000, and but little reduction of the charge can be counted on with any degree of certainty as the result of amalgamation.&rdquo; Then they go on to say, in case it should be alleged that I had not read the essential parts of this document: &ldquo;The amalgamating companies are quite willing to undertake the operation of these lines as part of the amalgamated system on behalf of the Government and without profit, but they contended and still urge strongly that in the public interest&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="1576" /> those unfortunates engaged in commerce&mdash;&ldquo;that in the public interest as well as that of the shareholders they should not be called upon to shoulder an actual loss.&rdquo;  These are people who have been engaged all their lives running railways and who know what they are talking about, and when people such as they send out a statement of that character I think we must recognise the knowledge and experience that they have in these matters.</P>
    <P>So much for the estimate.  I pointed out that we were entering on a dangerous and slippery slope in setting up a precedent of this character whereby we removed the liabilities from certain areas and put them on to the backs of commerce.  The President has not given us any reason whatever for embarking on such a dangerous precedent. I hold that it is a most dangerous precedent. He has told us, and I quite agree with him, that the baronies would be horrified at my proposal.  Naturally, if the baronies are going to get rid of this blister at the end of ten years, and my amendment proposes to continue that blister for a further period of 89 years, I would say the baronies would be lunatics if they would not be horrified at my proposal.  It is a natural consequence and there is nothing new in that, I think; in fact, I think that if a similar proposal were put up to the Dáil, sensible men as we believe ourselves to be, we would even be horrified at it.  But because certain areas are horrified it is no proof whatever that the principle is a wise one.  I say the principle is a most dangerous one.  We heard from Deputy Johnson last night, one aspect of it; I am sure in the weeks and months to come we will hear from other Deputies other applications of the same principle, and if we acceded to them in one case how could we refuse them in other cases?  I warned the President that in opening the door to relieve these baronies he is establishing a principle that may lead us into considerable difficulty.  The President says that this will not burden commerce; the President is usually exceedingly logical in his remarks, but I certainly cannot follow him on this occasion, when he says that by placing this blister on the back of the amalgamated company he is not burdening <Col N="1577" /> commerce.  Is the inference of that that there will be no blister?  If there will be no liability attaching to these baronial lines, why touch them at all?  In the opinion of those who are competent to form an estimate on that matter, they are going to be a blister for all time.  They hold that the proposals will be uneconomic, and if they will be &mdash;and nobody has argued to the contrary as far as I have heard except Deputy O'Sullivan, who could see sunshine in the distance&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is to extend the burden on these baronial railways from 10 years to 99 years, and I was pointing out that before the 99 years had expired, Deputy O'Sullivan was arguing that these lines which are uneconomic at the moment, would be economic and producing a profit, and that we had not taken that into account.  I think that was quite in order.  Some of us can possibly only see a number of years ahead, and we see during these years no likelihood of these losses being turned into profit. But Deputy O'Sullivan, with that longer sight of his, can see away into the dark distances where we cannot see, and see those profits that we hope for but cannot see.  The President told us that certain economies were to be looked for.  Doubtless there may be certain economies achieved in certain departments, but where are the economies that are going to set aside £90,000 a year?  Here we have a burden of £90,000 a year placed on the amalgamated companies.  Where are there economies on the other side to cover that additional liability of £90,000?  I want to give as fair a view of this measure as I can.  I have listened very carefully to all the discussions, and we have heard the views of different sections of the Dáil.  Deputy Johnson told us in no unmeasured terms that we need not look for any reduction in railway rates as a result of this Bill; that we need not look for any economies.  The farmers were not so pessimistic, but they were not very optimistic; they told us that things were so bad at present that the Bill could not make them <Col N="1578" /> any worse.  We amongst the independents did not keep our light in any way under a bushel.  We told the Dáil plainly that from our knowledge and experience we were quite sure no reductions would follow as a result of this measure, and it is only on the Government benches that there has been any optimism at all.</P>

      <P>I will try to be brief.  Either Deputy Good is standing on the basis of the present agreement or he is not.  If he is not, what is the high moral tone that he has assumed right through about undermining the foundation of society?  If he is, what justification has he for ignoring the present agreement and permanently fixing this burden on baronies for 99 years.  You cannot stand with one foot on the agreement and with the other foot ignoring it.</P>

      <P>That is the essence of the matter.  We are depriving the baronies of any right to have their accounts audited for 10 years.  That is number one.  I will now proceed to give the knock out entirely to this amendment. As I understand the amendment, if passed, it will come to this, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce gets for 99 years a sum in excess of the amount down in this Schedule by 50 per cent. from the baronies, but where he is to put it has not transpired.  It does not go into the pockets of the new undertaking, and where that infirmity can be corrected, if it is passed on the Committee Stage, I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the position. The passing of this amendment now is no relief to an unfortunate commercial man who is groaning under the heavy rates he has to pay at present, and which three or four years of intense intellectual agitation has not managed to reduce by one per cent. He has produced and evolved a measure which finds no response in the sympathetic hearts of businessmen. He is going to do for them what their activities on their own behalf could not <Col N="1579" /> do for themselves.  Yesterday, at the Chamber of Commerce meeting, they blazed forth on these and other matters. I have not had time to read the report, but in my spare moments I am quite sure that I might possibly be able to amuse myself with the criticisms of the Bill.  What does the proposal come to?  It comes to this.  In equity are we entitled to fix a burden such as this, supposing the infirmities of the amendment were rectified, and it were made fool proof, without knowing what the possible effects on those undertakings will be ten years from now?  Are we entitled to saddle the baronies in question for ninety-nine years with the burden they bore in 1913?  I do not think so.  I do not think it would be just. As to my reference a short time ago to bad management, I would like to correct that to this extent, that the very existence of fourteen of those undertakings, situated, as they are, in various parts of the country, run as public companies, lends itself to a management that cannot be looked upon as perfect, but when they are linked up with one big unified undertaking, which does not mean separate staffs for various matters of management, I think there will be bound to be some savings and limitation of the excessive costs that these companies are the heir to, and that are inseparable where there are fourteen or fifteen undertakings, all away from one another, having no interest in one another, and all having different boards of management, however good the management might be.  Deputy Hewat said if he were the proprietor of one of those undertakings, and did not succeed in making it an economic proposition, he would go out of the business.  That is exactly what is happening here, they are being put out of business.  Is it suggested for a moment that they should be scrapped, that we should close them?  I think that would not be in accordance with modern methods of business.  What is the contribution we are making?  The Government is making its maximum contribution.  The baronies are asked to pay that which they paid in 1913, which they were asked to pay during the war period, <Col N="1580" /> and which was generally looked upon as a fair figure.  The new unified undertaking is to be given the average of its receipts for three years, the three years being 1913 and two other years. Are we entitled as businessmen to subscribe to giving the shareholders a return on an average of three years, of which 1913 is one, and to refuse the same liability in respect of baronies at the same time?  If there were a marked line of difference between these two there should be some grounds for it. With regard to the estimate of £90,000, £30,000 was lost last year in addition to this £38,000, that is £78,000 in all. £90,000 is mentioned, and it is mentioned after a careful estimate.  I put it to any member of that great community in the country which contributes 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country, if he is selling a cow, a horse, or any other animal, is he not going to put its virtues and qualities to a stranger at a much higher valuation than if he were speaking about it to his wife or son?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he is going to buy something does he not reduce the value of it, and is not that always done according to a careful estimate?  I take it that if Deputy Good were buying these baronial lines he would have carefully estimated that there was a loss of about £90,000 on them.  If he were selling them a very different picture would be set forth, and that is really the case in this business: that the unified company naturally discounts the value of these concerns.  It has no interest in them, and it puts the losses at a much higher figure than what they are.  Even those who issued that statement will admit that the careful estimate prepared is an over-estimate, and they will admit further that bringing these baronial railways into the new undertaking is a very different proposition to leaving them outside; that it is a fair bargain&mdash;a ten years' contribution of £48,000, and that at the end of ten years the loss that will have to be borne by the unified company will not be a dead loss.  There is one other thing I wish to say, and it is this: on the Benches opposite there are people sitting who have as much interest in a reduction of rates as the commercial <Col N="1581" /> people.  The commercial people have heard the oft-repeated statement of the Minister for Agriculture, and I am sure they accept it as correct, that 75 per cent. of the wealth of this country is produced by those represented on the Benches on the far side.  I was considering that point of view a few moments ago in my own mind, and certainly the impression left on my mind was this&mdash;that the two representatives of commerce in this House have much more the appearance of millionaires than the gentlemen who represent 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, I think, has spoken to Deputy Good's amendment and, inferentially, to Deputy Good himself in the language of the market place.  In view of the very high-principled argument that Deputy Good used, I think it is worth following on the same line.  Deputy Good disclaimed the insinuation that he was talking the language of the market place, and he feared that the adoption of the proposal in the Bill, and the rejection of his own amendment, would lead to destruction, and that it would lead to the road which he feared Deputies on these Benches would desire to get on to.  He suggested that this proposal in the Bill was something new, because the baronies had, whether with a full sense of their responsibilities or by irresponsible authority or what not, entered into an arrangement to build railways and to give guarantees to the shareholders in these railways.  The Deputy says that they must be kept to their bond, and that if you decide by legislative action to interfere in any way with that bond then you are getting on to the road which leads to national destruction, as though there had never been at any time a coming to the relief of a locality or of a community or part of a section of a community, because of a change in social or economic conditions.  The facts are that these baronies entered into arrangements at the instigation of the Legislature at the time, and those engagements were entered into in view of certain economic and social conditions. <Col N="1582" /> Those conditions have changed radically since.  Relatively, the conditions of railway transportation and local economic conditions in the baronies concerned have changed so much that a great gap has been created and it has to be bridged over by the method contemplated in the amalgamation of these railways.</P>
      <P>The State is now coming to the relief of these baronies, not as something new, not as instigating a new principle at all, but following out a well-established principle.  Deputy Good, I think, will not dissent from the proposition that the congested areas in Ireland have had to be relieved to some extent, or to be specially legislated for, because of special conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different case altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exactly the same case as far as the legislative action goes.  Deputy Good may say that if people chose to live in congested areas they should be left there.  But he will answer that by saying, if the State is to come to the assistance of the baronies, let it do so by direct taxation, and not put a burden on the amalgamated company.  But the amalgamated company is getting very considerable and, as I think, excessive State protection in this Bill.  They are not asked to take over these burdens from the baronies for nothing.  The shareholders of these companies are going to be guaranteed a net revenue equal to the best that they have ever earned.  That is what they are getting for taking over these guarantees on these railways. Again, the Deputy may answer that the companies in taking over the burden will transfer it to the commercial community, and it is on behalf of the commercial community that he objects to this transfer.  I think it would not be difficult to find quite a number of instances where Deputy Good has pointed out that the commercial community, if it has to pay higher charges to the railway companies, will have to transfer those charges to the consuming public.  Inasmuch as pretty well everything that is consumed in Ireland has unfortunately, to be transferred by the railways this new burden that the Deputy speaks of will inevitably have to be borne by the consuming public on <Col N="1583" /> his own argument, so that the difference between asking the State to bear this burden, or transferring it by direct taxation, instead of via the amalgamated company, via the commercial community in the price of commodities, is not very great.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that the principle on which Deputy Good has made his argument is not a new one.  The State does relieve local authorities in view of changed circumstances, and the burden undertaken has not been found impossible to bear.  One might indicate very many examples of a similar kind, but it is unnecessary to go into details.  The arguments of Deputy Good in support of his amendment were in fact an argument against the intervention of the legislature for the purpose of relieving over-burdened baronies in consequence of what he alleges were bargains made in years gone by.  I assert that it is quite a well-established principle that the State shall come to the assistance of localities in special circumstances in relief of burdens which were entered upon in entirely different circumstances. Therefore, we are entitled to do it in this case, and there is no undue hardship on the company because the company is making an especially good bargain by means of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Local Government Bill, 1924.  At the outset I wish to state that the Bill is not intended to be the last word in local government reform. It is not intended as a codification of local government law.  It is a step in that direction, but we will not achieve that result for some time.  There are some principles in the Bill which I consider vital and there are other matters on which I am by no means taking up a cast-iron position.  I expect that Deputies of every Party will be able to contribute a great deal towards the improvement of the Bill in its passage through the Dáil.  This Bill is to a great extent the legislative outcome of two remarkable developments of our modern civilisation.  First of all, the development of motor transport and, secondly of the preventative, as distinct from the curative side of the science of health.  Both these developments have made it necessary that we should change our whole attitude with regard to local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first section I intend to deal with is that dealing with roads.  The road is one of those great fundamental institutions familiarity with which is likely, on the part of some of us, to breed a certain amount of contempt, with the result that we do not always attach to it the importance it deserves. It is, as a matter of fact, an institution <Col N="1587" /> which has an important bearing on practically every activity of our national life.  One of the most striking characteristics of the road is its durability. It survives for centuries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>To this day the traces of the five great roads of pre-Christian Ireland may be still traced without difficulty. This quality of durability has its disadvantages as well as its advantages, for the road that may suit the requirements of one century may be totally unsuited to another.  But when the path is once struck it is extremely difficult to change either its direction or character.  Yet, change it we must if we are to keep pace with the industrial development of other countries. We have reached the turning point in the history of the road.  New instruments of locomotion, greater weight in loads, vastly increased rapidity of transit&mdash;all these are factors which make a change in our attitude with regard to the road a matter of necessity.  This change in our transport system above all demands a change in our attitude with regard to the road.  The parochial point of view is no longer tenable.  We must now look at the road from the standpoint of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time when Rural District Councils were first established roads were not by any means of the same national importance that they are at the present time.  When they were established the railroads were at the peak point of development, and the development of the road had practically ceased since the time of the mail-coach.  The functions of Rural District Councils with regard to roads were originally the functions of the Baronial Presentment Sessions, which were in force prior to the passing of the Local Government Act of 1898.  They were devised to meet the circumstances of that particular period, and for causes which are no longer considered desirable.  At that time the roads were regarded mainly as the concern of the various districts through which they passed, and, as the standard of road construction and road maintenance was at that time considerably lower than it is at <Col N="1588" /> present, the burden of their upkeep was easily borne by the various districts charged with their maintenance.  That fact is to a great extent responsible for our present &ldquo;parish-pump&rdquo; attitude with regard to the roads.  The parochial attitude is responsible for hampering any comprehensive scheme of road organisation and for the continued maintenance of unimportant and unnecessary roads, with the result that Ireland at the present time has a greater number and a lower standard of maintenance of roads than any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>Now, the great age of the roads, that I referred to at the beginning, has not only placed in our way the practical difficulty of adapting obsolete ways to modern invention, but has also left its trace on the law relating to road administration. The present law, determining the powers and functions of the various authorities and the areas to be charged with the expense of carrying out various works, is so confused and so complicated that even its discovery is impossible for anyone except an expert, and when its provisions are eventually hacked out of the various laws, orders, rules and regulations in which they are concealed, the greatest legal skill is required to interpret them.  It follows then from what I have said, first of all, that this obsolete code must be replaced by one more simple that the ordinary citizen and ratepayer can understand. Secondly, that the initiation of policy with regard to roads at present in the hands of District Councils must be placed under the control of the higher authority, the County Council, otherwise we will not be able to get away from this parochial attitude. Thirdly, that district charges with regard to roads should be abandoned.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a new division of roads, first of all, into main roads, which will be decided by the Ministry; secondly, into urban roads (that is, all roads in Urban Districts), and, thirdly, county roads (that is, all roads other than main roads not in Urban Districts). The Urban Council will be the authority for all the roads in its area, and the County Council will be responsible for all other roads in its county. The main roads will be paid for by the county-at-large; urban roads will be <Col N="1589" /> paid for by the Urban District, and county roads will be paid for by the county-at-large, exclusive of the Urban District.</P>
    <P>At the present time a very cumbersome procedure is laid down by, I think, Article 25 (a) of the Procedure of Councils Act before the Minister can approve of a direct labour scheme, and when it is approved it has to remain in force for three years.  It is intended to make those provisions more elastic in the Bill, as the direct labour system of maintaining roads has been found to give great satisfaction in numerous cases, particularly where the roads are being maintained on a comprehensive scale.  The powers of the local authority for acquiring road material, and for draining roads have been amplified, and various regulations with regard to signs and signals are also being introduced.  The new powers of local authorities for the compulsory seizing of land are to apply to land acquired for the purpose of a road.</P>
    <P>With regard to the public health portion of the Bill, that part of it repeals the Ministry of Health Act of 1919, whose application to Ireland was rather illusory, and applies the main provisions of that Act to Saorstát Eireann. This portion of the Bill is mainly concerned with the co-ordinating and centralising of the various health services, with a view to uniformity and greater efficiency.  What are generally known as the public health services of each county, and the local administration of these services, at the present time, are divided up between different authorities&mdash;county councils, district councils, urban and rural, and committees of county borough councils.  The curative side of the public health services is administered mainly by the board of guardians and the county borough councils, while the preventative side is administered by rural district councils. The Temporary Provisions Act took power to do away with boards of guardians.  Most of them have since disappeared, and boards of health have been established in their place.  This Bill will give power to do away with rural district councils which have hitherto been the sanitary units for <Col N="1590" /> their area, and will transfer their sanitary functions, relating both to the curative and preventative side of health, to the county council, which will, in future, be the sanitary unit, except in the case of very large counties. The public health services of the county council will be carried out, in cases where county schemes have been adopted, by boards of health set up under the Act, and they will be known as Boards of Health and Public Assistance for each County District.  The result of the proposals of the Bill will be that the administration of all health services of the county, both curative and preventative, will be under the control of one body&mdash;the County Council. As I mentioned before, power is given to the Minister, in the case of the larger counties, to divide the county into two or more health districts, for each of which a public board of health will be established.  This will apply both in the case of the curative and the preventative side of public health.  For the purpose of administering the Bill a county medical officer will be appointed for each county.  This officer will be a whole-time officer, independent of private practice.  It would otherwise be impossible to get efficient service.  He will have to be an expert in matters relating to the public health, and possess the D.P.H. diploma of public health or sanitary science. This officer will be responsible for supervising, under the County Board of Health, all the health services in his county, such as maternity, child welfare, medical inspection of schools, inspection of midwives, tuberculosis, and the welfare of the blind.  A veterinary surgeon will also be appointed for each county to administer the Dairies and Cowsheds Order, and for the inspection of meat, and by arrangement with the Ministry of Agriculture, for the performance of certain duties in connection with the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The Bill makes the following Acts, which were formerly permissive, mandatory: the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889; Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890; Public Health (Aniendment) Act, 1890, Part III.; Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1907, Part IV.; Tuberculosis Prevention <Col N="1591" /> Act, 1908, Part I.  The effect will be to make tuberculosis and the more serious infectious diseases compulsorily notifiable, and to apply certain sanitary provisions and measures for preventing the spread of infection, which are now operative in certain parts, to the whole of the Saorstát.  Provision is also made for the establishment of Consultative Councils for advising and assisting the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some of the criticisms of this Bill in the Press made it appear as if these Consultative Councils were to be set up in connection with every local authority. They are only to be set up to help and advise the Minister in matters relating to public health and in such matters as formulating a definite scheme of State medical service, and for matters of that kind, which may concern us later on.</P>
    <P>With regard to superannuation, the present law dealing with superannuation is very obscure and complicated, and in one case at all events is grossly unfair to the ratepayers and employers. This state of affairs is largely the result of the introduction of amendments in various enactments to cover specific instances, without taking sufficient care or precaution to secure co-ordination of methods.  At a later date it may be advisable for us to introduce a measure of contributory superannuation similar to the Lunatic Asylums Act of 1909, but at present it would be impossible to introduce such a scheme.  The present Bill takes the initial step of codifying the law with regard to superannuation, and removing some of its more glaring defects.  The general effect of these proposals is: first of all, the code is to apply generally to all officers of local authorities, with the exception of officers of Committees of District Lunatic Asylums, who come under the provisions of the Lunatic Asylums Act of 1909.  Compensation is only to be granted for whole-time officers and to medical officers.</P>
    <P>At present medical officers carry on private practice, as well as attending to their public duties.  Notwithstanding this fact they are allowed pensions and it is considered advisable to continue that practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In order to facilitate the transfer of officers from one local authority to another, officers are to be allowed to reckon for compensation purposes continuous service under the different local authorities.  It is considered that it will be a considerable benefit to the public administration if experienced and capable officers can complete for positions under different local authorities without losing their pensionable rights.  When an allowance is granted by reason of incapacity, provision is made that where the incapacity ceases the officer may be reinstated and the allowance discontinued. In the case of non-compulsory retirement, compensation can only be granted in the way of allowance, and the maximum amount is as many sixtieths of the yearly salary and emoluments as the officer has years of service. In the case of compulsory retirement a gratuity or lump sum may be given where the officer has less than 10 years' service.  Where he has more than 10 years' service, he has to get an allowance which shall not be more than two-thirds of his yearly salary and emoluments.  In any case where an officer is dissatisfied with the compensation given he has six months to appeal to the Minister who may grant what he considers fair.  The main provision of the miscellaneous portion of the Bill is that the Minister shall have power to declare vacant the seat of any member of a local authority who shall become disqualified or who forfeits his seat through absence, and if such a person acts as a <Col N="1593" /> member after he has been disqualified he is liable to a fine of £20.  It is proposed to throw on the secretary or chief executive officer of each local authority the responsibility for objecting to any act which may result in unnecessary, illegal, or extravagant payments.</P>
      <P>In such a case the names of the persons who voted for or against the measure: that is under discussion, or who abstained from voting, are to be recorded on the minutes, and the auditor, in the case of such neglect or such misconduct, will surcharge not as heretofore the person accounting, but any member or officer that is present.  With regard to surcharges, when a member is surcharged, after the passage of this Bill, he will be disqualified from acting as a member until he has paid his surcharge, or until the next election, and in case of appeal the disqualification is to date from two weeks after the order determining such appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal Committees set up under the Bill are, as I have mentioned, Boards of Health, District Committees or Joint Committees of Lunatic Asylums. The members of those committees will also be members of the county council.  If the duties of those bodies are to be carried out efficiently, it will mean that those members will have to attend very constantly.  This will entail considerable expense on those members, and it is accordingly proposed to pay the expenses of such members where they have attended three-fourths of the meetings of those bodies, the amount of payment for expenses to be computed according to the distance that each member lives from the county council or local authority.  A simplified procedure is laid down in the case of the compulsory acquisition of land for the purposes of public health or local government, mainly in connection with land acquired for the purposes of sewerage, and waterworks, and of roads.  At the present time the procedure is very tedious, involving a Provisional Order, which has afterwards to be confirmed by a Private Bill.  No person can hold an office of profit under a local authority who is also a member of any local authority in the same county.  The temporary provisions which are in force at the present time <Col N="1594" /> enabling a Minister to hold an inquiry and to dissolve a council and to have its powers and property transferred, are made permanent under the Bill. Power is also given to reorganise various districts where the councils are not efficiently performing their duties, or where the councils themselves so desire.</P>
    <P>The question of the officers of councils whose duties have been transferred has received special attention.  They are to be treated as if they had been originally officers of the county council, and for the purposes of compensation, in the case of any of them who have been dismissed, their service under the previous local authorities is to be taken into consideration.  During the conflict with the British authorities here in Ireland, as part of the policy of making British law impossible in the country, certain local authorities got orders to surrender the leases and tenancies under which certain courthouses were held.  That was intended to be purely a temporary measure.  But since then difficulty has been found in some cases in getting those courthouses back for the local authorities.  And this Bill, accordingly, provides that such local authorities may acquire those courthouses under the same conditions under which they were formely held, except in cases where those courthouses had been purchased in the meanwhile <i>bona fide</i> for valuable consideration.</P>
    <P>Now, in the Bill I have not said very much about the abolition of rural district councils, mainly because their abolition is really conditional and consequential on the vital provisions of the Bill.  If the main provisions of this Bill are accepted the functions of rural district councils really disappear. There is no further use for them.  And if they are to be kept on, and if the main provisions of the Bill are to be accepted, those local bodies will serve no other purpose save that of ornament. The cost of electing rural district councils throughout the country is something like £65,000, and the cost of their staffs amounts to £85,000 per annum; and we consider this is rather a high price to have to pay for rural district councils, if we are only to keep them as ornaments.  As a matter of fact, it is a clear choice between the <Col N="1595" /> reform of local administration, between the more efficient and more economic operation of local administration, and the rural councils.  You cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs; and if you are going to reform local government you will have to do away with rural district councils.</P>

      <P>I waited long and very patiently for the introduction of this Bill.  Eighteen months have elapsed since I introduced a discussion on the subject of the necessity for an improvement in the public health.  I desire at once to congratulate the Minister on the fact that he has taken his courage in his hands and introduced a Bill which will be of far-reaching beneficial effects to the community. I have not the slightest doubt about that, and I am going, therefore, to give my heartiest support to the second reading of the Bill, subject to certain modifications which necessarily will be made during the Committee Stage.  I am, of course, sorry that we have not a Minister of Health.  It is no disparagement to the Minister for Local Government to say that he knows nothing about public health any more than it would be disparaging if he told me that I know nothing about legal procedure, which would be the truth.</P>
      <P>I regret he did not see his way to inaugurate a State medical service. Such a service was recommended by various commissions and at various meetings of delegates of medical men. That, perhaps, will come in a short time, and will probably make for still more efficiency than probably this measure will tend to make for.  I sincerely hope that for the sake of efficiency this State medical service will not be thrown into the background altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with a little matter just before I discuss the provisions of <Col N="1596" /> the measure.  At the present moment the Ministry of Health in Great Britain is extremely interested in the conditions under which food is produced in this country.  I say that a statement of fact; it is not anything that arises from my imagination.  So interested is the Ministry of Health in Great Britain in the production of such articles as butter, that there is a serious risk, if better public health conditions are not observed in the production of food here, that there may be prohibition against the introduction of that class of food, and I say quite deliberately, as far as the creameries are concerned, that there will require to be a very great improvement in the conditions under which they are worked.  I hope all that will be set at rest when we have the officer who is to be appointed under this Bill, namely, the County Medical Officer of Health.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, there are four main proposals in it in which I am particularly interested.  The proposals with regard to public health are that for the future the county councils are to be the local authority for all matters relating to public health.  I am extremely pleased that the sanitary functions have been taken from the urban councils and placed in the much larger and wider body, the county councils.  The second point of interest is the formation of consultative councils to advise the Minister.  He referred this afternoon to the fact that certain of the public Press have taken up the idea that this meant that in each county there was to be a consultative council formed to give advice.  But these consultative councils are to be formed to advise the Minister himself. I shall refer to that later.  The third point is the formation of the county boards of health which will be the controlling factors of all public health activities and organisations.  The fourth is the appointment of the county medical officer of health, who will be independent of private practice, who will be specially qualified for this work, and who will, I hope, have practical experience as well in the work that he is undertaking to do.</P>
    <P>I need not force this point too strongly, but it has been obvious for the last 25 or 30 years that the medical <Col N="1597" /> officer of health who was in private practice and whose patients were his masters, could not interfere in discouraging nuisances and other things, because if he did he would lose his patients.  Under this new scheme the medical officer of health will be absolutely independent of private practice, and I say this, that the more perfectly this man will do his work and the better officer he is, the less likely is he to be <i>persona grata</i> with the people in the county with whom he is finding fault.  I shall make use of that in advocating something later on.  Now the Ministry of Health Act of 1919, as the Minister points out, is to be repealed. There is only one section of that Act referring to Ireland, and there are only two parts in this section.  The first part dealt with matters that were to be handed over or transferred to the Minister for Health, and pointed out all the duties that he had to perform. The second part of this section dealt with the formation of Consultative Councils.  The class of people who were to be put upon the Consultative Councils were specified very particularly. One of the objections that I have to the section dealing with this matter in the present Bill, is that the matter is left very much too loose.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the medical profession a shock a short time ago when he replaced a very efficient officer or official in connection with the Midwifery Board by a man who knew nothing whatever about the Midwifery Board or anything connected with it.  Now I am afraid in his attempt to form this council, without knowledge, he may put on it a specialist for throat and nose diseases who would know nothing with regard to midwifery.  That is one of the reasons why I object to this clause, and I would rather he specified the definite class of people he intends to put on the council.  Because, as I said before&mdash; and I must apologise for saying it&mdash;the Minister knows nothing about public health, and unless he is able to get advice from independent men who know their business the public health conditions will not improve.</P>
    <P>Now I come to another matter which is engaging the attention of several of the Deputies.  There is no mention whatsoever <Col N="1598" /> made in the Bill with regard to the medical inspection of school children. That was not one of the duties that was imposed by the Ministry of Health Act, 1919, upon the Minister for Health.  The words of the 1919 Act have been transferred verbatim into this Bill, and the inspection of school children was not mentioned in the 1919 Act.</P>
    <P>It is not mentioned in the present Bill, and the reason is that there is no suggestion that this Act should be repealed&mdash;that is, the Public Health and the Medical Treatment of Children Act.  It never was put into force in this country.  But the Act is still there, and I am quite sure that my reading of the circumstances will agree with what the Minister will be able to state with regard to them, namely, that this Act is in abeyance for the present, and that as soon as the County Boards of Health are established and County Medical Officers of Health appointed, the provisions of this Act, which are still in force, will be put into working order.  If it were not so, if I did not think that that was a proper reading of the Bill, I should urge very strongly the insertion of some words relating to the medical inspection of school children.</P>
    <P>There are certain suggestions that have been made to me, and certain suggestions that have occurred to myself, that I should like to make with regard to improving the Bill, and probably amendments will be brought forward at a later Stage with regard to this.  The first proposal that I have to make, I have no doubt, will receive support from a certain section of the Dáil.  The proposal in the Bill is, &ldquo;the entire health service shall be paid for by the county council out of the poor rate levied upon the county.&rdquo;  My proposal is that only half the health service should be paid out of the local rates, and the other half should be paid out of the Central Fund.  That was a suggestion that was made by the Irish Public Health Council when issuing their report in 1920.  I have already alluded to the Advisory Board, and I think that it would be better if the Consultative Councils were turned into one Advisory Board with larger powers, and have it specified more definitely <Col N="1599" /> what class of people should be put upon this Board.</P>
    <P>A great many people have spoken to me with regard to the fact, that there is nothing in the Bill with regard to the qualifications required for these county medical officers.  The Minister explained very fully that the chief medical officer would be required to have a diploma in Public Health, and I hope certain other qualifications will be required showing that he has a practical training in this matter.</P>
    <P>The superannuation clauses are left to the local bodies to do what they please; in other words, a local body may grant a superannuation to a retiring officer at the age of sixty-five years.  This country has been cursed with Acts that allow people to do what they like.  There are two other Acts which are made mandatory now&mdash;the Notification of Diseases Act and the Prevention of Diseases Act, alluded to by the Minister.  These two Acts have been running since 1889 and 1890, and one rural council as sanitary authority could adopt these if it wished, whereas in the adjacent rural district these Acts might not be adopted, and the greatest amount of hugger-mugger went on with regard to it.  Now, these, I am glad to say, are made mandatory, and I should like to have it made mandatory upon the local bodies to give superannuation where superannuation should be given.  Where an official has given good service and is entitled to superannuation, I would not allow any question to be raised as to whether it should be given or not, and I would ask the Minister to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the three or four clauses in, I think, Section 29.  I would like the Minister to have mentioned also the fact that in certain large areas it might be necessary to appoint an assistant medical officer of health.  Of course that may come in under the rules and regulations, which are going to contain a great deal of material.  There is one other point that I am rather surprised has not been touched at all in the Bill, and that is the adoption of a county nursing scheme.  To my mind, and to the minds of a great many other people, <Col N="1600" /> too, the nursing in the county and in the districts is of equal importance with the medical treatment and the medical inspection, and I should be greatly disturbed if I thought that we were not going, as soon as this Bill comes into force, to appoint a nurse in each district.  There may be some controversy as to whether the nurse should undertake all the duties, but at all events there will be sufficient duties to occupy the nurse, with the Tuberculosis Scheme, the Child Welfare Scheme, and the Maternity Scheme, and the looking after sick children.  Let me say that as far as this contribution being divided between the local rate and the Central Fund is concerned, at least four of these schemes are worked upon that basis at present.  The Tuberculosis Scheme, the Venereal Diseases Scheme, and the Child Welfare Scheme are worked on the basis of a half-contribution from the State, and the other half from the local rates.  I hope that the Minister will not leave out of his mind this question of the nurses.  I am half afraid that it might not be possible to introduce it in connection with the rules and regulations, or that if he left it to the public health boards of the various counties that they might overlook it, and not appoint the necessary nurses.  I do not propose to detain the Dáil any longer at present, except again to offer my sincere thanks to the Minister for the efforts he has made to do what, for the last thirty or forty years, the medical profession has been endeavouring to get from another Government, without success, and I will say now that I shall give him the most hearty support as far as the Bill goes, and I hope at the same time that he will see his way to introduce certain amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that next to the Constitution this is the most important measure that has come before us.  Administration is, I think, almost more important than legislation because administration touches everybody in the community, and everybody feels the results of bad <Col N="1601" /> administration.  I am pleased to hear from the Minister that this Bill is only an outline or a framework and that he is prepared to give the utmost latitude during its passage through the Dáil to enable it to be made to serve the best requirements of the country with the best advice that can be given by those here who are conversant with Local Government affairs.  I hope that the Minister will, at the same time, make adequate provision of time to allow amendments to be considered.  The Bill seems to accept largely the old system of Local Government; it does not strike out on new lines, and as far as I can see, the old system of Local Government, as Sir Henry Robinson, the Vice-President of the Local Government Board stated, was largely a tussle between the central authority and the local authority; it was a continual struggle or a sort of war that went on between them all the time.  He stated that he and his authorities could not allow Local Government to march but had to compel it to shamble.  That has been the state of affairs under the old system.  I think the same state of affairs continues.</P>

Be that as it may, we have here the assistance of three Ministers, each of whom has or should have an expert knowledge of Local Government.  We have the President, who has been connected with Local Government; we have the Minister for Finance, and we have the present Minister for Local Government. Each of these in his turn has had experience that should be valuable to the Dáil and to the Government in endeavouring to secure a system of Local Government that will be what the country needs, and that is to put the administration of local affairs upon a basis that would be sound and safe and a credit to the country instead of what it is at present.  There are proposals in the Bill which I feel will be very unpopular, and one I would deal with, is the proposal to abolish district councils.  That will be a very unpopular proposal.  I cannot say exactly <Col N="1602" /> whether it is absolutely essential in order to secure efficient and economical administration or whether it is that we cannot do anything else.  I would require to hear very strong arguments to justify me in concluding that it is essential that these councils should be scrapped and that the district authority should not have some voice in administration.  As regards these councils it ought to be known and I am sure it is understood that the district councils were the real authorities as regards roads; the county council only had a sanctioning or a confirmatory authority.  The initiation of all proposals for roads lay with the district council and nothing could be done by the county council until that was done.  Then they had to go back again, and with these various ramifications and interminable delays and difficulties with surveyors, the result is that we have no proper road service, and that has been, I suppose, one of the difficulties that the proposal to abolish district councils is concerned with.  However, some other method might be, and I think could be, found to get over that difficulty.  The next proposal in the Bill is with regard to county councils, to increase the number of members. I think that we make such a body a most unwieldy one.  I think the difficulty in all the local bodies is that there are too many members and that it is impossible to get the business of the county done with the large number of members there are on these bodies, where every man has everything to say on every subject, and where it is nothing but a talking machine, with no business done.  I think that instead of increasing the number the aim should be to try and reduce it, If there were half the number they would be more efficient and would give better service to the ratepayers.  Besides, they could represent districts larger than they represent at present, and I think the service would be a great deal better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also that there should be some qualifications required for members of a county council.  I do not think you can take them indiscriminately from the community and put them in to manage the affairs of a county council without their having <Col N="1603" /> some qualifications, because a county council has very important business to transact.  If you take an ordinary man, what would he do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>The nation is on much the same basis.  We are dealing with legislation here.  Administration is still more important, and touches on the immediate lives of the people.  If you have a big business to be managed, you do not put in any person as a director; you must have experts in it. This is a bigger thing than any business concern.  I am not making it a strong reservation, but I am throwing out a hint that some sort of qualification should be required to ensure good administration, and to give the counties some sort of reasonable service.  There is another proposal with regard to roads authorised to be put out of commission. That is a very serious proposal, because, after all, those roads are a service to a great many people in certain districts, and it is likely that those districts are going to be affected. I understand, however, that, although those roads are to be out of commission, at the same time it will be in compliance with the Bill to have some expenditure on them at intervals.  That would solve to some extent that difficulty. It might have been wiser to approach the question of local government more drastically.  This is largely temporising with the business.  I think it is only a sort of patchwork scheme to try to cover over the blots on the present system.  I think if it were more drastic it would be better.  I think if it had been based on schemes such as those in operation in Germany, France, and in many parts of America, it would have been better.  Those things are well thought out in those countries, and are brought to a standard of efficiency there.  If local government was studied and worked on that basis it would make for a much more sensible system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing is that the Minister evidently proposes to train the local bodies to do their work rather than teach them.  I do not know whether <Col N="1604" /> that training will be successful.  I am afraid a tutor is necessary as well as a trainer, and I do not know whether we shall have an efficient system unless some tutorship is imported as well as training.  Officialism should be strictly supervised by some sort of capable supervising authority, and that is an important part of the Bill that should be looked to.  Officials, though they may be good and anxious to do their work, still may develop a form of laxity, and it is impossible for county councils, in the small amount of time at their disposal, to see if those officials are doing the work as they should do it.  I think there should be some form of supervision to see that the work is done in a proper way.  I believe this Bill is capable of amendment, but it will be impossible to give popular satisfaction and workable efficiency. It will not be done by the present Government.  They are not strong enough at the present time, and I do not believe they have at their disposal all the facts that will enable them to do it, much as they should like it to be done.  I am glad to find that roads will be a national concern.</P>

      <P>I did not say, as Deputy Gorey surmises, that the charge was to be a national one.  The roads would be a national concern, and it is on a national basis in that way.  District concerns, after all, are governed, more or less, by the amount of parochial energy that can be imported into the thing, and some parts will suffer and other parts will be fairly well attended to, but, as a national charge, they will all be in a better condition than they are now under the old system. As the Minister says, we have the lowest standard of roads in Europe. That is not much of a tribute to the old system.  Whatever system this Bill introduces, it will be some improvement on the past, in any case, and the confusions of law the Minister refers <Col N="1605" /> to, and the experts that were employed to interpret it, will be all done away with under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Now, as to direct labour <i>versus</i> the contract system.  Direct labour, the Minister asserts, is the best system.  I fully agree with him in that.  I am throughly satisfied that direct labour will be the best system in the interests of efficiency and of the ratepayers, and that it will give the best value as a return for expenditure.  I believe direct labour will be a guarantee of that, if it is properly controlled and managed.</P>

      <P>I am showing where the Bill requires amendment and where it may not.  I hope it will be properly amended in the Dáil to bring it into conformity with requirements. I do not know what the value of those consultative councils is.  I want to know more before I can express an opinion.  I am struck by the proposal for contributory superannuation.  If contributory superannuation can be arranged on a proper basis, it will be satisfactory to the officials and the ratepayers. I think it will be a guarantee to both sides, and will solve many of the problems we have at present on this question.  I think it is one of the most valuable parts of the Bill, and it will have my support.  I am putting down some amendments, and I am glad to find that the Minister in charge of the Bill is giving an opportunity for their being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down thinks the Bill is capable of amendment.  I do not know whether that is intended to be an expression of opinion that the Bill ought to be given a Second Reading or not. It is capable of amendment, no doubt, but whether, in its present form, it will be worth the trouble of amending is a question I am not able to gather has been answered by Deputy McGoldrick. He said there had been some statement made by Sir Henry Robinson to the effect that local government in Ireland had been a constant tussle between the central authority and the local authority in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that we have to make up our minds before going very far with this <Col N="1606" /> Bill as to what the desire of the Dáil is in respect to that question.  Is it desirable that Local Government should be conducted from Merrion Street, and that local responsibility for local affairs should be obliterated, or is it desirable to encourage local authorities to develop that sense of local responsibility, and gradually to minimise the extent of centralised supervision?  It seems to me that we have got to make up our answer to that question before we go far with this Bill, because the Bill in every section of it is a movement towards greater centralisation and the deprivation, in the case of local authorities, of responsibility for the administration of their areas.  Of course, it is distinctly in accord with the policy of the department as at present conducted.  The Ministry of Local Government is quite clearly bent upon centralising administration and on depriving local authorities of the powers which they have hitherto held, and on reversing the principle that has so often been expressed from the Government side of the House that the people have no right to do wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Bill is bringing into concrete legislation the idea that a local authority, the people in a district, have no right to do wrong, while nationally the Government are professing to be fighting against that conception. In actual practice, in administration and in this legislation, they are endeavouring to strengthen the hold of bureaucracy in governing every part of the country from a central government and relieving the local people of their responsibility for local administration; in a general way, reversing the process that government has been following and which I think is desirable that it should continue to follow, that is to say, to devolve upon local authorities the control and the power and the responsibility for the administration of their areas.  I say that we have to make up our minds whether we want a centralised administration, or whether we are to encourage local authorities to bear responsibility and take an interest in the good government of their own neighbourhood. If you are satisfied that greater centralisation, continuously increased centralisation, should be abolished, then <Col N="1607" /> support this Bill, but if you are against that policy, if you think that there should be a steady increase in local responsibility for local administration, then I say that this Bill ought not to be passed in its present form, and that the discussion of it should be deferred, and the whole question should be reconsidered in the light of devolution rather than of centralisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig has congratulated the Minister upon the sections of the Bill dealing with the public health services.  Well I think, his congratulations were cheaply bought. Some of the things in the Bill, of course, are tending towards improvement and to the embodiment in legislation of the recommendations of the public health council, but most of the recommendations of any value are omitted and are not embodied in the Bill, but are carefully left aside. The report of that public health council amongest other things, recommended the unification of local administration, of medical treatment of insured persons and of those unable to pay, and the medical inspection and treatment of school children.  The Bill does not carry out those recommendations.  There is no linking up of the dispensary medical system with the Health Insurance system.  That was recommended, but it is not embodied in the Bill.  As Deputy Sir James Craig said, the Bill does not establish a State medical service which was also recommended in this report.  Neither does it embody the recommendation regarding the subvention by the State of half the cost of the medical service, and it does not set up a health council.  This consultative body by no means fulfills or supplants the recommendation to have a public health council. That public health council was to be entrusted with the general direction of policy in regard to the administration of health services, and of medical services subject, of course, to the Minister.  But this proposal of a consultative council to be called in <i>ad hoc</i> to prescribe for any special questions that might be under consideration, does not by any means meet the requirements of this report.  I say that the Bill fails to do <Col N="1608" /> most of the things of value that were recommended by that report.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the Bill first, in regard to its treatment of road administration, and secondly, regarding health.  I think there is much to be said in favour of the Minister's view regarding the change in the responsibility for road administration, road care and government.  This Bill, does not alter the responsibility for what might be called national roads, which are obviously, in view of the modern developments of locomotion which the Minister spoke of, not a county responsibility but a national responsibility, and if the Minister's contention as a justification for the change suggested in the Bill is true it calls for much more radical treatment than the Bill proposes.  All that the Bill proposes to do is to transfer responsibility for roads within a county from the rural district council to the county council.  How, I ask, is that going to meet the requirements that the Minister himself says the new methods of locomotion have brought into view? Trunk roads are not local.  They are obviously matters that should be administered and cared for under a national authority, and though you may devolve upon the county surveyor certain duties in regard to these trunk roads the change that is required is to set up a national road authority and not to do what the Bill proposes, namely, to change the responsibility for the local roads from the district council to the county council.</P>
    <P>There is the extraordinary position of certain main roads running across one corner of a county, leaving part of another county high and dry, for which there is no responsibility and nobody cares, such as in a certain corner of Offaly, running into Westmeath. I am wrong in saying there is no responsibility.  There is responsibility, but inasmuch as another county gets the benefit, or loses the advantage of a certain road, the county in whose area this main road lies will take no responsibility for it because they do not benefit.  It is the other county that it affects.  That is just a little illustration of the necessity for national responsibility for roads in view of the development of locomotion which the <Col N="1609" /> Minister himself has put forward as a justification for the changes in this Bill.  But the proposition that the rural district councils should be abolished because it is proposed to transfer responsibility for local roads to the county councils is to me a great surprise. One would imagine that the rural district councils have not any other responsibility than that of the maintenance of roads.  Let us assume that it is satisfactory to transfer the responsibility for the maintenance of the local roads to the county councils. Are you going to leave anyone in the locality responsible for matters of sanitation, or for public libraries, or for any other of the many local matters that there should be a local authority responsible for?  You are not proposing in this Bill to set up any new authority to be responsible for local matters. I say that is a blot which will be very damaging to the idea of local government.</P>
    <P>You are going to try to centralise in the county councils all responsibility for all local matters.  You are not going to do that effectively.  It is not going to be the efficient administration that is suggested by Deputy McGoldrick. The county council is not going to change except by the addition of two or three people.  Is it contended, after all that we have heard from the Minister, and all that has happened in the office of the Minister, that the county councils are perfectly satisfactory in administration?  He will not claim it, because he has all too often said the other thing; but then the county councils, about which so many complaints have been made, are going to be responsible now for every local matter and for all the smaller matters of primary importance to people in the localities.  If there had been in this Bill a proposal to set up councils to cover the smaller areas, or the parish areas, if you like, I could then understand the principle of why the Minister wants to make changes, but he is proposing first to abolish the smaller local councils and to transfer their authority to the county councils, and then to require that everything done by the county councils shall be subject to his veto and to his approval even more than it has been in the past.  I say that <Col N="1610" /> is retrogressive.  It is a movement towards centralisation and, shall I say, if it were to be justified at all it could only be justified if you were sure of having a central administration which was generally sympathetic, generally liberal in its views, and generally willing to meet local needs and local demands. But, unfortunately, recent experience has shown that you cannot rely upon that kind of centralised administration.  Unfortunately, we have proved that it is possible to have in national government an administration which is harder, more rigid and more difficult to deal with than any centralised administration that the country has hitherto had experience of.</P>
    <P>Now as to the Health Council, or the Health Board, that is spoken of.  What is to be its position?  It is to be set up by the county councils.  It is to be composed of members of the county council, not necessarily representatives of any districts.  Districts may or may not be represented on the Health Board, but once it is set up it is a separate statutory body not responsible to the county council.  The local officer of Health is not appointed by the county council.  The local Health body will put in its claim to the county council for money, but the county council has no further control over its proceedings. Even regulations as to procedure are to be prescribed by the Minister, not by the county council.  The Board of Health may appoint committees, but it does not impose upon the committees that they shall appoint members of the county council who are not already on the Board of Health.</P>
    <P>It may include outsiders who are not members of the Board.  The effect of this is to create a new local public health authority practically independent of the county council, the county council in reality acting as an Electoral College and finding the money Again, we have to decide in which direction we are moving.  Do we intend to maintain the position, that the electorate will elect by direct election these administrative bodies, or is it intended that we should move in the other direction and that there should be elected bodies, who will then appoint other bodies to do the work at second hand, supervised finally, cabined and confined by orders from the <Col N="1611" /> Minister?  I say that it is desirable that we should know where we are going and have a clear view.  This, I suggest, is another illustration of the departure&mdash;the rather important departure&mdash;from the tendency of imposing upon the citizens direct responsibility for the administration and government of their areas.  Bear in mind this Bill is intended to deal with normal periods.  It is not an emergency Bill. We are presumed to be getting back to &ldquo;normalcy,&rdquo; as President Harding would have said.  If we are to get back to that stage, when people will realise responsibility, I say that we ought rather to increase that responsibility and make it more direct&mdash;if possibly personal&mdash;and the more direct the better. But we are going away from that. We are saying: &ldquo;Remove responsibility. Let it be indirect.  Let it be through the county council, which may be far away.  They will only come before you once in three years and they may do what they like in the meantime subject only to the pressure or the veto of the Minister.&rdquo;  There is to be no veto by the citizens.  There is to be no responsibility except at the end of three years.  There is not even the necessity for public meeting or publication of the proceedings under the Bill. In every respect the tendency is to move away from local responsibility towards centralised government.</P>
    <P>There is not in the Bill any mandatory provision which requires a county council, for instance, to set up any other committee except this board of health.  There is no necessity under the Bill to set up a local roads committee, responsible for the maintenance of roads for which the county council is to be held responsible.  There is no general scheme in the Bill providing that the county council shall do its work through Committees made responsible for administrative work. One very serious defect, which I mentioned a moment ago, is that the Bill does not provide that every locality shall be represented even upon the Board of Health.  This County Board of Health is to take over the functions of the old Guardians under both the Poor Law and the Medical Charities Act.  It deals with the treatment of the sick <Col N="1612" /> and preventive medicine generally, as stated by Deputy Sir James Craig.  But it is not confined to that.  It is responsible for the education of children, inmates of workhouses, but it has no contact with any of the other education committees.  It is to deal with the education of pauper children, but it does not touch, and has no responsibility for, technical instruction committees or school attendance committees.  It is responsible for the relief of the able-bodies poor, but it has no connection with any relief works that might have to be set up at some time.  It has charge of the aged poor, but it is not in direct touch with any of the pensions committees under the Old Age Pensions Act.  It is not designed to co-ordinate those functions, and there it fails to do work which a new Local Government Bill might have been expected to deal with.</P>
    <P>I have said that the tendency of the Ministry is to interfere unduly with administrative work, to centralise administration to the very minutest detail.  It is to issue regulations respecting this, that, and the other thing. Everything is to be done subject to the Minister, subject to his veto, and, in most respects, subject to his sanction. To give an illustration of the state of mind of the Ministry regarding the class of centralisation that they think is necessary, there was recently issued to the Board of Health a General Regulations Order.  It is dated the 4th March of this year.  Rules and regulations have been issued under the old regime somewhat similar, at least, dealing with the same matter, but apparently the new Department, like the old, still thinks that a medical officer or a nurse, or a workhouse master or matron is incapable of initiating any ideas at all, or carrying out work as responsible persons.  For instance, the Order details such things as these:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Duties of the Clerk to the Guardians; duties of the Secretary of the Board of Health.  No. 3, to peruse and conduct the correspondence of the Board of Guardians or Board of Health according to their directions, to preserve the same and all orders of the Minister; letters received, together with copies of all letters sent by direction of the Guardians.</P>
    <P>The old Order of the British Local <Col N="1613" /> Government regarding matrons read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To visit all the wards of the females and children every night before 9 o'clock; to ascertain that all the paupers in such wards are in bed, and all the fires and lights therein extinguished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is fairly general.  The new Ministry says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To visit the sleeping wards of the inmates at 11 o'clock in the forenoon,</P>
    <P>not five minutes before eleven or five minutes after eleven, but precisely at eleven</P>
    <P>every day and see that such wards have been all duly cleansed and properly ventilated.  To visit all the sleeping wards every night at or before nine o'clock, and to see that all the inmates are in bed and that all fires and lights are extinguished; to pay particular attention to the moral conduct and orderly behaviour of the females and children and to see that they are clean and decent in their dress and persons.</P>
    <P>This to the matron of the hospital, as though a matron of an hospital would be appointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have to raise it on the Estimates, but I beg to submit that it is quite germane to this Bill, inasmuch as it is showing the mind of the Ministry which proposes to centralise administration to an extent even greater than was done hitherto.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has suggested that these matters should be, perhaps, dealt with on the Estimates, I will refrain from going further into them at this stage.  From what I have quoted we get an insight into the spirit of the administration which seeks to obtain greater powers and greater centralisation under this Bill than it has hitherto had.  I do not think the Bill is big enough to be worth the trouble that apparently has been taken.  I am rather inclined to suspect that, if we had seen the Bill as it was originally drafted, say three months <Col N="1614" /> ago, it would probably contain very much more than it does to-day.  Considering how much has been expected to come out of this Bill, one is rather surprised at the steps that have been taken in respect to a reconstitution or reformation of local government in Ireland.  If the Bill is to be proceeded with, it will require, as Deputy McGoldrick said, very great amendment in all stages.  I think it is a pity that the Dáil should be asked, within four or five weeks of the Recess, to consider this Bill.  It is quite impossible to do what apparently is intended&mdash;to discuss this Bill, to examine it carefully, to amend it as it should be amended, and to deal with legislation of a more urgent character at the same time.  I think the Bill is not all bad.  I will give the Minister credit for that.  There are quite a number of things in it that ought to be in any local government reform Bill, but I do not say they are so urgent as would necessitate even a Second Reading for this Bill.  There is too much bad in the Bill to allow it to have a Second Reading, and I would suggest to the Dáil it would be better, instead of accepting this motion, that we should adopt a motion to postpone consideration of it for, say, four months, in order to allow other legislation, which is more urgent, to be dealt with.  It would also give the Ministry time for second thoughts and an opportunity to bring in a Bill which will not deprive local authorities of the responsibility which they have been exercising, but would co-ordinate their functions and rather extend their responsibility in respect to local affairs, even to smaller bodies than rural district councils.  It is quite wrong to deal with local government in this country on the assumption that the period we have just gone through is to be taken as the basis of any change, and that the experience of local authorities, and the conduct of local authorities, during the last three or four years is to be a criterion of what local authorities can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would have said, four years ago, that the local councils were unfit to carry out their functions, and to do their work.  On the other hand, everybody <Col N="1615" /> said that the experience of local government had proved a valuable education in civic responsibility, and was becoming more valuable year by year.  Then the Government Party, before it was a Government Party, took up the running and introduced political questions of a national character, and decided that those national questions were of more importance, as no doubt they were, than local administration. As a consequence, and what might have been a foreseen consequence of the action at that time, there has been defective local government, and in many cases there have been defective local authorities.  People in many cases have not done the work during the last three or four years as satisfactorily as they were doing it before, though in some cases they have been very much more satisfactory, but you have no right to consider legislation having regard only to the experience of the last four years in local government, and then come to the conclusion that the local authorities must be deprived of their responsibilities, and that administration must be centralised.  I think it is quite necessary for the Dáil to make itself heard on this question, whether it is desirable, whether it is the will of the Dáil, that local government shall be more and more centralised, or whether we should leave the responsibility with the local authorities, and make it even more direct and personal, than it has ever been in the past.  I would, therefore, ask you to accept the motion, that consideration of the Bill be postponed till this day four months.</P>

      <P>I second the proposal of Deputy Johnson, and I do so for the reason that this Bill should be justly described as a major Bill.  Now, I contend that, in any of the Parliaments that we have known, a Bill of this description would, to do it justice, occupy a whole Session.  Only one of those major Bills has been put through in any of the Parliaments that we are acquainted with in any particular Session. And I do not think that it is possible that this Bill can get the care and attention that it deserves when it is wedged in here amongst 38 or 39 Bills, and when we are only allowed up to the 4th July to decide all these Bills, or as many of them as we can get through, a number of them being of considerable importance.  Now, I think it is quite plain to the Ministry that if justice is to be done to this Bill it could not be done in that time, and I think the Ministry should adopt the suggestion that Deputy Johnson makes about a Bill of this importance, a Bill that is going to regulate our local administration for years.  And local administration is as important, and perhaps more important, than your central State administration here.  It cuts more into the life of the country; it makes a bigger demand on its finances, and to the people of the country it is in every way <Col N="1619" /> of as much, if not more, importance than your Government.  If this Bill is going to be put through in this Session it is going to be rushed through, and you might as well say so candidly. It can only be put through by rushing it through.  Now, with regard to the Bill itself, can I only speak to the question of adjourning its consideration for four months, or can I go into the provisions of the Bill?  I want to know that at the outset.</P>

      <P>It is sufficient for me to know that this Bill is before them for the first time.  I am not going to enter into an argument with Deputy Magennis as to whether it is the first or the second time.  Now the question whether our local representatives are to be known as district councillors or county councillors does not affect me in the least.  Whether we call them district councillors or county councillors, they are equally representative of the people; and the argument that a county councillor does not represent the people does not cut ice as far as I am concerned.  They are equally representative with the district councillors; and that suggestion does not appeal to me.  It seems to me that it would only duplicate representation.  My sole idea in supporting the local bodies known at present as district councils is to fit them into the present scheme.  As regards the Home Health Committees and the other Committees established by county councils, the people have not had time to consider them or offer suggestions in connection with this Bill; and I think if they had that time you would get valuable suggestions from the local elected bodies, and I think you ought to be able to fit in all these local committees in connection with County Councils, Home Health Committees and all the rest.  I suggest that these locally elected bodies would be more valuable, certainly more representative, than nominated bodies.  Some of those members who are at present administering Home Health are representative, having been elected in the first instance as county councillors, and afterwards nominated by the county council to the Board of Health; but a considerable number of them are not elected at all; they are not representative, but are strictly nominated and nothing else.</P>

It means that it will be a whole-time job for some of these county councillors if the work is to be done well.  I have served on a committee of Home Health, and I know the work that is entailed if it is to be done anything like well. Some men on these county boards have given more time, certainly almost as much time as some of the Ministers have given to their jobs&mdash;I am not speaking of the last few months.</P>

When I am debarred from dealing with the main Bill I have only to say that it would be desirable that the Minister should take into consideration the suggestions that have come from Deputy Johnson, and that he should also take into consideration the time that we have at our disposal.  I know that he is anxious that justice should be done to the Bill.  It is going to affect very largely our local life; it is our big thing, perhaps, for a generation; and I do suggest that more time be given for the consideration of this Bill, not alone to the Deputies in the Dáil, but to the people outside to whom its Deputies are responsible.  And no matter what you say here you cannot afford to ignore the people outside. They are our masters, or they ought to be; and the sooner we recognise that the better.  Having regard to the importance of this Bill and the time at our disposal, the Minister should give favourable consideration to the suggestions made here to-night.</P>

A few moments ago I said that the system of Local Government in existence for the past twenty, thirty or a hundred years, has not been altered, at least in so far as its general principles are concerned, by this Bill.  I think most of us are agreed that the system in vogue for the last few years has been responsible, more than anything else, for the condition of affairs in the various areas ruled by the local councils and corporations. For instance, I believe the members of the Dublin Corporation were the victims of this system, rather than that the people they ruled were the victims of their misdemeanours.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCabe has touched upon a point with which I am in absolute agreement.  I had not intended to state so until the end of the debate, but, owing to Deputy Johnson's amendment, it is necessary for me to state it now.  I have no intention of proceeding further with this Bill beyond this stage.  After a considerable amount of discussion, we decided to give this Bill a second reading in order to elicit the views of various Deputies in a general way.  That would give us a better opportunity and more time to amend the Bill during the Recess.  I had arranged to have the third Stage after the Recess. Meanwhile, we have started the second reading, a number of Deputies have spoken, and a considerable amount of time has been spent.  Now, if Deputy Johnson's amendment is accepted at this stage we will have to start the same process all over again, and we will have to recommence the second reading in the next session.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to leave the Bill by after the second reading, and give every Deputy an opportunity to prepare amendments and consider the Bill in all its aspects.  That will necessarily require a postponement of the elections.</P>

      <P>I think the statement which the Minister has made makes the reason all the more why an amendment such as Deputy Johnson has proposed should be accepted, if not at this stage, at least towards the end of the debate.  If the motion to carry the Second Reading of this Bill is passed now, it means that the Dáil is committed to the general principles of <Col N="1624" /> the Bill.  In view of what the Minister has said as to the necessity for giving the Bill much more consideration than an ordinary Bill would require, I think that is all the more reason why he should not ask the Dáil to commit itself at this time to the general principles of the Bill.</P>

      <P>If I may intervene, I would like to mention that I deliberately stated I did not want to ask the Dáil to decide now against the Second Reading, and that is why I suggested postponing it for further consideration. That will really mean postponing taking a decision.  This debate in itself will, so to speak, throw the Bill upon the waters for discussion; but if you ask the Dáil to come to a decision as to whether we approve of the principles contained in the Bill, it practically amounts to saying that, notwithstanding the necessity for hearing what the country has to say, we are committed to those principles.  While it is true the Bill admits of amendments in almost every line, if we adopt the Second Reading we are being more or less asked to vote for or against, and I want to avoid that necessity so as to allow the whole matter to be discussed in public.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson from the beginning has displayed himself a past master in Parliamentary strategy.  He delivered a long speech of acute and unmeasured criticism upon the Bill and, having delivered himself exhaustively on all that he had to say on every detail, whether trivial or important, he proceeds to burk discussion on it by moving an amendment which limits us to discuss, not the general principles of the Bill, but whether the Bill should be postponed for four months or taken now. Yet, a moment after, he assures you that his whole purpose is to secure the fullest measure of information and understanding <Col N="1625" /> on the part of the public, who are most affected by the intended measure.  He prevents one half of the Dáil from uttering its mind upon this Bill, either in favour of it or against it, by this device, and then takes credit to himself that in the interests of the public he has burked the discussion. That may be very clever tactics, but it is hardly intelligible from the angle of view that looks for consistency.</P>

But I do submit to you that I have given a fair account of what took place.  There was a discussion here and Deputy Johnson made by far the longest speech as his contribution to that discussion, a very valuable contribution, no doubt, and helpful in many respects.  If I had been allowed to continue the debate I would have paid him a tribute to its value.  But having delivered himself of all he had to say bearing upon the proposed measure, he then moved an amendment which he was well aware, being so proficient in the rules of debate, would limit all subsequent speakers to a discussion on the mere point of whether it was an urgent measure or one that could be postponed.</P>

The fact is, he spoke as anyone might have spoken under a proposal for a Second Reading, and when he was sitting down he was invited by your predecessor in the Chair by the question: &ldquo;Do you move <Col N="1626" /> an amendment?&rdquo;  Presented with the temptation, Deputy Johnson fell a victim to that temptation and moved an amendment.

The debate is limited now to the urgency of this measure.  I submit to you that we should not delay the consideration of it for four months.  If there were nothing else in the Bill, but this portion of it under the section dealing with the Public Health, it would deserve instant consideration. There are two great features in the Bill from that point of view, to wit, the provision of county medical officers, and this very valuable thing in Schedule 4 which applies to our Saorstát all these Acts&mdash;the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, the Prevention of Diseases Act, the Public Health (Amendment) Act, and Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Deputy Johnson is very much interested in the welfare of the poor throughout the whole of Ireland, and here is a measure that has been long looked forward to&mdash;the application of the Bill to the entire country.  Instead of its being optional with the local authorities, this Bill makes it imperative. Why, if it were more or less a short Bill, with some such title as the Local Government (Amendment) Bill, it would find ready acceptance here and would be passed immediately.  I am not going to raise the question here that has been already decided, but it does seem to anyone who is acquainted with public procedure that Deputy Gorey spoke as he ought to have spoken on the First Reading.  If Deputy Gorey believes that this was a Bill so complex, so far-reaching, that it requires the <Col N="1627" /> fullest discussion on the part of the country before the stage was advanced to consider amendments and receive information from constituencies, why did he not inform the Dáil to that effect on the First Reading?</P>

If I said Second Reading I was wrong, and I used a word that I did not intend to use.  The fact is that this Bill is really three, and therefore it requires a greater amount of attention and consideration than certain Deputies&mdash;I will not name them now, otherwise they would be hopping up and asking questions for the decision of the Chairman&mdash;are willing to give.  There are a great many items in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I think it would simplify matters if Deputy Johnson would agree to withdraw his amendment at this stage and move it later.  If he wants a free discussion on the Bill he will do that.  The present position of affairs precludes, I think, that discussion.  I think if he will agree to withdraw his amendment he will be in a better position to carry out the idea he has in his mind, and it would be more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>This Bill was introduced on the 20th May, and was circulated on the 21st and the second reading was fixed for the 29th May.  It has, therefore, been in the hands of Deputies for at least 8 days. Now, that much notice was given of the motion that the Bill be read a second time.  I received no amendment to the motion.  But an amendment is proposed now during the debate, and in manuscript.  If the amendment does not carry out the wishes of the Deputy who proposed the amendment that is an unfortunate state of things. We might probably be able to remedy that now.  I was simply asked to rule upon the meaning of the words which I had before me and of which I had no notice whatever.  If you are going to postpone consideration you cannot be considering the Bill now.  If the purpose that Deputy Johnson had in mind was to have a discussion on the Bill such as would occur normally on the second reading, and have no decision taken, if we had some time to consider that, we might have, perhaps, found a method consistent with our procedure to do that.  But at the moment we are confined, apparently against the general wish and the wish of the mover, to the question as to whether it ought or ought not to be postponed.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that after what took place this afternoon on the Railway Bill a suspicion has entered the minds of some of the Deputies that we have some Machiavelian motive to burk discussion on the Bill.  It was the last thought in my mind.  But for the promptings of Deputy Magennis the matter would have been avoided and this little trouble would not arise. <Col N="1629" /> I did not desire to burk discussion, and I do not desire to burk discussion, and I honestly believed that within the terms of this amendment the merits of the Bill could be discussed and I still believe that that is the case, but I bow to your ruling.</P>
      <P>If it is possible to withdraw the amendment now and move it at a later stage to avoid the necessity for taking a decision I am quite satisfied.  But, unfortunately, to move the amendment at that stage might involve a further discussion, and I wanted to have the motion and the amendment discussed as a whole.  If the ruling is that the general discussion cannot be dealt with while the amendment is before us, I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment till a later stage, if that will satisfy the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I cannot say if it will satisfy the Dáil, but it certainly will not satisfy me that an amendment of this kind should be proposed without notice, withdrawn, and then again proposed later.  I am sorry if Deputy Johnson does not agree with what seems to me to be the plain implication of the words.  It certainly would only be getting us into a more muddled condition to withdraw the amendment now and take it again at a later stage.  We have had five speeches and two from Deputy Johnson on this amendment already.  If we have it withdrawn now and proposed again I am afraid my ingenuity will be very considerably taxed.</P>

      <P>I think there is very little between the Minister and Deputy Johnson.  If I might make a suggestion, it would be this: Both are anxious to get a full debate on the principles of this Bill.  Both in that, I think, are perfectly right.  It is a most important Bill, and it is very urgent and important that it should be spread throughout the country in order that it might be considered during the Recess. I do not think the Minister wants to <Col N="1630" /> secure more than that.  It would be a very important preclude to that to have a full discussion here.  The only difference is whether it is necessary in order to secure that object that a division be taken on the Second Reading at this stage.  I suggest to the Minister that he would gain his purpose if he would continue the discussion and not ask for a division on the Second Reading at this stage.  All that it will cost will be another day at the commencement of another session, when time will be less important.  He will gain his purpose.  The Deputies will be able to make up their minds more fully after discussion with their constituents and everybody will have a much better idea as to how the Bill is likely to work out. I think the whole thing could be got over at once if that plan were agreed to.</P>

I think the proper thing to do, in order not to be making a precedent, is to put the amendment handed in by Deputy Johnson.  The Minister has stated that he is willing that the Bill should be postponed, after the Second Reading is taken, until the Autumn Session.  Surely with the ingenuity of Deputies they will have plenty of time to prepare amendments that can make the Bill absolutely new if they so desire.

      <P>The main question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Local Government Bill be now read a second time&rdquo;&mdash;is again before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the advantage of listening to most of the speeches made in connection with the measure before the Dáil.  It is a very important measure, perhaps one of the most important that has come before the Dáil, and the consideration which a measure of this sort should get and the construction of a measure of this kind, necessitates most careful examination of the problem.  I think that while this measure aims at a marked improvement and advancement in connection with local government generally, it is open to this charge that it has been formulated and considered more by experts in matters of local government than by any open examination of the problem as such.  To that extent, I think, there is a case for having a public examination of this subject of local government, such an examination as would embrace the entire subject, take into consideration several matters affecting local government, the question of representation on local bodies, their powers, duties, if necessary, the incidents of rating and the general position of the country at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be admitted by a number of people in business that there is very little inducement to business men to make extensions in their premises by reason of the almost certain enormous increase in the rates that they would have to pay when these extensions were made.  Somewhere about the year 1916, when a considerable portion of the city of Dublin was burned, amelioration in that connection was allowed for some years.  I expect a measure of the same sort will probably come before us in respect of Cork city.  If there was a case for some relief in the matter of rating in these two cases, why should <Col N="1635" /> there not be where a man, by reason of his enterprise and industry, and so on, gallantly faces enormous cost in extending his premises?</P>
    <P>This is more or less an economic question, but it is one of the matters that ought to be considered.  Then you have two cities like the capital and Cork where, I think, there is an idea that something more perfect than the present machinery for management could be thought out, and could be fashioned, but we have a peculiar people here. Their psychology is such that there is objection, and there is a pulling against any expert advice on those matters, unless it be got by some method of agreement. I think these matters could reasonably be discussed and examined by a Commission which ought to be possible for the Minister to call into existence, with terms of reference which would enable us to see how best local government could be conducted; how we could get the best advantage for the amount of money collected&mdash; and the amount is very considerable, and has increased in recent years out of proportion, very much out of proportion in certain places, as compared with others.  I have been looking over the assessments made in certain counties, and I find in one county the rate is increased from something like 100 to 130 per cent., and in another from 100 to 250 per cent.  There must be some justification, or at least there must be some extravagance to explain an increase like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts do not support that contention, but if it be alleged as a reason for it, the amount of money involved in the matter of the administration of the poor law could not possibly go to such an extent as that.  If it were the case with regard to the county that the Deputy has in mind, why should it not be the case in the instance that I have mentioned, where the rates have increased only by 30 per cent.?  It is very easy to make allegations against modern improvements, and very easy to allege all sorts of complaints against one's neighbour.  It is easy to see the <Col N="1636" /> mote in your brother's eye, but when your own is examined it may not, perhaps, be very much smaller than that of your brother's.  As regards the case I have mentioned of increase in the cost of local government, I have been informed that in one asylum the cost per head is £40, as against £70 in another asylum.  According to what I read of the Minister's statement, it would appear that there is very little work left for Rural District Councils to do.  It ought to be remembered that the cost of elections for Rural District Councils runs up to about £60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Dáil that a conditional Second Reading be given to this Bill.  It is a Bill upon which we could spend a very considerable amount of time.  I noticed that Deputies have been taking notes during the course of the debate, and I also know that many Deputies have a very considerable knowledge of local government affairs.  What I suggest is that a conditional Second Reading should be given to this Bill, that the County Council elections should take place either in July or October, or whatever time is suggested, and that the Rural District Council elections should be postponed until after the report of this Commission is received, and that the elections in the City of Dublin and in the City of Cork should also be postponed until after the report to the Minister comes in.  To that extent, this Bill would not reach the Committee Stage until after the report of the Commission had come in, and the Commission ought to report by the 1st January next.  I am fairly satisfied, when that report is in, that some alterations will have to be made in this Bill.  What I was suggesting was that the Commission should inquire into the question of local government, the Commission to consist say, of six, eight, ten or twelve persons.  I think it is possible to get that number of persons who have some knowledge of local government.  I would not say that the members of the Commission should be appointed from the Dáil.  I think Deputies will want a holiday by the time they have finished up the work that is to be done here, and I am sure they would not relish taking part in a Commission of this sort.  Anyway, I think that those outside <Col N="1637" /> are more immediately in touch now with matters of local government.  If that suggestion were agreed to, and if the Minister were agreeable, I think that the Dáil might give this Bill a conditional Second Reading, and that I would be able to announce to the Dáil within a month the names of the Commission, the date of its first sitting, and its terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do think it is a pity the President was not in the Chamber and did not make the speech he has just made now on the debate on Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I think if he had done so, and if he had removed the Whips, the majority would have been on the other side.  I am as much alive to the importance of this Bill and to the necessity for local government reforms as any Deputy here.  But while the Bill is a voluminous document, it certainly does not do what is required to be done for the reform of local government in this country.  I quite agree with Deputy Sir James Craig in welcoming the new departure so far as public health is concerned, <Col N="1638" /> but I do think that the Ministry responsible for the Bill should have paid a little more attention to the sanitary laws that prevail in this country&mdash; or, rather, that they should have paid attention to the necessity for better sanitary laws.  So far as I know, the sanitary laws, as they apply in urban districts at any rate, prevent councils from doing what is absolutely necessary in the interest of public health. The machinery is very cumbersome and requires a long time to set in motion. Irreparable damage is oftentimes done before councils are in a position to deal with what is sometimes a very serious menace to public health.  It has been pointed out by the various Deputies who spoke in support of the Bill that this is an important measure, and, therefore, warrants a great deal of attention. The reason Deputy Johnson moved his amendment&mdash;he made it perfectly clear&mdash;was because he realised it was an important measure, and required a great deal of attention.  It ought to be patent to anybody that the attention it demands cannot be given it between now and the 4th July, when it is proposed to adjourn, in view of the fact that there are 28 other very important Bills to be considered within that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the anxiety of members on this side of the House&mdash;both the Farmers' Party and the Labour Party&mdash;that local government in the country should receive drastic reform, that we put forward the suggestion that the Bill be postponed.  So far as the setting up of a Public Health Authority is concerned, I understand that the suggestion contained in the Bill is&mdash;I have not read the Bill through, but I know that an Order has been issued to the various Co. Councils in connection with the matter&mdash;that the Public Health Board should consist of 10 members.  Those 10 members will be elected or selected by the Co. Council&mdash;in the case of Wexford Co. Council, numbering 29 members.  It follows as night the day that the majority of those 29 members will be representatives of rural areas.  There is nothing in the Bill to secure that any of those 10 members who will form the Public Health Board will be representatives of urban areas, although the Board will <Col N="1639" /> function on behalf of the urban areas, so far as outdoor relief or home help is concerned.  I think that some provision should be made in the Bill to secure that at least one-third of the Board should be representatives of urban areas.  Urban areas should get special consideration in this connection, because there is more congestion in the urban areas and there is a greater demand for home help.  Unless there is some direct representation of urban areas on the County Board of Health, the hardships to the poor in those areas where there is so much congestion will be very severe.</P>
    <P>Again, it is absolutely necessary that formal application should be made to the County Board of Health by a person before he can secure home help.  As it is customary for these Boards to meet once a month, I do think that some other medium ought to be set up to enable those people to get home help in a shorter space of time.  I am wondering if the Superintendent has power to give provisional relief in the meantime, such as the outdoor relief officer exercised in the past.  It is absolutely necessary that such power should be given, because if a person in absolute poverty has to wait a month before he can get home help it will be a great hardship.</P>
    <P>There is one section in the Bill which I want to deal with especially&mdash;Section 37.  That section has to do with the superannuation of officers.  I agree with the Deputies who have said that there should be a tightening up, so far as this is concerned, and that the regulations, so far as superannuation is concerned, should be made plainer. The ratepayers should have some relief in this direction.  Whilst I say that the ratepayers should have some relief and that public representatives should not be so extravagant when superannuating certain officials, I also think the Ministry should go a little further and consider others than officials for pensions.  I do not see any reason in the world why an ordinary worker&mdash; say, a man who has swept the streets in an urban area, and who has given service for perhaps 40 or 50 years&mdash; should not be entitled to superannuation as much as an official&mdash;a clerk, a <Col N="1640" /> doctor, or any other person of that class who has had a pretty decent salary during his life, and who, one would think, would have put by a certain amount of money.  I do not see why the Minister should not make some provision or ask the local authorities to make some provision for superannuating the ordinary workman, who has as much right to be superannuated as any officer in any position in the State.  I ask the Minister to give this matter consideration.  If he gives it the consideration it deserves, I think he will secure that local authorities will, in addition to superannuating their officers, superannuate the ordinary workman, who has as much right in the matter as anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I may say that that matter was brought before the General Council of County Councils by me, and was definitely turned down there.  If the Deputy stands for democratic government, that is the most democratic institution in local government and, perhaps, the most democratic institution in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give the President credit for doing that; I know he did it.  But the fact that the General Council of County Councils turned it down, does not prove that that attitude is right.  So far as the abolition of Rural Councils is concerned, no reason, to my mind, has been submitted here by the Minister why they should be abolished.  The only reason he did put forward was that the roads would be better looked after if we had no District Councils, because certain works had to be initiated by the Rural Councils and then brought before the County Councils, which was a roundabout method.  He urged that effective work could not be done by keeping these councils in existence.  The Minister, I think, will agree that Rural District Councils deal with a great many things besides roads and sanitation. There is such a thing as housing to be looked after.  That is very important and has engaged the attention of the Dáil for long periods on different occasions.  Water supplies and other questions also arise.  The urgency of the housing problem in some <Col N="1641" /> rural areas is as great as it is in urban areas, and is of sufficient importance to warrant keeping the District Councils in existence.  We hear a lot about the voice of the people, but I do not think this Government has any mandate to silence the voice of the people, which is what this proposal really means.  I believe the County Councils have already too much work to do.  I am a member of a County Council myself, and I know what happens at the meetings. The first two or three items on the agenda generally take up the whole day, and the remaining business is postponed for a fortnight or a month. Matters do not get the attention they deserve.  It is going to be infinitely worse in the future in view of legislation passed recently and the legislation we are promised, most of which filters through the various local councils.  At this period, I believe it would be a great mistake to abolish Rural District Councils, as the County Councils have more work to do than they had before.  I think the abolition of the District Councils should, at least, be postponed for a considerable time.  The Minister should think seriously before taking such a step, as, I think, I am right in saying it is against the wishes of the majority of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand what the President means by asking the Dáil to give this Bill conditional sanction.  To my mind that will come into conflict with some of the Standing Orders.  If we gave the Bill a Second Reading, I take it, we would be committed to the principles in it.  The Bill will require a great deal of careful consideration. As to the Commission that the President proposes to set up, he stated that, in his opinion, it should not be composed of members of the Dáil, but of people outside.  To my mind, that will mean that we will have a repetition of what he himself condemned.  We will have local government experts again. I believe it is possible to get from the different parties in the Dáil representatives who could approach this matter from an absolutely impartial point of view, imbued with the idea of getting the best results possible out of local government in this country.  It is a very important function, in some ways more important than the national <Col N="1642" /> assembly.  What the Government should aim at is, to try and create a certain amount of civic pride and civic responsibility in the various parts of the country.  The Minister should keep away, as far as possible, from the appointment of Commissioners.  I am prepared to admit that during the past four or five years certain things were done by public bodies that would not bear careful examination.  But these things were done by direction of the Government then in power.  The public boards were told to do things that they did not always agree with, and having got into a certain groove, it is very hard to get out of it.  In the abnormal circumstances that prevailed, I think, the councils were trying to do their best.  They served a very useful purpose during a period when this country was in a death struggle with England, and it is not right for any Minister to come in now and base a Bill for local government on a review of the work of that period.  I think that has been done in this instance.  In my opinion, that is not a period on which to base a review of local government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion of the President that a Commission should be set up, but I contend that the members of that Commission should be selected from the Dáil.  If people outside are selected it would be the official mind that would prevail again.  We will get better results, I think, by having the personnel of the Commission selected from members of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Corish proposes, under the plea of supporting the recommendation of the President, is that instead of setting up a Commission of Inquiry such as the President outlines, this Bill, without undergoing a Second Reading, should be formally committed to a Committee of the whole Dáil, or rather a Special Committee.  Now there is no reason why Deputy Corish's idea, in an amended form, should not be adopted, provided always that we have the Second Reading of the Bill secured. Then, instead of the ordinary procedure of debate in the Dáil, it could be referred to a Select Committee, and that Select Committee could call before it witnesses and receive testimony and information from those outside persons, <Col N="1643" /> that the President had in contemplation. In that way, I suggest, examination of such a huge and complex measure as this is would be satisfied.  Personally, if the President will permit me to say so, I do not like the idea of committing to a body of men who are not elected representatives of the people, a task and an office, which properly belongs to the representatives of the people.  It is really on that principle that I approve of the central idea put forward by Deputy Corish.  There is only one thing I would like to stress, and that is, if the whole question of local government, in all its bearings, such as is set out in the present measure, be gone into, it would take a very long time to probe into the recesses of it and arrive at anything like an enlightened and final decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile the very important question of local government, to which the President made passing reference, will have been neglected and ignored.  The President spoke of the cases of the City of Dublin and the City of Cork. In the brevity and conciseness of his statement he put the two together in a way that might mislead the casual hearer into the belief that he looked upon the two cities as being under exactly the same position of disability as regards their boundaries.  Of course, as everything in life is comparative, so as between these two cities, the question of the boundaries and the improved administration of the City of Dublin is a far more pressing matter, a matter requiring more instant consideration than the other; in fact, out of my ignorance let me admit that I should say that the other question does not properly arise at the moment. Now, it would be a great pity if such an important thing as the position of the City of Dublin and the extension of its boundaries and an improved system of administration for an extended and greater City of Dublin were to be postponed, when the investigation could be carried on <i>pari passu</i> with this other, and I was hoping, perhaps, that the President would on second thoughts be willing to approve of setting up a special Commission, or, if not, give a special direction to the Committee investigating the question <Col N="1644" /> of local government <i>in toto</i> to take this into account.</P>
    <P>Anyone who considers the facts of the moment will realise why peculiar urgency applies to this.  What I might call the swan song of the late Corporation of unhappy memory was an effort to promote a measure for the extension of the city boundaries to what in equity they ought to be.  Those of us who read the newspapers, if we have no other source of information, are aware that a measure is being promoted for the amalgamation of Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and Dalkey, the outlying townships, to create a new and rival city to the older city of Dublin, and provided with a great harbour at Dun Laoghaire, and with freedom from the old and accumulated debts and disabilities which burden the older city; also, the Council of Dun Laoghaire, as I learn from the Press, is pressing forward a scheme for its own electricity work. All these things mean prejudicing the final solution of the whole question, and if the measure be not viewed at present in connection with this question of Dublin, later on it will become necessary to do, in fact, what is always difficult, namely, to undo what has been settled.</P>
    <P>It is true the present Bill does not deal with Urban Councils, but indirectly it does as regards the City of Dublin, because there is provision made for a new and enlarged County Council of Dublin, and if that area which ought to be included in Greater Dublin be included in it, there would be a very small portion, indeed, of the County of Dublin left for administration at the hands of this enlarged County Council, so that if one sees a little way ahead there is no reason why a complication should be deliberately brought about.  That, I put on the forefront, because I have my eye on the clock, and I wish to present that aspect of the Bill for the consideration of the Dáil, whatever else goes by the board.  If I were allowed to move the adjournment of the debate I might, perhaps, be disposed to weary the Dáil with some criticism of the measure itself, but, on the other hand, I realise that public business has become enormous in its extent, and that, unfortunately, <Col N="1645" /> public time is in inverse ratio, and that it might be just as well if I did not move the adjournment of the debate, so I leave myself in the hands of the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise a question in regard to the publication of the Inspector's Report on the conduct of civic affairs by the Corporation of Dublin.  The question has been raised two or three times, and the Minister has said that if there were a desire expressed generally from the Dáil, from the members, the publication would be made.  Since the question was raised last the newspapers have published what purports to be a report of the Inspector upon which certain very drastic action was taken by the Minister.  Now, it is quite obvious to anybody that that Report, which appears in the newspapers, is not the report on which the Minister took action.  There is nothing in that report that could, by any stretch of the imagination, be a justification for the procedure taken by the Minister; and therefore I assume that there is something in the Report which has <Col N="1646" /> been hidden from the public, but which ought to be presented to the Dáil.  The matter in question is, of course, of the very greatest importance; and one has refrained from raising the matter directly in the Dáil in the expectation that the Minister would be able to produce definite reasons in the form of the Government Inspector's Report.  And it has been by virtue of our patience in waiting for that Report that no steps have been taken to raise this question of the action of the Minister in suppressing the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Now I want to press upon the Minister that the Dáil is entitled in a matter of this kind to have the information placed at its disposal upon which he took action in regard to the Dublin Corporation. An inspector was appointed and conducted an inquiry.  That inquiry has been reported upon.  The Inspector's recommendations were delivered to the Minister; and I think it should be clear, and one would have thought obvious, to everyone, that a Report of that character on so important a question, should have been presented to the Dáil.  As I said, we have had a version, a summary presumably, of certain parts of that Report.  They do not contain, evidently, the facts which gave a reason to the Minister for taking the action that he did.  I say that we ought to have the whole Report so that those hidden disclosures, those hidden paragraphs which must be so serious in their reflections upon the Dublin Corporation, may be made public. And I would press upon the Dáil that the members should agree with me in urging, in calling for, if I may say so, the publication in full of the Report of the Inspector on the proceedings and actions of the Dublin Corporation.  Deputy Doyle does not want it, I suppose.</P>

This Report would also involve considerable expense; and I do not think, in the absence of the Minister for Finance, that I could agree to go to that cost.  Of course, I am wholly in the hands of the Dáil in this matter.  I have got absolutely no opinion one way or another in the matter.  I do not care whether the Report is published or not, but I wish to disabuse Deputy Johnson of the idea that seems to have got into his mind that we issued a garbled report, or version of the report, to the Press.  They were given the full version.  I did not <Col N="1648" /> read the account of it in the Press myself, but I have no reason to believe that they suppressed anything.
