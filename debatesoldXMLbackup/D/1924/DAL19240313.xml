      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he has received a resolution from Athy Farmers' Union pointing out (1) that no claim for compensation for malicious injury from the district has been heard since 1921, (2) stating that County Court Judge Drumgoole's duties will not permit him to deal with such cases for a considerable time, and (3) asking for the appointment of a deputy County Court Judge, and whether, in view of these representations, he will accede the request for the appointment of a deputy.</P>

      <P>I have received the resolution referred to and I have been in consultation with the Minister for Finance on the subject.  It is understood that Judge Drumgoole will shortly be able to deal with the claims which are not particularly numerous and will probably not take long to dispose of.

      <P>I have received copies of resolutions passed by various public bodies in County Mayo asking for an extension of telephones to that County, and the matter is under consideration. To connect towns in Mayo with the trunk telephone system, it would be necessary to erect new trunk lines for long distances at a capital expenditure of several thousand pounds, with a correspondingly large annual cost for maintenance.  Whether it will be possible to undertake this expenditure will depend upon the amount of local support forthcoming, and the revenue estimated to arise from the opening of Exchanges at the towns concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the letter myself, and the outstanding fact in the case, from the point of view of anything practical, for Browne or anybody else, is that James Browne did not perform storeman's duties after the date mentioned, and our regulations are, that being the case, that he cannot receive the additional pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

    <Title>OLD AGE PENSIONS BILL, 1924&mdash;COMMITTEE STAGE (RESUMED).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question, I would again say that the new method of calculation will mean great hardship to many people who have been looking forward to the pension, and who will be deprived of it by the operation of this Section.  It is not intended that the Section shall apply for those who became, before the passing of the Act, entitled to receive a pension.  I wonder does that mean that any person who was seventy years of age, and who was entitled, before the passing of the Act, under the terms and conditions of the law at the time, to claim a pension when he became seventy, will be excluded from the operation of this Section? I think such persons will.  I hope they will, because it will relieve a few people at any rate from the penalties imposed by the Minister in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The new method of calculation&mdash;the capital value of the property of the thrifty&mdash;imposing upon them a charge of 10 per cent. as income deemed to be derived from such property, as against the 5 per cent. which has hitherto been charged, is going to limit very considerably the number of people who have been looking forward to receiving pensions from the State.  I think one might say, by virtue of the fact that they have this little property as a result, probably, of thrifty ways, that they are decent citizens, and should not be penalised therefor.  I think the Minister, in the course of discussions on other amendments, rather deprecated the making of differences between one person and another who are pensioners. He is afraid that differentiation as between, say, 75 and 74 years, would be difficult and detrimental to the proper working of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to him that the calculation of means on the new basis for new pensioners will be equally detrimental. There are, say, two brothers, or a brother and sister, or more likely, two sisters, in a family, each of whom has a certain little property.  One was 70 years of age last year and came into her pension.  The properties are equal in value.  The other comes into her pension <Col N="2033" /> next year.  Her pension may be lost altogether, because of the different method of valuing the property.  You are going to charge 5 per cent. against the elder sister's property, and you are going to charge 10 per cent. against the younger sister's property.  Will that give the sense of equal justice that the Minister would like to see generated? I think it will not.  In this case it is penalisation because of youth.  One year's difference in the date of birth may mean the difference between a 4/- a week pension and no pension at all. But it certainly will mean a difference, and no good case is being made to reduce the pension on account of the difference in the method of valuation. To charge the property owners in this case, as I have already stated, as if that property were terminable and as if once a certain number of years had passed the property rights vanished, and to apply that only to old age pensioners, is a differentiation against the Old Age Pensioner and in favour of the property owner, who has been taught and encouraged by the State to look upon that property as something that is evergreen and ever growing.  In this case the Old Age Pensioners' property is to be treated as something declining in value and eaten away at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum, and that, I say, is a differentiation in the attitude of the State towards the poor pensioner as compared with the attitude of the State towards the rich non-pensioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that Deputy Johnson is not moving the deletion of sub-section 2.  It could be deleted.  I put it in because I thought it well not to make the change more <Col N="2034" /> drastic than we could help.  People who might be affected by this particular sub-section will, shall we say, suffer a cut of one shilling; they may suffer a revision of means, and I do not desire that they should suffer in a third way. If there was any great desire for having this new method of calculating means applied to all pensioners, I would not put up any great resistance to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is not serious in urging that I am even suggesting for a moment that the remission of penalty, and the remission of punishment should be deleted, and that the new punishment which is to be imposed upon the new pensioner is to be equally applicable to the old.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 18, which is to insert before Section 6 a new Section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In calculating the means of a person for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Acts the annual value of such means shall be deemed to be less than the ascertained value by the sum of eight pounds or such less sum as in the opinion of the Local Pension Committee represents a fair annual rent for the dwelling or lodging accommodation occupied by the person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Clearly the object of this amendment, or new Section, is to make a little recompense to the person who has that little property and who is being deprived of some of the value of that property if he or she is over 70 years of age.  I desire that at least the cost of shelter shall be allowed to them, and that by allowing 3/- a week, or £8 per year, the effect of the last Section may be somewhat modified.</P>
      <P>This new Section will not apply to the great mass of pensioners, but it will apply to some of those who have been counting upon the pensions to assist them in their old age, supplemental to the little property or savings, annuities, and the like, they may have.  It is a very small concession, and I hope the Minister will agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is not a very small concession, because it would apply not merely to those who rent a dwelling, but to those who are maintained by relatives or friends, and those who own the places in which they dwell.  It would simply mean that there was an additional allowance to means of £8 a year beyond what is contemplated. I think that would be the effect of it.  There is another point in it too. It would be impossible for any Old Age Pensions Committee to determine the fair annual rent of a dwelling or of lodging accommodation.  You would have all sorts of practices carried on, and you would have a lot of twisting of facts, so as to get the benefit of this particular amendment for everybody. I think it simply amounts to an increase in the means.  Shelter is, of course, a very necessary thing for everybody.  Food is a necessary item for everybody, and there is no reason why a certain calculation should be made in regard to shelter more than in respect of food, or any other of the necessaries of life.  I do not think that <Col N="2037" /> any particular case for this item can be made out.  It would be just as easy to say that in calculating means we should exclude the cost of bread or tobacco, and that the pension should be given irrespective of these items.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister has forgotten that he has, as a matter of fact, made an estimate of the other requirements, but he lumps them all together, and says that up to a certain limit he will pay the pension, provided the means do not exceed a certain sum.  That is, in effect, valuing the absolute necessaries.  Provided the income that is ascertained does not exceed seven shillings a week, a pension of nine shillings may be paid.  I take it, that in fixing seven shillings, there was some theory in the Minister's mind which would probably be that seven shillings would be sufficient to provide certain necessaries, presumably, a certain proportion of the cost of existence, and he would be prepared to supplement that by nine shillings, so that there is an estimate being made.  I am asking that a sum up to three shillings a week should be allowed in respect of rent.  The Minister said&mdash;and I am glad he said it, because it makes the decision clearer to those who have not been well aware of the effects of this Bill&mdash;that in estimating the cost of maintenance by friends, this proposal of mine, to leave out of account a sum not exceeding three shillings a week, would assist the friends.  I want to draw attention to the method that is to be applied, and is being applied, regarding assessment of pensions.  If a man or woman has taken into his house, or her house, to care, a father or mother who is aged, and is putting them into a decent room to sleep in and giving them the ordinary family food, or such of that food as they can take in old age, that is to be assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is going to be assessed at, say, 12/- per week, then the pension is going to be cut down to 4/-.  If it is assessed at anything more than 7/- per week, the pension is to be cut accordingly, and it is almost inevitable, prices remaining as they are, that, after the <Col N="2038" /> instructions that have been given for the purpose of balancing the budget, the pensions officer will estimate the cost of maintenance of the old man or old woman in a son's or daughter's house as being worth more than 7/- per week.  I want to relieve them at least of a charge of 3/- per week for rent.  But the Minister says &ldquo;No.&rdquo; If the Pensions Officer estimates the value of the maintenance, including rent, food and any comforts that are provided by the family, at more than 7/- per week, then there will be a cutting of the pension.  That is, in fact, being done.  Revision of maintenance is in operation, and we are asked to pass this Bill, which will entail a wholesale revision of the estimate of the value of maintenance.  If the Minister is stringent enough and the Pensions Officer is generous enough in his interpretation of the Minister's desires, I suppose the value of the maintenance will be raised considerably, and consequently the Treasury will be saved so much in pensions.  I, at least, want to guard against cutting into the cost of shelter, so that only the food and clothing that may be provided by the son or daughter will be charged into the value of maintenance.</P>
    <P>It is not realised how great a change may be accomplished by this Bill, and by the more rigid interpretation that is being given to the instructions to Pensions Officers regarding the value of maintenance.  I am sorry that the Minister shows himself adamant in this matter.  I had hoped that he would concede that the value of shelter for an old man or old woman might be reckoned at 3/- as a maximum even, and that that 3/- should not be charged against the claimant as income. To charge as income the shelter that is given to an old man or an old woman in, perhaps, a crowded house, looks almost like inhumanity.  But it is being charged as income, and the Minister refuses to make clear that it shall not be so charged.  I am only asking that a sum not exceeding 3/- shall be credited to the pensioner and not so charged, and that the local Pensions Committees, which have certain powers and responsibilities, which are not taken away by this Bill, may be <Col N="2039" /> able to reduce that if they think the value of the shelter is not as great as £8 a year, or 3/- a week.  It is quite a simple proposition and would be a protection for the pensioner.  I would ask the Dáil to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that this, like several other of the amendments, will not in any way affect the poorest class of pensioner.  It will only affect those whose means are 7/- per week.  It will not affect at all the pensioner who has no means whatever to supplement the pension, and those cases are really the pitiable cases in connection with Old Age Pension administration&mdash;those <Col N="2040" /> who are trying to eke out existence on the pension only. The case of the other pensioners is really not so bad at all, and it is those whose case is not so bad who would benefit by this particular amendment. This amendment would certainly lead to a charge of 3/- per week being put on the State in a considerable number of additional cases, those being cases in which there is not so much need as in the others, to which the amendment would not apply at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOMAS O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following new Section:&mdash; Before Section 6 to insert a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In calculating the annual value of the means of a person for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Acts, in any case in which the Pension Authorities are satisfied that the person is paying a rent exceeding three shillings weekly for dwelling accommodation, that such accommodation is not better or more ample than is reasonably suited to the person's needs, and that such rent is not, having regard to the opportunities of securing housing accommodation in the district, unnecessarily high, a deduction shall be made of a sum equal to fifty-two times the amount by which the rent so paid exceeds three shillings weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would affect certain old people who cannot get suitable housing accommodation except at comparatively excessive rates.  There are cases, undoubtedly, of old people who live in Dublin and other cities, and in some provincial towns also, who have to pay sums of 4/-, 5/- and 6/- a week for suitable rooms or lodgings, and this makes the pension very much less valuable than it otherwise would be. The object of the new Section is to assume that the sum of 3/- would be a reasonable rent for old age pensioners to pay, and if they are compelled through the shortage of housing accommodation to pay a higher sum than 3/-, the excess sum over 3/- should be deducted when calculating the means for the purposes of pension.  The proposal <Col N="2044" /> does not mean that the old age pensioner shall be able to choose quarters which would be better than is suited to his particular case and that he should then be free to have an excess over 3/- deducted, because it leaves to the discretion of the Pension Officer in the case to say whether he is satisfied that the person is paying a rent exceeding 3/- weekly, and when such accommodation is not better or more ample than is reasonably suited to the person's needs, and that such rent is not, having regard to the opportunities of securing housing accommodation in the district, unnecessarily high.&rdquo;  In other words, it leaves it to the Pension Officer to say that, in all the circumstances, this particular old age pensioner was not able to get suitable rooms unless he paid this extra sum.  I think that, under the circumstances, it is reasonable that this deduction should be allowed to meet the special circumstances of these old age pensioners who suffer through the scarcity of housing accommodation. Therefore, I move this new Sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another amendment designed to give certain benefits and additional advantages to the old age pensioner who has means, and will not benefit the old age pensioner who has no means.  I think there is no case for it.  It would lead again to abuse, to charging rent where no rent is charged now, and to manoeuvres of that sort which it is not desirable to introduce.  And in any case it is one of the amendments designed to increase the comparative advantages of the pensioner who has means over the one who has no means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister want to persuade the House that if a person is in receipt of an assistance from his or her friends that that assistance is not to be valued?  When he speaks of this amendment being applicable only to those who have means, does he mean to inform the House he has no intention of assessing the assistance which son or daughter provides for a father or mother as means, provided they are only given as gifts and that there is no formal contractual obligation? The Minister is speaking in regard to this matter in a way which I cannot quite connect up with the <Col N="2045" /> method which is being adopted of assessing value of the maintenance which people give to their aged parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this amendment carefully, and it seems to have a good deal in it and to be a reasonable claim.  It is an attempt, I think, to relieve a certain class of pensioners suffering from an accidental disability, owing to the part of the country in which they are living.  I do not see that it benefits the richer or better off pensioners rather than the poorer.  It is an attempt to put the pensioners more or less on an equality as regards the benefit they should derive under this Act.  I certainly, unless I find some better reasons than the Minister has given, will support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a little more in the amendment than the Minister realises, and that it deserves a little fuller consideration than he has given it.  It seems to me to be a practical attempt to take into consideration the circumstances of those old age pensioners who are living in places where the cost of living is high.  Nobody can dispute that an old age pensioner living in a village in the West of Ireland, with a rent of perhaps only a shilling a week, and where turf can be got comparatively cheaply, is much better off than an old age pensioner living in Dublin, where rents are high, and where coal has to be bought.  The acceptance of the principle embodied in the amendment, possibly in some altered form, would, in my opinion, be to the Minister's benefit and to the benefit of the Treasury, and at the same time it would help to meet such hard cases as I have mentioned.  I have supported the Minister in his reduction, but I want to make that reduction as little crushing as possible to those who happen to be living in places where their expenses are high.  I think the amendment is a step towards meeting cases of that kind, and of making things easier for people who have to pay high rent.  With high rent there goes high expenses.  Therefore, I propose to support the amendment, if Deputy O'Connell presses it to a division.</P>

We have not varying pensions for different districts, and I do not see how a national scheme could be worked with varying rates of pensions for different districts.  We simply have to work on a flat rate basis, and I do not see how we could depart from that without causing endless trouble and causing additional discontent and agitation, and without also being involved in a great increase of expense. As regards the placing of the old age pensioners on an equality the amendment does not do that.  This will be a benefit only to those who have private means of 7s. a week apart from their pension.  It will do nothing at all for the old age pensioner, whether in Dublin or Connemara, who is trying to live on his old age pension only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the law, but it is a fact that there has been a great deal of leniency in the administration of the law.  If I keep my father or mother, or if any Deputy in the Dáil who has a father or mother pensionable does so, and we say that &ldquo;for the purpose of obtaining a pension we are not going to keep you, we are going to <Col N="2047" /> put you out on the roadside,&rdquo; then they can go and claim the pension and will be entitled to it.  But if we say &ldquo;No. Hard as it may be, and difficult as it may be, for us to keep the old man or woman, we are not going to put them out on the roadside or send them to the workhouse,&rdquo; and if we do stint ourselves to provide maintenance for such persons that maintenance is to be valued at anything over 7s. a week.  The amount of the pension will thereby be reduced, and the instructions that have been given to the Minister's officers are that the administration in this respect shall be tightened up and there is to be a general re-valuation of this privilege. What does that mean?  It means that there is going to be a very considerable penalty imposed upon pensioners or upon the people who are keeping their parents.  The suggestion here is that in the valuation of that privilege which is called shelter, that an allowance should be made in cases where they are living in cities, where rents are high and where one room may be worth more than 3s. a week.  Surely that is the very smallest thing that could be asked.  The last amendment meant the same thing, but it meant that the 3s. a <Col N="2048" /> week should not be charged at all, that the shelter of the pensioner which is the privilege of living in the son's house or living in the daughter's house, shall not be charged up to the rate of 3s. a week.  The Dáil decided against that amendment.  Now, we are asking for a much less generous consideration; we are asking now that the Dáil should say that the 3s. a week should be the maximum, and that anything which is necessarily paid, because of the shortage of housing accommodation, should be excluded from the calculation of means.  Privileges that are granted to pensioners!  Privileges, forsooth!  The maintenance which the father or the mother receives from the son or daughter is to be valued.  If the rent of the house in which the family lives is high, we are asking that anything over 3s. a week, which may be assessed, is the value of that privilege called shelter and shall not be counted.</P>
      <P>That is the slightest possible relaxation of the Minister's attitude that could be asked, and I ask the Dáil to support it.</P>

      <Col N="2049" /> SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>(1)  If and whenever any person, within five years before or at any time after he becomes entitled to receive an old age pension and either before or after the passing of this Act, assigns any property or income, such property or income shall be taken into account in calculating for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Act, or Section 1 of the Act of 1920, the means of that person, unless it shall appear that the assignment was a conveyance or transfer by operation of law or was a conveyance or transfer on a bona fide sale for valuable consideration in money or money's worth amounting to not less than four-fifths of the value of the property or income, or the estate or interest therein, which was the subject of the sale.</P>
    <P>(2)  The yearly value of any property or income which is by virtue of this Section to be taken into account in calculating the means of any person shall be calculated in the like manner as the yearly value of property or income of a similar nature in the actual possession of or actual receipt by such person is required to be calculated, save that such value shall be calculated as of the date on which such person assigned such property or income.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where any person, by means of an assignment to which this Section applies, assigns any property or income for valuable consideration in money or money's worth amounting to less than four-fifths of the value of the property or income, or the estate or interest therein, which is the subject of the transaction, such valuable consideration, if or so far as it is in the possession of the person at the time he becomes entitled to receive an old age pension, shall not be taken into account in calculating the means of that person for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Acts or Section 1 of the Act of 1920.</P>
    <P>(4)  Sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the Act of 1908 shall not apply to any assignment to which this section applies.</P>
    <P>(5)  This Section shall not apply to the calculation of the means of any <Col N="2050" /> person who became, before the passing of this Act, entitled to receive an old age pension.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this Section the word &ldquo;assign&rdquo; includes any form of conveyance, transfer, or other transaction by which a person parts with the ownership or possession of any property or disentitles himself to receive any income, and the word &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; and other cognate words shall be construed accordingly.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In Sub-section (1), line 56, page 3, to delete the word `five' and to substitute the word `three.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 6 is designed to prevent persons qualifying themselves for the pension by making over their property to their children or others.  There is a similar provision for death duties, which are levied on gifts made prior to death, but in the case of death duties the period is three years not five.  The amendment brings the Section into line with the practice in regard to death duties.  A similar point to the one I am making now, was made by the Minister for Finance in opposing Deputy Johnson's amendment to Section 1.  I hope the Minister will be consistent and accept this amendment.  Some modification is called for, because the Bill, as it stands, will affect assignments made back to 1919.  The Bill with the amendment will affect assignments only after 1921.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Colohan in this amendment. I do not know if the Minister is conversant with the state of affairs that exists in country districts with regard to the disposal of property, or the passing over of property, before reaching the limit for the old age pension.  It is a fact that in those districts owners of small farms very often keep the farms on their hands and maintain their children as unpaid workers for a great number of years. Therefore, when the old persons get close to the age on which they are due to receive the old age pension, it is not unreasonable that they should have the right to make over the property to those children who have been working for them as unpaid labourers <Col N="2051" /> for a great number of years.  As a matter of fact, if they are not allowed to do so, what actually would happen is that the old person would have to retain the little property and maintain the children instead of the children obtaining the property and maintaining the old people, until they reach the age limit.  On that account I would ask the Minister seriously to consider this amendment, and if possible to accept it.</P>

      <P>In line 7, page 4 to add at the end of sub-section (1) the words: &ldquo;or that the property comprised in the assignment consists only of a farm of land the poor law valuation whereof (including the buildings thereon) does not exceed £10, together with or without the stock and chattels thereon.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment also.  Ten pounds valuation is an uneconomic valuation.  I think the Minister will concede that it has been accepted by every Government that has had anything to do with lands heretofore in Ireland.  It is generally admitted that it would not be fair to ask the holder of such a farm to contribute to the support of a person entitled to the old age pension. The income of those farmers is a very small one, and it would be really an injustice to ask the holder of a farm to contribute to the support of an old age pensioner.  As a matter of fact, it ought to be the other way about.  It is in order to prevent a very evident injustice that this amendment is suggested.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the amendment.  Speaking on the Second Reading, I called attention to this matter, and I held then, and I hold now, that the occupiers of these small uneconomic holdings are certainly in no better position than&mdash;and it is doubtful if they are in as good a position as&mdash;<Col N="2052" /> the ordinary labourer.  I think it would be most unfair if these little holdings which pass on to the son, should continue to be counted as property for the old man who has reached the age of seventy.  As Deputy Heffernan pointed out, speaking on the last amendment, the children on these little holdings give unpaid service for a number of years.  In view of the circumstances of the country, the number of these small holdings, and the social problem which is involved&mdash;for there is a social problem involved&mdash;there is a strong case for the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment also.  Practically the same arguments which I used in support of the last amendment will apply to this.  I do not know if those arguments had any influence on the Minister when he considered the acceptance of the last amendment, but, as Deputy O'Connell says, there is a social problem involved in this matter and it is only right that the Minister should consider the social problem.  I think the problem is very obvious.  It is a case of the probability of the children of these small holders getting married. This clause might have the effect of preventing these children from acquiring the little holdings in time and thereby getting married if they wish to do so.  I strongly support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To add at the end of sub-section (1), page 4, line 7, the words &ldquo;or was a conveyance or transfer of an agricultural holding or part thereof made by the owner or tenant thereof to his son or grandson who has attained the full age of thirty years provided that the local Pension Committee is of opinion that said last-mentioned <Col N="2053" /> conveyance or transfer was made <i>bona fide</i> by way of family settlement or as an advancement to and by way of provision for life of said son or grandson.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment also.  I might remind him that the object of the Old Age Pensions Act was not to grant a pension to a person merely because he had attained the age of seventy years.  It was not exactly for that the Old Age Pension was granted but because the claimant had lived a long and strenuous life and had given of his or her best to the country. Along the seaboard&mdash;along the West Coast of Ireland&mdash;there are a great number of very small holders having five or six in their families.  The majority of those have to emigrate and one generally remains at home to keep things going.</P>
    <P>He not only keeps things going, but during his whole time up to the 30 years of age that this is supposed to apply to, he has been working not only for his father and mother, but for the brothers and sisters to help to pay their way, as the general rule is, to America.  The transfer is a transfer in good faith.  It is in order to allow the son to get married, and, therefore, to do his duty to his country, that the transfer has been made.  There has been full value for the consideration. It is not exactly fair that the old man should be mulcted at the end of his days, or that the Minister should aid in compulsorily migrating the other man, because the old man must either keep his farm or get the pension.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to agree to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment, and to say that in my own judgment&mdash;and I have some local knowledge of a certain part of the West&mdash;in regard to the circumstances of these cases that the amendment is intended to relieve, it is almost too high, and if the date could be fixed at a period earlier than 30 years, the purpose that Deputy McBride has in mind could be better achieved.  What the Minister has said in speaking on amendment 21 would apply equally in regard to this, that the abuses that the section is intended <Col N="2054" /> to prevent will not apply in the areas that the amendment will benefit.  The one flaw in the amendment seems to me the full age of 30 years.  I think, at least in that part of the country that I know, the West of Mayo, which would be known also to Deputy McBride, if the son has not a prospect of coming in to take up the little holding, which because it is so uneconomic, cannot be called a holding at all, that son, long before the age of 30, would be off to America.  That is the only flaw I see in it.  I would like to see that age brought down to 25 years, or, at least, to 28 years.  However, so much as is in the amendment is to the good, and I would urge the Minister to consider whether the age of 30 might not be made even lower still.</P>

I think if this amendment were to be adopted, it would be just as well to eliminate the section.  I will undertake to consider, between this and the Report Stage, whether any form could be devised that would, in a substantial way, meet the Deputy's purpose without actually nullifying the clause.

      <P>To add at the end of the sub section (2) the words: &ldquo;or as of the date upon which the calculation is made by the pension officer, whichever value is the less.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of the amendment is to remove the hardship that exists in the section as it stands in connection with the age of giving up farms.  The point I wish to make in connection with the matter is, if a farm were assigned in <Col N="2055" /> 1920, a very much higher value would be given if the section as it stands were passed than would be paid if the assignment was made at a later date.  The purpose of the amendment is to put in a safeguard by providing alternative dates.  That is to say, where the date of the assignment, or the date, by the calculation by the pension officer, gives the lower value, the lower value should be calculated.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one and speaks for itself. There is little need to stress it. I ask the Minister to accept it, and I ask the Dáil to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very important to the farmers, particularly those who can speak for congested districts, that this amendment should be accepted and passed by the Dáil.  I say passed by the Dáil, whether it is accepted by the Minister or not.  &ldquo;The yearly value of any property to be taken into account by virtue of the section in calculating the means of any person shall be calculated in like manner as the yearly value of property or income of a similar nature in the actual possession of or actual receipt by such person is required to be calculated.&rdquo; The Minister has told us how it is calculated in another connection.  He told us that the value of the house would be calculated according to the current value, and the income derivable would be taken into account; but now, following up that portion of the sub-section which I have read, it comes to this&mdash;&ldquo;save that such value shall be calculated as of the date on which such person assigned such property or income.&rdquo; If the assignment took place when everybody thought that the millenium with regard to prices of agricultural products had arrived, the value would be high, whereas if calculated to-day, the value would be very much lower. It is reasonable.  I think, to say that the value of the property assigned must have some regard to the income which is to be derived from it, especially when it is taken into account that you are going to reckon the income as being 10 per cent. of the value.  If the value as in 1920 is taken as a basis of calculation, and you have 10 per cent. of that value, and compare that with the five <Col N="2056" /> per cent. of present day values, which would be the position if this section were not passed into law, I think it will be seen that there is something acting very much against the pensioner.  I would like the Minister to express his views upon this before asking the Dáil to decide not to accept the amendment.</P>

I can see now&mdash;I am sorry I did not see it before&mdash;that this amendment is one which would have a great effect on the small farming community, and I think it is very reasonable to ask the Minister to accept it.  It would be quite unreasonable to calculate the value of land assigned five years ago, taking into consideration the extremely high values which then prevailed in regard to land as compared with the present day low values, and taking into consideration also the fact that under this Bill the means are to be taken as one-tenth, which, I maintain, is altogether excessive.  I think it is very reasonable to ask the Minister to accept the amendment, and I strongly support the Labour deputies in putting it forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Murphy's argument is robbed of some of its point by the fact that a previous amendment has been accepted making the period three years instead of five, so that we would not go back to the prices of 1919, but at most to the prices of 1921.  However, I see there is a great deal to be said in favour of the Deputy's point of view.  If we were dealing only with agricultural holdings I would have no hesitation in accepting it, but we might, for instance, be dealing with house property, and losses might have to be disallowed for houses going into dilapidation and disrepair. There is another point about the amendment I would like to refer to.  I would not like to take the date at which the calculation is made by the Pension Officer.  On the whole, however, I am inclined to accept the amendment as it stands.  I will put forward a further amendment if I think it is necessary.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the application of Section 1 of the Blind Persons Act, 1920, to any person, the words &ldquo;so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential,&rdquo; shall be construed with reference to the opportunities of that person for obtaining work suited to his training and ability, and if such opportunities are not reasonably available the person shall be deemed to have satisfied the condition prescribed by the Section, notwithstanding that he may not be absolutely deprived of sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals rather with the definition of blindness.  Section 1 of the Blind Persons Act says that the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act shall be applicable in the case of blind persons when they have arrived at the age of fifty years instead of seventy. There has been some difficulty in regard to the administration of the Blind Persons Act in this country in respect of blindness.  In effect, the Act has <Col N="2058" /> been applied as though the person must be absolutely stone blind.  That was not the intention of the Act when it was going through the British House of Commons; it was not the intention of the framers or those who supported and promoted it, and that will be seen from the reports of the discussions.  It was not the intention of the Commission of Inquiry, on the Report of which the Bill was passed, and it is not the way the Act is being administered in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The opportunities for work have to be taken into account.  The person who has been trained to a certain kind of work, though not absolutely blind, might be relieved in some way if residing in a town where opportunities for that kind of work were provided.  But if no opportunities have been provided for that kind of work, then the person is in the position of stone blindness in so far as income is concerned, and unfortunately the provisions of that Act have not been applied in Ireland, though legally they should have been. Consequently, the opportunities for earning livelihoods by blind persons through training are not available.  The amendment would ask that the definition shall be construed with reference to the opportunities of the person for obtaining work suited to his training and ability.  Surely, when the Act provides for certain things it has a right to assume that the opportunities are available?</P>
    <P>When we have refused or neglected to provide the opportunities we ought not to evade the responsibility which that neglect involves.  The principle concerned, we have already argued, is not very great.  There has been harshness in administration in respect of the blind and their applications for pensions.  This amendment would make it more difficult to be as harsh as the administration has been, because it would more clearly define what has been intended by the Blind Persons Act, and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, in moving this amendment, I think, referred to the fact that it is more directed towards the Blind Persons Act than to this particular Act.  In <Col N="2059" /> other words, it is the administration of the Blind Persons Act that is affected by this amendment.  One would wish that this could be dealt with by administration, or in a manner other than by bringing in what seems to me to be a dangerous amendment, that the administration of the Act as it stands would do away with any grievance such as Deputy Johnson outlined.  According to the amendment, as it stands here, it seems to me it would create a very great amount of difficulty, because there is no definition of what Deputy Johnson means by a person not totally blind.  That may be stretched to a very considerable extent, so that a person with a very fair use of their sight might get benefit. I do not say that Deputy Johnson means that, but we all know that over here we have a particular aptitude for searching out any little weakness in an Act of Parliament and taking the benefit of it to ourselves.  The acceptance of this amendment might lead to a very large increase in the scope of persons affected by the Old Age Pensions Act.  I think what Deputy Johnson wants, might, without this amendment be achieved in connection with the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  None of us feel that the right of throwing out the claims in the case of blind persons should be too closely exercised.  There are various, and very different kinds of blind people.  There are people born blind, people who become accidentally blind, and people blind from infirmities.  In the case of persons born blind, I certainly would like to see the State&mdash;if there was need for it&mdash;trying to make those people self-supporting.  Of course if blindness comes on later in life, it becomes more difficult to deal with it in that way.  It seems to me that the whole range of Old Age Pensions would be very much affected by the amendment as it stands at present in Deputy Johnson's name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has to be borne in mind that, short as the time the Blind Persons Act has been in operation, there has been a great deal of abuse in connection with it.  I <Col N="2060" /> told the Dáil some time ago that, I think, in the Counties of Kerry and Mayo there was one person in every 430 or so of the population getting the Blind Pension.  That is to say there were that many people over 50 years of age having means of less than £26 10s. a year, and supposed to be so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential.  In other counties, I mentioned in particular the Co. Monaghan, there was only one person in every 4,000 getting this pension. Certain steps have to be taken to deal with that abuse.  A Medical Inspector, who has special knowledge in matters of eyesight, has been sent around to examine pensioners and applicants and the matter is being remedied, but I have no doubt at all that if we were to widen the Act in the way that Deputy Johnson would suggest that such abuses would be very likely indeed to grow up, and it would be in fact almost impossible to check or prevent them. We would then have one person of a particular occupation deemed to be blind and another person whose eyesight was worse deemed to be not blind. We would have a person in the County Mayo deemed to be blind, and a person in Dublin whose eyesight was much worse deemed to be not blind.  We would have all sorts of difficulties like that, and you would have nothing but discontent and dissatisfaction arising from that.  I would be surprised to learn that the Act is so administered that a person has to be stone blind before receiving the pension.  I certainly think that should not be so, and I would be prepared to undertake and see that the law, as it exists, was not so rigidly adhered to and that all that should be required to qualify persons for a blind pension would be that they should be so blind as to be unable to perform work for which eyesight is essential.  I think it is reasonable, in all the circumstances, that people should be required to make an effort and to adapt themselves to take up some sort of work to which they have not been accustomed in order to assist in earning their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Minister's main objection is contained <Col N="2061" /> in the next proposal, Amendment 25, which authorises the Minister to appoint a competent practitioner skilled in eye diseases and tests of that kind. If it is a fact that cases have been passed for pension where the blindness was not of such a defective nature as to warrant a pension under the Blind Persons Act, it was probably the fault of the local practitioners through their sympathies.  If that is the fault, which I do not admit for a moment, or if it is a fact rather that people have obtained pensions who are not entitled to them under the Blind Persons Act, the next amendment gives the central authority the right specifically which it already has, but has not exercised, except in these few instances to which the Minister refers as to appointing a real authority on eyesight.  That is the answer, I think, to the only objection of validity which the Minister has made. If it is a fact that ten times the number of people are obtaining pensions under the Blind Persons Act per thousand in Kerry than in Monaghan, then that either means that the people in Kerry are ten times more immoral or that there has been ten times more stringency imposed in Monaghan, or that the people in Monaghan are so prosperous as to be able to return a Minister for Finance to the Dáil and to remove them out of the region of the Old Age Pensions law.  I do not know whether the Minister wants to suggest that Kerry is particularly immoral in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine that the facts are that the <Col N="2062" /> blind persons were not accepted in America.  There may have been too much leniency, and there may have been a desire to rob the British Treasury. The chickens are coming home to roost now.  When people were encouraged to do these things in the past they were smiled at and lauded, and we ought to be prepared to pay for it, not they. I am sorry the Minister has not given any encouragement for the acceptance of this amendment, but it is important, and the blind people have pleaded and urged that better provision should be made for them in this country.  They have urged and pleaded that the second part of the Blind Persons Act should have been put into operation, but it has not been put into operation, and this proposed new Section will at least prevent a too harsh administration of the Act, and will, as I submit, lead to the application and the intentions of the original Bill regarding the state of blindness.  I assert on the authority of those who have been closely associated with this matter that stone blindness is, in fact, being the test that is used, whereas the whole tenour of the Act and of the report of the commission on which the Act was based, defined blindness in various terms, and showed that the fitness for earning a livelihood ought to be taken into account.  That is not being done at present, and I would ask the Dáil to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before determining any question as to whether a person is qualified by reason of blindness to receive an old age pension under Section 1 of the Blind Persons Act, 1920, the central pension authority may require the person to submit himself, at some place within the county in which he resides for examination by a registered medical practitioner possessing competent knowledge of diseases of the eye and appointed for the purpose by the local pension committee with the approval of the central pension authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil has not yet agreed to insist upon a provision of the Blind Persons Act being administered in such a way as to make it more lenient for the blind person, but I want to urge upon the Minister for Local Government, who is not present, and who might well be present, to consider in the framing of laws which he will have the administration of, the necessity for reviewing the method of applying this Blind Persons Act.  The object of the amendment is to allow the Minister to require that the person should submit himself to examination by a registered medical practitioner possessing a competent knowledge of diseases of the eye, and appointed for the purpose.  If such a person is appointed it will be within the power of the administrative authority to have the person examined by such competent specialist.  That would remove the possibility of the charge which the Minister made as to the ease with which persons had been able to obtain pensions under this Act.  I will call the Minister's attention to a resolution passed by the Kilkenny County Council, which I am sure the various members for that constituency have had a part in.  If they have not actually been participants in the promotion of the resolution, I am sure they have assented to it.  It deals with this measure, and particularly with the administration of the Blind Persons Act.  The resolution was passed on the 25th February, Senator de Loughry being in the Chair, in the temporary absence of Deputy Gibbons, who, I am sure, also assents to it, and will not oppose the County Council, of which he is Vice-Chairman. After dealing with two other portions of the Bill, which I will not refer to, the resolution comes to No. 3:&mdash;&ldquo;The Blind Persons Act to be administered more broadly, there being <Col N="2065" /> for the past two years extreme difficulty for anyone not stone-blind to get a pension.&rdquo;  I have only had that put into my hand since I spoke on the last amendment, but it confirms the information I have had from other places that, as a matter of fact, for the last two years there has been a very strict administration of the Blind Persons Act, and that in fact none but stone-blind persons have been able to obtain a pension.  I am moving this amendment because I want to press upon the Ministry that they should revert at least to the position prior to 1922 in regard to this position of the Act. Through the acceptance of this amendment the Ministry are protected against malingering, or against any possibility that the person applying for the pension is deceiving the authorities in regard to his blindness.  I believe that there will be some day, at any rate, a more generous interpretation of this Act by the Minister responsible, and I want to give powers specifically to the more generous interpreters of the Act even in future.</P>
    <P>I would like it to be understood that this new Section will enable the Minister to safeguard himself against malingering, which he alleges as having been common, and the cause of the extreme stringency in the administration of the Blind Persons' Act.  I am anxious that the administration should be such as to allow persons who are blind, but not stone-blind&mdash;yet incapable of earning a livelihood because of the absence of sight&mdash;to obtain a pension, and that there should be no interpretation of the law which assumes that only stone-blindness is referred to.  The acceptance of the amendment will protect the Minister against malingering.</P>

      <P>Steps have been taken to have cases of malingering or pretended blindness dealt with.  A Medical Inspector of the Local Government Department is, for the present at any rate, giving his time entirely to dealing with blind pensioners and applicants for blind pensions.  It is felt that that Inspector will be able to deal with new cases.  Where an applicant's claim is disputed he can appeal to the Local Government Department, and before the <Col N="2066" /> appeal is decided he will be seen by this particular Inspector.</P>

      <Col N="2068" /> Before Section 8 to insert a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In determining the age of a claimant or pensioner under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1924, or the Act of 1920, a local Pension Committee or the Central Pension Authority shall be free to act on the best evidence reasonably available in the matter and to decide the question of age on the evidence submitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that Deputy McGoldrick had the best of reasons for putting down this amendment, and I am equally certain that he consulted with members of the party with whom he is associated, and that he concocted this amendment as a result of their combined wisdom.  That being the case.  I have no doubt that the Minister is prepared, at least, to consider favourably this amendment, though he may want to make some verbal alterations. The local Pensions Committee and the Central Pension Authority, as the case may be, are supposed to act upon the best evidence available, and this amendment is to make them free to do so.  I presume that means that the Pension Authority is the Minister for Local Government, and in deciding upon the evidence they shall not be bound by the Minister for Finance.  I take it that that is the real meaning of this amendment&mdash;that the Pension Authority shall be free, meaning thereby free from the Minister for Finance.  While I am not pretending to be interpreting Deputy McGoldrick's purpose as clearly as he would, I think that is probably the purpose of the amendment.  I will assume that all those who supported him in framing the amendment will give it support verbally as well as in the division list if necessary.</P>

    <P>This amendment needs no argument from me because it is quite obviously and clearly a half-way house.  It assumes that there will be a reduction, but that the reduction will not be as great as that suggested in the Bill. The object of it is somewhat like that of the other amendments that have been moved, that the blow which this reduction will cause should be as light as possible.  Everything that has been stated against the cut in the old age pensions is an argument why this amendment should be accepted, and I do not propose to repeat those arguments.</P>

      <P>I think a little more is required to be said in favour of this amendment.  It has not been possible to make any aggregate estimate of the saving to be effected by the amendment, but no more has it been possible to make any aggregate estimate of the saving to be effected by the Bill.  The Minister hopes to save to the Treasury £500,000.  In other words, he hopes to <Col N="2071" /> deprive the Old Age Pensioners of £500,000.  This amendment, so far as one can make an estimate without the data, would probably mean a saving of £130,000.  That is not £130,000 as contrasted with £500,000.  It is £130,000 as contrasted with £250,000 or £300,000. The other £200,000, presumably, is to be saved in any case by rigid administration. What we are discussing is the difference between £130,000 and £250,000.  The effect of the amendment would be to maintain the maximum pension at its present level, 10/-.  He applies it only to those who have means not over 8/- a week, instead of those who have means up to 10/- a week, as at present, as against 10/- in the Bill. It graduates at 2/- steps instead of 1/- steps.  I would suggest there is, perhaps, good reason for crying halt, even if only in a half-hearted way, regarding this contemplated reduction, and that we should not go quite so far as the House, or the majority of the House, has been prepared to go, thereby carrying the decision of the House, in view <Col N="2072" /> of the apparent growing feeling in the country, and certainly in the city against this policy.  One cannot tell what the main issues in the elections of yesterday were, but I have very little doubt that pensions played a considerable part.  One would like that the voice of the country should be heard in a matter of this kind.  Perhaps, the necessity for endeavouring to secure an opinion, or shall I say a decision on the definite proposition and the expense the President feared might be involved in taking a referendum, might be avoided even by the acceptance of this amendment. I think it is clear that the country does not desire that this Bill should pass in its present form.  I do not think the country would desire it to be passed in any form, but as a via media, the amendment would save the necessity for a referendum, and save the Government from defeat at the next election.</P>

    <P>This amendment is put forward as a final attempt to endeavour to make the best of what we believe to be a very bad job.  The effect of the amendment is to maintain the 10s. a week pension for those who have no private means, or only means not over 6s. a week, while maintaining the maximum total income at 16s. weekly, as fixed by the Bill.  The total savings effected by the amendment, so far as the available information goes, is estimated to be £220,000 per year.  I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I could not accept the amendment, and I point out, further, that even the acceptance of the amendment in regard to the people over 80 years of age, which I announced the other night, will cost, for the first year, well over six figures. I cannot give the exact amount yet because, having accepted the amendment moved by Deputy Daly, I intend to accept it in full and to go a little further than the exact wording he proposed would carry.  But that particular amendment, leaving out the persons over 80 years will, in the first year, cost a good deal over £100,000, and it would be impossible, in view of that, to accept any further amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the statement of the Minister shows how necessary it was for him to accept that amendment.  The fact that there are so many people of that age who would be penalised to the extent of £100,000 by the Bill, as originally introduced, shows the importance of having the amendment accepted, and that the people over 80 at least should be allowed to die with the sense that they had not been starved to death.  I think it is necessary to draw attention to the effect of this amendment of Deputy Davin, and to amplify it.  As he says, the total income as fixed by the Bill will be maintained.  The amendment would leave it that the person whose means were 6s. per week would still have the 10s. per week pension as distinct from the 9s. per week of the Bill.  The Minister, in the earlier stages of today's discussion, rather suggested that that is the contemplation of the state of the old age pensioner who was entitled to full pension, so that he should be entirely dependent on the pension, that he should be a person with no means, without even privileges provided by his family, and he seems to assume that it is possible for people to live on the pension of 9s. a week.</P>
      <P>Apparently he will agree that a pension of 9s. a week may accompany an income in the form of privileges, house room, and food, provided that the house room and food does not exceed 7s. a week in value, as valued by the Pensions Officer.  He has told us that his contemplation was that the pensions were not intended to supplement private income, and included in the term &ldquo;private income&rdquo; are privileges provided by sons and daughters of the aged.  I am asking the Dáil to agree with me that in the year 1924 no person can live decently in this country on a pension of 9s. a week, and it is a very grave question whether any livelihood provided by a son or a daughter of a pensioner could be estimated by the pension officer as being valued at less than 7s. a week in the city of Dublin where rents are as they are, or in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, or any other towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, therefore, asked to believe that the pension is only to be given to those who have neither house room, nor food, nor clothing, provided by their friends or relatives; that it is in fact for the utterly distressed and for the utterly distressed alone and that it is an alternative to the poor law relief.  Is that <Col N="2075" /> the intention of the Minister?  Is it his intention in framing this Bill and presenting it to the Dáil and persuading the Dáil to pass it, that the pension is to be considered as an alternative to poor law relief?  Or is it his intention that they should supplement the pension by poor relief?  Is it the intention of the Government, which is presenting this Bill, that its influence with the Minister in the Department of Local Government shall be such as to impress upon the local authorities that the receipt of an old age pension must not disqualify the recipient from receiving poor relief?  It would be well if the Dáil knew the position of the Government in this matter, because the pensioner cannot live on the 9s. which is to be provided. It must be supplemented in some way. Is it to be by outdoor relief?  Or is it to be supplemented by the provision that is made by the friends and relatives of the pensioners?  If the latter, is it to be presumed that that supplement must be of such a quality as not to be worth more than 7s. a week?</P>
    <P>The amendment will not go very far in placing the pensioner, in view of the Minister's statement to-day, in a state of comfort.  But at least it will, in the case of persons who have no property whatever and no privileges whatever, save them one shilling per week.  The other stages are based upon the scale at present available as against the steps of one shilling in the Bill, but the main effect would be to assist those people whom the Minister has intimated as being the class that he is thinking of when he is talking of old age pensioners&mdash;that is, those who have no means or privileges.  Surely the Dáil is not going to say that these people should be deprived of the shilling. I am quite certain that it is not generally realised that the Minister is now accomplishing a revaluation of the instincts of the son and daughter, the friendliness, and the duty to parents, and is going to value these in such a way as will deprive the pensioners of the State bounty.  You are not only going to penalise the pensioners, but you are penalising the sons and daughters of the pensioners who are trying to do their duty under <Col N="2076" /> very great difficulties of unemployment, bad times and low wages, and yet are trying to keep their parents. Because they are trying to keep their parents, you are going to penalise the parent and the son, or the parent and the daughter, by cutting those pensions, because, accompanying the cutting of the pensions, you are revaluing the perquisites which are provided by the sons and daughters for the father and mother.</P>
    <P>The effect of it all is going to be to deprive these people, mainly the poor, of comforts as well as necessaries.  I ask the Dáil to agree with Deputy Davin that at least this should be retained for the pensioners.  If we cannot do better, let us at least try to retain this little comfort for them in the few days they have to live.  The cost to the Exchequer is, no doubt, a very important matter indeed to the Ministry, but let us try to think of the cost to the pensioner for once, and bear in mind that though you may be relieving the Treasury and that though you may be relieving the finances of the State, you are going to impose it upon, in very many cases, the State in another form.  You are going to impose it upon the poor law, upon the local authorities and, if not upon the local authorities, you are imposing it upon the poorest of the people who are trying to keep their parents in something like comfort.  I ask the Dáil to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.  I regret that we have to introduce this measure at all.  I think I need hardly go over the arguments that have been used here time after time.  The whole business of interfering with the old age pensioners is a very painful business, and one which we do not like.  But we have a duty to the old age pensioners in common with the rest of the country.  There is no doubt at all if we were to fail to take steps, painful as they may be, which will put this country straight financially, we would have a condition of affairs that would mean that we might give nominally 10/- a week to the pensioners, and in reality give them less real value than they would now get for 9/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> The idea of sticking rigidly to a 10/- maximum and not facing the other factors of the situation is not really considering the interests of the pensioners in the long run.  We are best considering their interests by trying to put this country straight financially.  If we fail to do that, any particular kindness or tenderness that we might show to pensioners will not prove to be a kindness or a tenderness to them in a few years time.  The burden that has been cast on the country by the events of the last couple of years makes it necessary to effect the saving that will be effected by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us whether there is any use whatsoever in the minority of the Dáil asking him to consider any amendment?  As far as I can see, he has given the one reply to practically every amendment that has been put down on the Bill.  I think it would be just as well that he would inform the Dáil and the Opposition now that, as a result of his having a majority that will be able to carry this Bill, he will not budge an inch, and will refuse to accept any amendment, and the Bill must go through as it is printed.  He has given the same reply to every amendment, and it seems to me there is no use in moving any further amendments to the Bill.  I thought he would have accepted this particular amendment, because it is a reasonable one; yet the reply he has given to it is the same as the reply he has gave to previous amendments that have been rejected.  I think some consideration ought to be given to the arguments of the minority, and when they make a good case it should receive the careful attention of the Government, and there should be no effort on the part of the Government to inflict punishment, because this is punishing not alone the pensioners, but the sons and daughters of pensioners, who are doing their utmost to keep their aged parents from <Col N="2078" /> entering the workhouse.  The alternative to the amendments that are proposed is the workhouse.  It appears nobody but a pauper is going to get the pension in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am forced to say another word or two in regard to this amendment, on account of the arguments that we are hearing so often in the Dáil, that the economy that is being effected in this, as in many other instances, is as a result of the burden cast on the nation by other people. Now, although I must agree that the Minister is brutally blunt and quite frank and honest in many cases in the statements that he makes, I regret I cannot accept that argument.  In the course of next week we will have a supplementary estimate coming before us making provision for salaries at the rate of £1,500 a year, a sum which indicates no reduction on the salaries that were previously paid for similar work.  If you are going to penalise one section of the community, and if the reason is the alleged reduction in the cost of living, then I think that those people whom you are asking us to vote £1,500 a year salaries to, should suffer in the same way as you are asking the old age pensioners to suffer.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the particular provisions set out in this Resolution is to ensure that the proportion of charges as between the Central Authority and the Local Authorities shall remain as it has been heretofore.  This particular Bill will effect savings in connection with the Jurors' Lists by joining them with the Electors' Lists, and it is proposed under this Bill to ensure that the full proportion of the savings effected will come to the Government, and that they will not be merely savings to the Local Authorities.  In the past the Central Authority paid half of the total charges of the register, while the Local Authorities paid the whole of the charges in connection with the Jurors' Lists.  As the register now consists of Local Government Electors and Parliamentary Electors, the cost of preparing the lists has been divided.  It is estimated in the case of the Secretary of a County Council or of a Clerk to an Urban District Council, that about half the work in connection with the Jurors' Lists and about half the work in connection with the Electors' Lists, will fall on each respectively.  In the past the Government paid for half the work in connection with the Electors' Lists, and paid nothing in connection with the Jurors' Lists.  It is proposed, therefore, in future that we will pay one-quarter of the charge in connection with the combined lists.  In connection with the work of the rate collectors it is estimated that about one-third of the work that falls on the rate collector is in connection with the Jurors' Lists and two-thirds in connection with the Electors' Lists.  It is proposed to continue paying one-half of the charge of preparing the Electors' Lists, that is, one-third of the whole amount. In regard to C., it simply continues to pay one-half of the expenses of registration. In regard to paragraph 2, the adding of the Jurors' column to the Electors' Lists will increase the cost of the printing.  It is estimated that the adding of the Jurors' column will cost one-seventh.  The cost of printing the Electors' List is six-sevenths, and the Government will pay the half of that, which is three-sevenths.  The intention of the Resolution is to prescribe that the proportion as between the Central Authority and the Local Authority shall continue unchanged.  I move the resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise again the question touched upon yesterday in regard to this motion.  The effect of passing this motion, in its present form, is to limit very greatly the powers of the Committee of the Dáil in discussing the Bill itself.  I think it is certainly not necessary, and I doubt whether it is expedient, that the form of financial resolutions shall be such that the Dáil in Committee is precluded from altering the proportion, as in this case, of the moneys which may be paid by the Central Fund or <Col N="2083" /> by State Funds and by the local authorities, respectively.  I am not very much concerned with the merits of this particular resolution, but I am concerned with the limitations that are imposed upon the Dáil, and incidentally upon the Seanad, but they can look after themselves.  I think the effect of bringing forward financial resolutions in such a form as this will mean that we shall have to be very particular in discussing such resolutions, and probably it will mean a double Committee Stage in Money Bills.  It will mean that we shall have to propose amendments to the Resolution, so that the judgment of the House will be found and decided before we tie our hands.  Now, I think that these financial Resolutions ought to be vague rather than definite, and when we are asked to confine ourselves in a Resolution and limit our considerations to the Bill itself, it is a warning to us that we shall have to be very much more careful in our examination of the financial Resolutions, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to a Committee Stage discussion on the Resolutions and probably to a second Committee Stage discussion when we come to the Bill itself. I think it is unfortunate that that course should be adopted.  We had a warning, through the discussion that took place last week in the Seanad, and I am sorry that that warning has not been taken, and that the new Resolution is of this limiting kind. I am not going to oppose the resolution, but I protest against this method of confining the activities and considerations by the Committee to the terms of the Bill itself when we come to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has, in another way, put the same point that I had desired to put before the Minister for Finance.  I am not discussing the propriety of whether Financial Resolutions are or are not required under the Article.  The Article says merely this, that money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same Session been recommended by a Message.  That does not require that there should be any detailed setting forth of the purport <Col N="2084" /> and purpose of the Resolution.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, and you yourself, Sir, will perhaps correct me if I am wrong; both yourself and the Minister have had an opportunity of reading more of these Resolutions in the source of their inspiration than I have had, but those that I have read and those I have had access to have always been in general and vague terms such as would not preclude detailed discussion and amendment in Committee.  I do not recommend that that is the better course to adopt.  It has been the practice hitherto for the Dáil to meet here and find a Financial Resolution on the Orders of the Day without having had the terms of that Resolution indicated to Deputies or circulated with the time required for the circulation of a Bill.  If it should become the practice that a Financial Resolution was to go into such detail as to anticipate many of the matters that would normally arise in Committee, not only would we have a Committee Stage twice, but what would be involved would be, that Deputies would legitimately require that the Financial Resolution should be circulated in such time in advance to them that they would have an opportunity of putting forward the same amendments as they did propose to put forward on the Bill itself in Committee.  I think it would be in conformity with the appropriate use of these Financial Resolutions, if they were put in general and vague terms, so that the Dáil would not be restricted in its discussion of the Bill by the terms of the Resolution formulated. Like Deputy Johnson, I will not discuss the case from the point of view of the Seanad.  They are very well able to look after their own interest.  But, from the point of view of the Dáil, it does mean in this case that certain amendments that might be desirable, and that should be within the power of this House of the Legislature to bring forward and discuss in Committee, after the passing of this Resolution would be ruled by you, Sir, as out of order.  That, I think, is undesirable.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into the discussion of the general matter on this particular Resolution, if it can be avoided.  I would not accept <Col N="2085" /> the theory that the Resolution should always be vague and not definite.  I think that there are occasions, and especially if large sums were involved, where it would be most desirable to have the Resolution extremely definite. I am not saying that this is a case in which the resolution ought to be definite. It might well have been vague, but I think that there is no harm in having it definite in this particular case, seeing that its definiteness simply takes the form of prescribing that the proportions as between the National Exchequer and the local authorities shall remain as heretofore.  It would be impossible to go on with the matter if the Resolution in its present form were not acceptable to the Dáil, because we would require to have a fresh message.  I simply say that in this case the definiteness of the Resolution is not objectionable.  While frequently, perhaps generally, these Resolutions should be vague, I think there must arise, from time to time, occasions on which the Money Resolution ought to be absolutely definite, because the Constitution certainly contemplates that proposals for expenditure shall originate with the Executive.  I think that there are very good reasons for that provision, and that idea in the Constitution and the carrying out of it, might involve an extremely definite Resolution.</P>

      <P>Might I ask whether, if we pass a Resolution that it is expedient to authorise payment out of moneys in certain proportions, we are free to alter the proportions so long as the proportions of the total sum to be paid out of the money provided by the Oireachtas is not increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that has been my view.  It should be stated, in the beginning, that most of the Money Resolutions have been couched in general terms&mdash;I do not like the word &ldquo;vague.&rdquo;  I did not contemplate that the matter would arise this evening, and I have not by me exact copies of the Money Resolutions.  Deputies who were in the last Dáil, however, will recollect that the Money Resolution in connection with the Damage to Property Bill was simply a Resolution to authorise the payment from <Col N="2086" /> moneys provided by the Oireachtas of awards made or decrees granted under any Act of the present Session, and so on.  That was a general matter.  It was not general enough, however, to cover everything.  For example, it was held by me to exclude moneys to be paid by the Minister for Finance as a result of an agreement made between him and the Railway Companies, on the ground that that would not be money paid on a decree given by a Court.  That was a general Resolution. In the case of the Army Pensions Bill&mdash; I am speaking merely from recollection &mdash;we had a considerable discussion on the Money Resolution, which was restricted in one part and general in another.  That is to say, it provided for the payment of pensions to members of the Irish Volunteers and the Citizen Army of 1916, who had received wounds.  I think I warned Deputies, in the course of the discussion on the Resolution, that the word &ldquo;wounds&rdquo; was clear and definite, and in the Committee Stage certain amendments endeavouring to extend &ldquo;wounds&rdquo; to &ldquo;illness&rdquo; were ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the same Money Resolution provided for pensions to the dependents of deceased members of the Irish Volunteers and Citizen Army.  The word &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; was held to allow amendments of any kind to be moved in Committee&mdash;to allow the payment of pensions to the dependents of persons who died either from wounds received on active service, or by hunger-strike in prison, or in any other way, on account of the word &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; having been used.  In the case of the Ministers Bill&mdash;although I am least clear about it&mdash;the Money Resolution was merely to pay the expenses of any Act of the present session in connection with the Ministers and Secretaries Bill.  In the case of the Housing Bill, the Resolution simply prescribed a sum not exceeding £300,000, and, in effect, the restriction was to £300,000.  The point that Deputy Johnson has just raised arose very clearly on that Bill.  The sum in the Resolution was £300,000, and we were restricted to that.  It would not have been possible in Committee to move an amendment so as to make the expenditure on the Housing Bill greater <Col N="2087" /> than £300,000, but it would have been possible in Committee to move an amendment to devote the £300,000 in a different way from the way proposed in the Bill, but not to exceed that sum.  I think, however, it is right to say that, as a general rule, the Money Resolutions have been couched in general terms.  I think I have disposed, by the example of the Housing Bill, of the point Deputy Johnson raised, except that in this particular case it would be possible to move an amendment which would not exceed the total sum contemplated by this Money Resolution.  The mathematical problem of discovering how one would juggle with the fractions would, I am afraid, be out of my power to deal with.  The real restriction is that I think it would be impossible to alter the fractions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my difficulty. No sum is mentioned.  We are restricted if we pass this Resolution to one-fourth of the amount paid by the Council. We cannot say one-third and we cannot say one-fifth, no matter what our views may be as to the relative liability that should be imposed on the two bodies.  After consideration of the Bill itself, we shall not be allowed to alter the proportion.</P>

It seems to me that if we agree it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys in the following proportions:&mdash;One-fourth and one-third, we are binding ourselves to these proportions, inasmuch as we are not stating any sum.  We have not fixed any maximum.  It seems to me that we are trying to legislate in the terms of the Resolution.  It is a wrong method, I suggest, and whatever may happen to this Resolution, the local bodies will perhaps have something to say on it.  I think it is a very bad precedent.</P>

The word should really be &ldquo;general.&rdquo; Passing from that, I only want to <Col N="2088" /> underscore the sentence used by Deputy Johnson, that the Money Resolution and the Bill to follow adjust certain moneys that are going to be given in a certain proportion.  That proportion is exactly the legislative proposal.  It is not the financial proposal.  It is a legislative proposal hereafter to be considered in Committee.  Being the legislative proposal, the entire sum is the financial proposal.  The proportions in which that entire sum will be distributed is the legislative proposal, and, therefore, is a proper matter for Committee.</P>

      <P>The Resolution does not propose to distribute the appropriation amongst these several heads in certain proportions.  What it does propose is to appropriate out of public funds such a sum as shall be equal to one-fourth under one head of a certain expenditure, and to one-third under another head, and so on.  There are really three contributions to three several expenses or headings.  I suggest that, in that sense, they are general, as the amount of the expenses is not known.  They are definite, as an appropriation must be, to some extent, definite, in proposing to appropriate from public funds so much towards one heading of expense and so much towards another, whatever the expenditure may amount to, and that is really within the terms of Article 37.  Of course, the object of the Resolution before the Committee Stage is that the Dáil may exercise of itself alone appropriating authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate part of that argument is that it is left to be an indefinite sum.  The desire to be definite is only made to a very very slight degree, inasmuch as it is one-fourth of an indefinite sum, so that there is nothing gained by going to this extent in the way of definiteness.  It is indefinite because it is a proportion of an amount that is not known and cannot be known.  While I am not very confident about it, it seems to me that we would not be entitled under the Bill in Committee to alter these proportions, even to reduce this sum that is to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Of course, that means that the whole discussion upon the imposition of rates or payment for registration would have to take place upon this Resolution rather than upon the Bill.  As far as I am concerned, I am not going to press the point any further on this motion, but I would urge strongly that the practice of proposing <Col N="2090" /> such a Resolution as this in general terms should not be continued, or, shall I say, repeated, so that we shall not be under the obligation of having long Committee Stages and many amendments proposed to a Financial Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be open to reduce the amount, but one should question what it is leading to.  This is, as Deputy Johnson says, an indefinite sum, but it is a definite liability. Any indefiniteness there is indefiniteness which is the outcome of not having a definite census at hand, and one can only get that definiteness when a census is made.  If there is a large jury list in one area and there is a huge tract out of that into another, the changes would effect the cost in each district, though the ultimate effect would not be large unless the people were to clear out of the country.  There is there a particular, definite loss so far as we are concerned.  You have a little latitude with regard to its extension. If you extend the Jurors' List from its present form, say from 21 to 16, you would have a bigger liability than that contemplated.  I think the Resolution is water-tight, and foolproof.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5) This Section shall apply to electors for a University constituency subject to the modification that the registration officer, register of electors and electors' lists shall be those relating to the constituencies in which such persons would have been registered if they had not chosen to <Col N="2092" /> be registered for a University constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is put forward with the desire to be quite sure that University electors will not be able to get out of their liability to jury service by allowing themselves to be placed on a University register and not to be on any Local Government register.  I put it forward because I want to have the Minister's views as to whether there is any risk of University electors evading that responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such risk.  The Deputy, in forming that conclusion or that suspicion, seems to overlook the existence of a Local Government elector as distinct from a Parliamentary voter.  A juror may be defined roughly as a Local Government voter whose premises have a sufficiently high valuation.  To have premises of such value rated in one's name in a county is what makes a person a juror.  Take this case as an example.  A University elector has premises rated in his own name in the city of Dublin.  His name appears as a Local Government elector in the city of Dublin electorate, and he will be marked in this list as a juror for the city unless exempted for some other reason.  If he is not a Local Government voter he cannot possibly be a juror at all because he has not the necessary rateable qualifications.  The point raised by the Deputy is already covered by the Bill, and until we alter the law as regards the qualifications for jury service and these qualifications are not altered by the Bill, the whole law on the subject may be summed up by saying that in each county each person with the necessary amount of land or property rated in his name should be returned as a juror.  The provision of the Bill effects this adequately without the amendment which stands in the Deputy's name.  The official who makes up the jury book in each county has before him a complete list of each Local Government elector in the county.  He takes out all the occupied premises with the necessary valuation, and whether they happen to be University electors or not makes no difference whatever.  The point which the Deputy raises has been looked into very carefully, <Col N="2093" /> and I can give him an official assurance that University electors under this Bill or the existing law do not escape liability for jury service.</P>

      <P>I gather that the effect of this Section will be that the conditions of being required to serve on a jury will be that the intended jurors will be on the register of electors.  The bargain may be struck that it is cheaply bought to lose the vote in exchange for losing the liability for jury service.  Once you let that go abroad you will give an inducement to those people who do not want to get on to the jury list to avoid being placed upon the electors' list.  After all, the chance of voting in the South Dublin election once a year is not so ardently desired by people who are liable to be called to serve on juries.  I think they would reckon that they would be getting off cheaply if they could get an exemption from jury service at the cost of losing their right to vote.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is to alter the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; to &ldquo;person.&rdquo;  It is proposed in response to what I might call the spirit of the age, which desires to see equal rights and equal responsibilities in matters of citizenship for men and women, and that we shall not ask women to exempt themselves unless we ask men to exempt themselves on the same terms.  The Section provides for certain women being exempted from serving as jurors.  I am asking the Section to be altered to read that every person to whom this Section applies who is qualified and liable to serve as a juror in any administrative county or county borough, shall be entitled, if he so desire&mdash;and &ldquo;he&rdquo; includes &ldquo;she&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="2095" /> to be exempted from serving as such juror, and shall be entitled, if he so desires, to be entered on the Register of Electors as exempt from serving as a juror.  It is a claim for the equality of the sexes, and is inserted with a desire to fulfil Article 3 of the Constitution. We have laid it down from the beginning that we shall treat men and women equally in matters of citizenship. Article 3 of the Constitution says that every person, without distinction of sex, fulfilling certain conditions, shall enjoy the privileges and be subject to the obligations of such citizenship.  There is a distinct bond there that there shall be equal obligations, equal rights and responsibilities, and so far as citizenship goes, I do not think we should make a distinction between woman as woman and man as man.  If we later come to say that a woman of a certain class, with certain responsibilities, should be exempted, that is one thing.  Men have similar responsibilities.  They should be exempted too.  I do not think we should exempt them because of their sex.  Therefore I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a perfectly honest difference of opinion on this matter, but I am very well satisfied that a majority opinion in the country would favour my view rather than that put forward by Deputy Johnson.  The effect of the amendment is to limit exemption on request.  The Deputy knows that under the existing law this liability is, in fact, evaded, and evaded with the full consent and full approval of nine persons out of ten.  He thinks that is wrong.  He puts forward abstract principles about the equality of the sexes.  I admire Deputy Johnson on abstract principles.  I admire him more in the afternoon than in the evening, but no matter what abstract principles may be enunciated, there remains the fact that the woman juror has not been an outstanding success, and that this abstract principle has broken down in practice.</P>

I know that there are a certain number of women who are indignant at this proposal, who resent it almost as a slight on the sex, and who would expect the Government to undertake the very unpleasant task, and what I am sure would be a very difficult task, of rigidly enforcing the responsibility of jury service on thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands, of women who simply loathe the idea of that service. I am not prepared to do that, and I think it is better that the law should be moulded in accordance with facts in recognition of the fact that this service is extremely unpopular with women generally.  It is better to have it that way than simply to have the law openly evaded and flouted as it is at the moment.  The advanced ladies resent this feature of the Bill.  It is open to the advanced ladies to convert their less advanced sisters, but I am not prepared to undertake, in addition to other strenuous duties and responsibilities, the duty of seeing that the existing law with regard to jury service is enforced. I, therefore, suggest to the good sense of Deputies that it needs to be amended, and I put this forward as a practical amendment in accordance with facts which are well known to all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking not from any doctrinaire point of view, whether in the one direction or the other, I may say that, during the consideration of the Courts Bill, I received a number of representations and a certain number of deputations from, amongst others, what the Minister for Home Affairs would call, I suppose, advanced ladies&mdash;that is to say, societies of women who are interested in political affairs and think about these things perhaps more than their sisters. And on this subject I was surprised <Col N="2097" /> that they did put forward this, as I thought, moderate proposition.  As a matter of practical affairs, we all know that in the conduct of the courts a great deal of delay and annoyance is caused by the innumerable applications on the part of women to be dispensed from service on juries.  We know that there are a great number who are simply frightened out of their lives at the idea of going on juries in a civil or, still worse, in a criminal matter, and as a matter of saving public time it has been thought desirable that there should be some provision to ease that situation until what the Minister calls the advanced ladies have brought the rearguard up to their standard of education in public affairs, and have imbued them with a desire to take part in the duties of citizenship.  I discussed this matter with two or three of these deputations, and I understood from them that they would be willing, for the present, at any rate, to have a provision by which only women who applied to be put on jury lists should be put on them.  That does not appeal to me, because I think that it would not get the average woman.  It is better that you should have as jurors average people, with special exemptions of people, who, by reason of their temperament, their timidity, ought, as a mere matter of practical business, to be exempted from this particular duty in the present state of education and conduct of affairs.  This Section as it stands is a nearer approach to the transition stage when one anticipates all women will face this particular ordeal with equanimity, and I submit that this Section as it stands will ease the business of the courts by allowing women to apply at the proper opportunity for exemption in the particular cases mentioned in the Section.  It would relieve the courts from having cases for trial held up, and having exhibitions of nerves and what, I suppose, the Minister might call temperament, which are a disturbing factor in the Courts of Justice.  For this reason I support the Section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word or two in support of the action of the Minister in resisting this amendment. I think it is a futile thing to <Col N="2098" /> think that because women have the vote they can ever be put, in all cases, on equal terms with men.  It has never been suggested that they should be asked to serve in the Army.  I do not think our Minister for Defence has issued instructions for recruiting amongst the ladies, and hitherto they have not been asked to serve in the Navy, although a few of them have served surreptitiously, and I do not think it has been a great success.</P>

      <P>I do not think they have ever asked for that, but I think that serving on juries is one of these things that might be ranked amongst the things that women might be exempted from, just as they have been exempted, and have not been asked to serve hitherto in the Army or the Navy. I have always been a very strong supporter of women having votes, though I lived in an atmosphere that was hostile to that.  I do not think it has ever been sufficiently demonstrated that the majority of women were ever in favour of possessing the vote.  We know a great number of them are, and have made themselves heard, but there has never been a referendum taken on the subject in these Islands, and we have never known whether the majority of them wanted to be on the same terms as men or not.  That remains a matter of doubt, and I think there is no doubt that a very large number of the women look forward to serving on juries with the utmost dread, and a very large number of them are quite unfitted for it.  Those who are fitted for it have the right and can insist on serving, and no doubt in many cases they can be extremely useful, but to insist that every woman, because she has a vote&mdash;in many cases against her will&mdash;should be compelled to serve on juries is, I think, an outrageous thing. If we knew for certain that the majority of women had asked for those privileges they have got, then we would have every right to insist that in everything they should do as men do.  But they never were asked.  That being so, <Col N="2099" /> I think we have no right whatever to insist on every woman having to serve on a jury, which is repugnant and odious to a very large number of them, and in many cases, as the Attorney-General has mentioned, they are quite hopeless when they come to serve on juries.  Therefore, I give my strongest support to the Minister in resisting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately for the Deputy's argument, and even that of the Attorney-General, the Section does not accomplish the end that he seeks, and may I say that this service is odious to men.  The very fact that certain exemptions are made&mdash;a certain liability is imposed even in this Section on women to serve on juries&mdash;is because there is a belief that the men are just as antipathetic to service on juries.  I want to disabuse the Dáil of the notion that I am putting forward this amendment in response to any demand from what was called the advanced women.  I may be called an anti-feminist in this matter. I am seeking to impose on them an obligation, and not to relieve them of a liability. If they have demanded rights as they have, I say certain responsibilities have to follow those rights, and they had better refuse to go on the voters list if they are not to serve as jurors.  Let me point out that this Section applies to unmarried women, and to widows, and also to married women whose husbands are qualified and liable to serve as jurors in the same administrative county or county borough as that in which such women are themselves so qualified and liable.  If a married woman's husband is not qualified and liable to serve as a juror, then she is obliged to serve as a juror, and she may not claim exemption, so that the very Section itself is going to impose on women an obligation to serve as jurors, provided they are women whose husbands have found a way of avoiding liability.  Therefore the arguments of the Attorney-General, the Minister, and Deputy Woulfe fail when applied to women's repugnance to serving on juries.  You are by this very Section imposing on women an obligation to serve on juries, but you <Col N="2100" /> are imposing it on them rather as a punishment because their husbands have evaded liability for service.  The sins of the husbands shall be visited on the wives.  When the Section itself embodies such a principle how can you come and defend the Section on the grounds that you must not impose on women a liability to serve because it is repugnant to them?  Let me also point out the weakness of the case again.  You are talking about the advanced women; take any hundred women who may be liable to serve as jurors, and ten of them probably are actively interested in political affairs.  Those persons will take advantage of the exemption which is provided for them in this Bill.  They may be the kind of persons who ought to serve on the jury because of their active interest in public affairs.  But they claim exemption, and other people who are not interested, who take no interest in public affairs, and read only the picture papers and the fashion plates do not claim exemption.  But because they do not claim exemption, the least capable women for serving on juries are, by the very acceptance of this Section, going to be obliged to serve.  I say that is a complete inconsistency, and cannot be justified by the arguments adduced by the Attorney-General, the Minister, and Deputy Woulfe, as you are imposing on a section of women an absolute obligation to serve, notwithstanding your feeling that you should not impose such an obligation, that it is repugnant, and you do that because their husbands have failed in their duty. You impose it upon the wives, but then you invite the active citizens who are just as likely to desire to evade jury service as any active men because of their activity and their knowledge of and interest in public affairs, to apply for exemption.  But the other women who are domestic and are not troubled about public affairs will find their names on the jury list, because they did not apply for exemption.  Is that the intention of the Minister?</P>

      <P>I have had experience of a good many mixed juries, and from my observation I can say that the fashion-plate variety of ladies seems to have secured exemption to date.  As regards the other observations <Col N="2101" /> of Deputy Johnson relating to the question of women whose husbands are qualified and liable, the Section in that branch is drafted in order to prevent evasion.  That is to say, the husband and wife, one of whom ought to give service, are not to be allowed to escape. Formerly the man could escape by the wife being the rated occupier.  In future under this Section that will become a matter for settlement domestically.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2102" /> To delete sub-section (2) and to substitute in lieu thereof as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2) This Section applies to women who are mothers of, or responsible for the domestic care of a child or children under the age of sixteen years.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment designed to relieve from responsibilities those people who might reasonably be expected to be relieved and whom we should think of as being entitled to relief. That is to say, the Section entitled to be relieved of a liability shall be women who are mothers of, or responsible for, the domestic care of a child or children under the age of sixteen years.  If this is carried, it will secure that these people who, it is urged, should be allowed to look after their domestic responsibilities should do so. But it will not relieve the unmarried woman who has not this responsibility, and who is quite capable of serving efficiently as a juror.  It will not relieve these women simply because they desire to be relieved.  If Deputy Duggan's contention is to be accepted, why does he not move as one of the amendments that no woman shall be allowed to serve on a jury?  The Section, as it stands, as I have already said, imposes upon women the obligation of serving on juries.  But what class of woman? Those women whose husbands desire to be relieved of the obligation and secure excision from the Jurors' Lists and the Electors' Lists.  Then the obligation is imposed upon the woman.  You cannot consistently say that women should not be allowed to serve on juries, and put forward a proposition which imposes on them the liability to serve on juries, provided their husbands have done certain things or failed to do certain things.  I want to exempt from liability the mothers of children, and those who have the care of children, and unless you are going absolutely to remove women from the obligation and alter the law with respect to women, then I can understand your argument.  I take it this is implied; the woman that will want to serve on juries will be a particular type of woman and you are going to put them upon the list.  Are they going to make efficient jurors?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2103" /> Will Deputy Duggan say that his experience is that that particular type of person is going to make an efficient juror?  Is that particular type of woman going to conform to the theory of the jury system that the even citizen, the peers of the prisoner or the disputant shall decide the case?  You are practically saying that the neurotic women shall serve on juries because they may desire to serve on juries, and you are going to leave to that particular type of women the responsibility for deciding very grave issues.  I say they are not the type of women that you should urge or even allow to serve on juries to the exclusion of normal women.  I am asking, in this amendment, that women who are mothers of children shall be exempted, but so long as you are inviting women and making provision for women to serve on juries, I submit that it is not good policy to leave that service to those who specifically express their desire on the one hand, or who are negligent of their rights of exemption.  You will, under the Section as it stands, impose upon certain women the obligation. You will allow the keen public woman who is capable and efficient and aware of her rights and public interests, but is not desirous of serving the public interest. She will claim exemption and leave on the list the careless and those who specifically desire to serve.  No, I say that is not fulfilling the intention of the jury system which provides for a case being tried by the average man. You are selecting women, and that, I think, is not serving the intentions, and I suggest that the whole question should be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy's case breaks down when he remembers that the positive act of seeking exemption is necessary in order to secure exemption, that the ordinary course is that women serve equally with men on juries.  To meet the case of sensitive nervous women with a positive reluctance and a distaste for this service, we are saying that the women who seek exemption, who take the positive step of seeking exemption, shall automatically secure that exemption. Now, the Deputy says we are making <Col N="2104" /> one class of women liable.  We inserted the provision to meet the case of a man desiring to evade jury service, getting his property rated in his wife's name, and we say that in a case of that kind that one or the other of the pair shall be liable for jury service, and that if the man takes a step to get his property rated in the name of his wife with a view to securing exemption from jury service, that the net result of that will be to place liability upon the wife. I rather think if that provision remains in the Bill, and the Bill becomes law, that there will be very few cases of men taking that particular step.</P>
