      <P>A claim has been received from the Ministry of Defence in respect of loss sustained by Mr. P.J. O'Reilly, the caretaker of the Ballina Dispensary, arising out of the military occupation of a plot of ground at the Workhouse, Ballina.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Land Act, 1923, landlords lodge schedules of particulars to enable the Land Commission to collect compounded arrears of rent (if any) and payment in lieu of rent from the tenants.  If a tenant questions the accuracy of the particulars furnished by his landlord, it is open to him to object in the manner prescribed by the Rules of the Land Commission, and if the matter is not settled the objection is listed for hearing before the Judicial Commissioner.  If a tenant is found to be entitled to an allowance in respect of income tax, allowance is made in respect of it when demanding payment of compounded arrears of rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular estate referred to only four of the eleven tenants claimed an allowance in respect of income tax, <Col N="2524" /> and when issuing receivable orders to them for payment of compounded arrears of rent, allowance was made accordingly.</P>
    <P>In collecting payment in lieu of rent, however, allowance in respect of income tax is not made by the Land Commission, but on production by the tenant to the Inspector of Taxes of his receivable order duly receipted, he will make the appropriate allowance.</P>

The Land Commission is not in a position at present to say in how many of these cases the State Solicitor has found it necessary to issue processes in the County Court, nor can they state the amounts of the costs paid by the parties before and after entry.  The State Solicitor has been asked for the detailed particulars sought for in the question.</P>

      <P>The appeal upon the pension claim in this case was disallowed on the 31st July, 1923, on the ground of insufficient evidence of age.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is in the affirmative.  I have no information on the third part, but the decision already given cannot be reconsidered.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one to give the Minister for Finance power to issue securities in payment of compensation <Col N="2528" /> in Report cases.  In decree or award cases the principal Act provides that the Minister for Finance shall issue securities of certain amounts in payment of the amounts awarded.  In Report cases where the payment is, as it were, <i>ex gratia,</i> apparently, through an oversight, there is no power for the Minister to pay otherwise than in cash.  It is obviously undesirable that people who get reports should have a right to cash, whereas people who have got decrees or awards will receive in certain cases securities.</P>

      <P>It is, because we wish that there should be no delay in meeting these cases.  As we do not want to pay cash in full, except in the very small cases, we would like to have power to issue securities, and I do not think that, on examination, it will be found that the Bill is of a contentious character.  I think it is a principle that if it had been included in the original Bill would have been passed as being in line with the general provisions.</P>

1.  The Committee has made progress in the matters referred to it, but is not yet in a position to present a final and comprehensive Report.  The Committee, however, desires to make the following interim Report on matters arising out of its examination of the Tailteann Games Appropriation<Col N="2530" />Account for the Year 1922-23, for the reason that an Estimate for the current year in respect of Aonach Tailteann was recently passed in Committee on Finance in the Dáil.  The Resolution supplying the Grant is about to be reported, and the Committee deems it to be its duty to present this interim Report before the final disposal of the Estimate.</entry>

Sa chéad dul síos, ba mhaith leis an gCoiste go dtabharfadh an Dáil fé ndeara an ainm a tugtar ar an Meastachán, mar a ritheadh é ar dtúis i 1922, eadhon &ldquo;Meastachán ar an méid is gá sa Bhliain dar críoch 31 Márta, 1923, mar Dheontas i gCabhair chun feabhas do chur ar Pháirc an Chrócaigh mar gheall ar Aonach Tailteann.&rdquo;</entry>
            <entry>2.  The Committee, in the first place, directs the attention of the Dáil to the description of the Estimate, as originally passed in 1922, viz., &ldquo;Estimate of the amount required in the Year ending 31st March, 1923, as a Grant in Aid for the improvement of Croke Park in connection with the Tailteann Games.&rdquo;</entry>

            <entry>3.  Is mian leis an gCoiste neadheimhnitheacht an Deontais a deonadh amhlaidh do chur in úil agus a rá fós gur le Cumann Gaedhlach na gCleas Lúith amháin an feabhas a cuireadh ar Pháirc an Chrócaigh. Rud eile, ní léir ón scrúdú a dhin an Coiste ar an gCuntas go bhfuil an Cumann ag tógaint aon fhiachais ortha féin maidir le blianta eile ina gcomórfar Aonach Tailteann.  Maidir le buaine an fheabhais a dineadh amhlaidh le cúnamh cistí puiblí, braitheann an Coiste gur cheart a chur in úil don Dáil ná fuil Cumann Gaedhlach na gCleas Lúith ag tógaint aon fhreagarthachta ortha féin lasmuich den Pháirc do thabhairt uatha i gcóir Aonach na bliana so.</entry>
            <entry>3.  The Committee wishes to point out the indefiniteness of the grant thereby made, and that the improvements effected in Croke Park become wholly the property of the Gaelic Athletic Association.  Furthermore, the examination made into the account by the Committee does not show that the Association assumes any liability in respect of future years in which Aonach Tailteann will be held.  Having regard to the permanence of the improvements thus made out of public funds, the Committee feels that the Dáil should be made aware that the Gaelic Athletic Association assumes no responsibilities beyond affording the use of the Park for the current year's games.</entry>

4.  A further matter arose out of the investigation of this account by  the Committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, in the course of his examination, laid before the Committee an extract from the Press dated 18th April, 1923, in which the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the General Council of the Tailteann Games was alleged to state that &ldquo;the accounts of the Council were duly audited by the Comptroller and Accountant-General and found satisfactory in every way.&rdquo;  No such audit was, in fact, made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General; and correspondence which passed between him and the Chairman of the Finance<Col N="2532" />Committee of the Games was produced to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was shown therein that the Chairman of the Finance Committee completely agreed that the Comptroller and Auditor-General had no responsibility for passing the accounts in question.  Having regard to these facts, a statement made by Deputy J.J. Walsh during the recent discussion in the Dáil on the Estimate for Aonach Tailteann for the current year is one on which the Committee feels obliged to comment.  It was that &ldquo;our Accounts have been duly audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and that point should be understood,&rdquo; the Accounts referred to being those of the General Council of the Tailteann Games.  The facts brought out in evidence before the Committee enables it to say that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has neither audited the Accounts in question nor certified them in any way.</entry>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say, in connection with this Report, that of the total amount voted the Tailteann Games Committee has received to date only a sum of £6,500.  That is a sum which, of course, is not disputed in the Interim Report.  It is rather inferred that the amount has not been audited. I wish to say that this grant&mdash;or rather the part of it spent in 1922&mdash;was audited in December of that year.  The further expenditure up to May, of 1923, was also audited, and a further audit was held last month.  Copies of the first two audits were duly transmitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and it appears now that that gentleman is not entitled to audit a grant-in-aid.  I had come to the conclusion, with the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Games, that those accounts were duly audited.  I now find that, though they were submitted in the ordinary way, they have not been so audited.  That of course, is no fault of ours.  I wish to say that we were led to the conclusion that the audit had taken place by the fact that a certain query had been put to our Finance Committee in respect of the first Report.  That query was duly answered.  The second point dealt with in this Interim Report refers to a grant of £10,000 to Croke Park, and exception is taken to the omission of any clause providing that in future years Aonach Tailteann should get the benefit of this grant.  It occurred to nobody at the time that a provision of this kind was necessary, and I do not believe now, that were it requested from the Gaelic Athletic Association Authorities, any great difficulty would be found in meeting the wishes of the Finance Committee.  I believe the Gaelic Athletic Association would be satisfied that until such time as the £10,000 were exhausted, taking into account that share of the gate receipts which should properly go to the grounds people, that the grounds would be at the disposal of the Tailteann organisation.  In that way the Dáil and the public funds would be fully satisfied.  The Gaelic Athletic <Col N="2533" /> Association made no request for this money.  It came, in the first instance, I think, at the instigation of the late General Collins, and some others, and arose out of the fact that the venue was not a suitable one for a great national venture of this kind.  In my opinion it is a step nowise different from that taken by other countries on the occasion of similar festivals.  I am not in a position to speak officially for the G.A.A., but I am satisfied that they have no desire whatever to benefit in the least by this grant and that they are prepared to meet the requirements of the Public Accounts Committee.</P>

      <P>I should say that it is not the Public Accounts Committee has any requirements in the matter. The Committee felt itself bound to inform the Dáil of the actual position in view of the recent Vote.  We point out that the sum granted in the year 1922-23 was a grant-in-aid for the improvement of Croke Park in connection with the Tailteann Games, and, as it turned out, it was, in fact, a grant to the G.A.A. for this purpose.  Latterly, it appears the Tailteann Committee has been the body to whom advances have been made.  In the matter of the audit, it is true that an account signed by the Auditor was sent to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  He asked a question in respect of it and received an answer.  But that is not intended to suggest that he had, as an official of the Dáil, audited the accounts of the Committee.  The object of the Committee in reporting on this was to make the Dáil aware of the fact that the statement made here by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was a misstatement; that it was not a fact that the accounts had been duly audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The accounts that had been audited had been audited by the Auditor of the Association, and no attempt at an audit had been made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It is not suggested for a moment by the Committee that he should audit those accounts.</P>

      <P>A series of these motions coming in relation to a number of Bills will, I am afraid, develop a bad habit on the Ministerial Benches, and I want, if possible, to put a brake upon that bad habit.  In this case there <Col N="2535" /> may be good reason for it, but we do not know.  We thought there was good reason when there was an expectation that a number of Bills would have to be passed within a very short time. Now that it appears that expectation has vanished, there is no need for this. We are probably going to sit here for two months, instead of two weeks, and it seems to me unnecessary to agree to this motion without further reason given.  I would like the Minister to give us some reasons why such a motion should be agreed to by the Dáil.  The only justification I can see was that it was a Bill which it was necessary to pass within a limited period.  The period seems now to have been prolonged very much, and, therefore, the reason for haste probably has vanished.  I would like the Minister to tell us what is the position.</P>

If there is any serious objection to taking the last stage of the Bill now, I would not propose to press it. But some of the matters covered by the Bill are important.  Take, for instance, Section 11.  There are certain cases outstanding covered by that section, which are cases of some hardship and some urgency.  My desire was to <Col N="2536" /> get the Bill as quickly as possible before the Seanad for its consideration.

      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; in line 49 to the end of the sub-section and substitute therefor as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;each such person shall be credited in respect of the period during which he has been a person to whom this section applies such number of contributions as is the nearest integral equivalent of the sums which would have been paid in respect of him as employed person's contribution and State contribution, but not as employer's contribution, if he had continued to be employed in an insurable occupation during the whole of the period aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has relation to the position of members of the National Army who have been demobilised.  In discussing the Bill last year, objection was made when a proposal was put forward from these Benches regarding the Unemployment Insurance of keeping soldiers in benefit.  The objection made was that the ordinary relations between employer and employed should not appertain in respect to the State <Col N="2539" /> and its armed forces.  It is, as a consequence of the position taken up by the Ministry then, that this amendment seeks to impose upon the State a liability for paying the State share and the employed person's share of the ordinary insurance contribution.  In general, it really means about two out of three contributions, but it is drafted in such a way as to embody the employed person's contribution and the State's contribution, leaving out the employer's contribution.  It seeks, in fact, to add to the number of contributions which the soldier has credited to him according to his service in the Army.  That stands, roughly, in the relation of two to three.  If he serves three weeks then he would have two weeks' contributions.  The State, as a matter of fact, provides clothing, food and medical attendance while the man is serving, and I think it is not an unreasonable suggestion that it should also provide insurance against unemployment after that person has been demobilised.</P>
    <P>The position created by the Bill is that a soldier might receive up to 24, or even 48, contributions if he had served two insurance years, but these are not additions to his credits.  He would only get credit such as would bring him up to those figures.  He must have had at least ten contributions to his credit before he gets anything, so that the maximum addition is from 14 to 38 contributions..  If he has already got 24 or 48 according to the number of years served, he will get no addition whatever by the scheme of the Bill, but under the amendment all the soldier's previous contributions will remain with him, with the addition of two weeks out of three.  That is in fact, what it means.  I think the case should be readily understood if I say that the proposal is to make the State liable for the insured person's contributions during all the time he is in the service, minus the employer's share. In the ordinary way the State pays 6¾d., the employer 10d., and the employed person 9d.  The proposal is, that while in the service of the State, the soldier should receive credit for the 9d. and the 6¾d., leaving unprejudiced <Col N="2540" /> the position that was taken up by the Ministry last year, which was that the State would not act in the relation of employer to a soldier.  I beg to move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This alteration, if accepted, would lead to great complication in the administration of the Act, and in the greater percentage of cases would not be as advantageous to the soldier as the proposal in the Bill.  A little detail is necessary to show that.  Payments, by way of contributions, are made up in this way: The employer pays 10d., the employed person 9d., and the State 6d. and the one-third of a penny.  This proposition is, roughly, that the 10d. be not paid, but that the 9d. and 6d. and one-third of a penny be paid.  That is to say, that the 1s. 3d., plus the one-third of a penny, be paid for every insurable person during the period of employment.  That is the real meaning of this amendment, but that 1s. 3d., plus the one-third of a penny, is only equal to a fractional portion of the total contributions.  It would take 39 of these proposed contributions to make up the 24 contributions proposed under the Bill&mdash;that is to say that 39 of these would only be equal to the 24 which is the proposal in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These thirty-nine contributions have to be taken in reference to the normal period of service of the ordinary soldier.  Thirty-nine contributions would be about as advantageous as the twenty-four to a person who had nine months' service.  To a person with over nine months' service the proposal would be better, and to a person with less service the proposal would be decidedly worse.  For a person who served for a period in each of two insurance years the proposal in the Bill is decidedly more advantageous than the proposal in the amendment.  It is a fact that most of the men's service was under nine months.  If those figures are realised and accepted&mdash;and I would like to have them examined and checked&mdash;they will show that it takes thirty-nine contributions to equal the twenty-four of the Bill, and that these thirty-nine will be only advantageous to people who have more than <Col N="2541" /> nine months' service in an insurance year.  The great majority of the National forces did not operate longer than nine months.  This is less advantageous to the big majority of soldiers and would cause immense difficulty in the administration of the Act.  For that reason I urge against the acceptance of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the point which the Minister has made, that I should not press this amendment if it is going to be of less advantage to the soldier. I think, however, that the Minister has overlooked the fact that under the scheme in the Bill the soldier will not get any contributions credited to him unless he had some already credited before he joined.  In the proposal in the amendment he will receive credit whether he was already insured or not, and that makes all the difference to the Minister's argument.  Under the proposal in the amendment the fact that he is in the Army brings him into an insurable occupation, and while I would much have preferred to have proposed full credit I deferred to the Minister's decision, or, rather, that of his predecessor last year, and eliminated the employer's contribution.  Far from the proposal being less advantageous I think in fact it ensures that all soldiers leaving the Army would be leaving the Army in insurance. Under the proposal of the Bill unless he were already an insured person when joining the Army he would not be in benefit.  I think I am right in that.  If that is a correct statement of the case, I submit that the proposal in the amendment is distinctly better than that in the Bill, and that a large number of men who have left the Army and find themselves not only without Army pay and without employment but without insurance, would have their grievance met to some extent by bringing them under insurance.</P>

      <P>I dealt mainly with the more technical point in the amendment.  Deputy Johnson is accurate in saying that if his amendment were accepted, inasmuch as it would ensure that every soldier leaving the Army would reckon as a person previously in an insurable occupation whether he was or not, it would be <Col N="2542" /> highly advantageous to the soldier. That, however, rather comes under the next amendment and deals with another sub-section.  I was not referring to it here, but I have an answer to it, namely, that we maintain that ten contributions are necessary.  I hope to maintain that later.  Even regarding the reduction of ten contributions Deputy Johnson is not quite accurate.  He says that there are only twenty-four to be made up, and that as ten are required there will really be only fourteen. That is not accurate.  If, say, four of these ten contributions are necessary in a particular insurance year, in which insurance year the soldier enlisted, these four would be deducted to that extent.  The soldier's maximum benefit by way of contribution would be twenty.  Take the man who had ten stamps to his credit, say, in the last months of 1920 or in the earlier months of 1921, and had no further stamps to his credit since.  He will benefit to the extent of twenty-four contributions in respect of each year in the Army.  While my figures are, to some extent, disturbed by what Deputy Johnson says, I think that that answer disturbs his figures still further. I may not be quite accurate in this statement.</P>

      <P>I submit that Deputy Johnson is entirely inaccurate. My figures are slightly disturbed, but those of Deputy Johnson are on a wrong basis, in so far as this amendment deals with insurance and as to whether a soldier on leaving the Army is considered in an insurable occupation or not.  I am dealing with that later.  In so far as the Bill seeks to put the soldier in a better position by increased contributions I submit, notwithstanding the point about the further reduction of the ten contributions, that the soldier is in a better position by this clause of ours than by the proposal in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister may apply this <Col N="2543" /> section to any person to whom in his opinion it would have applied but for the fact that the person had not had the requisite number of contributions paid in respect of him by reason of his being below the insurable age, or of his not being employed before enlistment solely in an insurable occupation, or of his having been employed before enlistment in an excepted employment, or by reason of a failure on the part of an employer to pay contributions due in respect of him, or of any other cause which the Minister may deem sufficient ground for applying the section in order to prevent hardship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This raises the question which the Minister has assured us he is going to meet effectively.  The amendment is, perhaps, a little detailed and difficult to follow, and it leaves the discretion very largely with the Minister.  It is framed in that form because it has been found very difficult to draft what one might speak of as a mandatory provision.</P>
    <P>There were many soldiers who joined about the insurable age, or shortly afterwards but had not been in insurable employment. There are, in addition to those cases of soldiers who joined the Army before they became insured, the cases of those people who were in certain occupations such as agriculture, horticulture or gardening, who would not be insured, and who are now, after demobilisation, unemployed. This amendment would allow the Minister to bring them into insurance.  There are cases of men who were working for local authorities, or public companies, or railway companies, who were not in insurable employment.  There were a considerable number of such men in the employment of local authorities, because it was considered by county councils and rural councils in many cases that they ought not to pay insurance for their workmen, and their cards were not, in consequence, stamped.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there are many cases of men whose cards were not stamped by their employers and no pressure was applied by the men to <Col N="2544" /> ensure that their cards would be stamped.  It is true that the men had a remedy by legal action, but in many cases, or at least in some cases, the old employer could not pay, in some cases he does not exist any longer, and in some cases he is quite outside the region of pressure.  I think the case is a reasonable one that the Minister should be in a position to bring into insurance a soldier who, for one reason or another has not been in an insurable occupation or who, having been in an insurable occupation, was not credited with any contributions.  I think it is reasonable that the Minister should be in a position to bring that person into insurance, so that the benefit of this section would apply even to persons who were not hitherto insured and had not to their credit the ten contributions which are required by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find, I think, that if he will agree to this amendment he will remove a very great grievance on the part of a very considerable number. He knows that many questions have been put to him, that many complaints have been made from all parts of the country by men who thought that they were insured, who were convinced that they were being kept in insurance or placed in insurance, and that they had come out of the Army with credit in the Insurance Fund. Those men have been sorely disappointed, and many of them are of a type that ought not to be allowed to be entirely at the mercy of charity or worse.  I would urge upon the Minister the necessity of accepting this amendment or some such amendment and allowing men of that classification to be brought into insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Administratively this amendment is very repellent, because it would involve the Minister, would put him in this position that he would have to admit to the benefit of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme all soldiers, or take upon his shoulders the responsibility of keeping them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I agree.  That is a suggestion that might be contended for if there was no financial consideration, <Col N="2545" /> and also if this was a Bill which was not founded on the principle of insurance.  One portion of the amendment keeps on the highway of insurance, and is away from the rather relief type of the rest of the amendment. And I submit to Deputy Johnson that a particular phrase in the proposal of the Bill meets his point.  I deal with this one detail first.  The phrase in the amendment is that the section should apply to any person who &ldquo;by reason of a failure on the part of an employer to pay contributions in respect of him&rdquo; has suffered. The actual phrase in the Bill which I set in contrast to that is line 4: &ldquo;This section applies to every person, etc., who in respect of employment before the date of enlistment.&rdquo;  If there are people who had been in an insurable occupation, and for whom stamps should have been put on cards, and for whom stamps were not in fact put, that error can be rectified still, and such persons are within the scope of the proposal of the Bill.  It is &ldquo;in respect of employment before the date of enlistment.&rdquo; It does not say &ldquo;in respect of stamps previously put on,&rdquo; but &ldquo;in respect of employment before the date of enlistment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>What the section says is that it applies to every person &ldquo;who in respect of employment before the date of enlistment has had paid for him under the Unemployment Insurance Act twenty contributions,&rdquo; etc. If the employer did not pay, then that person does not come under this section. He is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if that state of things continues.  But if the employer has not paid, and the error is now discovered, that error can be rectified, and the person's case be made quite clear.  If a person should have had ten stamps to his credit since the 8th November, 1920, and has in fact not got them, and if that error be discovered and proof given that the stamps should be there, then those stamps, when put on, will entitle the person to come under the benefit set out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that if those contributions should <Col N="2546" /> have been paid, then the person will come into benefit?  Or does he say that if the employer has been compelled to pay, then he will come into benefit? Because I suggest that there will be many cases where it will be found impossible to compel the employer to pay.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good raised a rather important question which I would like the Minister to answer.  In case of omission to stamp cards at the time of payment of wages, and if arrears are demanded at a later stage, is it, or is it not, a fact that the employer is bound to pay the whole of the contribution, both his own and the work-man's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal Act is the Act of 1920, Section 24, sub-section (1) of which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an employer has failed or neglected to pay any contributions which under this Act he is liable to pay in respect of any employed persons in his employment, or has failed or neglected to comply, in relation to any such person, with the requirements of any regulations relating to the payment and collection of contribution&rdquo; ... the onus is on the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not exactly a parallel case.  In a number of these claims there is a question as to whether the employee comes within the Act.  In fact, I am not sure that this amendment will not increase that difficulty because of the wording of the proposed sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may apply this section to any person to whom in his opinion it would have applied but for the fact that the person had not had the requisite number of contributions ....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I only point that wording out to show the ambiguity that very often arises under this Act.  If by reason of such ambiguity as to whether the person came within the Act or not the Act was not complied with, that would not be a case of neglect, and I doubt if it would come under the provision of this particular Act at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, this particular section (Section 24 of the Act of 1920) goes on in a more stringent way.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If by reason thereof that person has lost in whole or in part the Unemployment Benefit to which he would have been entitled under this Act he shall be entitled to recover, summarily, from the employer as a civil debt a sum equal to the amount of the Unemployment Benefit so lost.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to call attention to a further point in regard to this phrase: &ldquo;Who in respect of employment before the date of enlistment...&rdquo; The Act of last year, dealing with the question of the maintenance of soldiers in insurance laid it down that the contributions must have been paid before the date of enlistment.  This clause was drafted to allow contributions to be ante-dated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general item of the amendment, it seeks to do away with the whole basis of the Bill.  The basis of the scheme is insurance.  The most essential provision is this, that an employed person shall have paid in respect of twenty contributions at any time, or ten contributions since the 8th November, 1920.  See what that means. It means that for the past eleven years a person must have had twenty contributions; that is, he must have been at some period of an eleven years' period five months in insurable occupation, or else two and a half months in the last four years.  That is reducing the limitation to the narrowest possible point, and the whole basis of the scheme would become farcical if that were weakened any more than that.  All that is demanded is that a person should have five months' employment in insurable occupation in the past 11 years, or two and a half months in the past four years.  Beyond that he cannot go.  We can go beyond that on a supplementary estimate by way of relief, but not in an Insurance Bill.  The administrative <Col N="2549" /> difficulties I have referred to would be unending.  It would mean, in order properly to make up my mind whether this section should apply, that I should have a survey of a soldier's past history and get some indication as to his prospects, what was his likelihood of having been in insurable occupation if he had not joined the Army, and what were his present prospects of getting any insurable occupation.  There are not sufficient facts known about the majority of those in the National forces to warrant my making up my mind about that.  There would not be sufficient facts for my information.  The thing is administratively difficult.  It weakens the very small limitations in the ordinary insurance provisions, and it does away with the whole character of the Bill as an Insurance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has in mind a man of 25 or 27, and he is reasonable in assuming that such a person, unless he were a farm labourer or a son of a farmer, or the employee of a local authority or the employee of some person who refused to pay or neglected to pay contributions, would have been insured.  The chances are that in that eleven years since he was sixteen years of age or thereabouts he would have been certainly in employment for the necessary number of weeks.  I have in mind the young man who is now about 20, 21 or 22.  The Minister will know that there are very many who, during that few years, have not been engaged in insurable occupation. And yet, if life were normal, it would be almost certain that they would be entering into insurable occupations. Since 1919 we know, as a matter of fact, that in this country there has been very considerable derangement of the normal course of industry, and large numbers of young men who would have been insured ordinarily have not been insured because of that derangement.  They have been in the Army, and they have not been insured. The Minister says that as this is an Insurance Bill, pre-supposing contributions, he cannot go outside it for the sake of the comparative few.  I hope they are fewer than I believe they are, and I hope also that the Minister is <Col N="2550" /> better informed in the matter than I am.  I am, however, inclined to think he is misinformed and that there are considerable numbers who will be living on charity, living as so many did and had to do before there was any insurance, and whose position will be socially worse than those of their fellows who happened to have two or three months' employment before joining the Army.</P>
      <P>It is a bad influence on their surroundings to have them entirely dependent upon their friends.  I do not think the argument that it is not insurance has any substance.  My suggestion is that they will be brought into insurance if this amendment is accepted. They will be brought into insurance and they will be just as much insured from that date as any other person getting benefit in advance of contributions. By bringing them into the scheme you would thereby be insuring them and, as a consequence, the insurance basis of the scheme would remain. You would have contributions on their behalf, and you would be debiting them with contributions for the future. There may be, and, no doubt, there are, considerable administrative difficulties.</P>
      <P>This is an attempt to amend the Bill, perhaps not in the best way, in favour of the young men who ought to have been insured and who, by chance of the circumstances of the last few years, have not been insured, and it is to prevent such men suffering as a consequence of their lack of foresight, their misfortune, or somebody else's negligence. I think, in view of the small cost the Minister anticipates and the small number of people who will be left out, he would be well advised in devising an amendment to the Bill to cover such cases as I have mentioned, and to cover such cases as are referred to in the amendment I have put forward.  I acknowledge at once that the form of the amendment is not ideal, but, no doubt, the Minister, with his more expert assistance, will be able to effect the same purpose in another form, if he would but agree to the principle I have endeavoured to embody in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken of <Col N="2551" /> the administrative difficulties, but that was merely as an additional weight in the balance against the amendment. Administrative difficulties could be got over; we would have to get over them if the amendment were thought desirable.  I have no delusions at all about the number of people involved. I am not aware that I said there would be a very small number of people prejudiced by the omission of such an amendment.  I am regretfully aware a considerable number of people would be left without benefit and without any chance of unemployment relief if the proposal in the Bill stands without the amendment.  All I do say is this, that it is scarcely fair to make an Unemployment Insurance Bill bear the whole brunt of the unemployment in the country.  I have to be, in a certain sense, the guardian of the fund built up in a certain way and imposing a severe drain on industry in the country, and it is not fair to put on that fund young men who have not been in an insurable occupation, and about whom we have no assurance that they will ever be in an insurable occupation.</P>
      <P>The principle of the clause is that those who left civil life, being in an insurable occupation, in order to join the Army, should not be prejudiced by leaving stamps which would have gone to their credit in the civilian work they might have been in had they not joined the Army.  I do admit this does not give relief to all those who need relief in the country, but I am only dealing with unemployed of a particular type.  That is to say, whatever body of unemployed can be counted a charge upon industry and commerce.</P>

Of course, if the employer has left the country he cannot personally be made amenable to justice for this negligence.  I am not quite clear as to whether any property he has still in the country might be made amenable.

      <P>In line 15, to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;sixteen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In line 17, to delete the word &ldquo;sixteen&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;eighteen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In line 19, to delete the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;twenty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those amendments are an endeavour to reduce the length of the gap.  The Minister pointed out on the earlier stage that the Bill provided for ten weeks in the third year out of seventeen; in the fourth year, sixteen out of twenty weeks; in the fifth year, fifteen out of 29 weeks; and in the sixth year, twenty-six out of fifty-two weeks.  The amendments are designed to reduce the gap and to allow sixteen weeks instead of ten, eighteen instead of sixteen, and twenty instead of fifteen.  There is much that might be said, but all that could be said would be simply saying so in so many words what can be said in very few words, and that is that we want to reduce the number of weeks during which unemployed men are living upon their friends.  We want to reduce the number of weeks during which men are without benefit.  It will be known that the proposal in England, which is being copied in the North of Ireland, is to close the gap up.  In this amendment we have not even gone so far as that, but we have attempted to do better for the unemployed than the Minister is prepared to do, or was prepared to do when he drafted his Bill. I hope he has changed his mind and is prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will have some sympathy with the amendments.  This was one of the matters I raised on the Second Reading. If the Bill as it stands were to become law, that would mean that those who would benefit would go out of benefit at the end of ten weeks, and they would be more or less reverting to their previous needy position.  I would urge the <Col N="2554" /> Minister to meet the point in some way, so that the gap would be reduced. People who will be in a desperate position will be getting benefit for a few weeks only and then they will revert to their old position.</P>

      <P>The whole idea underlying the division of benefit set forth in Section 5 is to spread the limited amount of money at our disposal over the longest possible period. Our proposal is that in a seventeen weeks' period the benefit shall not be paid for more than ten weeks.  Deputy Corish's proposal was to enlarge the period to sixteen weeks.  That, in the first period of seventeen weeks, would indicate a possible gap of one week. In the second period of twenty weeks we propose to have the maximum period of benefit sixteen weeks.  Deputy Corish wants eighteen weeks.  Finally, in the twenty-eight weeks' period, we have set out a maximum of fifteen weeks, which Deputy Corish wants enlarged to twenty weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has put that this way&mdash;that we should reduce the number of weeks in which these people will have to live on their friends.  If that is the alternative, I would ask Deputy Johnson to consider if it is better to have these people taken off their friends for a ten-week period, then to resume living on them for six weeks or so, and then to have benefit for a further 16 weeks, rather than have them off their friends for 16 weeks, with the possibility of their contributions being exhausted very soon after that in the second benefit year, when they would return to live upon their friends until the end of the fifth benefit year, having all their contributions exhausted. This is a way of spreading it.  It is based on a principle, that principle being that it is better to have a short period during which benefit may be received, in the summer and autumn, when work is more plentiful. and allow more unemployment benefit in the winter months when work is not so plentiful.  In the third and fourth benefit years the maximum number of weeks over which benefit is to be allowed is twenty-six.  If, keeping to that twenty-six maximum, Deputy Johnson were to propose to split it up <Col N="2555" /> in any other way than ten and sixteen, I could meet him, but not in any enlargement of the number of weeks in these two benefit years.  There is a limited amount of money to be spread over those two years, and it is thought better to limit the amount in that portion of the year in which employment is more plentiful, and to have greater benefit available in the portion of the year in which there is less employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the Minister seems to be rather hopeless regarding the prospects of any considerable reduction in the claims owing to unemployment.  I would have been pleased to have heard him say that he is confident that before the middle of next year the amount of unemployment would be so greatly reduced that the fund would, perhaps, be increasing rather than declining.  But he, apparently, thinks that because a certain sum is fixed, that sum cannot be enlarged. I prefer to think of a man getting at least sufficient to eat for the period when we know employment is very low.  To pay a man unemployment benefit ten weeks, and leave him for six or seven weeks without anything is not conducive to a good social State.  I suggest that it would be better to fill up the gap even to the extent we are speaking of in this first year, and then count upon an improvement in the general state of industry before the period provided for in respect of the fifth and sixth years.  I would hope that the Minister would be able to do something to stimulate employment between now and then, and that the call for those longer periods of payment would not be so strong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section one of Section 8 of <Col N="2556" /> the principal Act (which imposes a disqualification for the receipt of benefit during a stoppage of work) shall not apply in any case in which an insured contributor proves that he is not participating in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work, and that he does not belong to a grade or class of workers members of which are participating in the dispute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of the principal Bill in the past has been to deprive workers of benefit who are thrown out of employment by a dispute to which they were not parties and in which they had no interest.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to supplement Deputy Colohan's statement by pointing out that this proposed amendment is identical with a clause in the British Unemployment Insurance Bill of this year.  There has been a good deal of litigation in regard to the meaning of the principal Act, and I think a good deal of injustice has been done to men who have been disemployed because they worked in an industry which was somewhat associated with another industry where a lock-out took place.  We have had instances of that in Dublin, and certain litigation ensued.  The men have been deprived of benefits because, for instance, in the case of a railway company, a dispute or lock-out occurred when the men declined to accept certain conditions, and in another establishment belonging to the same concern people were disemployed who had nothing at all to do with the dispute.  By virtue of the decision of the umpire, the insured persons were deprived of benefit.  This amendment is as I say taken from the British proposal, and is intended to remedy an evil here which has been found to apply not only here but in England, too. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>First of all, this amendment is technically not an amendment to this Bill.  It is an amendment to the principal Act, and would arise more definitely on consideration of the principal Act, if the principal Act were being substituted by a comprehensive <Col N="2557" /> Bill, drawn up to meet the industrial conditions of this country.  Waiving that, the amendment is similar to one shortly to come up for discussion before the British Parliament.  It is an amendment about which great controversy has already taken place in England and there is promise of much more controversy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The lead would be a very dangerous one for this country, not highly industrialised, to give to another country, which is highly industrialised.  The whole idea of the Unemployment Act of 1920 was that benefit is only for people who are involuntarily out of employment.  Collateral to that is the other principle, that the fund should not be used to benefit either side in a trade dispute.  It is quite easy to see how this could be used to benefit people in a trade dispute. The key men in certain industries could be called out.  The others would then come under this amendment and would receive benefit, and the dispute could be prolonged indefinitely.  In fact, there could be a certain amount of parcelling out of benefit to the different groups and an industrial dispute could be dragged out to a length absolutely impossible except for this amendment. That is running quite contrary to the whole principle at the back of Unemployment Insurance.  While there have been, no doubt, cases of hardship, men thrown out of work not because they were engineering any plan for benefit, but because the industry was held up owing to a dispute with the key-workers, there is a certain protection for such workers under Section 8 of the principal Act.  There is a certain safeguard and guarantee in a paragraph of that section.  Inasmuch as this is, first of all, too big an amendment for consideration here in discussing an Act which is very definitely technical in its character, and secondly, because it brings in this very bad principle and gives an opportunity for the use of unemployment benefit to aid either party to a trade dispute, I cannot accept it.  It could be used also by the employer in a certain way, so that it is a double-edged weapon.  For those <Col N="2558" /> reasons I oppose acceptance of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment would allow of that which the Minister suggests it would.  But the fact remains that notwithstanding what is believed by all those who took part in the original discussions to have been the intention, the legal decisions have debarred men who were never intended to be debarred by the principal Act.  People entirely disconnected with disputes in operation have been disqualified owing to a legal interpretation of the Act.  The amendment says that sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the principal Act &ldquo;shall not apply in any case in which an insured contributor proves that he is not participating in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work, and that he does not belong to a grade or class of workers members of which are participating in the dispute.&rdquo;  If one says that key workers might be used to bring a whole series of connected industries into disemployment&mdash;if that is the interpretation the Minister would like to place upon it&mdash;it simply means that at any time employers wish to bring the Act into disuse, all they have to say is that they have only ceased work and closed their business down because somebody in a far-distant key position made it difficult for them to carry on.  As a matter of fact, a very nice point has arisen in certain cases, whether the persons concerned had any connection whatever of any kind, near or remote, with the dispute.  But the employers have said that such and such a thing would not have taken place but for the fact that such and such a person was in dispute with his employers.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly this legal definition, which is a defect of the 1920 Act, has given opportunities to disqualify persons who ought not to have been disqualified for the purpose of bringing their influence to bear in the dispute. Certainly the conception of the Insurance Acts never was to debar such people from insurance.  The amendment is an attempt to remedy an obvious injustice, and I would press upon the Minister that it is important that he should accept this, or some such amendment to cover the point.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 7 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Paragraph (c) of the proviso to sub-section one of Section 7 of the principal Act (which relates to failure to fulfil the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit) shall be amended by the addition at the end thereof of the words &mdash;&ldquo;or at a rate of wage which, having regard to the duration of the employment offered and the cost and inconvenience of travelling or removal to the district, would not constitute a reasonable recompense.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister will accept this, because it is a harmless amendment.  The proviso of the Act as it stands at present reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) an offer of employment in any other district at a rate of wage lower, or on conditions less favourable, than those generally observed in that district <Col N="2561" /> by agreement between associations of employers and employees, or, failing any such agreement, than those generally recognised in that district by good employers.</P>
    <P>As the provisions stand, a man whose normal rate of wages would be, say, £3 or £4 a week may be sent down the country to a district where the rate of wages for the same class of work might be only £2 a week.  Another point is that the duration of the employment might not be such as would reimburse an employee for the expense he incurs in going down to a job in the country. It might happen that practically all the wages he receives there would go to pay for his board and lodging.  In fact, he might be put to such expense in going down the country to a job that he would have nothing left to send for the support of his wife and family.  I trust that the Minister will see the justice of this amendment and that he will accept it.  I accordingly move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make the point again that this is an amendment to the principal Act instead of an amendment to the Bill.  We have already dealt with one of these amendments, and this amendment is really unnecessary. It relates to the third proviso of sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the principal Act, in which the words occur &ldquo;unable to obtain suitable employment.&rdquo; That word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; has to be interpreted, and there have been a variety of cases before the Courts of Referees.  These cases have a bearing and are recorded and looked back to for guidance in any future cases that come along.  A decision as to what is suitable employment would include a good many things.  It would certainly include such things as expenses incurred in getting to a particular area.  That would come before the courts for consideration, to decide whether or not the employment offered was or was not suitable.  It is, I suggest, a bad thing to limit these Courts of Referees, which should be given great latitude by setting in an Act of a strict proviso to this effect.  The conditions will vary very much in the different sets of circumstances, and I suggest to the Deputy that the amendment is undesirable <Col N="2562" /> and that it will unduly tie the hands of the umpire and the Courts of Referees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has correctly stated the procedure.  As I have stated, a great variety of circumstances has to be taken into account by either the original decider, the Court of Referees, or the umpire, before coming to a decision as to whether or not suitable employment has been offered.  There has been no complaint that the provisions of the principal Act have been harsh on this particular point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misinformed on that point.  I think there have been considerable complaints, and that the complaints are increasing. The increasing number of such complaints is due to what might be called an increasing stringency in interpretation, and it is that that has given rise to this amendment.  It is true to say that in the other stages of the Act some regard was paid in sending men away or offering them employment at a distance.  Some regard, I say, was paid to the circumstances of the men concerned.  If, for instance, he were a married man, he would not be asked to go a distance.  The relative wages ruling in the place where he usually worked, and the place where he was asked to go, were taken into account. It has been found that latterly consideration has not been given to anything like the same extent that prevailed formerly, and men have been asked to go to certain places where the wage ruling was very much lower than in the place where they usually worked. The men, knowing the circumstances and the conditions of what would be <Col N="2563" /> involved in the way of expense, have declined to go to these places, and have consequently deprived themselves of benefit.  The proviso in the principal Act provides that a person shall not be deemed to have filled the statutory conditions by reason only that he has declined an offer of employment in another district where the conditions were less favourable than those usually observed in that district by agreement between employers and employed.  One would naturally assume that the intention was to have some regard to the conditions under which a man normally worked.</P>
      <P>To take an instance, it would not be reasonable to ask a man in employment in the building trade in Dublin to take employment in Connemara, where the wage is very much lower and where the general conditions are quite different.  It would not be fair, I say, to put the alternative of refusal before that man, because he will inevitably refuse to go unless it is summer time and that he knows he is going to an easy job and wants a holiday.  He will refuse that employment, and then he will be deprived of the unemployment benefit.  It is currently believed, in some parts of the country, that the Labour Exchange managers do, as a matter of practice, put to a man difficult questions of that kind.  They ask him will you take a job in such and such a place, and the man thinks that a proposition of that kind is put forward in the hope that a refusal will be the answer and that consequently no benefit will follow.  That may be unfounded, but it is currently believed, and the belief arises from what is a not infrequent practice to ask men to take jobs in low wage districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is an attempt to remedy that, and to bring into reality what I understand was a common practice in the earlier stages of the administration of the Act: That in this city, and I think in Cork, and other cities, it was fairly general for the employer to take into account the circumstances of the man himself and the circumstances of the district.  Men were not invited or asked to go to places where the rate of wage was considerably lower, or where considerable <Col N="2564" /> expense would be involved in lodging or in travelling, but I understand that that general consideration of all the circumstances is not operating now and not infrequently men are asked to take up such positions.  I understand that there have been quite frequent complaints and I am surprised that the Minister has not had some information in regard to them.  After all the amendment is still leaving a discretion, and it is asking the insurance officer to take into account the rate of wages and the circumstances in the district in which employment is offered.  I think there is not a great deal in the amendment that the Minister should object to.  It will certainly remedy a grievance which is a growing one, and one that is exciting a good deal of feeling on the part of men in trades who are frequently travelling from one district to another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure with regard to disputes has been correctly described by Deputy Morrissey. First you get the decision of the insurance officer.  There can be an appeal from him to the Court of Referees, and there can be an appeal, then, which is easily obtained, from that body to the umpire.  The umpire is a person independent of the Ministry, of the employers generally, and of the employees. The workers' interests are very definitely protected in so far as any independent person set up as a final arbiter can protect them.  Now, there have been a great many cases decided by insurance officers, by the Court of Referees, and finally by the umpire, and these decisions are, in the main, favourable to the points set down here in the terms of the amendment. These cases are considered and are held to be binding in like circumstances on new appearances of the same type of case.  I suggest it is highly undesirable to put in, as a strict provision in an Act, a thing which is already secured for the employee by Case Law and by decisions given in previous cases before the Court of Referees and before the umpire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I wish to attain is that a certain amount of latitude will be allowed in exceptional cases.  As I say, the main bulk of the cases have been decided in <Col N="2565" /> favour of the point raised in the amendment, and there is no doubt whatever that a man would not be precluded from benefit for refusing a post at an unreasonable rate.  Consider the type of circumstances mentioned.  For instance, a post is offered to a man where the work is likely to be of short duration and where the expense involved in getting to the district where the work is offered is high.  In that event, undoubtedly, a refusal of such work would not preclude a man from the benefits of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I am in agreement with Deputy Morrissey to this extent, that these points have already been considered by the particular courts dealing with these matters and have been in the main decided in favour of the workers. I suggest that it is better to leave this as a matter of case law than to include in an Act a provision which might have to be rigidly worked and which might have certain repercussions on the judgment of the Court of Referees or on the umpire and against the worker. I understand that these matters are being definitely decided in favour of the worker, and in the way that the amendment would seek to have them decided.  I suggest, therefore, that it is not good to introduce this compulsion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately for the Minister's argument, cases have deen definitely decided.  There are a great number of cases which if decided favourably, have been interpreted wrongly by the Ministry and the various officers concerned.  After all, it is not fair to throw upon the applicant the onus of going from court to court from insurance officers to referees and from referees to umpires whenever there is a grievance, and if, as is alleged, notwithstanding what the Minister says about case law and decisions, there remains an increasing number of complaints under this head it follows that the insurance officers are not acting in accordance with the decisions in previous cases.  Notwithstanding again what the Minister says about decisions, this similar complaint applies in England and Scotland, and the various exchanges are charged with following the <Col N="2566" /> same practice and with offering men work in low wage districts.  The amendment still leaves the umpire finally to say whether it is reasonable recompense or not, and it makes clear what the intentions of the legislature are in this matter.  I think if the Minister will make further inquiries he will find that there is still a good deal of dissatisfaction with decisions in such a matter and that the dissatisfaction arises from the fact that the insurance officers have decided against the applicant and, in effect, force the applicant to go through the procedure of referees and umpires, and that should not be necessary for a man in the position of a workman seeking unemployment insurance. If we are going to make the matter clear by the insertion of an amendment of this kind, it would save a great deal of dissatisfaction and, I think, injustice.</P>

I think, however, that there is an absence of objection by reason of what I stated.  I think it would require further consideration to see what would likely be its effect on other conditions and to see whether the employer would be satisfied.  Other conditions would, for instance, be the length of unemployment in which a man found himself for a period beforehand. You take his previous history into consideration.  If you segregate one item, namely, the rate of wage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That elevation of the rate of wage marks it out as the main consideration, and may have results not desired by the employee afterwards.  I have not yet heard any great number of complaints on this particular head, and I think complaints would have come to my notice, even in the short period during which I have been looking after this matter.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister that if this Bill had not been brought in when it was he would have had a request from the Executive of the Trades Union Congress, from the Dublin Workers' Council, and from the Cork Workers' Council, to receive a deputation on this specific question. We had a conference to discuss this matter, and I had complaints time and again from different parts of the country, and amongst those complaints this is one of the most insistent.  This is a real grievance, and if the Minister cannot accept this amendment at this stage, or even in the Dáil, I think that he ought to be prepared in the Seanad to move an amendment to secure this object when the matter comes forward there.  I would, however, be better pleased if he accepted it now, and amended it later on.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Corish I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 7 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Paragraph (b) of sub-section one of Section 35 of the principal Act (which relates to evidence as to the fulfilment of the conditions and the absence of the disqualifications for receiving or continuing to receive unemployment benefit) shall be amended by the insertion after the word &ldquo;depends&rdquo; in the last line thereof, of the words &ldquo;and, if so desired by a court of referees, to attend upon and submit to examination by the court in connection with the consideration and examination of any claim or question.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2568" /> The provisions of the existing Act are defective in as much as the Minister may make regulations for prescribing the evidence as to the fulfilment of conditions in the absence of qualifications. What has been found and complained of is that the employer answers by filling up a form and according to the manner in which he fills that form the applicant may be damnified in the eyes of the insurance officers or referees, and is not required to answer any questions verbally that may be put to him by the applicant or the applicant's representative.  The contributor is going to appear in person and subject himself to any examination that may be necessary.  The employer is required to answer inquiries which may be pressed and may be insisted upon and which may be very full, but what usually happens is that a stereotyped form is frequently filled up in a way which prejudices the applicant, who has no opportunity in practice to put questions to the employer before the court.  The intention of the amendment is to put the applicant and the employer on equal terms so far as that is concerned.  It is a very easy thing for an employer to answer a question which will, for instance, suggest a trade dispute.  In such a case the applicant is disqualified.  The amendment would enable the court to say that the employer shall attend and submit to an examination if the court so decides.  The original Act says &ldquo;shall answer inquiries,&rdquo; and in practice the answer to inquiries is an answer by letter or by the filling up of forms.  I think it is only equitable that the applicant should be allowed to face the employer if, as may be alleged, the answer that the employer has made to the insurance officer's question prejudices the applicant.  This amendment says &ldquo;if so desired by the court of referees to attend upon and submit to examination by the court.&rdquo;  I think that is an equitable proposition which would remedy the grievance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment again is not very strongly objected to, nor, indeed, is there any objection to it but I just want to draw attention to one danger.  As the Unemployment Acts are at present worked, there is no <Col N="2569" /> statutory obligation on anyone to attend. Witnesses are invited and employers may attend or may fill up a particular series of questions addressed to them.  I suggest to the Labour Deputies that what ordinarily happens in cases where the employer answers, and where the questions are not satisfactory, and where he does not appear to supplement unsatisfactory answers, the case is given in favour of the employee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, at any rate, that it is a reasonable assumption that an insurance officer or a court of referees or an umpire, not receiving satisfactory answers from the employer, is at least prejudiced against the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what is satisfactory.  If it is more satisfactory to the insurance officer that a man should be deprived of benefit, and if the answer would have that effect, it would be satisfactory to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then let me move away from the area of the insurance officer who may be prejudiced.  Let us take the umpire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to leave it to a Court of Referees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>An umpire is away from both employers and employees. He is as independent as can be made, and he is chosen because of his independence.  I suggest that such a man would be seriously prejudiced against an employer who did not satisfactorily answer questions, and &ldquo;satisfactorily&rdquo; there would, I am sure, be in accordance with Deputy Johnson's argument.  He may insist on this more formal procedure.  The whole effect of the practice in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Acts has been to make them less formal than ordinary courts of law, which are reputed to be very slow and cumbersome in their procedure.  Is it desired that this informal court should be put in a position to adopt a more cumbersome procedure than it has previously adopted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is to be pressed, and it is <Col N="2570" /> thought desirable to press it, I suggest that it should be at least enlarged so that all people interested in connection with the Act should be brought, if so desired, before the insurance officers, the Court of Referees and the umpire. That would make it more comprehensive than it is at present.  If you are going to apply the principle of compulsory attendance, apply the compulsion both to the attendance of the employer and the employee, and to their attendance not only before the insurance officer, but before the Court of Referees and the umpire.  There is one difficulty that I see in the way&mdash;you are going to make the procedure somewhat slower and more expensive administratively to the Ministry to carry out the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to misapprehend.  Under the principal Act the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of requiring the attendance of insured contributors and requiring them to answer inquiries.  The amendment seeks to give the Minister power to make regulations additional to that&mdash;to make regulations to enable the Court of Referees to call the employers just as that court can compel the contributors to appear under the regulations.  There is nothing very terrible about it.  It is putting both sides in a position of equality, and it enables the inquiry to be conducted with the parties face to face.  It enables the man who has been disqualified by the reply which an employer has given to the formal question to come to the Court of Referees and to meet the employer there face to face and to say whether the answer was a true answer or a false answer.  It is impressed upon me that the matter is of considerable value and considerable importance, and that the amendment, if adopted, would save the necessity of going to umpires from referees.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not good policy to assume that the normal course was to go from an insurance officer to the Court of Referees and from the Court of Referees to umpires.  We should rather hope that the regulations and the law in the matter would be clear enough to avoid the necessity of having to go to the umpire in every case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is to allow the Minister to make reciprocal arrangements with the Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which, of course, is very desirable. This amendment is perhaps not of very grave importance if there was an understanding.  But the suggestion is that in coming to such arrangements or before making such reciprocal arrangements which may involve the claims or the rights of insured contributors there should be some consultation with trade unions or other persons representative of the insured contributors, in the matter.  I do not think it is a matter that need be pressed very <Col N="2572" /> much if one could get an assurance from the Minister that there would be such a consultation before final decisions were taken.</P>

But in view of the fact that the system of Unemployment Insurance in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is different in some respects from that in force in the Saorstát, it may be that the words &ldquo;reciprocal arrangements&rdquo; would prove embarrassing. The insertion of the words &ldquo;or other&rdquo; would give the Minister discretion in cases of that kind and would ensure that the intentions of the framers of the Bill would not be defeated by reason of a very strict interpretation being given to the word &ldquo;reciprocal.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The object of this amendment is to reduce the ratio of the entertainment tax on the cheap seats in places of amusement.  I did on a previous occasion endeavour to draw the attention of the Minister to the unfairness of the manner in which this particular tax is assessed.  At the present time a man who is able to afford a 6d. seat and who desires to take advantage of a place of amusement has to pay 2d. as a tax in addition to the 6d.. or 33 ?rd per cent. on the entrance charge, while the man who is able to afford a 2/- seat is only charged 4d. entertainment tax or 16 ?rds per cent.  That means that the poorer man is charged entertainment tax at double the rate charged to the better off man.  This entertainment tax was originally imposed by the British Government, but I find it very difficult to get an explanation as to why it has been assessed in that way.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Bryan Cooper and Deputy Figgis who yesterday, on a discussion on another amendment, pleaded with the Minister for some consideration in regard to a deduction of the duties on pianos.  They seemed to <Col N="2574" /> be under the very wrong impression that the playing of the piano was a popular form of amusement for the poorer classes.</P>
    <P>I think that it is easier and cheaper for the poorer classes who wish to enjoy themselves and get away from the slums in which they live in cities and towns to go to the picture houses for the amusement that they can provide rather than buy pianos from England or somewhere else.  I have not been able to get any of the figures which would enable me to make a rough estimate of the effect of such a reduction if the Minister was agreeable to accept the amendment.  The Snowden Budget, I understand, makes provision for having no entertainment tax on seats under one shilling.  I think that some consideration should be given by the Minister to the conditions prevailing here at the present time; and some explanation, at any rate, should be given as to why it is that the wealthier classes of people have to pay a lower rate of entertainment tax than the poorer classes.  The Minister may argue that he could not undertake to accept the amendment because of the amount of money that would be involved. I believe that whatever amount of money would be involved as the effect of accepting this amendment would be met, to some extent at any rate, by the increased number of people who would be likely to patronise places of amusement as the result of the reduction. Some explanation is due to the Dáil for the tax as it stands at present; and I trust the Minister will see his way to make it more equitable to all classes in the future.  The tax, whatever it may be, is, in all cases, passed on to the people who patronise the picture houses; and nothing is gained by the people who provide the amusements in picture houses or theatres or anywhere else from the tax which is at present charged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This entertainments duty provides us with a revenue of about £175,000 per annum.  In the year before we took up it was about £118,000, and it went up considerably last year, and it is anticipated that it will bring £175,000 at least this year. That is partly due to a restoration of <Col N="2575" /> more normal conditions and to the better enforcement of the tax.  The estimate that is given is that the loss involved in the change suggested by Deputy Davin would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £20,000 per annum.  I do not believe that the public attending places of amusement would get the benefit of all that by any means.  For instance, at present, if we take the case of an inclusive charge of 6d., I do not think that would be altered by a ½d.  If Deputy Davin's amendment were accepted.  Yet the revenue would then only be 1d. as against 1½d. at the present time.  I believe in that particular case, for instance, the public would simply pay as usual, and the owner of the picture house would benefit to the extent of ½d.  That would happen to some extent in other prices. Deputy Davin's amendment would bring in another anomaly.  At present there is a very popular price of 9d. That would be done away with altogether. As a matter of fact, under Deputy Davin's scheme we would have a price of 8d.  That would include 7d. admission fee and 1d. tax.  Following that there would be an admission price of 8d. and a tax of 3d.  I do not think it probable that there would be an 11d. charge at all, and the result would be we would have a gap in the scale of admission charges between 8d. and 9d.  I am speaking of the inclusive charges, so that Deputy Davin's amendment would introduce new anomalies which would in a number of cases, I think, not be carried on to the public at all.  I do not believe that the extra tax does deter many people from going in.  I do not believe it would make any appreciable difference in the number of people attending.  If I know anything of the picture house owners, from the various interviews I had with them, they would not rush to give the public the benefit if the public could be induced to pay.  As a matter of fact, if there are difficulties in that, I think they are difficulties due to the erection of picture houses in various places where there were too many already. In that case I am not entirely convinced by the arguments of the impending ruin of the picture houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2576" /> Quite recently we detected a picture house in a series of frauds on the Revenue in the matter of the entertainments tax.  They were brought before a very good District Justice.  I think there were twenty counts, and he fined them £100 on each count.  We had a tremendous furore created.  We were told, of course, that the picture house would be closed, and that the people would be left desolate, but we hardened our hearts.  Two thousand pounds were paid on the nail, and the picture house is going.  I am not convinced by all the statements I heard about the terrible bad state of the picture houses.  They may not be as flourishing as they were, but I think they will be able to carry on, and I do suggest that only a proportion of this remission would reach the public.  It certainly would not reach them in the whole.  For instance, where you now find a charge of 7d., if you drop the tax of 1d., you most probably will find that they will continue to charge 7d.  Certainly, a great deal of that would go on, and unless there was a more drastic reduction possible, so that it would be plain to the public that the drop in the prices of admission should follow, I would not advise the Dáil to agree to it.  I also think that a tax on amusements in a certain sense is a less objectionable tax than one on necessities, and I am not inclined to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to understand quite distinctly that I am not moving this amendment in the name of any people associated with the running of picture houses.  Certain documents did come into my possession some time ago.  I read some of them in connection with the motion that was dealt with in this Dáil, and for the first time I discovered in them information which led me to put down this amendment. Of course, until we get hold of this Profiteering Bill that has been so long promised, and that people are so anxiously looking forward to, we cannot insist that any reduction of taxes will be passed on to the consumer&mdash;in this case, the patrons of picture houses. The Minister did not explain why the Government or himself could stand over the tax at present in force, of 16? per cent. on the higher priced seats and <Col N="2577" /> 33? on the lower priced seats.  That is a thing which I think requires some explanation, apart from the anomalies which appear to exist in the amendment standing in my name.  I think some undertaking might be given by the Minister that between now and next year he would consider it from that point of view.  We are surely entitled to expect that a Profiteering Bill will be in operation when the next Finance Bill is being discussed.</P>

      <P>This amendment, as put down by Deputy Davin, and as explained by him, means that he wants to get a reduction in the tax for those who cannot afford to pay.  When one analyses who can afford to pay, I think perhaps there may be some difference of opinion.  Of course, Deputy Davin is representing the labour side always, or the labouring man, as the poor man.  I, as an employer, contrasting the conditions that apply to labour to-day with what they were, call labour the new rich.  At all events, in this particular matter the Government gets most of its revenue from the cheaper seats, which are patronised by a very large number of people who, I think, without any disrespect to Deputy Davin's opinion, can afford to pay a small charge.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reading this amendment, read into it, I think, something that I cannot see on the face of it.  I think he made it a peg on which to hang accusations against the cinema proprietors.  I think this is not the first occasion on which he did the same thing.  The cinema proprietors, I take it, are human.  There are good, bad and indifferent amongst them.  I think it was hardly necessary, if I may say so, for the Minister to cast a slur on the trade, as to whether they would make use of this for profiteering purposes or otherwise&mdash;if they get the concession.  I think that is not quite right.  I am quite sure that amongst the cinema owners there are good and honourable men.  At least, I hope there are, for the sake of commercial morality.  At all events, as a body of men, I might claim for them that they are no worse than their neighbours. Even amongst the different sections in this Dáil we find perhaps the same variable conditions as regards the principles of ordinary commercial honesty. It seems to me that the mover of this amendment has not made out a very strong case for its acceptance by the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, there is a matter on the 3rd Schedule that I should mention to the Dáil.  The first repeal&mdash;the repeal of certain sections of the Finance Act of 1909-10&mdash; deals with the duties on various articles, including chloroform&mdash;which it was decided should be abolished&mdash; chloral hydrate, acetic ether, sulphuric compounds, and so forth; and the other one deals with the Safeguarding of Industries Act.  Now, the remaining repeals, except the first and the fifth, are Customs repeals.  One deals with chloroform duties and the other deals with the Safeguarding of Industries. The remaining repeals are repeals dealing with the quarterly assessments of income tax on weekly wage earners.  That was an arrangement introduced in 1916 when war wages were very high, when wages were rising rapidly, and when it was impossible to recover income tax due by weekly wage earners by the ordinary method.  Now however, the number of weekly wage earners who are in a position to pay income tax has decreased very considerably, and the quarterly assessment of income tax has become something in the nature of a nightmare, administratively. We find it would be assessed on workers who, perhaps, would be liable for tax on their earnings in the first three-quarters of the year, and tax would be collected.  Then something would happen in the last quarter, so much of a deduction had to be made, and the tax collected in excess had to be refunded.  In consequence, an enormous <Col N="2582" /> amount of work is involved; so much so that the cost of carrying out the quarterly assessments exceeds the amount recovered.  As a matter of fact. I believe there will have to be a certain wiping of the slate with regard to a number of assessments that have been made in this way.  That, however, is another matter.</P>
      <P>The whole business of the quarterly assessment was suitable enough when you had rising wages, and when you had quite a number of weekly wage-earners due to pay a large amount of income tax.  Now, if a weekly wage-earner is liable for income tax, it will be assessed in the ordinary way, according to these proposals.  Each one of the various sections mentioned in the repeal deals with some particular aspect of the matter.  The clauses repealed, except those I have mentioned, deal with some aspect of the quarterly assessment.  For instance, Section 2 of the Act of 1918 sets out that weekly wage earners are to be assessed and charged quarterly.  Section 22 provides that the fact of assessments being made quarterly shall not affect the granting of allowances or deductions. Section 105 provides that returns shall, in the case of weekly wage earners, be made at such intervals as may be fixed by regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 131 provides that the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations with respect to the assessments charged, and the collection of the tax in the case of weekly wage earners assessed quarterly.  Various references are found in those Acts to quarterly assessments of weekly wage earners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me this is a capital way for the Minister to get over his difficulties.  Here, in a sort of side-issue, he is wiping away practically all provision for extending income tax to workers' salaries.  We all know that in the past the provisions for charging income tax on a worker were a farce.  At the same time I do object to it all being wiped away, without any attention being drawn to what is being done, by slipping it into a section of this Bill, and referring to sections so-and-so of a previous Act.  I should not have understood what was <Col N="2583" /> meant by it, were it not for Deputy Johnson's inquiry.  I am afraid that my curiosity does not extend to these minutiae in the same way as a Deputy who attends to his business properly, as Deputy Johnson does, and who immediately requires an explanation of them.  Let us be quite frank about this thing of a workman's income tax. I never knew a workman, no matter what his salary was, who paid income tax.  There may be some workman in receipt of a large income who has, as a matter of fact, paid income tax to the revenue, but in such a case as that I really do think he ought to be put in a glass-case.  I have known workmen making very good wages, but I never heard of one of them paying income tax yet.  I think the Minister might face the position in a better way.  He should have told us that he was going to cease charging income tax in the case of weekly wage earners, or cease going through the farce of charging workmen income tax altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the statement made by Deputy Hewat.  I would have imagined that he would welcome the wiping out of these three-monthly assessments of income tax.  Not alone will it do away with a good deal of work in the Department of the Revenue Commissioners, but it will relieve employers, for whom Deputy Hewat speaks in the Dáil, from employing men to make out returns for the Revenue Commissioners.  Deputy Hewat speaks as if no workers ever paid income tax.  I believe the Revenue Commissioners have the power to compel employers to render returns of the amount of wages paid their employees. I have spent many hours, night and day, making out returns.  I agree with the Minister that those returns cannot have the effect originally intended.  I know returns have to be made out by railway companies for thirty or forty thousand workers, and in most cases, at particular periods, no income tax is due.  Still, all the necessary particulars have to be furnished to enable the authorities to see whether the workers are liable for income tax or not.  I know of many cases where employees received notices, threatening and <Col N="2584" /> otherwise, from the Revenue Commissioners, ordering them to pay income tax which they did not owe at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat knows that quite well. If those for whom he speaks have failed to render the returns, then he is not the able champion of the law which I always believed he was.  As an employer, he should welcome the proposition from the Minister, because it will relieve him of certain responsibilities in the making of necessary returns. From an administrative point of view the Minister is quite justified in wiping out these three-monthly assessments, under which people were obliged to render returns which did not bring in any revenue at all.</P>
      <P>Again, in cases where income tax has been deducted, and where the amount has exceeded what is actually due, there is considerable delay in getting a refund.  I hope the Minister will pay some attention to that.  I know many people who have been overcharged income tax, and they had to wait a very long time for a refund.  It is immaterial whether they patronise picture houses with the amount refunded.  What is really material is that they are entitled to get back their money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better put it this way: I quarrel with them for using the term worker in a narrow and particular sense.  There are a great many workers who pay income tax, and there are even workers who pay supertax. The sooner the practice of using the term worker and workman as regards men who work with their hands in comparison with those who work with their brains, is put an end to, the better.  On the definition adopted by Deputy Hewat it might be possible to say that Deputy Johnson is not a worker, which we know is quite absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would support one claim of Deputy <Col N="2585" /> Hewat's, and that is as to the incomprehensibleness, under existing circumstances, of these schedules.  Three months ago and more we were promised a set of the Statutes would be provided for Deputies' use in the library of the Dáil, and that set has never been provided. We were told that there was a set somewhere in Dublin Castle, which would be available and brought here, but that has not been done.  Whether the Minister for Finance has objected or whether the judges have laid violent hands on the books, I do not know.  It is not only unfair to the Deputies, but there is a consideration which should appeal with more force to the Minister for Finance, and that is that it wastes time if all these references have to be explained to Deputies.  If the Statutes were there, and if we could look up the Income Tax Act of 1918 and the Finance Act of 1921, we could work these things out for ourselves.  I do not say that we would, but we could, and in some cases of spasmodic energy we might.  I do hope the Minister will bring his influence to bear on the responsible authorities and have those promised books supplied.  His legislation, more than the legislation of most Ministers, is legislation by reference. His legislation is continually referring to old British Acts, and yet a complete set of the British Statutes, which he is altering, revising and repealing, has not been provided for the use of Deputies.</P>

I recognise that the present situation is such that legislation has got to be rushed through and discussion is becoming a farce.  But even so, I do think the Minister should not come down twice on the one day and suggest suspension of Standing Orders unless a condition of real crisis exists.  I am not disposed to protest in this case as strongly as I otherwise might, because this Bill has been before the Dáil for a considerable time.  But I do think that the suspension of Standing Orders is unnecessary. The Bill might easily have been advanced more in its earlier stages and might have gone to the Seanad before now.

There is, further, the fact that the Bill is administratively urgent, that these tangles, with all their possibilities of trouble and disorder, exist here and there through the country, and it is necessary to deal with them in the manner prescribed by the Bill.  I do not quite understand what the Deputy meant by saying that the earlier stages could have been expedited, and that the Bill could have been in the Seanad by now.  The question took some investigation, and we had to consult with other Ministries as to the best manner of dealing with the troubles that exist.

      <P>I am glad the Minister recognises it is going to make a serious difference.  While practically admitting the weight of the argument the other evening, the Minister, as he usually does, resolutely refused to move on this.  He is not disposed, I presume, to concede to us in this amendment that it ought to be compulsory.  It is to be left to the Ministry in framing regulations to decide exactly what is to be done, and it is with them to make the choice.  It seems to us that it <Col N="2593" /> ought not to be with them, that we ought to make the choice here and definitely decide that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; ought to be inserted instead of &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I do not know if the Minister maintains his attitude and says that it cannot be so, that there is no purpose to be served by pressing the matter to a division, but it seems to us it is the proper course to adopt, and that strengthened by the law the Minister will be in a much better position than he will be under any regulations he may choose to make.</P>

      <P>Apparently the idea is that the Ministry should have discretion in regard to six or seven of the matters which are set out in the section, such as grading, packing, cleaning premises, cold storage, and other matters.  But for some unknown reason, which has not yet been explained, the Dáil is to decide that the Minister must and shall make regulations that every egg produced in the Free State is to be marked by the producer, because that is what it comes to.  It must be remembered that this Bill is to come into operation before the 1st August, 1925.  But he has to order that this is to be done straight away.,  They need not grade them, they need not say they are fresh, but they must mark them.  I could understand the attitude if the Deputy took up the position that the Bill should be mandatory from the start to the finish, that it should be mandatory in regard to the freshness of eggs and all that.  But they may be stale or they may be dirty; the Ministry is to have a discretion in regard to the other matters, but they must be marked.</P>

      <P>The eggs are taken to the exporter; somehow they get <Col N="2594" /> there.  As I see it, if the obligation is on the producer to mark the eggs, the Minister will not, of necessity, have to make regulations about the marking of those eggs.  He will not necessarily have to employ a staff to go round the farmhouses, or the small dealers, to see the eggs are marked.  All he has got to do is to send to the exporters.  He will discover there if the eggs are marked. If they are not marked the exporter is liable.  The exporter will make very certain that he will not be liable, because he will see that the eggs will be marked when taken in to him.  He will also be liable if the eggs are stale, or if they are not clean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministry may make the regulations.  Under the Bill as it stands, the Ministry may make regulations about the stamping of the eggs.  The Minister's arguments all along would lead one to conclude that the marking of the eggs was such a very big task that it was questionable whether it should be mandatory or not. There is no question, nor has it ever been thought of, that the eggs ought not to be fresh, or ought not to be clean. There is a feeling that it is such a big problem it would be very difficult to ensure that they shall all be marked. We want to make absolutely certain that they shall be marked, because we are satisfied that the regulations will see to it that they will be clean and fresh.  The question of marking is just as important, and the question of who shall do the marking is more important even, in a sense, than the marking itself.  If the obligation to do the marking is put on the exporter or small dealer the producer must necessarily suffer.  In the producer's home there will be ample time to mark the eggs, and it will cost little to do it.  In the case of the exporter, or dealer, it would probably mean the employment of extra labour, and the producer would, of necessity, have to pay the exporter or dealer what it would cost to get it done.  We want to see to it that the <Col N="2595" /> producer will be saved that, by the obligation being put on him to mark the eggs before he takes them to any dealer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister realise that the effect of having the eggs marked will be to cause the eggs to be kept clean and sold fresh, and to prevent stale or unclean eggs being sold, for the reason that if the eggs, when marked, were sold and found to be stale, or otherwise unfit for use, the offence of having sold those eggs would be brought home to the person responsible.  That is our intention in making this mandatory&mdash;that any person guilty of selling eggs unfit for use will have the guilt brought home to him.  Undoubtedly the shopkeeper or trader will refuse to purchase eggs from any person who continually brings in stale eggs for sale.</P>

      <P>We hope, even if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not introduced, that the Minister will carry out the intention of the amendment.  By placing the mark of the producer on every egg it will ensure good eggs, fresh eggs, and clean eggs.  That is the best means of getting over the branding trouble, and there will be no expense to anyone. You will ensure that the provisions of the Bill will be carried out, and, to my mind, this is the only means by which you ensure it.</P>

There is no question, and the Minister has admitted it, that the Bill will be farreaching in effect in interfering with trade and it is only right that whatever regulations are made&mdash;which, as I take it, are going to have a greater influence on the trade than the Bill itself&mdash;should be laid before each House so that we may see what they are before they become law.</P>

It will allow the Minister at least to decide in favour of the marking, for identification purposes, of all eggs, if he so wills, and that that shall be done at the farmer's house.  I think it will be found, on consideration, that this section will have to take three or four sub-sections.  The fines will probably have to be made applicable to the whole rather than to two separate parts of the Bill.  The section in the Bill relates to the word &ldquo;fines,&rdquo; and the same thing is repeated in sub-section (3). However, that is a matter of drafting. What I want to draw attention to is that when this becomes law any person who sells eggs in the Free State, which are dirty, will be liable to a fine of £10. I am not opposing that.  I am supporting it, but I think it is just as well to draw public attention to the fact that the Bill is not only going to apply to eggs for export, but to eggs retailed in the city which are dirty, and the offence is going to be considered such a one as to be worthy of a fine of £10.</P>

It had been suggested, and I thought more or less approved, that the formula henceforth should include this word &ldquo;annually&rdquo; which would make it quite certain that it was to be an annual vote.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion and amendment are, the statements to the contrary regarding the motion notwithstanding, in the nature of a vote of nonconfidence. Dissatisfaction with the course pursued must be necessity involve the Executive Council.  There are two, or possibly three, parties to Article 12.  The amendment to the resolution only alters the motion by making it more exhaustive and changing the character of the motion as interpreted by Deputy Milroy.</P>
      <P>The amendment, if passed, involves a change of Government and to the inheritors, in consequence of the passing of the amended motion, its duty to convey to the British and Northern Governments:</P>
      <P>(a)  Dissatisfaction with the course pursued in dealing with Article 12.</P>
      <P>(b)  Instruction to the Executive Council to cease participation in any further negotiations regarding the matter pending the setting up of the Boundary Commission.</P>
      <P>(c)  Insist upon the fulfilment of Article 12 in respect both to the provisions relating to the Council of Ireland and the appointment of the Boundary Commission.</P>
      <P>(d)  Fix a limit to the time to which it will assent for constituting the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the last of the four conditions first, the Dáil must know that such a course involves a time-table with extensions and extensions or estimated delays at each step&mdash;contemplating that delays in this sense are unavoidable accidents&mdash;and not premeditated acts&mdash;the sum total which might reasonably be claimed could be absorbed and a good case made for unforseen contingencies.  I am not satisfied <Col N="2605" /> that the course pursued&mdash;as Deputy Milroy's motion declares&mdash;has been entirely to my satisfaction.  The correspondence which has passed between the two Governments reflects in a very fair way the opinions of the Executive Council.  I am not in a position, nor would I consider it wise, to fix a time limit&mdash;nor would I, were the positions changed, seek to impose such a condition on an Executive Council, the President of which was Deputy Milroy, and the Vice-President Deputy Johnson.  To fix a time limit to which it will assent for the constituting of the Commission may be read to mean that you do agree to such delay.  That policy is not to be found in the correspondence between the two Governments, and if I may be permitted to express my opinion on the mind of the Northern Government it is that this boundary question should be determined without delay.</P>
    <P>For the first time this matter has assumed a tincture of party treatment.  I deprecate such a course in dealing with a matter of such very great importance. Whether the objective be dissatisfaction with the policy of the Executive Council in dealing with this Article of the Treaty or not&mdash;by this motion and amendment&mdash;the Dáil is forced to decide for or against the resolution as amended or not amended, according as Deputy Johnson's proposal is accepted or rejected.  In voting against the motion you are placing the Executive Council in the position that it might be claimed elsewhere that it was satisfied with the course pursued.  In that connection I may say that I would prefer that the Executive Council were removed from office by a vote of the Dáil than that it should be inferred that the true mind of the Executive Council were not reflected in the published correspondence. The amendment appears to have been occasioned by certain remarks made by the ex-Attorney-General in the debate of May 28th.  His intervention in the debate arose through Deputy Johnson and Deputy Davin (especially the latter) pressing the question of inclusion of the Great Northern Railway in a particular way. They did not appear to be satisfied with the case as put by the Minister for Industry <Col N="2606" /> and Commerce.  They insisted on attributing to the Government a line of action based on supposed inability to deal with the Great Northern Railway, and other railways which cross the Border.  The ex-Attorney-General intervened for the purpose of asserting our complete sovereignty, including unlimited authority to deal with these railways so far as they are within the twenty-six counties by legislation of the Oireachtas, while explaining the liability of the Oireachtas to legislate for such railways in so far as they lie outside the territory for the time being, subject to the jurisdiction and legislative authority of the Oireachtas. The ex-Attorney-General was asserting authority where Deputy Davin particularly, was apparently attributing to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a smaller conception of our powers.  I do not understand how the ex-Attorney-General could have supposed that Deputy Johnson and Deputy Davin had forgotten the provisions of the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922, or that they had failed to understand it, or that the provisions of that measure passed nearly two years ago were not known until three weeks ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was published in the Press, and might have been known.  The clause dealing with the Council of Ireland in the First Schedule to that Act was no secret at the time. The entire text of the Bill was printed in the Irish newspapers of the 27th November, 1922, and the debates in the British Parliament at every stage of the Bill were also fully reported in our newspapers.  It would be absurd for public representatives to say that they took the ostrich line, and would not read the Bill when it was going cause it was the British Parliament, through the British Parliament, beeven though the Bill greatly concerned us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2607" /> The question of the position of the Council of Ireland and its difficulties in practical operation was not something newly sprung for the first time in November, 1922.  It was recognised in a public document, the Collins-Craig Pact in January, 1922, and indeed the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, itself provided for the variation of the Constitution of the Council by identical legislation of the two Parliaments contemplated by that Act.</P>
    <P>Apart from any criticism of the Constitution of the Council of Ireland under the Act of 1920, it was absolutely clear after the Treaty was made that some variations in its constitution must be made, because there was no longer a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (necessary, e.g., for Section 2 (2) (of the Act of 1920) or a Joint Exchequer Board (required for the purposes of Section 10 (5), and some alternatives to them with legislative sanction became necessary.</P>
    <P>Moreover, General Collins had always been dissatisfied with the mode of constituting the Council as it stood in the Act of 1920, and (as appears by the Pact) he had discussed the matter with Sir James Craig for the purpose of arriving at the constitution of the Council of Ireland by agreement, which, resting on agreement, would be able to function with success.</P>
    <P>A great many things happened between January and November of 1922, and, worst of all, General Collins had been killed.  I hope the Dáil will acquit me of an ulterior motive in introducing the name of the late General Collins.  I am not doing so for the purpose of any excuse or explanation. I am not including the fact of the original agreement between the late General Collins and Sir James Craig for the purpose of substantiating my case.  It is now my own responsibility. If there was an error or mistake in the policy of the late General Collins in January, 1922, I have no desire to shelter myself.  If the action of the Provisional Government in the arrangement entered into between the three Governments in November, 1922, were blamable, I accept it and accept the fullest responsibility for it.  But I cannot suppress the fact that due and <Col N="2608" /> ample notice was given to the country in the first instance regarding this proposal so far back as January, 1922, and subsequently by the Press in November, 1922.  No further progress had been made in evolving satisfactory proposals for the Constitution of the Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>One proposal had been mooted and received not unfavourably, namely meetings of the Executive Council and the Belfast Cabinet, with a view to joint action on the matters within the purview of the Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The idea of joint action by the two Governments was an attractive one, but in order to make it effective it would be necessary to work out the administrative machinery through which it would operate and the mode of meeting its financial obligations. The position at the time of the passing of the Constitution was that the original Constitution of the Council of Ireland had been admitted to be defective when it came to putting it into operation; it had been recognised that the Constitution of the Council could, and should, be modified so as to make it a real and actually operative instrument of Government within its limited sphere; and no progress could be made in the matter without appropriate financial arrangements.  Further, it was essential that while the Council of Ireland should, if possible, be continued, it was apparent that the setting up of the Saorstát with unlimited powers within its own territory restricted the powers of the Council contemplated by the Act of 1920.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to get the Constitution of the Saorstát established.  It was desirable to keep open the question of how the Council of Ireland was to be made real and effective.  Therefore, the Provisional Government assented to a suggestion which was embodied in the Act of the British Parliament known as the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, Clause 3 of the 2nd Schedule&mdash;an Act which, while still in its Bill stage, received every publicity, as I have shown, and must have been familiar to every member of the Dáil. As a matter of fact, on 27th November the Dáil was not in session.  It came into session on 28th November while the Bill was in progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2609" /> It is quite fallacious to say that the postponement is in any way a deviation of the Treaty.  The Act of 1920, which in this respect has been imported into the Treaty, and upon which the Council of Ireland depends, contained a provision that days were to be appointed for the bringing into operation of its various purposes, and Section 73 of that Act provided for the postponement of the appointed day for any particular purpose at the joint request of the Governments of Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Under the terms of the Treaty the Provisional Government, in addition to its other powers, succeeded to the powers conferred by the Act on the Government of Southern Ireland, and it had ample power to enter into the agreement in question. When the period of postponement of the appointed day expires&mdash;if nothing has been done in the meantime to vary or improve the Constitution of the Council of Ireland as contained in the Act of 1920, then it will be immediately called into existence as respects Northern Ireland exactly as set out in the Act of 1920.  The period of postponement to which the Provisional Government assented was a period to enable further consideration to be given to proposals for the improvement of the Constitution of the Council.  As I have pointed out, some such improvements are practically vital, as, for instance, substitutes must be found for the Lord Lieutenant and the Joint Exchequer Board.</P>
    <P>I must challenge the statement that the Provisional Government was not an Executive Government.  It was, in the fullest sense, and though in some respects that was not at first admitted by the British, the Provisional Government was an Executive Government, and performed the acts of Executive Government ultimately without challenge. Some of these acts must be known to Deputies.  Some of them are recorded in official documents, such as Prorogation of Parliament, known to every citizen of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I will now deal very shortly with the steps which we took from the commencement in regard to Clause 12.</P>
    <P>1.&mdash;Clause 12 did not become operative until December, 1922.</P>
    <P>2.&mdash;Irregular activities were at <Col N="2610" /> this time at their worst, and continued so until the spring of 1923.</P>
    <P>3.&mdash;The preparation of the Government case went on during this period.</P>
    <P>4.&mdash;We appointed our representative in July of 1923, and called upon the British Government to take the steps necessary on their part for completing the Commission.</P>
    <P>On that I may say that the earliest date, in my opinion, upon which it would be possible for us to approach the British Government on Article 12, was after the 1st April.  It is well within the knowledge of members of the last Dáil that we had not completely taken over our own Customs at that time and, properly speaking, it would not have been correct to make a case for the Boundary Commission until after that had been done, and if there has been any delay in respect of Article 12, it has been from 1st April to 19th July.</P>
    <P>5.&mdash;The General Election here took place in August, 1923, and on 22nd September, 1923, the British Government invited us to a Conference to discuss matters arising out of Article 12.</P>
    <P>6.&mdash;We agreed to attend this Conference &ldquo;in the hope that a basis might be found for the harmonious co-operation of the whole Irish people for their common weal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>7.&mdash;Sir James Craig also accepted the invitation, and it became a question of fixing the date for the Conference.</P>
    <P>8.&mdash;The Imperial Conference sat during October and November, and the Duke of Devonshire, who was to preside, found it impossible to afford time for the Conference during its sittings.</P>
    <P>9.&mdash;A tentative arrangement that the Conference should be held on 15th November was prevented by the political crisis in Great Britain with its resulting General Election.</P>
    <P>10.&mdash;Immediately upon the foundation of the new British Government, the matter was re-opened and the Conference took place on the 1st February.</P>
    <P>11.&mdash;The Conference adjourned to <Col N="2611" /> enable certain proposals to be examined.  Our examination was over on 16th February, when we asked for an immediate re-assembly.</P>
    <P>12.&mdash;Sir James Craig was ill at this stage, and this occasioned further delay.  The Conference re-assembled on the 24th April.  It failed to come to an agreement.  On the 26th April we asked the British Government to take immediate steps to complete the Constitution of the Boundary Commission.</P>
    <P>13.&mdash;The British Government immediately asked the Northern Government to appoint their representative. The Northern Government refused, and the British Government requested the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to advise them as to the steps which they must take, in the circumstances, to carry out their part of the bargain.</P>
    <P>14.&mdash;We protested against the delay occasioned by this request, and urged the immediate appointment of the Chairman, so that work might be begun at once on the important preliminary of ascertaining the wishes of the inhabitants.</P>
    <P>15.&mdash;The Chairman has now been appointed and will arrive in a few weeks.</P>
    <P>16.&mdash;The delays will, therefore, be seen to have occurred from causes without our control, and we have continually urged for expedition. (See particularly No. 11 in correspondence published.)</P>
    <P>The Government has been criticised for entering Conferences in relation to the matters arising out of Article 12. Their reason for accepting the invitations is clearly stated in our despatch of the 8th of October, in which we say that it would indeed be a source of gratification if a discussion could open up a prospect of remedying the unsatisfactory position of Northern Ireland in relation to the rest of the country in a manner compatible with our trust to our people, and fair and reasonable to the parties concerned. We have never regarded a divided Ireland, with the Boundary Commission, as an ideal solution.  We desire the unity of Ireland, and we wished to <Col N="2612" /> leave no stone unturned to assist in securing that end.</P>
    <P>The Conferences did not arrive at agreement, but that they failed cannot be ascribed to any lack of endeavour and good-will on our part.</P>
    <P>The Government has been urged to engage in no further Conferences. We do not expect any further Conferences, nor do we see any likelihood that results would accrue from them. So far as we are concerned, our position is that the preliminary work of the Conference shall begin immediately and without waiting for the further steps, if any, which the British Government may be advised to take to fulfil their end of the contract.  At the same time, as we have already stated, we are willing at all times to consider, even during the sitting of the Commission, any representations which would offer hope of a genuine settlement on the basis of the reunion of Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fixing of a time limit, no time limit has been fixed by the Treaty, and consequently we must apply the general principle of allowing a reasonable time for the carrying out of the contract.  I can give my assurance that the Government will not agree to any unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>I think, sir, I may conclude by reading the letter which I sent on the 4th June in answer to the letter from the British Prime Minister.  I mention this letter because it was written before any notice of motion had been given (reads):&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Prime Minister,&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  I have given earnest consideration to your letter of yesterday, in which you express the opinion that the interval which will elapse before you receive a report from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council might profitably be employed, with the assistance of the Chairman of the Boundary Commission, in examining the general aspect of the problem with a view to seeing how far an agreed settlement is possible.  I regret that I cannot accept this view for the reasons which I gave you on Saturday, namely, that such a course would be bound to afford opportunities for suggestions from one quarter or other of a departure from <Col N="2613" /> strict impartiality on his part, which would be a source of serious embarrassment in the judicial task which he is to undertake.</P>
    <P>2.  The gravest apprehension is felt in Ireland regarding the manner in which Clause 12 of the Treaty has been canvassed.  Since February last it would appear as if the terms of the clause, viz., the wishes of the inhabitants, were to be subordinated to whims of persons in positions of authority and power.  Further examination and approaches towards possible agreement in these circumstances would, of necessity, imply that the rights guaranteed by this Article are in jeopardy, and I have never had any authority to agree to any abrogation of the rights of the inhabitants as defined in the Article.</P>
    <P>3.  You mentioned in the course of the discussion on Saturday last that you were in a position to show me your signature appointing the Chairman. I must say that in the opinion of my Government&mdash;with which I concur&mdash;the appointment should be immediately announced.  There is a large amount of preliminary work to be done which could be undertaken forthwith.  It is evident that a census of the wishes of the inhabitants must be taken before the Commission can settle down to consider the problems which they will finally have to determine. This is purely a matter of machinery for the ascertaining of facts and statistics, so that they may be available for the Commission to work upon.  The collection of this information is, in the opinion of my Government, a duty which should be undertaken at once by the Chairman in conjunction with our representative, and we have addressed an official despatch to Mr. Thomas on these lines.</P>
    <P>4.  I cannot conclude without urging upon you most earnestly that the delay which has occurred in the setting up of the Commission is causing very grave anxiety and unrest in this country.  I realise that you desire to obtain the best legal advice possible as to the steps His Majesty's Government must take to implement Clause 12 and I understand that the reference to a Judicial Committee of <Col N="2614" /> which it is proposed to have the Chief Justice of Australia as a member must entail delay, but it will be represented here publicly and otherwise, and will obtain some measure of credence, that the British Government must have known all along that Sir James Craig would decline to appoint his representative, and that the reference to the Judicial Committee is a device to cause further delay, and, if possible, to shelve the whole matter.</P>
    <P>5.  This is the type of criticism which is most pronounced here, and it is strengthened by the daily references to conferences and solutions in which it is implied that the wishes of the inhabitants are to be ignored. The situation is fast becoming critical, and I shall find it necessary in the very near future to give a day for discussion in the Dáil of the whole problem.  I am very much concerned at the prospect of such a discussion and its possible outcome, unless some definite progress towards the operation of the Commission can be shown. Mr. Thomas wrote me on the 10th April that all the necessary steps had been worked out in advance.  The position now is that delay follows delay, and if we point to the assurances which we have received we will be countered by an inquiry as to what tangible evidence of progress we can show.  The immediate appointment of the Chairman and the starting of the work on the preliminaries would make matters much less difficult and would be regarded by our people as practical evidence that Article 12 is being fully carried out.</P>

    <P>There was an answer to that letter of mine from the British Prime Minister, dated the 6th June, which has been published.  My answer sent last night (reads):&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">17th June, 1924.</P>
    <P>The Right Hon. J. Ramsay</P>
    <P>MacDonald, M.P.,</P>
    <P>Prime Minister,</P>
    <P>10, Downing Street,</P>
    <P>London.</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>1.  A debate upon the Boundary <Col N="2615" /> Question, which began on Friday, is being resumed on Wednesday next, and I shall take the opportunity on that day to lay before the Dáil the text of the later correspondence between us on this subject.</P>
    <P>2.  There are a few points arising out of your letter of the 6th instant which perhaps call for some observations from me.  The most important is your view that there is scarcely any difference in principle between our proposal that the Chairman and Dr. Eoin MacNeill should proceed with the preliminary work of ascertaining the wishes of the inhabitants, and your suggestion that the Chairman, with Dr. MacNeill and a representative from Sir James Craig, should join in preliminary studies with a view to an agreed settlement being arrived at.</P>
    <P>3.  The major difference is that our proposal involves merely a question of setting up the necessary machinery for ascertaining facts and raises no point of policy.  The other proposal postulates explorations for agreement which the principals have already failed, after repeated Conferences, to reach.  If agreement can be reached, it must be reached, not upon the basis of my views, or of Sir James Craig's views, but upon the basis laid down in Article 12 of respect for the wishes of the inhabitants of the area affected and for the economic and geographical conditions.</P>
    <P>4.  The possibility of agreement depends, therefore, upon considerations which have to be ascertained, and our proposal is that the work of ascertaining these considerations should be embarked upon at once. This work Dr. MacNeill is ready to co-operate in at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>5.  As far as we are concerned, we will cordially co-operate in any action which will make for friendship between ourselves in these islands, but we are satisfied that any departure from the elementary democratic principle enshrined in Article 12 would not tend in that direction.  We feel that it is essential for the maintenance of harmony <Col N="2616" /> between nations that the wishes of the inhabitants should be a primary consideration in any system of Government, and we are prepared to translate this view into practice to secure not alone a spirit of brotherhood amongst ourselves, but, so far as it can be accomplished, amongst the whole human race.</P>
    <P>6.  This is the spirit in which I addressed the Assembly of the League of Nations last September.</P>
    <P>7.  I cannot conclude without assuring you that I appreciate fully His Majesty's Government's desire to have the highest available opinion as to their course of procedure, under their Statutes, for giving effect to Treaty obligations entered into by them, and I also appreciate that the delay which is caused thereby may be to a certain extent inevitable.  At the same time, I would urge upon His Majesty's Government that it is in the interests of all parties concerned that existing sources of possible irritation be removed at once, and accordingly that every effort should be made to have all outstanding matters in regard to the setting up of the Boundary Commission composed at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, I ask for your guidance on the matter of procedure.

      <P>The discussion upon the amendment, I think, could embrace the question of the Boundary Commission as well as the question of the Council of Ireland.  But it would be advisable that as far as possible Deputies should express themselves upon the amendment and upon the motion in only one speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">

      <P>The discussion of both matters?  This depends upon whether <Col N="2617" /> or not the President has concluded his observations on the original motion, or concluded his arguments.

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no complication.  Article 12 of the Treaty deals with the Boundary Commission, and has a reference to the Council of Ireland.  I think Deputy Milroy, in putting down his motion, did not advert to the Council of Ireland, but merely to the Boundary Commission. Deputy Johnson, in his amendment, stresses the Council of Ireland. The same questions arise upon the amendment and upon the motion, and the simplest procedure to adopt would be that Deputies should make one speech, choosing whether they will make it on the amendment or on the motion.  That, however, is not a ruling, but rather a suggestion.</P>

      <P>I should just like to say, without dealing at any length with the terms of the original motion, that I quite realise the difficulty of being able to encompass both the motion and the amendment in one speech.  But I think it is fair that I should indicate exactly my attitude with regard to the original motion before devoting the greater part of the few comments I wish to make to the amendment to it.  I agree with the substance of the motion made by Deputy Milroy, with this one exception&mdash;that seeing that he has made complaint and that others have made complaint for a long time that this Boundary Commission, in spite of all its complexities and difficulties, seems to have been unnecessarily delayed, I cannot quite follow his reasoning in urging that the Executive Council should take no further action, but should withdraw and state a definite date.  With that part of his motion I am not in agreement.  Generally in so far as his motion urges that the work on the Boundary Commission ought to be hastened with a view to getting some conclusion at the earliest possible moment&mdash;in so far as that is his intention, so far am I in agreement with the substance and meaning and purport of his motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I wish to confine what I have to say mainly to Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I think Deputy Johnson has served a very valuable purpose in drawing attention to a matter that has for a long time passed away completely from the important place in the entire question in which it was undoubtedly held by the chief negotiators of the Treaty&mdash;that is, the right of the Free State, when constituted, to insist upon the creation of the Council of Ireland with such powers as are attached to that Council, and particularly that that Council may be at once some link between the two Governments, and assemble, and more than assemble, an <Col N="2619" /> actual working proof of that which everybody in Ireland&mdash;in the Free State certainly&mdash;desires far more than a change in the boundary or a rectification of the boundary, and that is the achievement of Irish unity.  It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the argument entered into by Deputy Johnson.  He pointed out, and I just now return to it for the sake of clarity, that the 1920 Act did have that one feature which was judged by the negotiators of the Treaty to be worth preservation.</P>
    <P>That was, that there was an administration representing the unity of this country, and it is well known to the President and to many Deputies in this House that the Chairman of the Irish Delegation attached very considerable importance to the carrying over of the functions of the Council of Ireland from the 1920 Act into Articles 12 and 13 of the Treaty.  There were two kinds of matters with which the Council of Ireland was, under the original Act, empowered to deal.  The first concerned three specified functions.  They were: Railways, Fisheries and the Administration of the Diseases of Animals Acts.  In addition to that, there were certain other powers which were reserved from the two Parliaments created under that, which are referred to throughout that Act as reserved powers.  Among them is one to which I desire at the present moment to draw particular attention, because I think it may prove to be a matter of some importance in the immediate future, and I believe as a negotiating instrument it should be made to be a matter of supreme importance, that is, that the Council of Ireland should be utilised in regard to the completion of land purchase. I will return to that in a moment.  I only say here and now that Article 12 of the Treaty definitely said that the Council of Ireland, in so far as it affected the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland, was to remain, and those who read the debates in the English Parliament upon the Treaty will know that the representatives of Northern Ireland fastened chiefly upon that one question in centering their criticisms upon the Treaty.  I recall that now because I think it is a <Col N="2620" /> matter of some importance the Boundary Commission has achieved a front position which it did not hold at the very outset, because the representatives in the British Parliament from the Six Counties had their chief criticisms to centre upon the Council of Ireland. Why?  For the reason indicated by Deputy Johnson, because the Treaty gave absolute full powers to the Free State as it should be constituted, and as it was subsequently constituted from the Twenty-six Counties, powers that were declared by our Constitution to be such as to make us nationally and legislatively co-equal with England.  Consequently, when the Council so appointed is carried over into the Treaty, the Council of Ireland, representative alike of the Free State and of Northern Ireland, should have for its function only those matters which were reserved to that Council and under the 1920 Act, but only within the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Captain Craig, brother of the Northern Premier, drew attention to that fact in the debate.  He said that it was a provision that they objected to most strenuously against any other provision, for it meant that the Free State would have a voice in the Government of the Six Counties in respect of these particular matters, co-equal with them, whereas they would have no voice in the administration or legislation of the Twenty-six Counties.  Nevertheless, that was the fact.  But that Council, as carried over under Article 12 of the Treaty&mdash;I ask the President to note this, because of a certain sentence that he used in his speech here to-day&mdash;his words were: Article 12 of the Treaty did not operate until December, 1922, and that is correct.  That is a statement of fact.  It cannot be questioned. But if the Article did not operate until December 6th, 1922, how then came it about that the Provisional Government varied an Article which had not already come into operation by which they were not endowed, for he has told us that in November the variation of the Council of Ireland is enforced &mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to be perfectly fair in my argument.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>He cannot say he acted under the powers of the Treaty and still claim that the Provisional Government up to that moment was the Government of Southern Ireland under the 1920 Act.  There are many reasons why he cannot say that. The chief one is that he had not fulfilled, as Deputy Johnson pointed out, the various qualifications that were required of the Government under the 1920 Act, qualifications in respect of oaths that I do not believe the President or any member of the Provisional Government took.  Anyway, after the adoption of the Treaty, a certain variation has been made and the terms of that variation are set out in the Act to which the President has referred, the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act of 1922. Several references have been made to paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule, but the paragraph itself has not been quoted, and I want to quote it in drawing special attention to the words used by Mr. Ormsby Gore, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.  He said that this Clause came before the British Parliament as an agreed clause.  The President demurs to the further words <Col N="2622" /> of Mr. Ormsby Gore, that they implied a variation of the Treaty.  I accept that demurring frankly.  I think his demur is right, because the words do not carry the construction of a variation of the Treaty when the clause is examined.  But there was no demur to the words used by Mr. Ormsby Gore when he said that these two sections of the paragraph came before the British Parliament as an agreed clause. I will read this agreed clause.</P>
      <P>The constitution of the Council of Ireland shall, if identical Acts for the purpose are passed by the Parliament of the Irish Free State and the Parliament of Northern Ireland, be altered in accordance with those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain other words to which I wish to draw particular attention. I pause at this moment to say there is nothing here about five years.  It then goes on to say: &ldquo;and it is hereby declared that the passing of such Acts is within the powers of the said Parliaments.&rdquo; That was after the adoption of our Constitution.  The British Parliament in what it has stated there to be an agreed clause, states that certain powers, certain matters, are within the power of the Free State Legislature. The Free State Legislature is constituted under our Constitution to be coequal with that Parliament, and we know it needs no passing of Acts there to empower this Oireachtas to do any such thing as it purports here to do. But I urge upon the President that he ought to make it clear whether these words&mdash;and I touch upon them now merely in parenthesis&mdash;are correctly stated by Mr. Ormsby Gore to be part of an agreed clause&mdash;that a power is conferred upon this Parliament in contradistinction to the rights stated in the Constitution from the Acts of any other Legislature, but from the Acts of the Constitutional Assembly alone. There is another matter in this connection. We have heard a great deal of the postponement of the powers of the Council of Ireland for five years. The Attorney-General stated in the debate to which reference has been made: &ldquo;This postponement has been for five years.&rdquo;  I will quote the whole of his reference.  He says further: &ldquo;So far <Col N="2623" /> as the Six Counties are concerned the setting up of the Council of Ireland was postponed for five years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The words I have quoted from the Attorney-General <Col N="2625" /> are that so far as the Six Counties were concerned the setting up of the Council of Ireland was postponed for five years, and the jurisdiction was to be exercised by the British Government.  He added that that had been given effect to in an Act which, he goes on to say, was passed by the British Government.  Here are the actual words that Deputy Magennis requires, and I ask if the matter bears the construction given to it by the Attorney-General at the time:&mdash;&ldquo;The appointed day for the transfer in relation to Northern Ireland of the powers which by the principal Act are made powers of the Council of Ireland shall be such day as may hereafter be fixed by Order in Council, not being earlier than the day on which such identical Acts as aforesaid come into operation or the expiration of a period of five years from the passing of this Act, whichever may first happen.  Provided the appointed day for the purposes of Section 10 of the principal Act.&rdquo; It then proceeds to deal with certain other matters.</P>
      <P>The section I have read makes it perfectly clear that there was a postponement, but instead of that postponement being for five years, the postponement is made for five years or for such lesser period as may be decided on between the two Parliaments.  The section does not state that the powers of the Council of Ireland shall in the meantime be exercised by the British Legislature.  I ask if the British Legislature is endowed with the rights and with the powers reserved from the Northern Parliament under the 1920 Act?  What is there to stop the constitution of the Council of Ireland at an earlier date by the two parties that now exercise their respective rights under it, the two parties being the Free State Parliament and the British Parliament, exercising its authority over its subordinate Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do think this is a matter that ought to be pressed, and pressed with equal strength, with the Boundary Commission.  The Boundary Commission has been delayed, and whatever settlement be made under it, it will merely make certain adjustments of territory.  In the meantime, during the <Col N="2626" /> past twelve months, what has been happening in Ireland has been very marked.  I am not weakening or suggesting there should be any departure from the full pressure of all the rights of the Free State, but the Commission of itself is not all.  It is only the creation of partition, and it is the hope of every person that partition may finally be overcome.  Therefore, I think Deputy Johnson has done a service in drawing attention to a matter that is equally important with the Boundary Commission, and, together with it, may help towards the solution of this problem. That is, while steps be taken to correct the boundary in accordance with the wishes of its inhabitants, as stated to be the result to be attained under Article 12, at the same time the other part of Article 12 should also be given effect to, and that is that the Council of Ireland should be created, that Council of Ireland exercising its functions at the earliest possible moment, in order that it might be a symbol and a prospect of Irish unity, which is, after all, the main matter of importance before this nation.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Johnson has done a service in drawing attention to what has been very largely neglected in the past.  Now that the Boundary Commission is attracting a big degree of attention, I think that this matter should be stressed in the future.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that when I speak and indicate my attitude towards the amendment, it must call for some comment from the mover <Col N="2627" /> of the amendment.

      <P>Deputy Milroy appears to be suggesting that we proceed in a circle.  The Deputy's speech, he says, will draw forth comment from the mover of the amendment, and this comment will draw forth counter-comment from Deputy Milroy, so that Deputy Milroy and Deputy Johnson will have a field-day, and perhaps a night, on this question. I think Deputy Milroy is mistaken. Deputy Johnson cannot speak again upon the amendment.  If Deputy Milroy speaks on the amendment and goes into his own motion, it would hardly be fair for him to insist on his right to speak when the discussion on the main question is being wound up and the motion is being put either as it was proposed or as it may be amended.</P>

      <P>I wish to say, first of all, that I regret very much one thing the President said in his statement.  He said this matter had assumed a tincture of party politics for the first time. While I regret he made that observation, still it gives me a little satisfaction, because it enables me to repudiate similar statements that were made outside. I have not brought this question up from any partisan point of view.  I challenge the President or any other critic to analyse every word I said in my speech proposing the motion, and I defy him to find one single word or sentence that departs from the strictly national outlook in regard to this question. It has been said that I moved this motion as an electioneering dodge. It has been said by those who seemingly desire to bring this question down to the low level of the partisan squabbles that disfigured the public life of this country recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What was said here was a faint echo of it.  At any rate it is my attitude that Party considerations should not enter into this matter and that we should face England and the British Government and the spokesmen of England with united front, to assert that not one iota of the rights obtained by this nation under the Treaty will be filched from us.  The amendment of Deputy Johnson I decline to accept, not because I agree with the President's view, not because I am convinced that the issue he (Deputy Johnson) raises is a false one, but because I consider it an issue different from the one which I have raised, which cuts across the issue I have raised and somewhat confuses the idea and obscures the meaning and the vital importance of the issue I have raised.  The issue Deputy Johnson has raised may be a more important one, as he contends, than the one I have raised.  But it is not the same one and, therefore, I cannot see my way to accept it.  But there are one or two comments I would like to make on that amendment, because there is no shadow of doubt as to its importance or as to the importance of the issue it raises. We are told that there was a certain agreement between the Provisional Government, the Northern Parliament and the British Government with regard to the Council of Ireland.  I want to know the date that that agreement was arrived at and the precise nature of the agreement.  I want to know where is the authentic document or documents embodying that agreement. I am not a lawyer.  I do not know much about the tricks of that particular craft, but I have the outlook of the ordinary plain man who considers that agreements between Governments must have legislative expression.  The only indication of such expression we have been informed of is the British &ldquo;Irish Free State Consequential (Provisions) Act.&rdquo; The President has asserted a doctrine which to my mind is very, very faulty. He seems to indicate that publicity of that Act is equivalent to law in this country.  Whether that Act is binding on the British or not does not concern us.  What does concern us is whether it is binding on the Saorstát.  Before <Col N="2629" /> provisions such as are embodied in that Act are binding and law in this country, I think they must get expression in an enactment of the Oireachtas.  The President has said that he cares very little for what is said in another place.  Still, what is said in that other place, if it bears on this matter, is not to be simply dismissed with a dignified gesture of contempt.  The statement referred to was made by the Minister who was explaining and interpreting to that House the provisions of this measure, which, it is implied, is binding upon this country because it received publicity in the columns of Irish journals.  Whatever weight be attached to it, I find a definite conflict of statement between that Minister and the late Attorney-General. He said, bearing upon this matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It only needed the Northern Government to assent to the powers of the Council of Ireland being exercised by the British Government, and in so far as joint action would be taken in reference to a railway affecting both parts of the country, it would be a matter for agreement between the British Government and our own Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words he used were &ldquo;between the British Government and our own Government.&rdquo;  The Minister in the British House, explaining this particular agreement, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The three parties, as it were, have agreed to this solution of the problem of the Council of Ireland, namely: that it should be left without any further intervention from this Parliament to the Parliaments of Northern and Southern Ireland to come to a fresh agreement, other than was originally proposed, by the passing of identical Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I presume we must take the pronouncement of our own Law Officer as the definite and authentic judgment on this matter.  But, if that be true, then the Minister in the British House misled those who listened to him.</P>

      <P>Examine the subject and see whether it is right or not. The Deputy should examine the subject and see what the point in dispute is.  The ex-Attorney-General made the case that this was simply interpreting, or giving a date for the interpretation <Col N="2630" /> of the other Act.  If there be a variation, let the Deputy tell us where it is.</P>

      <P>I was not commenting upon the question of the variation of the Treaty, though I might do so, were it not that time presses.  I was simply drawing attention to a very important consideration, that in regard to this particular Act or agreement one statement is made in this House and a vitally different one in the British House. Therefore, I say that this amendment raises a very important issue, but a different one from the one in my motion, and I must decline to accept it. I have no desire to create an embarrassing situation for the Executive of this State, and it was not for the purpose of doing any thing that would add one iota to the already heavy burden on their shoulders that I raised this matter. If I announce now that I do not propose to press this to a division, I do not want that attitude to be misunderstood. The primary motive animating me in raising this motion is to make it perfectly clear where we stand and to make perfectly definite what will be the inevitable consequences of the nonobservance by Great Britain of the part of the Treaty we have been discussing.</P>
      <P>I spent my week-end within the Six Counties and I met a good many people there&mdash;people who are living under the conditions that have arisen out of the abnormal circumstances that have recently arisen there.  Certainly, none of them expressed in the slightest degree that they read into what I have said anything in the nature of a partisan attitude.  But there was a general and emphatic approval of my attitude in this matter.  As the lives and future of these people will be vitally affected by what transpired I contend that their attitude on the present situation and on the declarations made in reference to this matter is not something to be ignored or derided.  The position there at the moment so far as the Nationalist and Catholic majority is concerned, is that of hopeless impotence.  They have been driven out of every sphere of political and administrative life. They feel their impotence and their inability to extricate themselves, and they look to this Assembly to see that they are not abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2631" /> We have heard from those opposed to us in this matter in the North-East the argument that the Treaty does not over-ride the Act of 1920.  They seem to lose sight of the fact that the Act of 1920 was simply a creature of the British Parliament and that its creator could, if necessary, unmake it at any time, whereas the Treaty is a solemn international contract between two States, negotiating and arriving at decisions as equals.  This Act of 1920 has perpetrated a manifest, serious and vital injury upon a great number of the citizens of the Six Counties and it does not possess any attribute of immortality and can be repealed just as easily and as equitably as any other oppressive statute.  The proposals embodied in the Act of 1920 were never intended as a solution of the problems confronting those concerned at the time, but were intended merely as an expedient by which to thwart the national aspirations of the people.  Since it has become an Act the policy has been pursued, persistently, ingeniously and malignantly, of reducing the Catholics and Nationalists of that part of Ireland to the state of helots.</P>
    <P>This Article in the Treaty, which we are considering, provides the means by which those people to whom I refer can be rescued from that position.  The Treaty guarantees certain rights to those people.  The question that arises, and which I want to emphasise as insistently as I can, is this: Are these guarantees going to be cancelled by the inaction or evasions of the British? Certainly the indications of attitude or outlook on the part of the British, all during the period when this matter has been under discussion, gives even the most patient person, I think, the impression that they desire either to cancel these guarantees or to allow them to become a dead letter.  These indications <Col N="2632" /> of their attitude are, I think, ample justification for the suspicion in our minds that the British statesmen do desire to evade their commitments under Article 12 and, I think, make it imperative that we should make it clear beyond all shadow of doubt that such an attitude and such a policy will receive no countenance from us; that England must honour her bond in this matter or else the Treaty goes smash, and it will be England and England's statesmen who will have broken the Treaty.</P>
    <P>If that eventuality comes, this State will stand before the world as a State that has honoured its bond at a terrible cost, and England will stand disgraced in the eyes of the world as a nation that has dishonoured its bond. It is in order to emphasise that and to make it clear that that is the view that will be taken in such an eventuality, that I have put down this motion.  It may be that it has been sufficiently indicated, at least I hope so.  I recognise the gravity of all I am saying, and I recognise the gravity of this issue.  I do not wish anyone here, or anyone outside of this Assembly, to imagine for a moment that any motives of expediency or political interest animated me in tabling this motion.  It was nothing less than national interest that animated me in putting down the motion.  I hope I have disabused the mind of the President that any feelings such as those he seems to have assumed in the course of his statement, were in my mind.  There were no feelings of the kind in my mind at all.</P>
