      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any award or compensation has been made to William Mulvihill, Rapparee Hill, Killashee, Co.

      <P>No claim on behalf of the person named by the Deputy in respect of personal injuries or loss of property can be traced in my Ministry.  A claim founded on an alleged robbery at the hands of British forces would, in any event, not be within the scope of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, and as no award thereon is possible the question of payment does not arise.</P>

      <P>An Order has been issued entitled the County Board of Health (Assistance) Order, 1924, prescribing rules and regulations for the administration of home assistance.  The Order sets out the procedure, in regard to the granting of home assistance, under which the assistance officers are required to investigate each application and furnish the Board of Health with particulars on prescribed forms, to enable that Body to decide on the merits of the applications.  The assistance officer is the only person who can pay home assistance.  The regulations are made under the Poor Relief Acts and the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, particularly section 10.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is only fair that the Dáil should give the promoters an opportunity of explaining the merits of the measure before a Joint Committee. This will not prejudice the position of any other Bill, because when those Bills dealing with the same object come before the Dáil and Seanad again, after going through the Committee Stage, it would be open to the Dáil or Seanad to reject whatever measure they think should be rejected.  I think if the Dáil turns down those Bills for no other reason than that an opposition proposal has not been brought forward at the same time, it will only mean the discouraging <Col N="1158" /> of private enterprise.  As you are aware, those Bills are being promoted at considerable expense to the promoters.  It would be obviously unfair to those people to hold up their measures because other people did not show the same promptitude in coming forward.  I beg to propose this resolution in reference to the Dublin Electricity Supply Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I would like to know what the position will be if this resolution is rejected by the Dáil, in view of the fact that the last day for the lodging of Private Bills was last Tuesday.  If this Resolution is rejected, will the Bill simply be discharged, will the promoters have their deposit returned, and will it be possible for them to have the Bill considered simultaneously with the Bill that is being promoted by the Dublin Corporation, and which, I believe, was lodged on Monday?  Shall we require to amend Standing Orders to enable them to do so, or can it be made an instruction to the Committee, if, and when, it is appointed, to postpone consideration of this Bill and of the other Bills on the Paper until the Dublin Corporation Bill also comes before them?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be several questions.  With regard to what would happen if this Motion were rejected&mdash;if the Motion were rejected it would mean that the Dáil refused to co-operate in the formation of a Joint Committee to consider this Bill.  The promoters of the Bill would then have the option of sending it through the Seanad.  The Seanad has agreed to consider it in Committee, and could appoint a Special Seanad Committee to consider the Bill.  Then they could take the Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Bill in the Seanad, and send it down to us, in which case it would occupy the same position in regard to us as a Public Bill; that is to say it would go through the usual Stages.  The Committee which framed the Standing Orders had in mind that contingency, and the promoters of a Private Bill would have to ask themselves whether, when a Bill had been rejected by the Dáil, it was <Col N="1159" /> worth while spending more money on it when the chances of getting it through the Dáil, after it had passed the Seanad, would be slender.  That is the principal point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The question I was asked was: What would the effect of rejecting the Motion be?  The effect would be a refusal to appoint a Joint Committee; that would be rejecting the Bill.  It would have the same effect, from our point of view, as rejecting a Public Bill on the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>That would require a motion, and deferring the Bill for two months might bring it into a new session.  If the President's programme of adjourning early in July is carried out, the promoters then would either have to go through all the expense again, or we would have to amend the Private Bill Standing Orders, so as to allow the Bill to be taken up in a new session.  Or perhaps we could pass a motion in both Houses which would enable the Bill to be considered in the new session.  That question has not been considered, but I take it that if we want to do it we can do it.</P>

      <P>I think so.  The other arrangement may be made as well.  Does that dispose of all the points that Deputy Cooper raised? I was trying to dispose of them <i>seriatim.</i> The first point is that if this motion were rejected it would be equivalent to the rejection of a Public Bill on the Second Reading.  The motion itself is made under, I think, Standing Order 58.  The motion involves the acceptance by the Dail of the principle of the Bill, and in the case of a Private Bill it is difficult to say what exactly the principle would be.  It may be defined to be this: That the Dáil considers that the Bill is worth consideration in Committee; I think not much more than that.  The Seanad has decided that these two Bills are worth consideration by a Special Joint Committee. If the Dáil concurs in that, it agrees with the principle of the Bill to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point of order&mdash;would it be in order, if this Motion were carried, for any Deputy who wishes to postpone consideration of this Bill to move that it be an instruction to the Committee to postpone consideration of this Bill and of the other Bill on the Orders of the Day until they are prepared to consider the Dublin Corporation Bill as well?  I think there are precedents for that course, but I am not quite sure whether they exist in Private Bill legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I am anxious that the Bill should be proceeded with now and a Committee set up at once, but I gathered that the general opinion of the Dáil&mdash;of all parties&mdash;when we discussed this matter last week, was that this Bill and the other Bill, as to which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle also has a motion, should be deferred until the Dublin Corporation Bill can also come under consideration. If that is the opinion of the Dáil, surely it would be better to confirm the principle, of these two Bills, <Col N="1161" /> say that they are worth consideration by a Committee but that the Committee should not actually consider them until the Dublin Corporation Bill comes before them as well.  That would be giving the three Bills an equal chance. As I have said, I would prefer, myself, that we went on to consider these two Bills, which have legitimate advantages of priority.  If that is not the wish of the Dáil, I cannot help thinking it would be a singularly bad precedent to reject Bills which had complied with Standing Orders and against which nothing can be said except that the Dublin Corporation is also in the field and seeks to have the matter deferred until they are ready&mdash; I should rather say, the late Dublin Corporation.  I wish to speak with respect of the dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>A point that did not strike me before is this, that we could not of ourselves give instructions to a Joint Committee. We should have to send a Message to the Seanad asking their concurrence in an instruction to the Joint Committee. The procedure normally is this: If we concur in the appointment of a Joint Committee, the Joint Committee is appointed by the Joint Committee on Standing Orders for Private Business. Normally the same Deputies and Senators would be appointed to consider a group of Bills dealing with the same thing.  That is to say, all these schemes for getting power from rivers would be referred to the same Joint Committee. There is therefore this certainty that in the case of these two Bills they would be referred to the same Joint Committee with the same Chairman.  If the Dublin Corporation Bill complies with the Standing Orders and comes to this stage the probability is that, given that it comes before the same Dáil, of course, it would be sent for consideration, if sent for consideration at all, to the same Joint Committee. Whether there is any advantage in sending three Bills at the same time to the same Committee I am not aware. After the Committee has reported and the Bill comes to us from the Seanad, its consideration can be deferred.  I understand that it is not usual in other places to give instructions to Joint Committees on Private Bills.</P>

      <P>That very important point having been settled, may I say for the information of the Dáil that I rise to explain, in my personal capacity, my knowledge of what the Corporation were doing, not through being a member of the Corporation, but through knowledge acquired in other directions.  This Private Bill procedure we recognise, first of all, is quite new, and there has been rather delay in putting it into operation.  Prior to this Liffey Water Scheme coming before the Dáil in the shape of Bills, the Corporation were working on lines to co-operate all in the public interest; that is, different public bodies and large users of electricity in a joint proposal to put forward a hydro-electrical scheme for developing the Liffey; I attended a good many meetings where the effort of the Corporation was not to act on their own, but to act in the capacity of forming a joint electrical body to govern and control the development of electricity in the district.  These meetings to my knowledge took a great deal of time, and were ultimately abortive because the various public bodies, for instance, like the urban councils, did not see their way to enter into a joint proposal of the sort.  During that time the syndicates which represent the Bills that are before you, were, of course, free to work out their plans, which ultimately culminated in the lodging of the Bills in the Dáil.  But when the Corporation found that they could not get co-operation, they had a long and weary process to go through to get the authority of their own bodies.  I do not wish to say that I <Col N="1163" /> agree in any way with what they did; but I want to show you the difficulties they had to go through by way of a sort of justification for the delay in the lodging of this scheme.  They, as a public body, had to go through certain forms of procedure which naturally took longer than would be necessary in the case of private enterprise. The operation of calling meetings of the Council together, getting the authority of the Council, and all that sort of thing took a good deal of time, and I understand they claim that is the reason why their Bill is not as far forward as the other Bills in the other Liffey water schemes.  But whether it is right or not, and whether we agree that the Corporation is the right body to do this, or whether we do not, it would seem to me, that it would not be reasonable under the circumstances to turn down this proposal; bearing in mind that the Corporation have for many years been working on this project and have employed an expert to go over the whole scheme, the result of which is at the disposal of all and sundry for their information, it would not be reasonable for the Dáil to ignore the fact that the Corporation, as representing the citizens proposed to go on with this project of harnessing the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, nobody in the Dáil would suggest, and so far as I am concerned I would be the last to claim, that the other syndicates should be, in any way, embarrassed by reason of the delay in the lodging of the Corporation Bill.  On the other hand the Corporation Bill, as I see it, deals with exactly the same proposals or practically with the same proposals as these two Bills that are before us for consideration.  Now, if the Dáil wishes that these Bills be taken separately, irrespective of the proposal of the Corporation, it would seem to me that it would be imposing a very heavy tax on the Corporation and, through them, on the citizens, in first providing for the opposition to those Bills, and ultimately for the separate hearing of their own proposal.  Now without being in favour of one or the other of them, I do think that the claim of the Corporation is a fair one.  This is a project of public utility, and at all <Col N="1164" /> events it should be heard concurrently with any of the other proposals that are put forward.  That is all that I would claim as far as the Corporation is concerned.  I claim that they have a right to participate on equal terms in connection with any proposals put forward about the harnessing of the Liffey, and I would ask the Dáil to take into consideration at the same time that our own Private Bill procedure was a good deal delayed, and very few people in Dublin, or in the country, were very conversant with what was going to be Private Bill procedure, and very little time has since elapsed for people to be conversant with the steps that should be taken in matters of the kind.  If the argument is, that because the Corporation Bill has not been lodged up to time, I would claim for it that that might not be right in the future, but in the particular circumstance of the case a certain amount of latitude ought to be allowed in this connection when starting the whole machinery of Private Bill legislation.  I would, therefore, ask the Dáil to deal with the matter in that light, if possible, without doing any injustice to the syndicates who have put down their money and put their energy into their own Bills to try and arrive at some conclusion whether the Corporation Bill will not be prejudiced.</P>

      <P>The suggestion I made on the last occasion, and I will put it in the form of a motion if necessary, is that consideration of these Bills should be delayed for two months.  If the delay of two months puts the other Bills into such a position, as Deputy Johnson suggested, that they may be thrown out altogether, some alternative proposal might be made to get over that difficulty.  I think it would be a great hardship if the syndicates promoting the other Bills are mulcted with heavy costs because of this delay.  It is not their fault.  On the other hand, it is not altogether the fault of the Corporation that their Bill is not in, and perhaps the Dáil might devise some means without being unjust to any party.</P>

      <P>This matter of harnessing the Liffey was brought forward by me first in the Dáil in October last.  I suggested it in the few remarks I made on the Governor - General's Address, and I suggested that the Government should take the matter up as a means of giving employment.  There was nothing done, and some months afterwards four companies took up the matter.  Since then they have been bringing Bills forward.  The Dublin Corporation, which has a very eloquent advocate in Deputy Hewat, had every opportunity of bringing forward a Bill along with the other Bills.  They did not do so.  The people of this district have been looking forward to the work being carried out, and it was chiefly for that reason that I brought the matter forward in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have no personal interest in it, and I do not care whether it is done or not except that I think it would be a great advantage to the district and it would give employment.  It is only for that reason that I am interested.  The people are grievously disappointed that some selection has not been made. There has been a frightful delay over this matter, and it is most unfair for the companies concerned that there should be any further delay.  I have the interests of my constituents at heart; the scheme should be worked for their benefit and they should get employment as soon as possible.  I do not see that there would be any gain to the country or any persons concerned by having any further delay in order to allow the Dublin Corporation to come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation have had <Col N="1166" /> their chance.  They were the premier Corporation of Ireland, and you would think that they would have their wits about them and that they would be able to guard their own interests.  I do not see why any favour should be shown them.  They had, perhaps, better opportunities than others to deal with this matter.  It would be most unfair that the two companies that have complied with the Standing Orders should not have a chance of going before the Committee.</P>

      <P>The Corporation Bill has been lodged, and in so far as it had been lodged up to time it is in order.  It will be examined for compliance with Standing Orders on the 21st or 22nd June.  If the Examiner decides that it has complied with the Standing Orders, and if no appeal is lodged against his decision, the First Reading of the Bill in the Seanad could take place on the 26th or 27th June. Assuming it gets a First Reading in the Seanad&mdash;a practically automatic Stage &mdash;the Second Reading in the Seanad must take place within fourteen days from the 26th and 27th June, that is to say, before the 9th July.  If we adjourn on the 4th July until October, we could not consider a Message similar to the one we are considering now, about the Corporation Bill, until October.</P>

      <P>One of the principal considerations in the putting forward of this Bill was economy and public benefit.  Now, the Corporation did not lose one minute in connection with the lodgment of this Bill.  From the moment they got leave from the Local Government Minister to go on with the Bill, and from the moment they got the power to spend the citizens' money in connection with it, they did not lose a single moment.  In fact the short period <Col N="1167" /> which it took to put forward the Bill, since they were empowered to do so, constitutes a record.  Private people have the advantage of being able to put their hands down deep into their pockets and pay Parliamentary Agents. If the Corporation had not gone on with the work, worked out a scheme, spent thousands of pounds, had everything pigeon-holed, and got a foreign expert to come over here, no Private Bill could have got as far as this.  I know nothing at all about other Bills. The Corporation claim that they were in time, and I think it is only fair to the citizens that the Bills should be all considered at one and the same time.</P>

      <P>We seem to be at cross-purposes a little on this question.  I do not think I could receive an amendment to this Motion to postpone the consideration for two months, because this is a Message from the other House.  We are asked to appoint a Joint Committee; I think we simply have to refuse or accept.  I have no interest in this matter, but it may satisfy Deputies to know that even when the Joint Committee has reported, the Bills do not thereby become law.  The Joint Committee will report; the Seanad will consider that report on Fourth Stage and then on Fifth Stage. When the Bill has gone to the Seanad it will come to us.  It is very unlikely, if we appoint a Joint Committee, that we will be considering the Bill, as reported from the Joint Committee and amended in the Seanad, if it be amended in the Seanad, before the autumn.  At that time the Corporation Bill, if it goes smoothly, as I have said, will have reached a certain stage, and we would then be concerned, not with the Joint Committee, but with our own procedure, and it will be quite open to us to delay if we please.  But moving to delay this proposal is, I think, impossible in view of the fact of this Message from the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, from what I can learn, the usual procedure to have a number of Bills of the one principle, or on the one matter, debated one after another by any Committee. It certainly does not tend either to the convenience of the Committee or of the Dáil.  Here is a quotation from May's Parliamentary Practice, 1917, the last edition of this work, which concerns the practice of dealing with the question of competing Bills.  The learned author writes: &ldquo;It is usually arranged that competing Bills shall be introduced in one and the same House so as to be considered together, and that generally, all the Bills should, as far as possible, be allocated with a view to convenience of handling.&rdquo;  It certainly does not seem &mdash;and I am not the only Deputy that holds that opinion&mdash;that it is fair to consider the three Bills one after the other, particularly when there are other arguments, that in this case, if the motion is carried, these Bills will have the advantage over that of the Corporation. Now, the Corporation claim that, being the authority for the supply of electricity to the City of Dublin and part of the suburbs, it is right that they should have the same opportunity of being considered with the other Private Bills.  That has been the effect <Col N="1169" /> of legislation, that the public authority and not private companies, ought to operate where a public utility service is considered.</P>
      <P>As to the delay which has been referred to regarding the Corporation not being in the same position to-day as in the case of the other two Bills, I might point out that the Corporation were first in the field with this scheme; there is no doubt whatever about that. At considerable expense they engaged the services of an eminent Swiss waterpower engineer, who reported favourably on the scheme, and it was when he reported favourably that the matter was taken up by two private companies. Owing to the Corporation having to comply with procedure that private companies had not, delay took place, and hence the two private Bills referring to the scheme are ready and the Corporation one is not, because of having to comply with one of the Standing Orders that seems to be to their disadvantage, and that is Standing Order 45: &ldquo;The Examiner shall give at least seven clear days' notice in the Private Bills Office of the day appointed for the examination of each proposed Bill, which shall have been duly deposited and there shall have been at least 30 days between the deposit of any proposed Private Bill and the examination thereof.&rdquo;  That means, in my opinion anyway, that unless the two months is granted to have these Bills considered jointly on their merits, the citizens, who are entitled to some consideration in this matter, would be deprived of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that there will not be much delay in any case.  Whatever happens to this motion the Joint Committee that is to consider this Bill and, presumably, the East Leinster Electricity Supply Bill, referred to in the next motion, will have to consider and report, and the Bill then will have to go through the Seanad, come to the Dáil and find its way amongst a multitude of other Bills that are threatened.  There is no chance of its passing before the adjournment in July, and consequently, unless there is something in the Standing Orders contrary to what I am now saying, the procedure will have to be gone through again, or the discussion <Col N="1170" /> of the Bill can take place after the resumption in the autumn.  I would say that the Dublin Bill will then know where it stands in respect of its parentage.  Since this question was mooted last week, when the President suggested that the matter be deferred until to-day rather than two months hence, a change has taken place in respect of the Dublin Corporation.  The Dublin Corporation, as elected by the citizens, has a policy in regard to electricity supply, and they promoted a Bill.  By the action of the Minister for Local Government the people who were responsible for that policy have been deprived of their authority, and somebody else, responsible only to him, has been put into their place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil does not know what the view of that new authority is to be respecting the electricity supply for the City of Dublin, and if it so happens that the Minister for Local Government disapproves of the Dublin Corporation seeking powers in respect of electricity supply in such a scheme as is in question, then the new authority which he has placed in power would say: &ldquo;Well, we are not interested in this scheme, because we are not pushing it forward.&rdquo;  As one who believes that works of public utility ought to be conducted and carried through by public authorities, people responsible to the public, I think that the right policy for the Dáil to adopt in this matter is to delay the promotion of any private schemes until we know what the authority representing the citizens of Dublin is going to do regarding electricity supply.  I would oppose the promotion of any private scheme simply to assist, as it may be, a new authority, responsible only to the Minister, to prevent the development of electricity supply schemes.  It may very well be, very likely is, judging by the general attitude of the Minister, that he wants to thwart the Corporation scheme and therefore has appointed Commissioners, responsible only to himself and having no responsibility to the citizens, to prevent the Corporation scheme from going ahead, allowing private schemes to get their way, and by the delay to see that there will be no future for the Dublin Corporation scheme.  That I believe to be a probability, if not a certainty, <Col N="1171" /> and judging by the revelations of the Minister's general attitude in public policy, one of his purposes in dethroning the Dublin Corporation and enthroning Commissioners responsible only to himself was to defeat the Dublin Corporation electricity supply scheme.  Having that in mind I propose to vote against this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson may, I think, reassure himself.  If we are to judge from outward and visible signs the Minister for Local Government is not interested in this matter at all.  I do not think there is any such Machiavellian proposal in his supersession of the Dublin Corporation as to torpedo their interests.  I think it was merely the process of which Deputy Johnson has heard, the filling up of the cup.  The cup was full, and it overflowed. I am sorry that Deputy Hewat is not here, for I recognise that Deputy Hewat, like Oxford University, is the home of lost causes, but I never expected to find him taking the Dublin Corporation under his sheltering wing. Some of his arguments were rather fallacious.  He said it was not reasonable for the Dáil to ignore the Corporation. It is not doing so.  The Corporation has all the rights under the Standing Orders to oppose any of these schemes, and to be heard by counsel in opposition to the schemes, and that right it is exercising.  One might as reasonably complain that the Rathmines Urban Council has been ignored.  They also have lodged an objection against these schemes, and they also have interests, but, because they have not thought fit to bring in a Bill of their own, they do not ask that these other schemes should be shelved until they prepare a Bill.  The Corporation is also participating on equal terms, says Deputy Hewat, but what he and those who are voting for the rejection of this motion are asking, is not the right of the Corporation to participate on equal terms, but the right of the Corporation to a priority, because if the promoters of this Bill, and the East Leinster Bill, did not elect to go to the Seanad at considerable cost and with almost a certainty that the Bill will be rejected when it comes here, then their only option is to withdraw the Bill.  The last <Col N="1172" /> day for lodging another Bill was last Tuesday, and, therefore, they cannot be heard simultaneously with the Corporation Bill, and they will have to wait until the autumn or this time next year. If you reject this motion, you are not giving the Corporation equality; you are giving the Corporation, or the Commissioners acting for the Corporation, an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument of Deputy Hewat was that the Corporation had very little time to get acquainted with Private Bill Procedure.  These Standing Orders were adopted last December, and the Corporation, as compared with a private individual, has innumerable advantages in dealing with this question, because they have a set and standing legal department, and engineering department.  The ordinary individual has to go out and find a solicitor who understands these things, and an engineer, if necessary, if he wishes to promote a Bill.  What the members of the Corporation who have spoken have told us is that the Corporation has been in the field for months, and years, I think, was suggested. I can only say it is very unfortunate that at the crucial moment the Corporation fell asleep, at any rate so far as the outside world can judge. I am not a member of the Corporation. I have many sins on my conscience, but not that.  The first mention so far as the general public were able to discover on the Corporation side of any measure of this kind was in the public Press, after these two Bills had been lodged about February this year.  The Corporation suddenly became interested. Deputy Keogh says the Corporation lost no time.  I believe they lost no time once they started, but they did not start soon enough.  They allowed two valuable months to go by before beginning to think about lodging their Bill They have really no grievance at all. They have the right of every public body under Standing Orders.  If you confer on them a privilege, because by rejecting this motion you will confer on them a valuable privilege of priority, I can only say that I am very apprehensive that there will be no private enterprise for promoting Private Bills, and private industry will feel itself so much at the mercy of any organised <Col N="1173" /> body of the kind, that they will be slow to incur the risk and expense of the promotion of a Private Bill.  That is Deputy Johnson's object.  He does not wish private enterprise in any essential service, but I do not think <Col N="1174" /> that is the object of the majority of the Dáil, and if they wish for a fair field and fair play for all bodies, whether a corporation or private syndicates, I believe they will be wise in assenting to this motion.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Provided, however, that the Minister shall be entitled, at any time within three months after the passing of this Act, to lodge with the railway tribunal an objection to the continuance of any such agreement on the ground that its continuance would be contrary to the public interest, and the tribunal shall consider any objection so lodged and shall make such order as to the continuance, annulment or variation of such agreement, including matters ancillary thereto, as shall seem to the tribunal to be equitable and expedient in the public interest, and an order so made shall come into full force and effect on a date to be fixed by the tribunal when making the order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As there has been already about three hours' discussion on Amendment 15 (a) as to the agreements and the effects they have on the welfare of the public, I do not wish to say very much.  This amendment gives permission to the Minister, if he thinks fit, to lodge with the Railway Tribunal within <Col N="1176" /> three months of the passing of the Act an objection to the continuance of any such agreement.  As it confers power upon the Minister to do something in the interests of the general public, if he thinks it fit and necessary, I do not think he should have any objection to accepting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only the objection to this amendment that Deputy Johnson had previously to the tribunal.

I prefer to leave that to a judicial tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister agree that any such agreement shall be made known to him, or to his successor, or whoever is the authority at the time.  I have information that shows how necessary a provision of this kind is.  Certain powers were applied for by an English railway some years ago to run into a station owned by another company.  They argued when they applied to Parliament for the power that it was necessary in the general interests and for public convenience.  But having got the powers, the first company entered into an arrangement with the company owning the station to refrain from exercising the powers they had obtained, and in consideration of so refraining they paid an annual sum of £30,000.  That may seem to be quite satisfactory between company and company, but if such an arrangement, for instance, were made as between the amalgamated company and any other organisation of any kind, it would impose upon the amalgamated company the necessity for taking out of the trading public an additional £30,000 per year.  That sum would be required to be expended to meet the annual requirements of their traffic.  It would be consequential upon an agreement, and, of course, the public would have to pay.  If such an agreement may be entered into without notification to the Minister or without his having the right to object and to bring the matter before the tribunal&mdash;which, I think, is <Col N="1177" /> what this amendment provides for&mdash; the public will be made to suffer.  The Minister is not asked in this case to judge finally.  He is asked to take powers to object to the continuance of any such agreement and to submit that objection to the Tribunal.  Does anybody think that is unreasonable?  Does anybody disagree with the contention that such power is essential to be given to the Minister?  I would have thought that was the obvious desire the Minister would have in such a Bill as this, and I would like to hear his reasons for disagreeing with it.</P>

      <P>I was viewing this amendment in the light of what I had said yesterday: that it was now proposed to limit Section 29 to agreements confirmed by Statute.  This amendment, as I now read it, deals with agreements, and if Deputies will look at Section 58 they will see that we have pretty well the same ideas with regard to agreements&mdash;that agreements may be varied or rescinded on an order made by the Minister.</P>

Section 58 has exactly the same idea underlying it as in this amendment.  It is also proposed to amend Section 58 slightly.  It is phrased in the negative and the words &ldquo;without the consent of the Minister&rdquo; would seem to imply that appeal would have to be made to the Minister before he could interfere.  A proposal will be made to remove that, and to leave it that they shall not be varied or rescinded without an Order from the Minister, but the Minister may by Order get the matter referred to the tribunal, In so far as this deals with agreements it is met by Section 58.</P>

      <P>I do not want points to be made which might be brought up against me on the Report Stage.  There is no statutory agreement as between the London, Midland and Scottish and the Dublin and South Eastern Railway from clauses 1 to 11 of their agreement.  Clauses 1 to 11 are not statutory.  It is only from clause 12 on that the agreement is made statutory.  This section has relation to a statutory enactment dealing with the protection of ports.  This section is limited to that, but I propose to put it to the Dáil to amend it, so that it will read: &ldquo;Terms <Col N="1179" /> and conditions and provisions of any statutory enactment, or of any agreement which has received express statutory confirmation.&rdquo;  I do not propose to introduce into Section 58 in the matter of agreements any such idea as that contained in amendment 19: that it shall be lawful for one of the parties, within six months after the passing of this Act, to give notice to rescind or modify.  I do not accept the idea contained in this amendment at all.  It is different entirely from the last amendment, in which the idea is not merely acceptable, but is to be included in the proposed addition to Section 58.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the amendment in that form.  The meaning of this amendment, I think, is that in Section 29 it gives protection, which seems to be taken away to a large extent by Section 34 (1 and 2) and Section 55 (1).  The main contention I am standing for is, that the ports should have full protection against any undue preference, and, more particularly, as far as Dublin is concerned, so that it shall not be put in an unfair position.  As far as Section 29 is concerned, I think the discussion has gone very fully into the whole matter.  In some way I think the Minister appreciates the need for revision or modification of some of the provisions of the Bill.  I would be agreeable not to <Col N="1180" /> press the amendment if he has the matter under consideration.</P>

      <P>Again I wish to utter a word of warning.  I have proposed to reconstruct Section 29 by preventing it applying to agreements which have not been confirmed by statute.  This is an entirely different thing, to insert the words &ldquo;or by unfair diversion of traffic.&rdquo;  That is definitely met in sub-section 2 of Section 29.  That surely includes what is sought to be prevented by the words set out in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister recognises that the agreement with the Great Western Railway might operate in a very unfair way, but he has pointed out safeguards.  The Minister says he must stick to the statutory agreements, but inferentially he admits that the ports, or the people concerned, should have protection against undue preference.  For instance, in the Great Western agreement there is a provision that the Great Southern should influence traffic from Dublin along to Kilkenny.  He says that is embodied in the Act, and, therefore, it is not non-statutory.  In furtherance of that agreement the Great Southern continue to do, what we claim to be an improper act, and we want protection, as far as we can get it, even if we cannot convince the Minister that it would be wise to interfere with the statutory rights of the company.  We claim that we should get reasonable protection in this Bill against the undue inner working of the railway mind in this matter.  If we could go to the Tribunal and say, &ldquo;Traffic is being influenced from Dublin and other places via Rosslare,&rdquo; we want to be perfectly sure that that will be considered undue preference to Rosslare.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to admit that I was as imperialistic in my outlook as Deputy McBride suggests, if I held the imperialistic Free Trade views that he has given expression to. I suggest, as an explanation of his ignorance, in regard to the interpretation of this section the fact that he was not present here during the Committee Stage of the proceedings.  While I do not care for a good deal of Deputy Hewat's argument, I may agree with what he is aiming at, but not for the same reasons that he gives in support of his attitude.  The object of the Deputies who supported Deputy Redmond's amendment yesterday evening was to see that no undue preference was given to one port, that is Rosslare, as against any others.  The Minister's contention is this, that he only makes any concession for a revision of agreements where these agreements are not conferred by statute.  He is not prepared to admit that any case can be made out in any circumstances for the revision or reconsideration of any agreement in the nature of a statutory agreement.  The President argued the other evening that a bargain is a bargain, and as far as I can understand the reason for that argument that a bargain is a bargain was because the bargain was made by some law passed in the British House of Commons.  It is a new kind of argument for an assembly of this kind.  It may be, and I am quite certain it will be that the laws we are passing here to-day in the <Col N="1182" /> machine made way we are turning them out may not be suitable to whatever Minister is sitting on the Government Benches in five or ten years hence. If that is the case and the laws we are making now can be repealed five or ten years hence for good reason, surely the laws made in the British Parliament can also be repealed if there is good reason for it.</P>

I may not have taken him up right, but I believe he asked me if I hold that this House can vary an agreement made by the British Parliament. I give the answer quite definitely in the affirmative&mdash;we can.  But what I put to the House yesterday was, knowing the House has that power, was it equitable to vary and rescind a particular agreement?  That particular agreement, I take it, is the worst of a series of agreements, and it was <Col N="1183" /> dilated on, to some extent, to show that even taking it as the worst of them, it was not very objectionable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> I think it is only right to inform the Committee that this is an amendment which follows on a resolution passed by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and indicates the position that they would like the Committee to consider. As far as I can make it out the Manchester Shipping Canal when it was originally built received a very considerable measure of support and excited a great deal of interest on the other side.  Therefore, I suppose they wish me to claim on their behalf due consideration for the amendment which I now bring before the Committee.  The development of traffic on the canal has been greatly hampered by the attitude of some of the railways.  One can, of course, understand that that is so.  The Manchester Canal came in competing at points with a system operating via Liverpool and other ports.  The canal and Manchester port do not get through rates, but traffic taken by the railways is carried on a through rate basis to centres in Great Britain from Ireland.  Of course that is a handicap to Manchester and they seem to resent it, and it also throws light upon the ramifications and powers of the railway companies in dealing with traffic, which I would like to emphasise this time, because the Committee may consider that I have been an advocate of the railway companies in some cases, and I would like to disabuse their minds on that point.  I have no interest in the railway companies as such.  As far as I am concerned, I tried to plough my lonely furrow, but with due regard to the traffic passing through Dublin.</P>
    <P>The English and Irish railways have in the past refused to extend through rates to the Canal.  I hope the amendment I propose on this occasion will have the sympathy of the Committee, and that Deputy Cooper will not be able to taunt me again with championing a lost cause.  I hope the Committee will provide that the amalgamated company, when it operates, shall not differentiate between ports, and that as far as it can through rates shall operate fairly all round, and that in this particular case the through rates shall operate through Manchester by Liverpool, Holyhead, or any other ports. After all, this is a Bill for unification, <Col N="1185" /> and so far for a national railway concern. I hope that this amalgamated company will treat everybody fairly. All the Manchester Chamber of Commerce asks is that they shall not be put in a disadvantageous position and that the amalgamated company will see that through rates are put in operation for them.  That comes up in Clause 30, and in various other clauses of the Bill.  If the Minister would indicate his acceptance of the principle of this amendment as a whole, it would simplify matters.  He might accept the principle that in the operation of the amalgamated company as a whole, they will see that there is no bar, and that the amalgamated company shall not be in a position to put into operation through rates from centre to centre on one route if they do not put in similar rates for other routes: in other words, to see that there will be absolute fair play all round, and that the routes shall be natural and satisfactory as far as possible to all parties concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with the foreigner as Deputy Hewat is in his amendment.  I am concerned alone with my own people here in Ireland, and if through rates are to be operative from Ireland to England for the benefit of Englishmen, I think these through rates should operate in the same manner from all parts of Ireland in the opposite direction.  Up to the present Irish railway companies are differentiating.  They allow through rates to one company and not to another, and I hope the Minister will see his way to make these through rates work for the benefit of Ireland just as Deputy Hewat asks that they should work for the benefit of the Manchester Ship Canal shareholders.</P>

      <P>I doubt whether we have the power to do what is intended in this case, but I realise if we can have an alternative route to Manchester and beyond Manchester, because Manchester is really only the port, it would be of great advantage to Irish produce.  What is sought by this amendment to be done is to ensure <Col N="1186" /> that the traffic beyond Manchester for the interior of England will be carried by the Ship Canal and taken then to be carried to the interior of England on through rates the same as the rates that would apply via Holyhead. I do not think we have power to do that, but perhaps when the authority is striking the through rate, if we put this amendment into the Bill, it would give the opportunity of using this alternative route on the same terms as those operating for other companies.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Hewat, who moved this amendment, will explain it a little more in order to show how it would work.  I think if he attuned himself more to the feelings of the House he would not introduce his amendment by saying he was asked to propose it by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce.  If he was able to tell us that the Dublin Chamber of Commerce approves I think that would be more appropriate to the discussion.  Is the suggestion that cattle from Mullingar through Holyhead to Lincoln should be taken at the same rate as that fixed for cattle from Mullingar via Dublin to Manchester by Canal to Lincoln.  Is it suggested that you can impose upon the Irish company, the shipping company and the railway company in England the necessity for allocating rates which will be satisfactory, and that the railway companies carrying through from Holyhead to Lincoln will be paid the same share of the freight as it would if it carried through Manchester to Lincoln? Is the long sea journey to be taken into account in fixing the rate? I think Deputy Hewat will require to explain how the suggested amendment could be made operative.  If he can say that, and if we can impose upon the Irish company the duty of insisting upon the English companies making agreements to suit Irish conditions, and if he can show that that is possible, then we may consider it favourably, but otherwise I think it is out of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I appear to have misled Deputy Johnson in the matter of my credentials.  What I meant to say was that the Manchester Chamber of <Col N="1187" /> Commerce had passed this resolution in favour of the course suggested in the amendment, and not that they sent it on to me because they did not.  Further, I understand that the Manchester Chamber of Commerce Resolution came to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and that the latter approved of it.  I hope Deputy Johnson will not think that it damnifies a fair consideration of the question he asks as regards cattle going from Mullingar to Lincoln.  All that is asked in this resolution is that the through rates put into operation should be through rates that will give the Manchester Canal through rates also.  In other words, that Irish produce going by the Manchester Canal and re-booked shall have the same through rate by that route as by others. That leaves open a certain element of competition so far as traffic is concerned which I think is on the basis of fair play.  All the amendment asks is that the amalgamated company shall put into operation through rates that will not be prejudicial to one port more than another.  It appears to be a modest request and in favour of people sending goods from Ireland to Great Britain. So far as Deputy McBride's remarks are concerned, I do not think he can ignore this volume of traffic passing between Great Britain and Ireland except on the lines that we are to build a sort of Chinese wall round Ireland.  So far as conditions at present are concerned, there is a large volume of traffic passing, and fair provision for that traffic is all that is asked for.</P>

      <P>It has been properly stated, at least in the form in which this amendment came.  The Manchester Shipping Company state that the Bill should prevent the Irish railways being parties to a through rate arrangement, which would give preference to any one British port over any other.  If you follow that out, what does it mean?  Take any place on the British seaboard which calls itself a port.  Until we get through rate arrangements with them all we cannot make any through rate arrangement. The amendment can be construed that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be far-fetched but we are going to have a tribunal which is going to come to all sorts of far-fetched decisions according to some Deputies here.  Why should we go out of our way to protect British ports?  If British ports want protection, let them get an amending Bill to their own Act of 1921.  Let them get a clause similar to our Section 29.  Then there will be a question of an arrangement between two sets of parties, each having the same type of protection in its country.  If there was a clause corresponding to clause 29 introduced with regard to the British ports, then there would be a definite matter for agreement.  If there is not, we have Section 49 in this Bill, which allows the tribunal in its wisdom to determine any question with regard to <Col N="1189" /> the institution, variation, or cancellation of through rates.  I ask is it considered reasonable that this Dáil should proceed to pass an amendment such as that before us, which ought to be passed on a survey of the whole through rates question, and discriminate as between the short sea route and the long sea passage, and decide what was undue disadvantage and what was not.  Is it better to have a technical question like that decided here in a short period, by this Dáil, or have the whole question under Section 49 left to a tribunal? I do not think it is for this House at all to interfere in an endeavour to protect British ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think that up to this we have not provided that all Irish ports shall be treated on an equal plane by this tribunal, and we should not go out of our way now to provide that all English ports get that treatment.  For that reason, and also for the reason the Minister has stated, I personally believe that this would be a futile proposal.  I think that the railway tribunal is there to determine as between the various English ports, and I do not see that it would serve any useful purpose for us here to tie the hands of the tribunal in that regard.  Certainly there is a great deal in what the Minister has said, that it would mean that before any through rate arrangement could be come to, all possible English ports and English routes would have to be taken into consideration.  This Bill proposes to set up an Irish amalgamated company, and as far as that company is concerned, I strongly urge that it should be made to deal equally with all Irish ports.  But when it comes to dealing outside Ireland, then I say that it should be a matter to be left to the discretion and to the judgment of the tribunal, when they have viewed all the circumstances surrounding the situation.  I do not see that English ports can have any grievance in the matter, or English railways either, because they can all come forward.  In fact, they can compete with one another if they choose to get the tribunal to secure through rates to their ports, or on their systems.  My complaint about the whole Bill is that that will not obtain in Ireland.  I suggest <Col N="1190" /> that this amendment would not assist &mdash;it would rather hinder&mdash;the proper negotiations and fruitful, possibly useful, decisions of the tribunal with railway groups and the ports on the other side to bring about what I, at any rate, hope to see in the future, all round through rates from this country to the various ports in Great Britain.  Therefore, I do not see really the force of this amendment from the Irish point of view.  I do not suppose Deputy Hewat will put it to a division.  If he does, happily, or unhappily for the Minister he will find me with him.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the last speaker has not exactly followed the amendment.  He argues that all ports should be available for the purpose of through traffic.  He was anxious to see that.  Might I read for him the first clause of this amendment:</P>
      <P>Traffic destined for or to pass through any one port in Great Britain at an undue disadvantage as compared with traffic destined for or to pass through any other port in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>So the object this amendment has in view is to achieve exactly what Deputy Redmond is in favour of, so that one port shall not have an undue advantage over another port.</P>

It would put off until perhaps Tibbs' Eve the attainment of that end.  It would not be possible if this amendment was passed, for the tribunal to come to a through rate arrangement with any one port before it had done so with all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Redmond's additional information, but I cannot say that it made the situation any more clear.  He prefaced his remarks by stating that this proposal would tie the hands of the tribunal. If I understand the amendment it appears to me to do the opposite. At the present moment I think the <Col N="1191" /> objection we all have to through rates is that those who are settling through rates say, &ldquo;Your traffic must go through certain ports.&rdquo;  Those who are in favour of traffic, and those who are interested generally in trade, I think, have the right to say if we want to send our traffic via Manchester we should get the opportunity of sending it that way, if we think it is the best or most convenient route.  That is all the amendment aims at.  Things as they stand at present leave it in the hands of a body called the Conference. I do not know exactly what body arranges these through rates. Some of the authorities here present could possibly tell us, but I understand it is a body called the Conference.</P>
      <P>It should not be the right of any conference to settle what particular way traffic should go, and to say that it should go no other way.  It appears to me that that is the principle we are very largely supporting, and that that is the principle this amendment strikes at.  As Deputy Hewat has pointed out, the Manchester Ship Canal people, when they opened this canal a number of years ago, opened it for the purpose of facilitating trade between Manchester and Ireland, on the one hand, and between Ireland and Manchester, on the other hand.  Are we in trade to be debarred from the advantages that accrue from the making of that canal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the position we are in.  This Conference says: &ldquo;We will only give through rates via Holyhead, Liverpool and Rosslare.&rdquo; Are we to be tied to that decision? Are we to be tied to this Conference, who will say what way they will give through rates, and that we cannot go any other way?  That is the position this amendment strikes at.  That is the position at the moment.  If you are anxious to get through rates via Manchester Ship Canal you cannot get them.  This Conference says: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Is that in the interest of trade?  Is there a Deputy who will stand up and support that principle?  It is not the right of any port that traffic should go by that port for all time.  One port <Col N="1192" /> may have certain advantages for traffic to-day; another may have advantages to-morrow.  We want to be in a position to send our traffic via whatever port is most convenient for that traffic. I hold that that is a principle we ought to endeavour to establish in this Bill.  This amendment makes for that and for no other principle.  I hope, therefore, the Dáil will support it.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this motion.  I would like to embody the idea in the Bill but I do not see the sense of trying to legislate for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company.  We may embody this amendment in the Bill, and the only effect of it may be that you will get no through rates at all via Holyhead or via Dublin.  If the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Companies say, &ldquo;We are not prepared to enter into an arrangement with you in regard to Manchester,&rdquo; then the amalgamated company may be in the position that they cannot make any through rates via Holyhead or Liverpool, because the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company is the body that is determining the course of traffic through these ports.  If the Deputy moving this motion can persuade the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to insist that the British House of Commons and House of Lords&mdash;the British Oireachtas&mdash; pass legislation to cover this point, then it will be very satisfactory.  Possibly, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce took a leaf out of the book of the Minister for Agriculture, or, perhaps more pertinently, the President himself, he could say, &ldquo;We will pass a Bill identical with yours,&rdquo; as they propose to do in regard to Land Bonds.  If he can persuade the Minister for Industry and Commerce to approach the British Ministers with a view to a guarantee that this idea will be embodied in British legislation, then I think we might be justified in supporting this amendment. I cannot see the sense of passing this amendment, which means, in effect, that you are legislating for the British railways.  The British railways can tell the Irish railways, &ldquo;We are not prepared to enter into any through rate agreement with you under those circumstances.&rdquo;</P>

The amalgamated company will have the power of negotiation in connection with through rates and it will be a very valuable factor.  What we want them to do is to exercise that power in inducing through rates.  Let me say that, in mentioning the fact of Manchester being in favour of this amendment, I did so as explaining where the amendment came from.  So many amendments are down in my name, that it might be taken that this was from the Port and Docks Board, whereas it is not.  It came from Manchester. I maintain the principle embodied in the amendment is a valuable one, not with a view to helping Manchester, but with a view to securing an alternative route for traffic going from this country to the other side.</P>

I am only alluding to the Conference to point out that whatever it has been up to this, it will have a different position under the Bill.  I think I can put, in a very brief way, to Deputy Good my objection to this amendment.  The idea of through rates is one that we are very favourably disposed towards.  If Deputy Good will point out to me how I can make a British railway company agree to a through rate via a particular port, I will take the matter into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way it can be done is, when negotiations arise in connection with matters, it very often occurs in trade when you are considering one subject, and a difficulty arises, you <Col N="1194" /> point out that there arc difficulties in other directions that these railway companies could facilitate, and it is very often a matter of business that you give way on one point, and they give way on another point.  If you have a clause such as this it assists to that end.  Business is very largely negotiation, and certainly nothing in this would debar&mdash; in fact it would help towards&mdash;such negotiation, because it would be in the mind of the Tribunal, following the discussion that has taken place here, that through rates if possible should be made available via Manchester.  Then, of course, while the Minister points out that a Conference is now set aside by this Bill, it may be set aside in name, but in substance it is practically the same body.  There will be representatives of the Amalgamated Company on the one hand, instead of representatives of the individual railway companies, and representatives of the shipping and other companies on the other side. While there may be a difference in name, it will be practically the same body in substance, and when they come before that body to arrange through rates then, if we had such a clause as this, it would be naturally a subject for negotiation to consider whether through rates could not be also made via Manchester, and then give us the alternative routes.  If this clause cannot be acted on, it is certainly no load on the Bill; if it can be acted on it will be an advantage, and why not incorporate it?</P>

      <P>I do not purport to speak with very definite accuracy on that point.  It will be, I suppose, the representative of the amalgamated undertaking, and not the Tribunal; the Tribunal will be the body over and above.  It now comes to a question of voluntary agreement on the basis of negotiation.  I say it will be best to leave the amalgamated company in an unfettered position and leave its hands free.  This ties it up to a certain extent, and it is because this would be a hindrance in the negotiations that I object to it.  If it is any consolation to the Dáil to know, there are already through rates to Manchester.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for the Dáil to pretend to determine rates to an English port.  It is worse still to determine rates to some place in England via an English port; it is still more absurd.  It is quite reasonable on a voluntary basis.  My only statement on that is to leave the undertaking unfettered in every way.  This would be a restriction, a very definite restriction, and the Tribunal will certainly be able to instruct the amalgamated undertaking to press for through rates via all, any, and every port in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Deputy McBride, apparently, has got the point in this amendment from the admission the Minister has made.  The Minister says the amalgamated company should be left free, and the freedom to act will always be in accordance with existing agreements.  The freedom to give, for instance, through rates, if they are allowed to be quite free on that point, <Col N="1196" /> will, in view of the existing agreements between the G.S. and W. Railway and the G.W. Railway, give them the right to give these through rates via the route which they are compelled to send traffic by in accordance with the agreement.</P>
      <P>That is the danger that I have been trying to call the Minister's attention to.  That is the reason why I occupied so much time in trying to get the Minister to agree that where the amalgamated company did quote rates it should be through all ports inside the Free State area.  The Minister has now made a dangerous admission.  The effect of leaving them free is that they will exercise their freedom within the limits of the existing agreement, and give undue preference to one port as against every other port within the Free State area.  That is the meaning of what he said.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us further whether the hands of the tribunal would be tied, and whether the hands of the Government, as representing this country, would be tied, by passing this amendment?  I cannot see anything in the amendment that even limits its effect to the port of Manchester.  It does not mention the port of Manchester at any one point. It simply wants for all ports what is given to any one port.  What Deputy Davin pointed out is correct in a way. That is, that at the conference if the railway companies are willing to fix a through rate, they should not be thereby given the right to say that through rates shall only be by a certain port.</P>
      <P>All we claim under this amendment is that all ports should be placed on the same basis; that if we want to send traffic via the Manchester Ship Canal, and from Manchester to other places in the centre of Great Britain, that we shall be at liberty to do so, and that that particular port will not be handicapped.  The Minister pointed out that there are through rates already to Manchester.  I would like to know if there are through rates by the Manchester Ship Canal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal of confusion in regard <Col N="1197" /> to the whole matter raised by this amendment.  The existing agreements which we have heard so much about, statutory and otherwise, both of which I abhor, have to do with traffic from Irish ports, and I need scarcely repeat&mdash;in fact, I cannot upon this amendment if I so desired&mdash;my arguments against the continuance of the practice embodied in those agreements in regard to Irish ports.  This amendment does not deal with Irish ports, but purports to deal with British ports.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true what Deputy Davin has said that when the amalgamated company or the conference, as it has now been called, comes to decide on the question of through rates, they will be bound, unfortunately, to my mind&mdash;if this Section 29 goes through as it is&mdash;by the agreements statutory and otherwise, in regard to Irish ports, a limitation which I detest and which I very much regret.  But I do not think that these agreements will bind them in regard to ports at the other side of the water.  I think there is a great deal to be said, therefore, for allowing them to deal with both British ports and British railways without the restriction, and I say that, paradoxical as it may seem, the proposal in this amendment is a restriction&mdash;that they could not deal with any British ports before they dealt with them all.  That, to my mind, is the substance of the situation. I did get a shock for a moment when I heard Deputy Davin's interpretation in regard to the conference having to act upon this agreement.  I agree with him that if the Bill passes as it now stands with regard to Irish ports, they will have to act upon it.  But this amendment, referring as it does to British ports and purporting to do what probably we are all powerless to do, I consider, without any offence in the slightest degree, is absolutely futile.</P>

      <P>Perhaps some expert members of the Committee would explain what happens if this amendment passes.  I gather that we <Col N="1198" /> are anxious to get through rates.  These through rates are fixed as a result of the agreement between the railway companies in this country, and the railway companies in England.  Now, we want to insist that no through rates can be granted which favours one particular English port.  That is, that if there is a through rate fixed for one port, there should be a through rate fixed for every other English port.  Is not that the effect of this resolution?</P>

Supposing the English railway company does want to favour one port and then if it says: &ldquo;We shall not under any terms make through rates with you,&rdquo; where are you?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing now with this amendment, 20 (a), and what strikes me about all this debate is that it might very well have taken place in the British House of Commons with regard to the protection of certain ports in Great Britain, as against the dangerous Irish railway companies who might seek to get preference via one British port as against others.  Deputy Good has stated that all that it requires is leave and liberty to have through rates to any place.  Now, supposing this amendment is not passed, is that leave and liberty that he seeks taken away? It is taken away, of course, by the Rosslare agreement.  If we are going to get back to the Rosslare agreement, we are bound to have another field day on it.  But we must keep the Rosslare agreement out of this.  I hold that the failure to pass this amendment does not in any way deprive Deputy Good of the principle that he seeks.  It does not deprive the amalgamated company of the liberty that Deputy Good would like to give it.  Deputy Davin wants to introduce a new idea.  He desires that we <Col N="1199" /> should refuse to have through rates to any particular ports&mdash;or shall I put it this way, that through rates should be via all ports.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>All reasonable routes is a matter for definition afterwards. Now, supposing that to a certain town in England there are certain equal anl natural routes from a particular place in Ireland, and we decide (we are precluded by Deputy Davin's idea from deciding in any other way) we must have through rates which must operate to all those routes.  There is another party to the agreement of through rates.  Supposing any of these individual people who have to be a party to this question of through rates will not agree to these through rates, and suppose that one, two, three and four ports were concerned, then the whole thing would have to lapse if we could not get through rates to all the ports, for it must be for all ports.  It must be to all ports of a particular type where they can be classed together as reasonable routes in a particular way. But if other parties to the agreement do not coincide with that view, then this idea of through rates drops.  I think in the other argument used with regard to this amendment that I sense a hint of the Rosslare agreement in it, and that when the amalgamated company comes to deal with through rates they will find themselves bound by a certain agreement as far as traffic to or from a particular port is concerned. That has very little to do with the through rates question, and in so far as it has anything to do with it, it depends upon the consideration which I stated at full length here yesterday. There is nothing to be gained by passing it, and no liberty is taken away by the failure to pass it, and therefore I take it that the amalgamated company undertaking is given greater liberty to deal with the varying circumstances.</P>

      <P>This is a very important amendment. Deputy McBride now will have an opportunity of airing his grievance, and he will also have an opportunity of having Leinster men helping the men on the western seaboard.  The object of this amendment is to try to develop the natural harbours which exist on the western seaboard and which, by reason of the paucity of the service given them by the steamship company are not getting traffic.  My idea is so to reduce the through rates via any of those western ports by 10 per cent, that it will draw necessarily from the interior of this country traffic via such ports as Westport, Ballina, Galway, or Limerick, to its destination as against bringing it via Dublin to Scotland, or England, as the case may be; that is, to give a rate cheaper than the through rate of 10 per cent. so as to bring traffic to these undeveloped ports and thereby develop that part of the country.

It is not specific, of course: it does not suggest Western ports; it allows differentials for traffic passing by sea to or from certain ports in Saorstát Eireann.  It is proposed to amend Section 58 so as to retain differentials, but, of course, the differentials will, in the last resort, be subject to revision by the tribunal in cases where there would really be undue disadvantage.  As to what undue disadvantage may mean in the future, I am not in a position to say; that is a question definitely for the tribunal.  It is not for the Dáil; I do not think the Dáil will care to have on its shoulders the burden of deciding what is to be considered as undue disadvantage.</P>

But in this case Deputy Hewat evidently wants to make it a direction so that an advocate appearing before the tribunal will say: &ldquo;Here, this is a direction of the Statute that you shall, if required, use all proper endeavours to provide a reasonable system of through bookings.&rdquo;  In the one case you are leaving it to the tribunal to consider whether they should do it or not; in the other case you are telling the tribunal that if the railway company fails to do it, they shall do it.

      <P>If there is any object at all in the idea of Governmental interference with a publicly owned concern like a railway company, surely it should be to secure powers to see that the things asked for in the amendment are done in the interests of the trading <Col N="1203" /> and travelling public.  No element of doubt should be allowed to enter into a matter of this kind so far as the tribunal is concerned.  I gathered from the Minister's statement yesterday that he more or less looked upon the tribunal as a body of people that would be called upon to interpret either acts or agreements, or to give decisions upon any complaints or appeals made in the light of their interpretation of the existing agreements or statutory enactments. I think we should not be giving the tribunal the right to determine whether these things are necessary or not.  They are necessary, and that being so, if the Government has any function at all in a matter of this kind, or any right to interfere in the management or administration of a railway company or to say what should be done in the interests of the trading and travelling public, I think that they cannot reasonably say that these things should be left to the discretion of the tribunal.  A definite direction should be given in some shape or form, perhaps in the form of the amendment, so that there would be no doubt whatsoever in the minds of the tribunal that these things should be done.  I quite admit that you cannot compel people who are parties to a through rates arrangement to fix through rates, but as to the desirability of entering into negotiations or seeing that an effort is made to bring about the necessary negotiations that would make possible the fixing of through rates and facilities by all reasonable routes, I think there should certainly be a definite direction to the tribunal that that is part of their powers, and that it is their duty to make these arrangements, if that can possibly be done, to bring about a voluntary agreement, which is the only way, I submit, that through rates can be arranged.</P>

That is not going to be the case.  A Tribunal will be set up, and the idea in the setting up of the Tribunal is to provide for the more efficient and economical working of the railway system.  Surely, a Railway Tribunal set up with that end in view is going to be quite as diligent about endeavouring to get through rates as Deputy Davin himself could be?  I do not see any great difference between the clause which states that the Tribunal shall have power to determine the institution, variation or cancellation of through rates and the amendment which reads: &ldquo;The amalgamated company shall, if required by any person interested, use all proper endeavours to provide a reasonable system of through booking.&rdquo;  Is there any great difference, or any such difference, between the Section as it stands and the amendment, that makes it worth while to change the Section?</P>

It is a very natural assumption. If the railway company evades the Statute there will be an appeal to the Tribunal.  For the moment, I am assuming, with Deputy Hewat, that the <Col N="1205" /> railway company will obey the law.  If this amendment is adopted then it will be an obligation on the company, without having to go before the Tribunal, to do so, and without having to put anybody to expense, to provide a reasonable through rate by reasonable routes.</P>

      <P>True.  If, then, some person thinks that the company has not made these proper endeavours they will go to the Tribunal, but they will not be obliged in the first instance to go to that trouble if the company obeys the law&mdash;a great assumption, I admit.  Let us assume that the Tribunal is a judicial body and that it is to weigh up matters as between the company and the public&mdash;it may say that there is no occasion for instituting, varying, or cancelling through rates.  It may say that it is not for them to take the initiative, because the Statute which set them up did not state in its body, in the various clauses, that it was expected that there would be this general system of through rates established.  From the absence of a provision of this kind, it may be argued before the Tribunal, and the Tribunal may agree with the argument, that the Oireachtas did not intend that this system of through rates should be established.  Whatever value there may be in the amendment, it certainly will be an indication to the Tribunal that it was the desire and intention of the Oireachtas that a system of through rates should be established.  I want to put in this demurrer: it must not be taken that the be-all and end-all of railway service to and from Ireland should be the establishment of through rates.  I would very much prefer to see through rates established from points within Ireland, but I will say that the purpose of the amendment is not effected by Section 49.  It is undoubtedly desirable that there should be through rates for some commodities, at any rate, and it is better that we should put into the Bill a specific intimation that that is the desire and intention&mdash;that a system of through rates should be established.</P>

We might have that considered, but I do not know where exactly it would most appropriately fit into the Bill&mdash;that is if there is any great insistence on it. I think this phrase &ldquo;power to determine.&rdquo; taken in conjunction with other clauses which allow persons interested in any particular question to appear before the tribunal, provide an intimation to the tribunal that through rates are necessary, even if we assume, as is apparently the assumption of the Dáil, that those who are going to be on the tribunal are those people who know nothing at all about railway matters and the importance of through rates.</P>

      <P>With all respect, this is a matter as much for the company, because representatives at these conferences will be representatives of the company and not representatives of the tribunal; that is, they will be actually people connected with the company just as they are at the moment.  Then with regard to the other point, I do not know whether the Minister quite sees the whole purpose of this amendment. It not alone encourages the principle of through rates, but it also states that these through rates shall be by all reasonable routes.  The Minister said that we were arguing the point that it would be to the interest of the tribunal to encourage traffic.  That is true, but it is also the duty of the tribunal <Col N="1207" /> to maintain the standard income. That being so, it will be their desire, as far as possible, to get out of that through rate on the part of the amalgamated company, as much as they possibly can.</P>
      <P>That being so, if they get more out of the through rate by sending the traffic by one port rather than another, it would be to their interest, being responsible for maintaining the standard income, to send the traffic by that particular route.  This amendment, as I pointed out, would, to some extent, direct the railway companies that they must take into consideration the reasonable routes and other routes which might give them the largest portion of the through rates.  I hope I make the point clear to the Minister that the Tribunal may be anxious, and doubtless some of them may be filled with the desire, to do all they possibly can in the public interest, but having this other responsibility cast upon them of maintaining the standard income they must have regard to that particular fact, and I am quite satisfied that the advisers from the amalgamated company will keep pressing that fact before them, that certain rates can realise more than the others can.  For these reasons I strongly support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Internationalist Deputies who sit upon the Independent Benches are simply concerned with the one-way traffic to England, and they want through rates to operate in that direction alone.  There is another direction in which through rates can operate, and that is into the country. I hope the Minister will assume that the through rates will operate in both directions, and not as the great internationalists wish, in one direction only.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is out of order.  It does not arise on this <Col N="1208" /> amendment.  I bow to the superior intelligence of Deputy Johnson, because he convinces me that there is more in my amendment than I thought.  That arises largely from the Minister's view of this as disclosed in the discussion.  It seems to me that he has the idea that this Bill is going to form a Tribunal, and that that Tribunal is going to manage the railways.  Surely that is a misconceived idea?  If that is the idea, why make two bites of a cherry, and why not nationalise at once?  The position, as I understand it, is that the amalgamated company will continue to carry on the functions of management and the Tribunal will be a Court of Appeal.  As Deputy Johnson very properly pointed out, this is an instruction to the Tribunal.  I would like to emphasise that view, which I think has been clouded.  The Minister's attitude of mind is as if the Tribunal was going to arrange through rates, and I think they are really getting more into the Minister's mind than into the Bill. The Bill does not provide that the Tribunal shall do any such thing.  The Tribunal is a Court of Appeal.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Hewat's last remarks are most valuable, and that this amendment, if proposed in any other form, as the Minister has stated it will, should certainly adopt the term &ldquo;amalgamated company&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tribunal.&rdquo;  This amendment does not altogether refer to through rates and fares.  It also refers to all reasonable routes.  Now, I do not know whether the term &ldquo;reasonable routes&rdquo; has been defined in the Bill.  I do not think that they have, but in a subsequent amendment to be proposed by Deputy Hewat it is sought to define the expression to mean &ldquo;the shortest route and any route not less expeditious than the shortest route and any route which in distance does not exceed the shortest route by more than 50 per cent.&rdquo;  What I am particularly anxious to ascertain from the Minister is that when he does propose at some future stage of the Bill in some other form to introduce a provision amounting, as I understand, to a direction to the company, I hope it shall be &ldquo;proper endeavours shall be <Col N="1209" /> made for a reasonable system of booking with through rates, fares, and facilities,&rdquo; and that he shall also include &ldquo;by all reasonable routes.&rdquo;  If he is willing to do that, I certainly would conclude that it would be a very valuable direction to the company.  As I read this amendment of Deputy Hewat it would mean that the company in future would have to consider when fixing these routes, fares, and facilities whether routes as defined by Deputy Hewat were also the most reasonable ones, and that the same facilities, fares, and rates should be provided over all routes which would be considered reasonable on that line.</P>

I am being made to look on that Act with more fervour and enthusiasm than I did forty-eight hours ago.  We are definitely taking our stand on it, and, so far as that Act is concerned, we propose to adopt it.  It will, of course, have some influence with regard to that particular Board, in and so far as Section 19 of the Schedule applies to it, with all the guarding clauses that are in that section.  Outside that there is no possible danger of the amalgamated undertaking or the Tribunal having their view-point distorted in any way with regard to these through rates.  In so far as I accept this amendment this section is a hint to the amalgamated company to provide a reasonable system of through booking, and the Railway Tribunal by Section 49 finally determines it.  The question of a reasonable route will lie unhampered by any consideration except the 1899 Act.</P>

The amendment as he has accepted it, I do not think meets that case.

Reasonable routes have been defined very well in a later amendment by the same Deputy.  Perhaps it might be no harm to ask the Minister does he mean the same as the proposer of the amendment does by the words &ldquo;reasonable routes&rdquo;?  Reasonable routes, according to Deputy Hewat in his amendment <Col N="1213" /> 44, mean &ldquo;the shortest route and any route not less expeditious than the shortest route and any route which in distance does not exceed the shortest route by more than 50 per cent.&rdquo; Does the Minister mean what these words mean, or something to that effect?

      <P>&ldquo;Traffic not consigned by any particular route shall be forwarded by the natural route as hereinafter defined.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise with a feeling of elation that all my labour has not been in vain.  I would like to solicit the kind consideration by the Minister of my next effort. I think the amendment is a reasonable one.  It means that a direction should be given to the companies so that they cannot play &ldquo;hanky-panky&rdquo; with traffic that is not consigned.  That is, when traffic is handed over to them to send to its destination that they cannot send it round the world for sport.  If the old competitive systems were in operation I would not press the amendment, because with ordinary competition between the companies the trader would have the benefit of that competition. <Col N="1214" /> It has been stated that the effect of this Bill is to eliminate competition. I have heard people say that there is no competition at present.  I disagree with that.  I have also heard people say that there will be no competition. I disagree with that, too, because under unification competition will naturally arise in other directions. In the event of competition being done away with, this amendment proposes to take from the companies the power to send traffic round the world for sport, and confine them to sending it by the natural route, which is the most convenient route for the traffic to go.</P>

I take the hypothetical condition of things against which the Deputy seeks to provide, that is to say, a company for the purpose of bigger receipts taking some consignment of merchandise and sending it all round Ireland.  In the old days an appeal would lie to the Railway and Canal Commission against such a practice.  Under the present Bill, according to Section 22, an appeal will lie to the tribunal against such a practice.  There is no necessity. <Col N="1215" /> therefore, for the amendment except on the basis that I started with, that the Railway Tribunal is going to be a body which will allow all these malpractices to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill should tell the company what the company is to do.  If the company disobeys the law then the Tribunal comes into operation. To say that the company should be free to do the right thing if they wish, or the wrong thing if they prefer, and that the trading community, if they have an objection, may go to the Tribunal, is simply putting a charge on the trading community and putting money into the pockets of the lawyers as well as wasting the time of the Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the process, and I can imagine that, inasmuch as this Bill has been copied from the British Act, which was framed largely in the interest of lawyers, by lawyers, for lawyers, that we are adopting the same plan and rather suggesting that the company would take a certain course. They may take it if they wish.  In the long run the Tribunal is there to protect the public.  I suggest it is better we should tell the company in the Bill what they are obliged to do.  If it fails to do it to the satisfaction of the trading public, then the trading public can go to the Tribunal, to prove that the company is not carrying out the law, as required by this Bill.  The conception of the Bill that the Minister is defending is that you must trust the railway company to do this.  If it does not do it then you can appeal to the Tribunal.  It is assuming that the Tribunal must always be in operation. The President suggested that there will be a time when the Tribunal will have much less to do than in the first three years.  The conception of the Bill, as defended by the Minister, is such as would ensure that the Tribunal will be active and always have plenty to do, because the company will only act according to what we tell it it should do.  When the public move, even the Tribunal will compel them to do what we could compel them, or very nearly compel them, to do by embodying our wishes in the Bill.  I think we are <Col N="1216" /> simply going to ask the public to waste money which we would save them by embodying this intention in the Bill itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I can support this amendment, particularly on the plea of Deputy Johnson, that it is going to save money.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of cases that came under my notice, of unconsigned traffic from Tuam to Manchester being sent down to the South of Ireland, across from Rosslare to Fishguard, and up the other side to Manchester.  That has actually happened.  I think nobody will doubt, in view of Deputy Johnson's statement, that that is wasteful. That is the sort of thing that this amendment wants to stop in the interests of everyone.  It ought to be stopped.  The acceptance of such an amendment as this will ensure that it will be stopped, and that it will be the duty of those administering the Act to see that it is stopped.  It is only right that the Dáil should express opinions on this matter, especially when certain cases are brought before it, where traffic is carried by a circuitous route at a loss to the trading community. It is our duty in drafting legislation to insert sections that will prevent such methods in the future.  I would strongly urge the Minister in the interests of the tribunal, the company, and particularly of the trading community, to accept this amendment. If such a thing happens in future, and if attention is called to it, there will be no necessity for taking any formal action, as those administering the amalgamated company will see, that by one of the sections in the Bill traffic is to follow the natural and shortest route between two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a greater desire on the part of the Minister and of the Government to give protection, in things that cannot be justified, to the amalgamated company, rather than in a Bill of this kind, to the trading and the travelling public. It has been stated here before that it is quite possible for traffic from, say, Dublin to Birmingham, handed in to the Great Southern and Western Railway Company at Kingsbridge, to <Col N="1217" /> be forwarded via Rosslare and Fishguard, a route which nobody can claim to be the natural one.  If the Minister would accept the amendment that has been moved by Deputy Hewat it would prevent the possibility of traffic being sent in that direction, as I submit, to the disadvantage of the trading and travelling public.  If an equally expeditious service was provided via Rosslare and Fishguard, that would get the traffic to Birmingham as quickly as if it went via Dublin, there would be very little reason for complaint.  In the light of the existing agreement, traffic sent that way via Rosslare and Fishguard, will not get the same service and cannot get to its destination as quickly as if it were sent via the direct and natural route, the port of Dublin. It should not be left to some person, or to some organisation, like the Farmers' Union, or the Chamber of Commerce, with money to spend, to employ lawyers to go before the tribunal to prove that the forwarding of the traffic in that way was unnecessary and unjustifiable. Something in the nature of a direction should be available, so that, if the company did not carry out the instructions they got in the way of legislation framed by the Dáil, then as a last resort the Chamber of Commerce or any other body or individual could go to the Railway Tribunal and appeal to it to compel the company to send the traffic handed to them under such circumstances by the natural and most expeditious route.  In the interests of the development of the trade of the country the Government should give this very necessary direction to the amalgamated company.</P>

      <P>If that happened, and if it is supposed to have been protected by the 1905 Act, then it was a wrong assumption.  It was not protected, and it is not protected.  Such a malpractice is not protected, and is not sanctioned by anything we have done in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement that was read is subsidiary to the other Act, and the other Act, with its overriding clauses, governs anything that is in the 1905 Act.  It is impossible to deal with every case, and to put down in black and white safeguards against every possible malpractice that a railway company might be guilty of. We are told here one thing, but there might be other things.  I do not know if Deputy Davin could get all his bogeys translated to paper and put in a schedule to the Bill, so that the Railway Tribunal would take cognisance of all these horrible imaginings of the Deputy's.</P>

      <P>I do not think any railway company could outrun Deputy Davin's imagination of what it might do.  It is impossible positively. by legislation, to compel a railway company if it is going to be dishonest, to remain honest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring <Col N="1219" /> to the Deputy, in fact I was speaking away altogether from the Deputy's imaginings which, apparently, do not run to dishonesty on the part of a railway company.  But supposing a railway company wishes to be dishonest, I do not believe it is possible by setting down all the acts of dishonesty that it might perpetrate to guard against them or to do anything more than you can do by saying that you will punish certain things and set up a tribunal for the punishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a Bill, the whole purpose, aim and object of which is the more efficient and more economical working of the railways in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The railway company may be just as good a judge of that as the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but their good judgment comes finally for further judgment before the tribunal.  If Deputies are going to go on with this kind of imagining we will get nowhere. If we define here &ldquo;expeditious route,&rdquo; and we have a tribunal of such a type as appears possible to Deputy Johnson, the Railway Tribunal may distort this definition of &ldquo;expeditious and natural route.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A tribunal such as the Deputy imagines can do anything; no paper safeguards will guard against it. We have done all that is reasonable and possible in the proposals that we are putting before the Dáil.  As I have stated, I do not think it is possible to set out in detail all the things that a railway company might do.  We are giving a general direction as regards certain things, and we are leaving it to the Railway Tribunal to decide what is the best thing to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to a promise on the last amendment. That only deals with through bookings.  This amendment does not <Col N="1220" /> deal with through bookings, but with traffic not consigned by any particular route.  It has no reference whatever to through bookings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I only referred to the question of through bookings because the matter was brought in by Deputy Davin on this question of the 1905 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to ensure that what you have promised on the previous amendment will also apply to goods which are not booked through.  This will apply to all traffic whether they are through bookings or not, and it will ensure that the companies shall consign all such traffic by the natural route.  But if you shut out a direction of that kind the companies will still be free to send non-through bookings by any route they please.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the use of the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; there is not a proper statement of fact.  They may do it, but while they are free to do it they will be liable to be hauled up for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course, until they are caught.  The Minister for Home Affairs might well expatiate on the principle that people are free to do things, but that they are not free because they might be caught and brought before the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us pass this amendment, and what happens?  Somebody has to go counter to it and be caught in going counter to it before he can be brought up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But you impose an obligation on the company if you pass it.  If you do not pass it there is no obligation.  Therefore, it is only the tribunal that is making a decision so far as the company is concerned.  In the meantime, we desire to impose an obligation on the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that the obligation is imposed on the company by the very purpose of the Bill.  The whole tenor of the Bill is against such malpractices as this seeks to guard against specifically.  I am only answering the point, and it seems to be a great <Col N="1221" /> point against the Bill, that somebody has to be caught doing something wrong and be brought before the tribunal before rectification follows. What else must happen if this amendment is passed?  You are giving a specific direction to the company, and if that is not carried out there has to be an appeal to the Railway Tribunal before there is any chance of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be quite clear in that case, but the Minister is assuming that the railway companies will not obey the law until they are brought before the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You are assuming it!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am assuming that if you impose an obligation on the company by the Act which sets up the company, the company's servants, until the directors tell them to do otherwise, will proceed to carry out the Act.  The Minister's view is: &ldquo;No, let the company go on following its own bent, because it has no obligation such as is provided for by this amendment.&rdquo; Then the public come along and say: &ldquo;We have a complaint to make; the company is doing what we thought it should not do, we will bring you before the tribunal, we will bring our lawyers, and they will bring their lawyers, and we will have the matter threshed out fully.&rdquo;  Witnesses will be brought here from all parts of England and Scotland, and immense expenditure will be piled up against the trading public.  We could avoid all that by putting a section in the Bill; we could avoid that, assuming that all the companies are fairly law-abiding; we could avoid that provided that the companies will obey the law, and we have a right to assume that this new company will, as the child of the Minister, obey the law.</P>

      <P>The objection to the amendment is that it will add very much to the expense of the unfortunate people who are obliged to fight actions <Col N="1222" /> under such a definition as this here of &ldquo;natural route.&rdquo;  I cannot see myself any great array of counsel brought in on the question of the economical working of the railways in the Saorstát, but I can very well see the great array of counsel that might be brought forward to fight and argue about this question of natural route, and on the definition to be given to that term.  We are giving a definite direction to the railway companies that they must have economical working, and complaints can be taken on that.  This amendment seeks to give a direction with regard to traffic not consigned by a particular route.  It says that the traffic shall be forwarded by the natural route hereinafter defined.</P>

    <P>Motion by Deputy Baxter:</P>
    <P>That this Dáil, cognisant of a return to peaceful and more stable conditions in the country, and aware <Col N="1223" /> of the approach of the Tailteann Games, with their historic associations of peace and good will amongst Irishmen of all sections, is of opinion that the time has arrived when all untried or sentenced political prisoners should be released, and &ldquo;men who are on the run&rdquo; for political offences be free to return to their homes.

      <P>Before Deputy Gorey speaks, on a point of explanation I just wish to say that in a statement of mine last night I said it was being alleged that Deputy Professor MacNeill, at some time or another, made the promise that the prisoners would be released about Easter-time.  I have gone into that matter to-day, and I find that I have been misinformed.  I desire to withdraw all reference to the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go back on anything I said last night.  I will begin as far as I can remember where I left off.  Some of these people, the responsible men, if you can describe them as responsible men, have given their word that the Constitutional line would be adopted.  I suggest to the Executive Council and to the Government that the time has come to put that word to the test, and to see if these people's word means anything. I suggest that it be put to the test now. The President referred to some people responsible or irresponsible.  He referred to the mentality of Miss MacSweeney and people of that description. It is time that the people inside got a chance of showing publicly whether they approve of the tactics of Miss MacSweeney and the other ladies. During the last week or ten days I have been sent a document from the usual seat of propaganda here in Dublin in connection with the treatment of prisoners.  I knew that this motion was coming on, and in order to keep my mind unprejudiced, I refused to read the document.  I wish to say that the issuing of these documents has done more harm than good to these people. It has not influenced any member of the Party I belong to; it certainly has not influenced me.  In order that I <Col N="1224" /> would not be influenced.  I did not read this particular document, but I am convinced that scarcely a word of truth is to be found in any one of those documents. The President, last night, asked was it likely that these people would act constitutionally.  If the people inside do not act constitutionally, surely there are enough outside not to act constitutionally, and the addition of the few inside to the many that are outside, could scarcely alter the position in one way or the other.  As a matter of fact, I think it would help the situation if those people who have some responsibility were allowed out to accept full responsibility for whatever is happening.  The present position is that these people say &ldquo;we are in gaol, we cannot have our voices heard, and things are happening for which we take no responsibility.&rdquo;  I suggest they ought to be let out and accept responsibility for whatever is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not again refer to the Tailteann Games.  I think I referred to them last night fairly fully.  I think that keeping these few hundred in gaol is merely furnishing a fruitful ground for these people to grow propaganda on.  If they had not that ground to sow their seed on I think they would be bankrupt for propaganda, and those people who at the present moment wear the crown of martyrs would become what they are, very ordinary citizens.  I do not think that the detention of these few is any cure for interruptions at meetings or for the things the President referred to last night; I believe the reverse.  I think, and my Party here think, that the nominal leaders ought to be let out and be made accept responsibility for interruptions or misconduct or anything else.  I should say that the sooner they are made to accept that responsibility, the better.  The sooner they are let out, to my mind, the sooner the general public will realise that they are very ordinary individuals, composed of very ordinary clay.  I suggest that these people are scarcely worth retaining in prison.  As I said, the retention of them only means a halo for them.  Some of the Deputies have alleged that it is because of the Tailteann Games that we bring this forward.  It is not because of their hostility to the Games that we bring it forward, it is because their <Col N="1225" /> hostility has failed to be effective.  That is the reason it is being brought forward, because those handling the Tailteann Games, I believe, are big enough and strong enough to be generous in the position that exists at the moment. It is not because of any threat or because of any hostility on the part of those people to the Games that we brought it forward.  It is because of the associations; it is because of the traditions in connection with those Games.  I think the Executive Council would be well advised to let out those people, because the longer they are there the longer they are looked upon as something apart from the people.  The sooner they are let out the sooner people will realise that they have feet of very ordinary clay.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has seemed to me throughout this debate that there was rather too little advertence to what has actually been done in this matter of release.  The President gave figures. Over a period of ten or eleven months 10,000 or 11,000 prisoners have been released.  There remains a balance of roughly, 600, of which only 314 are unsentenced. Twenty-six of those are recommended for release.  Orders have been signed for their release.  And of the remaining 288, a list of 103 has been arrived at, whose release will be recommended, and will become effective inside the next couple of weeks, which leaves 185 unsentenced prisoners in custody.  We are prepared to take it that it is the view of the average citizen represented here in the mind of the average Deputy, that releases should continue as rapidly as seems to the Government consistent with public safety.  We are prepared to accept that view and to act on that view.  We are prepared to take it that the people in their generosity and in their magnanimity would wish us even to take certain risks in the matter of releases&mdash;but not undue risks, to take as much risk as we consider consistent with a decent discharge of our stewardship to the people and a decent regard for their interests.  That, I believe, is the view and is the wish of the ordinary people up and down through the country, and I believe that that view is represented in the average mentality of their representatives. <Col N="1226" /> It is unreasonable to expect more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Baxter's motion, in the last analysis, means a demand for amnesty. Sentenced men, unsentenced men, men at present evading justice through the country are all to walk free.  Now, in the setting that is not a reasonable request, in view of the fact that there has been a dogged refusal to surrender weapons and ammunition to the legitimate authority of the country.  Implicit in that refusal&mdash;and the Deputy must face it&mdash;you have a threat, a menace, an indication that in some undefined and unknown set of circumstances, they would deem it right or proper to have recourse again to those weapons and to that ammunition.  In other words, implicit in their refusal to surrender weapons, you have a refusal to recognise that the people of the country should decide, and decide freely, their political issues. You have that not merely implicit. You have it explicit from the statements of certain people who would, no doubt, be insulted if they were not called leaders. You have a member of the late Dublin Corporation announcing in rather truculent fashion, that he is not yet demobilised, though for many a year long back he has not been seen to carry anything more formidable than his umbrella. But you have these statements, these menaces from people who lay claim to be responsible and lay claim to some little degree of leadership. And you have the mentality of the Cobh crime to reckon with&mdash;a crime deliberately planned and deliberately carried out with one object, and one object only, to embroil this State and this Government with the British Government and their forces.  That is not a kind of situation which justifies an amnesty demand.  As I say, we are prepared to take it that the ordinary, generous people of the country are desirous that the utmost leniency should be exercised with regard to those men who kept them under the harrow for two years, who defied them, flouted them, made war upon them and upon their very economic existence.  We recognise that the people are anxious that the utmost leniency should be observed, and should be practised with regard to these men.  We are willing to take <Col N="1227" /> that instruction and to act upon it. But you have not an amnesty setting, and we would not be entitled to take undue risks.  We must simply go ahead with the sources of information at our disposal, and if we wished to harrow the feelings of Deputies or to raise their hairs, we could trot out here in the Dáil certain very serious information.</P>
    <P>But simply moving on from day to day and from week to week, and watching the situation, we must reduce that figure.  We mean to reduce that figure, and reduce it with all the rapidity which we think the public safety and the public interest permit.  If the Deputy presses his motion to a division, what does he effect?  He puts Deputies here in the position of voting or appearing to vote, at any rate, against releases, when every Deputy desires that releases should continue with even increasing rapidity, certainly with the rapidity which in our judgment the public interest would permit.  He will simply have a line up one side asking an utterly unreasonable thing, and that is a complete amnesty where you have not the condition to justify a complete amnesty, and others appearing to be opposed to a release, when, in reality, everyone would be glad that we could get back as quickly as possible to normal relations in the country, when political parties would accept a proper perspective of the community as a whole, and set themselves to the task of convincing the minds rather than coercing the bodies of their fellow-citizens. Now, there is talk of peace and goodwill. Very sound, no doubt, and all very excellent no doubt.  These people, had they wished it, could at any time within the last two years, could to-day or to-morrow, bring about such a situation. They have not taken that road. You have the sinister menace of the arms there, and you have the truculent tyrannical statements from time to time from important pivotal people in their political and military organisation.</P>
    <P>They cannot complain if a certain amount of caution has to be exercised by the Government with regard to them and with regard to the more important of the prisoners.  Then Deputy <Col N="1228" /> Baxter's resolution fails from its vagueness, from the vagueness of its terms.  He refers to political prisoners and says he does not want criminals out.  Now, that is a failure to recognise the big fundamental fact that the big crime was the attack upon the people and the attack upon the people's fundamental rights to decide their political issues, and if we were to fight over words, everyone who participated in that attack was a criminal. You cannot distinguish then between the man who actually put the torch to the house, and the man who put the torch to the whole situation, which made crimes like that routine.  Yet, Deputy Baxter says he does not want criminals released.  In other words, he would distinguish between the man who put the torch to the house, the man who robbed the banks, the man who wrecked the railways, and the men who performed individual acts of that kind, and the people who stood over and accepted full responsibility for all the crimes.  He says then that people on the run should be allowed to return to their homes.  Here again you have the same vagueness.</P>
    <P>Does he mean that we are to repeal the ordinary common law code running in the country by which decency of life is preserved or sought to be preserved? If people who are evading justice or who think they are evading justice, have any curiosity to find out how they stand with the law, there is no great difficulty about that; let them communicate or let their friends communicate with the police or with the military authorities, and they will find no hesitation about informing them whether or not a specific charge is proposed to be brought against them, and whether they must regard themselves as being within the reach of prosecution.  But there are, and there have been for many months back, people playing that foolish &ldquo;Ned of the Hill&rdquo; kind of role, through the country, who have no need to live away from their homes, and who can return to their homes, but who prefer to live that kind of vagabond life, living parasitically on their neighbours, a bed here and a meal there.  It would be better if they were at home at tillage, very much better.  The country's wealth, after all, is the sum total of its production, <Col N="1229" /> and the more of the youth of the country that you have living a nonproductive existence, the less is the total wealth.  We would be glad if these men would take steps to ascertain how they stand with the law, and that they would return to their homes and try to live decent lives that will in time blot out the records of the last two years.  The Deputy must take his choice.  He can press this motion to a division, and he can have a line up, which will be an unreal line up, and which I have endeavoured to explain, or he can take the assurance which is given that we are prepared to accept it that the average mind of the people is that they would be glad to see releases proceeding as rapidly as we consider consistent with their interests and consistent with their safety, and that we can even take it that they would wish some risk to be taken in the matter of releases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to indulge in any captious criticism on this matter, but I will endeavour to treat it in the same line as it has been dealt with by most of the other Deputies.  It has been dealt with from the purely human standpoint, and the motives and intentions of the Government have also been subjected to very close analysis.  But it strikes me that the Government have proceeded along three definite lines of argument.  First of all, they have pleaded that charges of a criminal nature can be adduced against certain men who are at present interned.</P>
      <P>Now, as far back as November,  I endeavoured to bring the Government to meet this problem in a fair fashion, and from that period on 12,000 prisoners have been released.  What I would like to know is, what is the gauge of the mesh through which those 12,000 have passed, and what is the gauge of the mesh through which it is proposed to pass the 600 who are now inside?  If it were possible for the Government, in the space of nine or ten months, to release 12,000, passing them at the rate of 1,000 a month through this mesh, why was it not possible to pass the 600 who are in through the mesh since last Christmas?  What is to prevent them?</P>

Taking into consideration the number of releases which have been signed, and the numbers of prisoners in respect of whom forms are being made out for release, the total number will be reduced to 182&mdash;that is, irrespective of what releases may take place in the meantime.

      <P>If I may intervene for a moment, I would like to put the Deputy right.  There were 300 cases tried by courtmartial, and, under the Indemnity Act, they are either convicts or prisoners in the ordinary sense.  The Indemnity Act provides that they should make application for a review of their sentences.  As I have already explained, there were less than 100 applications, and in respect of these a certain number of releases have been ordered.  With regard to the rest I explained that it was not within the competence of the authority, set up under statute here, to review the cases. But I propose that two judges should review the cases and make recommendations, and I said that we would give generous consideration to those recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Why the 300 were chosen for courtsmartial, I am not in a position to say.  I should say, however, that perhaps one reason was that proofs, identification, and so on, were much easier than in other cases. Another reason was that the measure or amount of guilt must have been larger in those cases than in other cases.  The Deputy can quite understand it would be rather difficult to have, in the space of nine months, 12,000 courtmartialled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

      <P>It is merely an accident that those 300 were picked out, and because they were tried by courtsmartial, they cannot be released until they make application to have the sentence reviewed.  It is merely an accident that those few hundred men were picked out.  I am sorry that I am not in the position to understand the peculiar meaning that attaches to the Government's explanation.  The total number that the Government could find any positive evidence against was 300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I explained yesterday that these were court martialled. There were other cases&mdash;I think the number was somewhere about 80 or 100&mdash;who were handed over for civil prosecution in the ordinary courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That at most adds 80 to the number.  I do not see that we <Col N="1232" /> are getting much further, and anyhow a military court on the face of it, is not an impartial tribunal; from its very nature it can never be accepted as an impartial tribunal, and even at most they could only convict 300 out of 12,000.  These 300 were chosen, and it is simply explained that they were chosen and kept while the others were let out.  What is in the power of these 600 that are kept in to achieve, if they were set free, that the 12,000 who were liberated cannot achieve?  Are there so many great leaders inside, that if they are let out they will rally all the discordant elements and rekindle a blaze from one end of the country to the other.  Are there no rallying centres now?  If not, can the President tell us why the men &ldquo;on the run&rdquo; are not allowed home.  If there are no rallying centres, why does he not let them home?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  That should be more the province of the Minister for Justice than mine.  We were told that it was to prevent the policy of destruction that these people were interned and kept out of the way of the average citizen.  We were told that there was an attempt to destroy the Treaty and to destroy the Constitution by creating economic paralysis in the nation.  For the last six months there has been, on the Government's own declaration, 12,000 releases, and what economic paralysis has been brought about by these people; what attempt has been made to destroy the Treaty and what attempt has been made to upset the Constitution? What terrible things have been brought about by these 12,000 who have been released, and how much would the 600 that are inside add to it that would make the country incapable of being called a civilised country and a place fit to live in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the speeches from the Government benches might have been very well made on the Second Reading <Col N="1233" /> of the Public Safety Bill when introduced some two years ago, but to-day the situation has changed considerably. We have declarations from the responsible leaders that they are going to adopt a constitutional policy, and the President was not perfectly clear in his mind, he told us, as to what they meant by a constitutional policy. He thought that there were varying degrees and varying definitions of the word &ldquo;constitutionalism&rdquo; within the ranks of the Republican Party.  There are.  There are various definitions, I daresay, of constitutionalism within the ranks of the President's own party. But would the President consider this, that it is impossible for that party to come to a definite policy, or a definite understanding, as to what constitutionalism means, while a good many of the responsible leaders are under lock and key and are kept in by the present Government and cannot consult with their colleagues or with the people whom they represent?  Deputy MacNeill asked us to get rid of sentimentalism in this matter, and he is perfectly right.  We do not want sentimentalism in this matter; this is not a sentimental question; it is purely a humane question, and when we are told about the mentality of some of these people, the mental and moral calibre of some of those in jail, has the Government thought that their continual detention is not likely to be beneficial to their mental or moral character?  Some members of the Government have been in several jails themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>But never as comfortable as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue that. I will not argue as to the comfort of being in jail, but one thing that makes life in jail uncomfortable, is the absolute helplessness of the person in jail, running up against things that he cannot conquer or destroy.  These people are up against confinement; they are up against the position that they do not know how long they may be kept in jail, and it is the indefiniteness of that that makes them so callous and so cruel.  We are told that they are indulging in unconstitutional <Col N="1234" /> action by obstructing meetings, and some such things.  We were told that the old Sinn Fein Party, when it was less of a power, in 1912, 1913 and 1914, had not indulged in such tactics.  It is surprising to hear that.  Anybody who knows Dublin knows that it was the boast of some of the old Sinn Fein Party that certain political parties could not hold meetings in Dublin, that they would not be listened to; that there was such a following for a certain political party of a revolutionary kind, that another political party could not find an opportunity to express its opinions in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dissent. That is not the case.  I am a Dublin citizen, and I have known Dublin for many years, and I must say that the old Sinn Fein Party did not interfere with or interrupt meetings.  I have been at meetings, and I was at the meeting when the late Mr. Redmond unveiled the Parnell statue, and there was not a sound of interruption against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember being at meetings that were interrupted, and very much interrupted, but that can pass.  Another aspect of the case I would like to refer to is, that we should endeavour to put our own house in order before we can ask others to liberate men who are imprisoned or interned elsewhere.  We know there are prisoners outside the Free State locked up who, according to all notions of decency and good government, ought to be free, and if we intend or expect to have any force in our arguments in making an appeal or demand for their release, then we ought to release those whom we have incarcerated ourselves.</P>

      <P>I can hardly go back to where the President began last night.  I think there were times when the President felt he had something to do to reply to Deputy Johnson, and I will leave him to reply to Deputy Johnson when he gets the opportunity. I am more concerned with the statement of the Minister for Justice.  I would like to try to get to the back of the mind of the Minister, when he says that the Government, or the administration, <Col N="1235" /> is prepared to recognise that the people are anxious, or at least agreeable, that the Executive Council would take certain risks.  That from the Minister is a welcome statement, and I think I must admit that this whole debate has been carried through in a spirit that ought to be welcome to every one who is interested in the release of the prisoners.  Our intention in putting down this motion was that we would be able to accomplish the release of all the political prisoners, that we would at least know what the Government's intention was, and that it would be fairly plainly stated.  The Minister for Justice makes an allusion to the indefiniteness of my motion, but particularly with reference to the tried and sentenced prisoners.  I have not the time, and I have no intention of trying to determine here what type of man of those sentenced could be termed an ordinary criminal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know that; I do not know the individuals, and I am not in a position to attempt to do that.  The President's statement, however, is very welcome, that they had decided within the last forty-eight hours to appoint two temporary justices to review these cases, and the sentences imposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <P>I think it is to be regretted that the decision was not taken six months ago, for if that decision had been taken then, and the sentences reviewed, many prisoners would be free, and there would be no occasion for this motion.  I would be glad to <Col N="1236" /> know if these Justices will review the sentences of those prisoners, irrespective of whether the prisoners appeal or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I explained that.  We are as anxious as you are to get rid of them, as they are costing £1 per week each.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I hope these Justices will succeed in getting rid of every one of them.  I recognise that according to law there is a difficulty as regards the sentenced prisoners, but as regards the other prisoners who you state will be down to 185, when the numbers you have under consideration will be released, we feel that everyone of these 185 ought to be released.  It was our intention in bringing forward the motion that not one, two, three or half a dozen would be released, but that every one of the 185 who you say would be left after the 130 would be released, would be also liberated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give that undertaking.  I gave an undertaking that it would not interrupt the consideration of the other 185, who are down to 182, for all practical purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I understand that the position of the 185 will be reviewed, just as the position of the 130 you are about to release, has been reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if it is in connection with those prisoners that those statements have been made, I would be perfectly satisfied to leave matters as they stand at present, and to await the action of the Ministry in dealing with the remainder of those prisoners.  I must say this.  I do not want to make the position difficult for a single Deputy in this House. Our party had one end in view, and that was to secure the release of the <Col N="1237" /> political prisoners.  I want to say on behalf of a good many Deputies on the Government Benches that I have, at times, had their assistance in obtaining the release of prisoners in different districts, and I must say I found them to give great assistance where it was possible.  I do not want to put any Deputy in the position of appearing to be against the releases when I know they are not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not to trouble Deputy Nolan, but I must say that I recognise there is an opportunity for the different political parties to come to the top by different constitutional means, as the Minister for Justice says, by showing and proving that one body has better statesmen than the others. We want to see all political parties having all their political leaders at liberty to accomplish that end.  I think our party will be perfectly agreeable to await the action of the Executive Council in dealing with the remainder of the prisoners, feeling that the Minister for Justice is speaking the mind of the Executive Council when he says he understands that the people believe they should take certain risks.</P>
