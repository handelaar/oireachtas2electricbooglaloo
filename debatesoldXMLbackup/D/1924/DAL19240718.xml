      <P>asked the President whether the Government have any schemes in hands for the providing of work for the unemployed of the City of Dublin, and, if so, whether he will announce them to the Dáil before the Summer Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £75,000 has been allocated to the Commissioners of the Dublin County Borough for road work, and of this amount a scheme for the expenditure of £22,000 is in operation at Fairview, giving employment to sixty men.  Schemes for the expenditure of the remainder of the grant which have been received are under consideration, and it is hoped that work will be started at an early date.  It is estimated that the total road grant for Dublin will give employment to 300 men for a period of six months.</P>
      <P>A grant for £35,000 is now available for relief schemes in Dublin, and details of these schemes will be prepared as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of the Borough have been allocated the sum of £462,848 for the building of nine hundred and twenty-six houses in the city, and eight contractors are concerned.  Work is in progress in three centres, and, as the Deputy is aware, housing is being delayed at Marino owing to an unfortunate labour dispute.  This matter is having close attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> The awards for compensation claims up to the 8th instant in respect of destruction in O'Connell Street total over £413,000, of which £300,000 is in respect of rebuilding.  Clearing operations at the sites are in progress in four cases; building has begun in two further cases, and plans have been lodged with the municipal authorities in four other cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the desirability of having the sites of the Four Courts and the Custom House cleared?  That would give a considerable amount of employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why compensation has been refused to Fireman Michael Dowling, Lake View Terrace, Athlone, in respect of injuries received on February 7th, 1923, whilst discharging his duties between Castlebar and Islandady Stations owing to his engine being overturned, due to the removal of the rails and the raiding of the train by Irregulars; whether, as Dowling was severely scalded and has not yet totally recovered from his injuries, he will have this case re-investigated with a view to granting compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President (for Minister for Finance) The PRESIDENT (for Minister for Finance)">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (for Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of the person named by the Deputy was refused by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee on the grounds that the applicant was not in any way permanently incapacitated, and incurred no medical or out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the injuries.  The applicant suffered no hardship, and the circumstances do not merit a reconsideration of the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, is the Minister aware that the applicant was three months idle, and that he is not yet in a position to perform his duties?  This was not an accident, but was due to the rails being removed during the Irregular activities.  If the man can prove that the rails were removed will the Minister reconsider the case with a view to giving compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the applicant was injured on February 5, 1923, and resumed work in July, 1923. During his absence from his duties his wages of 12s. a day were paid in full by the railway company, and, in addition, he received £20 from the company for expenses and £3 10s. from his Society.  He did not pay anything to the doctor, and he is unmarried.</P>

      <NameTxt>PADRAIG MAG UALGHAIRG</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what is the aggregate amount of property compensation awards paid or reported for payment in respect of County Tirconaill; whether all such claims put forward have been considered and reported on; whether in accordance with a special minute, were all such claims contested at the hearing by the County Council through their solicitor; (4) are all reported amounts subject to revision; are they being so revised before payment is ordered; and (5) if he is aware that allegations abound that the reported amounts in many cases are excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question refers to compensation for property destroyed after the 11th July, 1921, and on or before 12th May, 1923, the period covered by the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts.  The amount paid in Co. Tirconaill in respect <Col N="1634" /> of such property is £11,244 11s. 11d.  I regret that I have not statistics as to the total amount of awards made to date by the County Court Judge. All the claims put forward have not yet, so far as I am aware, been adjudicated on.</P>
      <P>With regard to the third part of the question, I have no information about the special minute referred to.  All applications are opposed on behalf of the Finance Department by the State Solicitor for Co. Tirconaill.  I assume that in the fourth part of his question the Deputy refers to cases in which reports are made by the County Court Judge under Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923. Such reports are examined in the Finance Department, and the amount recommended by the judge will be carefully considered in each individual case before payment is authorised.  I have been informed of the allegations to which the Deputy refers in the fifth part of his question, and I shall be glad to be put in possession of definite information relating to individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the County Court Judge is reported to have stated that, where the damage fell on the ratepayers of the county, he scrutinised the claims very carefully, but where it was paid by the State he allowed himself to be more generous?  Will special supervision be given to these reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the State Solicitor in each case forwards a report to the Finance Department or the Chief State Solicitor, as to the advisability of having appeals in cases where the amounts awarded appear to be extravagant.  I should say that we are informed by the State Solicitor in reference to Tirconaill the amount recommended exceeds very much what might be regarded as reasonable.  The figure I have got is 100 per cent., which I do not believe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Constable Michael Foley retired on a pension of £123 10s. 0d. on 20th August, 1920, after twenty-five and a half years' service. The Committee of Inquiry considered his application, but did not report it to the Government as one in which it considered that the resignation was caused by national sympathies. The Minister for Finance regrets that he cannot issue a certificate under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, which would render him eligible for an increase of pension.</P>

Owing to the activity of her sons her home was lost, her position as a caretaker at 30s. a week was lost, and her two sons lost their employment.  The family were sent back to Dublin because of their activities. One son was killed in an ambush in Dublin, and the handsome reward given was £100, to be paid in quarterly instalments.</P>

There are several cases which require to be dealt with before the adjournment for the Recess.  These include the building <Col N="1651" /> formerly known as Richmond Barracks, and now known as Kehoe Barracks; the lands and buildings in Pearse Street, in the parish of St. Mark, formerly, I think, known as the recruiting office functioning under the British military; lands and building known as 14 Upper Sackville Street, commonly called O'Connell Street; lands and buildings known as No. 15, part of the land at Tallaght, and lands and buildings situated in the town of Clonmel which have been built by the Corporation with the sanction of the Local Government Department within the last sixteen months or two years. In all these cases the passing of the Bill will afford some employment, and it is necessary to pass it so that that employment can be given.  In Clonmel there is some difficulty in getting in rents for the houses built under the Government grant and that difficulty will be obviated in this particular case.  The Bill is urgent.  It is intended to deal with Kehoe Barracks in a way that will be of considerable importance to the housing accommodation in the city and in addition will give some employment. I formally move.</P>

    <P>The Joint Committee have made a very careful study of the subject matter <Col N="1652" /> of this Report and have set out its different aspects as fully as they could. As the Report has been presented to the Dáil so late in the Session, I feel that it would not be fair to ask for a speedy decision upon the grave matters referred to in it.  I would prefer that the decision should be left over till October so that during the Recess members might have an opportunity of weighing the Report fully and of arriving at a considered judgment.  I beg to move, therefore, that the consideration of the Report be postponed till October.</P>

In order to guarantee the <i>bona fides</i> of the applicant, a preliminary fee will have to be paid before the application is even considered, and that fee is £1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be in the discretion of the Minister.  The idea of this is to prevent impossible applications, to prevent the consideration of applications over a very long period, which afterwards may be found on examination to be unwarranted.  The fee is extremely small, and is merely to ensure that applications which have no chance of success will not be put up.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 3: &ldquo;In Section 9, immediately before sub-section (2) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>`There shall be paid to the Minister by the person applying for registration of any premises in the register <Col N="1655" /> of exporters the deposit specified in the Schedule to this Act on account of the first annual fee payable in respect of such premises, and the payment of such deposit shall be a condition precedent to the registration of the premises.' &rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As the section stands, the fee is paid in advance.  It was considered that in the interests of the exporters themselves it would be better to have the fee paid at the end of the year, and not in advance.  As I suggested for the Butter Bill, simply a deposit of £5 should be paid for the first year, and that each year after that the fee would fall due on the 31st December. For any particular year after the first year, the fee will fall due on the 31st December of that year, and will be payable on or before the 17th March of the next year.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) The first annual fee to be paid by the registered proprietor of any premises registered in the register of exporters shall be calculated on the quantity of eggs, ascertained in the prescribed manner, exported from such premises during the period between the completion of the registration and the end of the calendar year in which the premises were registered, and shall become due on the 31st day of December of that year, and the difference between such fee and the deposit paid on account thereof as aforesaid shall be paid by or returned to (as the case may require) the registered proprietor before the 17th day of March, in the year next following.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Every subsequent annual fee shall become due on the 31st day of December in the year in respect of <Col N="1656" /> which such fee is payable, and shall be paid before the 17th day of March, in the year next following, and shall be calculated on the quantity of eggs, ascertained in the prescribed manner, exported from the registered premises in the year in respect of which the fee is payable.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The first proposed new sub-section deals with the first annual fee only, and the second sub-section deals with the subsequent annual fees.

      <P>The trade itself agreed to the amount.  There is no change in the amount of the fee which is still a penny per £2 worth exported.  There is, however, a change in the procedure. As the Bill stood formerly, the payment was made in advance.  I met the trade organisations and they complained, not very bitterly, but they made some complaint about payments in advance.  They pointed out that it would mean making payments for extra book-keeping and that sort of thing.  When I did meet them I made no promise whatever that we could change the procedure and we left it at that.  Afterwards, in considering the Butter Bill, we contemplated having the same procedure, that is, payment in advance, and we decided to adopt this procedure in the interests of the exporters themselves.  Then, in reconsidering the Egg Bill, even though it was in the Seanad we decided that we might as well give them the benefit of the change.</P>

It was as a result of representations made to me that I inserted an amendment of this character in the Butter Bill.  Afterwards I made certain inquiries in regard to the effect of putting such an amendment in the Butter Bill, and after considering the matter I inserted an amendment in it to that effect.  It was two members of the egg trade who put this consideration before me and made me start my inquiries on that line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

When the Butter Bill was going through I took exception to that section and I stated my reasons at the time, reasons which I do not propose to repeat now.  The objections which I then stated to the section in the Butter Bill apply to this amendment, but as the Dáil accepted the principle in the Butter Bill I do not propose to contest it to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not take exception to the amendment from the trade point of view at all.  It is to the principle that I object, and not to the effect that this amendment will have on the trade.  I really think it is detrimental in an Act of Parliament to introduce a section which really affects morality more than anything else and I do not think it should be necessary for this Dáil to put in a section of that sort.</P>

      <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT 8.</P>
      <P>In Section 14, at the end of sub-section (1), page 9, a new paragraph (g) inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is meant to guard against the possibility of foreign eggs being brought on to premises and sold as Irish eggs.  It enables us to make regulations that if foreign eggs are sold that they shall not be sold as Irish eggs.  There is a danger that when Irish eggs get a reputation on the foreign market, and they are rapidly building up a reputation at the moment, that there would be a great temptation on the part of people to buy Russian eggs in great quantities and to sell them as Irish eggs on the English market.  To guard against that temptation, and to safeguard the Irish egg trade from the possibility of such a contingency arising, we are taking power here to make a regulation compelling any exporter who sells foreign eggs to sell them as foreign eggs and to mark them as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Supposing an exporter runs short of Irish eggs and imports a couple of thousand Russian eggs, re-packs them, sends them to his customers in England, they will naturally take it for granted that they are Irish.  He has not broken any law that I know of.  That is likely to occur.  It is just like foreign creamery butter which is sent from here and is sold as butter from Ireland.  We do not want to leave any loophole as the reputation of Irish eggs will be gradually growing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy is partly right and partly wrong.  This empowers us to make any regulations we like.  We have a description.  Remember, it is extremely difficult to know one egg from another.  Remember that it is probable that as Irish eggs get a reputation, the temptation to mix Irish and foreign eggs will be so great that we may actually be compelled to do what the Deputy suggests we are taking power to do and say that no foreign eggs shall be brought on the premises.  If we reach that stage an exporter dealing in foreign eggs would simply have to make structural alterations to his premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know the reasons for the change, because it makes a distinct change.  It is on account of this and the next amendment that I ask the Minister to consider it.  The section says that the Minister may make regulations in regard to all or any of the following matters, such as testing, <Col N="1660" /> grading and packing.  The Bill, as it went from the Dáil, reads: &ldquo;tested, graded, or packed.&rdquo;  Now the Seanad asks us to agree to an amendment saying that all eggs tested, graded and packed shall be in accordance with regulations. These regulations, however, may be only made in respect of grading or testing or packing Consequently, if only one of these regulations is made in respect to only one of these matters, according to this phraseology, if the amendments were agreed to, it would have no effect because unless they are tested, graded or packed, there is no offence.  In the original form, if either or all of them were regulated, the sub-section would apply.  The Minister has proceeded on the assumption that it is certain that regulations shall apply to all these things.  I suggest that it is not imperative according to the Bill, and that there is no improvement, but rather the contrary, in the amendment of the Seanad.  It is an important verbal alteration which may possibly bring about considerable difference in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that I do not see any great reason for it, but I do not see that it makes any difference.  Surely, &ldquo;all eggs tested, graded and packed&rdquo; means the same thing as &ldquo;all eggs tested and graded and packed.&rdquo;  If there is any force in the Deputy's contention it was always there because the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; was understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 says that certain conditions shall be complied with before any export of eggs is allowed; that is to say, the eggs shall be tested, graded and packed in accordance with any regulations that may be made under Section 14.  It is possible to make regulations affecting the matter of testing, and to make no regulations in respect of the matter of packing. You may make regulations under (A), (B), and (C), or either of them, but if you put in the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in sub-section (3) it implies that you must have regulations in respect of all those things.  There is no value in altering it to &ldquo;and.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move the following Motion which, I think, will meet the difficulties encountered on the last stage:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Chun críche aon Achta a rithfar sa tSiosón so, go bhfuil sé oiriúnach a údarú go n-íocfar amach as airgead a sholáthróidh an tOireachtas, aon phinsin is iníoctha fén Acht san le baill áirithe agus le seana-bhaill áirithe de sna Fórsaí Náisiúnta agus d'Fhórsaí Cosanta Shaorstáit Eireann no d'aon Fhórsaí Armtha a bhí á gcoinneáil suas ag an Rialtas Sealadach no ag Rialtas Shaorstáit Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> That for the purpose of any Act of the present Session it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any pensions payable under such Act to certain members and former members of the National Forces and the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann or of any Armed Forces maintained by the Provisional Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well on this Motion to have made clear, before we pass it, a point that was raised by Deputy McGrath as to what was the definition of &ldquo;maintained&rdquo; in the Motion and, therefore, in the Bill.  If the intention is made clear we will be able to introduce an amendment to the Bill which would remove the possibility of doubt.  &ldquo;Armed forces maintained&rdquo; might be interpreted to mean maintained in a state of armament, or maintained as living and active persons, or might be interpreted to mean as an embodied force kept in being by discipline and organisation from a central authority.  I suggest it is not clear in the Bill or in the motion and we ought to have a clear understanding as to what the intentions of the Ministry are in the matter so that we will not be charged with having enlarged the scope of the Bill when we propose to make any amendments.  I wanted to bring to the notice of the Dáil before passing this restricting motion the case of men, who, while not being members of an armed force or of the National Forces, were precluded from being members of such forces by virtue of the fact that they were employed by the Ministry and were ordered not to volunteer for service.  Had they not been so precluded from volunteering they would come under the provisions of this Bill and, therefore, under this motion, but having been so precluded they are now placed at a disadvantage.  The intention of the Minister, as has been stated twice at least, was to make provision for men whose livelihood had been interrupted, whose careers had been changed, and possibly damaged irretrievably by virtue of their service since 1916 onwards.  In the case I <Col N="1663" /> have in mind I cannot say how far their livelihood or prospects have been interfered with, but they are equally interfered with, if at the time of the setting up of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann those men were in Government service and precluded by Government action from joining the Army, and, therefore, qualifying for the pensions set forth in the Bill to which this is a preliminary motion. Cases have been brought before me of this character and I was hopeful to have been able to introduce into the Bill an amendment covering such instances. I do not suppose they would have been very numerous.  I do not know.  Probably they would not be very extensive inasmuch as the men concerned are at present in Government service and the difference between what they would receive under the Bill and are receiving now as pay would not be very great.  It so happens that they are probably receiving less as pay for work done than they would be receiving as pensions.</P>

      <P>Yes, that is the case.  They consider they should not be hurt as permanents because of the fact that the Minister precluded them from joining the National Forces, and therefore qualifying for those pensions. The cases that were referred to in other amendments will be probably dealt with by those responsible for the other amendments, but it seems to me that this is the only opportunity we shall have of raising the matter and therefore I have raised it in the hope that we shall have an indication of the intentions of the Government and possibly an amendment to the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to admit that I have had great difficulty in being able to find out the exact meaning ensnared in this form of words.  Perhaps the case Deputy Johnson mentioned is intended to have been included to meet the Government amendments that were moved on the previous occasion and ruled by you as being out of order.  I have in mind a different kind of case altogether.  To come back to the Bill, the position, I <Col N="1664" /> take it, is this.  Pensions are intended for those who have served in the National Forces and who also gave service prior to the establishment of the Saorstát. Any person who had not given service prior to the establishment of the Saorstát and who had been serving in the National Forces after the establishment of the Saorstát is to be precluded from the operations of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Now there are persons who served prior to the establishment of the Free State who to-day should not come under the operation of this Bill. There is not any question whatever about that, and the Dáil would be united in that connection because of the action that these men have taken hostile to this State.  But between those two there is a certain body of men to whom I think the Ministry ought to give attention.  There are persons who gave very courageous and self-sacrificing service in pre-Treaty days under conditions of very considerable danger but who afterwards did not join the National Forces for a variety of causes. I have come into contact with some of them.  I give some instances that recur to me at the moment.  I know one case, the case of a man who had been in employment. He was one of the active service units and because of the conditions that prevailed immediately after the Treaty his employer took him back.  If he had not been in employment he would probably have joined up in the National Forces because he has been a strong adherent of the Free State from the very beginning.  He did not join up because he happened to be at that time in employment, and he wished to keep secure in that employment. But because of the economic conditions that have since come about that man to-day is out of work and he is precluded from the operations of the Bill although he has been a strong adherent of the Free State from the moment of its establishment and had done the utmost that lay in his power to bring this State into existence.  I hold that it is not fair to exclude such a man from the operations of the Bill in a case where a very genuine attempt is being made to deal with persons who have given the kind of service that this man has given to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> There are others on whom the President might not look quite so kindly but I think that they too ought to come within the operations of the Bill.  I refer to the case of men who in the days of the Black and Tans gave very courageous and very fine service, and it is not against them that they should have felt disposed to give that service because it was a non-mercenary force that they were joining.  These motives do influence human beings.  When a paid force was established afterwards they felt that it ranked on a somewhat different basis; and in not joining they were not moved by any considerations of disaffection; they were moved by what we will call unworthy social motives, but these motives nevertheless did influence them.  To-day these men are either in employment and not receiving much, or they are out of employment and receiving nothing.  These are men who did give good service towards the establishment of this State, who have never done anything prejudicial to the establishment of this State, men whom nobody would claim to have been in any way disaffected; and yet because they did not happen to join the National Forces for the reasons I have given, they are excluded from any benefit under the Bill.  Some of them, I think, will not altogether be glad to have their cases espoused in this way. Others of them whether they would or not, at another period, have been glad to have their cases espoused, would be glad to have them espoused now because they have joined the ranks of the unemployed.  At the time when these men did great and good service there was no payment made for the work they did, and if there was any financial assistance given it was given merely to meet the conditions involved in moving forward from week to week and it was not given in the form of pay to an ordinary mercenary army.</P>
    <P>I have two cases before me now in reference to men of this class that are being dealt with by charitable institutions about the working of which I happen to know something&mdash;the cases of two men who joined up with the active service units who lost their employment and yet who, when they were <Col N="1666" /> offered enlistment in the National Forces, did not join the National Forces, though in not joining they were not moved by disaffection.  And I urge the President that such men ought to be remembered to-day and ought not to be excluded when we come to the moment of meeting in some measure the services rendered by men of this class.</P>
    <P>If I correctly interpret the words now moved as amending the Financial Resolution, I take it that the particular cases I have mentioned would be excluded from any benefit under the Pensions Bill.  If the Resolution would exclude such persons I urge the President to enlarge it so as to include them.  I agree entirely that persons who have been moved by disaffection or who could be shown to have done acts prejudicial to the establishment of this State as established by the will of the people, should not be included.  But I do say that to give pensions only to those who gave valiant service in days of earlier danger, and who, with that service, gave further service in the National Forces is to limit the arrangement too much.  I urge that the motion be further amended.  I am not prepared to state now exactly what form the amendment should take, but I do urge that some further amendment should be made so as to extend the operation of the Bill and to include the class of persons that I have mentioned here to-day.</P>

      <P>I think not.  The Money Resolution has been amended so as to extend the Forces to which it applies, but I think the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is sufficiently clear in the ordinary way to exclude a person who was not in the Forces, that is to say, a member of the Forces was a person who was in the Forces.  If they were members they are included in the Money Resolution and therefore they are in the Bill.</P>

Nobody could hold, and it would be impossible for me to hold, that the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; could be construed in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the President intends to bring in, and unfortunately, when the Bill becomes law, it will have passed from the President's opinion.  The particular difficulty Deputy McCarthy is in is that for a period of three or six weeks in Dublin there were persons on the streets in arms and not in uniform, and acting under the authority of the Provisional Government.  The questions is, whether these persons were &ldquo;members.&rdquo;  They were certainly acting in the armed forces under the Provisional Government, but whether the word &ldquo;maintained&rdquo; covers them is the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>. There is a rather important point in connection with this, and it is that the term, &ldquo;National Forces,&rdquo; and the term, &ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo; cannot, as far as I understand it, be applied to any force that existed prior to the 3rd August, 1923, because the Defence Forces Act, 1923, is not retrospective in its operation, and, therefore, the forces that existed at the coming into being of the Provisional Government, prior to the 3rd August, are brought in under this Money Resolution, only under the term, <Col N="1669" />&ldquo;any armed forces maintained by the Provisional Government, or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  So much for that point.  The other point is, I feel certain, that any of the men in the mind of Deputy McCarthy, are men who were armed by an authority, acting under the authority of the Provisional Government at the time, and men who acted under orders of officers who were officers of armed forces maintained by the Provisional Government at the time, and that being so, there can be no question but that they were members of armed forces maintained by the Provisional Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the President replies, may I put a point that gave me some difficulty in this amendment, and ask if the interpretation that occurred to me would, in your judgment, be a possible one.  It is this: I take the phrase &ldquo;certain members and former members&rdquo; of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann, &ldquo;or any armed forces maintained by the Provisional Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  I wonder whether the amendment I have put down on a previous occasion, and which you ruled out of order, might not come in, or whether it could possibly be brought in, by considering the Government of Saorstát Eireann as being the Government of Saorstát Eireann in the sense in which the President himself would recognise it, and I would recognise it, that is as being the actual successor to the Government of Saorstát Eireann, as proclaimed in 1919.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to get notice of that point and give it careful consideration.  I have not adverted to it before, but it seems to me that the Bill itself as introduced and as it has passed its Second Reading, was clearly intended by the Dáil to be a Bill for the purpose of giving pensions <Col N="1670" /> to certain persons who had given service after the Treaty, and in addition to that armed service after the Treaty had pre-Truce service.  That is my interpretation of the scope of the Bill. I think the amendment to which Deputy Figgis alludes, and which is not now on the Paper, besides being outside the Money Resolution is outside the scope of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended in the Money Resolution to cover the case mentioned by Deputy Johnson, that is, of persons who accepted office from the Civil Government at the time, or rather, who accepted civil employment to put it correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand these people were already in civil employment under the Government and were precluded from leaving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there were very few cases of that kind, and they had this advantage, that they got employment then.  Had they gone out they might have been maimed or even killed, whereas they have that employment now.  There was, I think, generally speaking, fairly generous treatment given to those persons who were Dáil Eireann employees.  We have postulated that service in the National Army is essential to get the benefits of this, and I have endeavoured to frame a resolution to bring in the <i>bona fide</i> cases that Deputy McCarthy has in mind.  These cases should not be large in number; I am told they are not many in number.  I hope their number will not increase as soon as this particular accommodation is provided for them.  With regard to the case mentioned by Deputy Figgis, I should like to be in a position to give some compensation to the persons who rendered service, and rendered it free of charge on the national funds.  But this measure must be construed in the light of our ability to meet the bill, and it was originally intended to deal exclusively with those officers and men who, by reason of the reduction of the strength of the Army, were landed out in the street without any employment at a time of economic instability, to <Col N="1671" /> say the least of it, and who had not the opportunity of getting employment which many others had who did not join the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our responsibility, as far as this measure is concerned, was originally intended to meet only those who were demobilised or who had resigned from the National Army, and who had given service in it.  The extension which we have made to meet those mentioned by Deputy McCarthy is an unreal extension.  It was not contemplated originally.  It is more than compensation to them.  It is a payment to them for services that they have rendered, and to that extent their case differs from men in the National Army who gave the time, ran the risks, and ran them over the whole period, even though, I admit at once, the services rendered by those whom Deputy McCarthy mentioned were real and most valuable services at that time.  But their case is different from the case of men demobilised in March last, or since March, or after the period of the disturbance had passed, when there was no danger, or very little likelihood of danger. To these men it is merely compensation, and only compensation, and to the other cases it is a payment, and I am sure it will be admitted as such.  The original conception of this Bill was compensation pure and simple, compensation that is their due.  Regarding the cases mentioned by Deputy Figgis, I would like very much to be able to introduce a measure to deal with them, but I do not think we are entitled to do it at present.  We would not be entitled to do it until we knew what are the liabilities we have got to face, and when we are in a position to vote these payments, then it is for us to do so. There are many such cases.  The Minister for Justice brought numbers under my notice, and I know quite well that it is impossible to provide accommodation which would prevent real suffering in a great number of these cases.  I am sure that we have not succeeded in doing it in anything like the whole number, but the real idea of this Bill was to provide compensation for those <Col N="1672" /> who had looked foward, by reason of their former services, to the Army as a profession, who had banked on that and who were disappointed in so banking.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked some question on the last day about this measure. I have some notes on the subject, and I think this will be the proper time to mention them.  It is not possible to give any estimate either of total cost or of Government grants, for the following reason.  There are 178 drainage districts in the Free State, large and small.  Any or all of these may require restoration works.  No trustworthy opinion can be given whether any work, or what amount of work, is required in any district till it has been inspected by the Board of Works engineer. Fourteen districts have been inspected; each inspection takes some days.  Perhaps twenty more may be <Col N="1675" /> inspected this season, and many more next season, if the Minister for Finance approves.  Works can only be carried out in a few cases during this season&mdash; the season usually ends in October&mdash;for want of time; and no trustworthy estimate can be made yet of what can be spent this season.  Most of the money for relief schemes will be for works other than drainage works.  Only a small amount for the latter will be needed.  Few of the possible drainage works will be in areas where unemployment is acute.  It will be understood, of course, that we shall not recommend in any district expenditure to be recovered from the proprietors of land unless we are satisfied that it will be remunerative to them by the improvement of their land.</P>
      <P>The following figures may be of interest:&mdash;The total number of drainage districts in Ireland is 185; of these 7 are in Northern Ireland, leaving 178 in the Free State.  There were two main drainage codes in Ireland.  The principal Act of the first is dated 1842. The works under this code were mainly carried out by the Board of Works. Many of them were spoilt financially by being carried out as relief works during the great famine.  In the Free State there are 114 districts formed under this code&mdash;4 costing over £70,000 apiece, total £383,000; 20 costing from £20,000 to £70,000, total £823,000; 31 costing from £5,000 to £20,000, total £347,000; 59 costing less than £5,000, total £117,000.  Grand total, £1,670,000 for 114 districts.  The principal Act of the second Code (which is still in force) is dated 1863.  The works under this Code were not carried out by the Board of Works, but by committees of the landowners interested.  In the Free State there are 64 districts formed under this Code:&mdash;4 costing over £70,000 apiece, £545,000; 3 costing from £20,000 to £70,000, £88,000; 27 costing from £5,000 to £20,000, £273,000; 30 costing under £5,000, £69,000&mdash;£975,000. So, that taking the two Codes together, the total number of districts in the Free State is 178, and the total cost, £2,645,000.</P>

      <P>There is practically nothing outstanding, I understand at present.  Under the procedure at present in force, the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1866, the Board of Works have intervened in the past and done works themselves in 52 cases; in 37 other cases they have made loans to the local Drainage Boards to enable them to carry out the works.  The total sum advanced in all these 89 cases was £64,300, which has all been repaid except about £700.  I think that gives all the information wanted.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill for the maintenance of existing Drainage Works under certain Acts. It is for the maintenance of these works.

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, to add after sub-section (1) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided however that the Commissioners shall continue to exercise in respect of any person employed in the business of any drainage board constituted under Section 12 of the Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act, 1863, and transferred to a county council pursuant to the provisions of the foregoing sub-section, the powers conferred by Section 41 of the Drainage of Lands and Improvement of Navigation and Water Power (Ireland) Act, 1842.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> You will perceive at once, sir, that this is a permanent Bill, and that it is proposed that existing drainage boards or boards of trustees be abolished and that the powers vested in them should be transferred to the county councils. I presume that will entail as well that the persons employed by these drainage boards will also be transferred: all the existing men will be transferred. I think these drainage boards have failed to a very large extent to justify their existence but I am just wondering will the change be for the better.  Under the Local Government Bill which is at present before the Dáil it is proposed to abolish the district councils and to constitute the county council as the only local body within the county.  That will necessarily mean that a large amount of extra work will be thrown on these councils, and I am just wondering whether the drainage schemes could not be better administered than under the proposed arrangements.  In Section 41 of the Drainage of Lands and Improvement of Navigation and Water Power (Ireland) Act of 1842 the Commissioners have certain powers, somewhat arbitrary powers.  It states: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for the said Commissioners to appoint, employ or dismiss at pleasure such engineers, clerks, surveyors, inspectors,&rdquo; etc., and as well they had to vouch the accounts when requested to do so.</P>
    <P>I feel that in the present chaotic condition of local administration in the country it is essential to have a supervisory body with powers to intervene in such cases under this Drainage System, and I believe the Commissioners of Public Works responsible to the Minister for Finance and consequently to the House, should be superimposed and should intervene, and should have the right to do so.  They should have all the rights and powers that were originally conferred on them by this Drainage of Lands and Improvement of Navigation and Water Power Act of 1842.  It is quite inconceivable that the large amount of money that must be necessarily spent in restoring the drainage systems of the country, as well as the large sums that must be spent in <Col N="1679" /> maintaining the older works, should be handed over at the present juncture to irresponsible county councils and that the officials who will be employed in these schemes should be without any proper check.  Remember, the work will be highly technical, and I do not think even a county council with the best intentions could sufficiently direct and carry out the work they are supposed to do, therefore I ask that the President will very seriously consider this amendment or something equivalent to it and see that the officers employed on these works will be under some responsible authority such as the Board of Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not agree to accept this amendment. Power is taken in this section to transfer to the county councils the business of the drainage boards, and in that case all the officials should also be transferred.  Now the amendment is that you should transfer the services and retain control of the officials&mdash;that is, the power of dismissal and appointment of officers.  I do not think we could justify that.  If we consider the county councils bodies sufficiently responsible to take the control of the works, I do think we cannot limit the control without creating very serious trouble.  The appointment of the officers and the dismissal of them by the Board of Works only, and the control of the service by the county council might lead to extraordinary complications. Let us suppose for a moment that the best will in the world is evidenced on both sides, and the Board of Works says &ldquo;We dismiss this man&rdquo; and the county council says &ldquo;You will not.&rdquo;  The county council has the money and they could continue to keep this man on.  In another case where the county council would wish to dismiss a man and the Board of Works would say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; you would have another complication of the same sort.  I do not think the county council should be asked to take over the service unless they get all the authority.  It makes for much greater responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that.  It will eventually make for efficiency.  We are very critical with regard to local authorities, even more than critical.  I observe that some of them have taken upon themselves the very onerous and exacting duty of criticising this House and some of its members.  We are living in a country in which great things are expected and anticipated.  The Local Government code as such, and all that it meant, was certainly a great success in this country, but it was not the success that everybody anticipated.  That is due to the fact that our conception of perfection is much higher than that of less discriminating peoples.  In this case it would, in my opinion, be a very peculiar decision to hand over to county councils a service, but to limit their authority in connection with that service. I do not think it would make for efficiency.  If they carry out their duty and carry it out efficiently, it would be a great pity to have interference with them.  If they have responsibility and do not carry it out, I hope that the electors and ratepayers will have sufficient means at their disposal to see that the next county council will carry out its duty efficiently.</P>

In my constituency these boards were under the management of the county council, the county surveyor and his assistants, and I have never heard any complaint as to the manner in which they carried out their duties. I know myself they have been well carried out and at the present time the works are in a very good state.</P>

      <P>Certainly I will.  I confess frankly that I have no great opinion of local authorities.  The members constituting them are, to a large extent, in a groove.  I am referring now to boards of trustees of drainage systems.  The officials, to a very large extent, dictate the policy of the boards and do practically what they please.  I am prepared to give instances where that has occurred.  I feel that with the new addition of work which will be thrown on the county councils, they will not have sufficient time to do this work, and even if they had they are wanting in technical knowledge as to the needs of drainage.  I feel that there must be some body super-imposed which will keep the officials in order, as it were, compel them to execute certain works, and to do their work in a right and proper manner.  It is hardly fair to county councils to place responsibilities of this magnitude upon them. In future their labours will be overwhelming, and is it just or right that they should be required to undertake work requiring high technical knowledge? It is essential for the success of these drainage schemes to which this State out of its penuriousness is contributing that there should be some vigilant supervisory body armed with semi-arbitrary powers to restrain the officials from falling into a state of semi-inanimation.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be possible for me to give an answer to that question that would satisfy the Deputy.  Circumstances, I take it, would very largely enter into each case.  Take a poor district in which there is unemployment.  The need in that district would be far greater than in a fairly well-to-do district, where the advantages that would be derived would perhaps be more than compensated for by reason of the expenditure. I take it that if it came to the notice of a Deputy that the contribution of the Minister for Finance was not what he thought it ought to be, he would have an opportunity of questioning him here in the House and drawing attention to it.  Than that, I think, it would not be possible to get a better grip of the Minister.  The Deputy knows that he has two things to watch&mdash;a very soft heart and a very light pocket.</P>

      <P>Apparently not.  The Minister for Education said that even before his vast responsibilities included the responsibility of the College of Science, he had made it clear that there was no intention on the part of the Government to diminish or to impair the educational benefits afforded by the College of Science to the people of this country.  He repeated that he did not propose, now that it comes within his domain, that the work of the College of Science should be diminished or impaired in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three things obviously that might be done with the College of Science.  One was to maintain it as hitherto; the other was to scrap it, and the only third alternative is the one which the Minister for Education has adopted&mdash;namely, to change it.  More than one Deputy made an attempt to advocate the policy of maintaining the College of Science as it is.  For the views of Deputy Johnson I invariably entertain a genuine respect, because they are always put forward, where they concern matters with which he is <Col N="1685" /> not directly concerned in his own active experience of public affairs, in a scientific spirit&mdash;that is to say, hypothetically and tentatively and subject to correction, with a readiness of mind always evinced to modify his view if good reason is shown that he should do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson, by one remark that he made in answer to a rude interruption of mine&mdash;for which I regret to say that the Official Report makes the Minister for Industry and Commerce responsible&mdash;rather tempts me to discuss &mdash;although there is no time for it, and possibly never would be time for it&mdash; the idea of a University.  Deputy Johnson said in answer to my rude ejaculation: &ldquo;Why not&mdash;I do not know.  I thought universities were institutions rather for the education of the growing person and not for the activities of the finished product.&rdquo;  That is the conception of a university's functions widely entertained.  I have no doubt that if anyone were foolish enough to spend the money on it and take a plebiscite on &ldquo;What is a university and what does it do?&rdquo;  the overwhelming majority of answers would come that it was a place where young men spent a few years, came out with a degree and were regarded as educated men in consequence. Those who advocated the maintenance of the College of Science, whether they were conscious of it or not, had the conception of the university as a place of higher studies, and Deputy Good or Deputy Hewat&mdash;I always mix them up; I find it absolutely impossible to remember, like the heavenly twins, which is which; but one of them, I think it was Deputy Good&mdash;spoke as if he believed the very atmosphere of the university was such as to unfit men for the active business pursuits of life.</P>
    <P>Now, a university has a dual function. If you like, it has two functions, that though dissimilar, are closely united.  The ordinary view of it as a place where young men and young women are instructed is correct so far as it goes.  The University and University College have been, and are, and always will be centres of education, in the sense of education being the impartment of instruction and also of discipline of mind and character.  But universities have always also taken on <Col N="1686" /> a very great function, what Deputy Milroy would call the vital function, of expanding knowledge.  The advancement of knowledge, the widening of the bounds of what men know and understand, and the imparting in turn to others of the knowledge so achieved, being always the double role of the university.  In later days the name research has come to be applied as a convenient name for what Bacon wrote about under the title of &ldquo;The Advancement of Learning.&rdquo;  Through this debate, Deputy Thrift, for example, who understands these matters through and through, spoke of research always without the qualifying adjective of scientific. From the moment that the name &ldquo;research&rdquo; replaced the longer title &ldquo;the Advancement of Learning,&rdquo; research came to be identified in university circles with a closer scrutiny of nature as pursued in scientific laboratories. But the presence in this Dáil of the Minister for Education, who, when he was not Minister for Education, was a professor in the National University, is a reminder that even on the side of the humanities, as distinct from the scientific studies, there was room for research.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor MacNeill holds a Chair that is almost exclusively a Chair of research.  The work that he did, and was called upon to do as professor, while he was a professor&mdash;his duties are, of course, in suspense for the benfit of a wider public&mdash;was, let me say, one-tenth lecturing and nine-tenths research. A large part of the work that Deputy O'Sullivan, as a professor, is called upon to do, is the extension of knowledge through historical research. The spade of the archæologist&mdash;we have a professor of archæology by the way (Professor MacAllister) in the National University, who is making history in the best sense of these words in Palestine&mdash;the spade of the archæologist and the research of the scholar into the ancient past also widen the scope of human knowledge and throw enlightenment and illumination on the human mind, contributing to civilisation and its advance.  Nearly all that work, I would like to tell Deputy Johnson&mdash;on the, perhaps, erroneous supposition that he had not adverted to it&mdash;is post-graduate work.  In the <Col N="1687" /> modern university, the most valuable, at any rate not to exaggerate, not the least valuable part of its work is the post-graduate work and it is the most expensive to the university.</P>
    <P>So that my answer to Deputy Johnson is that the university is not merely for finishing a product to turn it out. It is a centre of research to which graduates come attracted by the facilities that a particular university institution provides and that is in a great measure due to the personality of the professor.  When the X-rays were discovered, Professor Röntgen was appointed to another university and the students of Europe and America flocked to him in the new university.  For scientific research an enormous expenditure is necessary.  Fortunately for research, the expense is not so great for studies belonging to the old traditional side of a university.  But on both those sides&mdash;on the side of scientific equipment and on the side of the provision of a library&mdash;the National University has been absolutely incomplete and kept incomplete from its very foundation.</P>
    <P>That was the plaint I have made in this Dáil on two occasions, apropos of these University Estimates, and I will return to it, sir, with your permission. The great work that is required of universities, as the Minister for Education put it, is that they should be in harmony with the life and the needs of the life of the nation to which they are supposed to minister. Universities, like every other public institution, have that as their <i>raison d'être.</i>  They are called into being by the needs of the nation and they exist profitably only so long as they serve its needs&mdash;educationally more particularly &mdash;the promotion of civilisation and of better living, both on its spiritual and its material side.</P>
    <P>The further discussion of this point I find exceedingly difficult, because I am unwilling to rake up the embers of a dying fire.  It is difficult for me to speak about this subject of the relation of the College of Science to the National University, and to skim over it so lightly as not to refer to past controversies, and in that way so far renew them.  My friend and colleague in the <Col N="1688" /> University, Professor Swift MacNeill, wrote some years ago a history of the Irish Parliament&mdash;that is the Parliament of the Irish Pale&mdash;and in a very succinct treatment of the legislative efforts of the first years of Grattan's Parliament he provided me with a model of allusiveness which I should be glad to be able to copy.  Referring to the re-enactment of the Penal laws and the penalties against the public worship of the older Faith, he says they found it necessary to re-enact some provisions dealing with the tenure of land and public worship.  In that simple fashion all these painful and, let me call them, passionate topics are dismissed. Deputy Thrift, whose views on educational policy, and in regard to educational theory, must always be listened to with more than usual respect, contributed several speeches to this debate.</P>

      <P>Well, as we say with regard to the arrangements for Lent, one meal and a collation&mdash;one speech and a few little addenda.  Deputy Thrift requires no conversion to the view which, if there were time, I should like to expand as well as expound, that the main work of a modern university is research, and that that research is not in pure science alone, but research devoted to the application of exact knowledge to the science of agriculture and the mechanical industries. Since that is common cause between us I may pass on to the points on which unfortunately we differ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our first difference is as regards history.  He has told us that in 1906 Trinity College established for itself a faculty of Agriculture and did it in a practical way.  It appointed a qualified man as professor.  I am not quoting all the Deputies words, but, if I misrepresent him by abbreviation, I know he will correct me.  &ldquo;The University resources were very limited and its appeals to the Government for assistance to enable it to carry out that work on a scale befitting the country met with no response whatever, which, perhaps, is not to be wondered at.&rdquo; That is not my comment, sir.  That is in the speech, which, perhaps, is not to be wondered at.  If I were to say it on my own behalf, I should say it with <Col N="1689" /> another significance altogether.  Did Trinity College initiate this movement for agricultural and technical development? In a recent debate the Minister for Education stated that I threw a brick at him and gave the bouquet to myself.  If I were to recite all the history of this movement I should be throwing bouquets to the Minister and myself in conjunction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The bricks are round the corner in reserve.  It happened that in response to a long continued agitation for the provision of a university, to which the majority of the country could send their sons and daughters, Lord Beaconsfield created an examining and degree-giving body which he facetiously represented was a university.  Under cover of that he said that the Catholics of Ireland had now the ball at their feet, thereby anticipating a remark of Mr. Birrell at a later date, who declared that a National University was created&mdash;more particularly in reference to University College, Dublin&mdash;that though the income provided for it was a beggarly endowment, yet, if we made good, if we showed how much we could do with so little, we would then have justified the Westminister authorities in giving more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us, who, in the old University College were trained under men who had been graduates at Oxford, Cambridge, and Trinity College Dublin, and various other universities, became aware of the new movement in the world which had built up a great industrial fabric in Prussia; we realised that if science teaching, and more particularly research, and more particularly still, scientific research with regard to applied science could be provided, we could make a new Ireland.  We could stop emigration, and instead of having people descanting on the woes and poverties of Ireland, we could make it a better, a bigger, and a more prosperous Belgium. We clamoured for the creation in Ireland of a new and modern type of university institution.  We were supposed to represent medievalism, backwardism if you like.  The Government of the day decided that we should get scientific education but it would <Col N="1690" /> be put in what has been called a neutral atmosphere.  At the very moment that this absurd proposition, of calling upon us to create a university college as one of the constituent colleges of the National University, to provide it with new buildings and equipment out of a sum of £110,000, the Government of that day were expending, as Deputy Sir James Craig told us last evening £270,000 on a college of science.</P>
    <P>We asked for a modern type of university.  I remember, and I am almost ashamed to recall it, the number of speeches I made, and the articles I wrote pointing out how a few German professors had created the great beer trade of Germany and given it a monopoly of the world; that a few German professors had created the aniline dye trade which got the monopoly of the world and which even the United States of America, with all its millions devoted to scientific research, and its almost innumerable universities with scientific equipment, on which money has been lavished&mdash;almost squandered, if one could use such a word&mdash;in spite of that competition, and in spite of the war Germany still retained the monopoly of the dye stuff production.</P>
    <P>A University Commission was set up and we were given a replica of Dublin University.  A Commission was set up to arrange the chairs and apportion the work.  I remember well the horror with which some of us saw that Commission draw its pen through the name of a Chair of Agriculture and Chemistry, and substitute for it a Lectureship on classical archaeology.  That was the temper of the gentlemen who were in charge.  They had been brought up on the old traditions.  At a University Conference held in Oxford in 1921, which my friend Deputy Alton and I had the advantage of attending, Professor Joly of Trinity College, one of the advanced men in modern science, told the assembly, which was composed of representatives of all universities of the world practically where the English language is spoken, of his efforts to have a Degree of Bachelor of Science set up in the Dublin University and to have it of equal weight with the <Col N="1691" /><i>Artium Baccalaureus</i>, and of his failure.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming so much the individuals as what is called in the jargon of philosophy <i>zeit-geist</i>, or the spirit of the times.  There are men even still in high places in the universities who would controvert the views of Deputy Professor Thrift that the application of scientific research to the practical concerns of mechanical industries that ultimately lead to breadwinning should not find a home in the university.  It is academic snobbery, for snobbery is what one ought to call it, and it is a great handicap to university advance.  Narrow views with regard to culture, pronounced of course for this purpose not as culture but as &ldquo;cultchaw,&rdquo; go with that snobbery and create the impression which has had such a disastrous effect upon Deputies Good and Hewat, when they hold this view that the universities are inimical to the proper development of anything but the professions.  That spirit and that temper of belief in the old knowledge and distrust of the new learning as belonging to business pursuits was dominant in Dublin University in 1906, the time that Deputy Professor Thrift referred to.  Our agitation laid such stress upon this scientific development that when the British Government arranged for a Commission of Inquiry into Trinity College and when our Graduates' Association was going before it to give evidence on university reforms required, this chair of Agriculture was created in Trinity College. I do not say that that was done for window dressing, nor do I say that it was done to get ready for the Commission. That is not contained in my statement even by way of innuendo. I do say, however, that the jog, the spur and the stimulus for doing the thing, the awakening to the new needs at the moment, was due to pressure from the Graduates' Association as much as to the fact that there was then growing up in Trinity College with the Professor Thrifts of that time younger minds and a newer spirit.  I would call attention to what I venture, without any meaning of disrespect, to suggest are discrepancies in the statement of <Col N="1692" /> Deputy Professor Thrift.  No doubt, he will clear these up, but I am drawing attention to what seem to me to be discrepancies.  He says the university resources were very limited.  They were not at that time limited, but they are limited now.  The change in the purchasing power of money and the increase in the cost of living affected Trinity College in recent years as it has affected us.  As a point of fact I challenge that statement of Deputy Professor Thrift that the resources of Trinity College were limited and that appeals to the Government for assistance met with no response. They met with no response because the Government of that day was only too well aware that they could not have the egregious callousness or display a cynical attitude before the world of adding to the endowments of Dublin University at a period when we were clamouring for the wherewithal for existence and were being refused.  It was pointed out, and I shall proceed with your permission at a later stage to point out also to Trinity College, that if it were to re-adjust its own financial resources it could do a great deal more than it did.  That is a distinct challenge to Deputy Professor Thrift, who, no doubt, will set the Dáil right on the matter if it can be done in correction of me.  I say the contrast is between the impoverished institutions, and I have no hesitation in saying deliberately impoverished institutions on the one hand, and a rich corporation on the other, which is, no doubt, feeling the pinch in the present hour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor Thrift in his speech goes on: &ldquo;It was really ahead of its time.&rdquo;  Then we, the Minister for Education and our colleagues in the Graduates' Association were very much ahead of our time.  &ldquo;Because in the country itself and from the agricultural interests it met with no practical support. That system was continued for some years with discouraging success.&rdquo; I do not profess to know what sort of success &ldquo;discouraging success&rdquo; is.  I quote again: &ldquo;Then the University initiated the move which was the forerunner, I might say, of the move to which the Minister has referred to-day, <Col N="1693" /> namely, that this kind of work could be done better and more economically in co-operation with the College of Science than if it were run as a separate faculty by the University.  Instead of appointing a new professor arrangements were made by which the general educative work could be done inside the University.  More specialised work could be done under the professor in the College of Science.  That was in 1912, and since then that work has been running on these lines.&rdquo; Now, there are two policies of Trinity College, Dublin.  In 1906, the University worked its own faculty of agriculture. In 1912, the University does not work its own faculty of agriculture, but it utilises the equipment and the facilities of the Royal College of Science, and for two very excellent reasons, for reasons that it could be done better and more economically.  Certainly, if the work of the nation can be done better and more economically by method A than by method B, then it would be the duty of the Dáil to insist that it was done by method A, and not by method B, but in so far as Deputy Professor Thrift represents the mind of Trinity College there is another policy in this matter in the year 1924.  In 1906, the University had its own faculty of agriculture, but in 1912, it is better and more economical to make use of the College of Science.</P>

      <P>It was there in 1924, and Deputy Professor Thrift would do well to remember that.  If the Deputy will turn to column 4295 of the Official Report, he will see his own declaration on the matter.  Deputy Professor Thrift interrupted the Minister for Industry and Commerce on a point of explanation, and the point of explanation he put forward was of a totally different character.  It was that there should be a discussion between the Universities and the Minister as to how this work could best be done in a way that would benefit the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister replied: &ldquo;Deputy Thrift in his interruption or speech did not say that it could best be done by keeping on the College.  I wonder <Col N="1694" /> does he assert that now?&rdquo; and Professor Thrift replied &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Deputy Professor Thrift's view, which he made very clear, is that the College of Science should be continued as it is at present.  That was the view of Trinity College in 1906 and in 1912.  &ldquo;No&rdquo; is his answer to the question: Should it be continued in 1924.  Now, why was Trinity College in favour of this system? Other speakers have advocated, by the way, the 1912 policy for 1924. Why was that done?  If Deputies will take the trouble to read carefully the speech made by Deputy Major Cooper, the speech made by Deputy Good, and some of the remarks made by Deputy Alton, and the concluding portion of the speech made by Deputy Sir James Craig last evening, they will thoroughly understand why.  It will emerge if I read a passage from Deputy Thrift's speech.  Am I exceeding my time?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I think I shall read from Deputy Thrift.  There is no one in the Dáil whom I should less wish to misrepresent than Deputy Thrift.  He says: &ldquo;Those schemes which were initiated by Trinity College are, I think, exact forerunners of the scheme outlined by the Minister to-day, but in the form in which the Minister has put forward his proposals, his proposals would appear to have the effect of shutting down the efforts of Trinity College on those two lines, and cutting off the connection it has made, and the work it is doing, in connection with the College of Science.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Deputy Cooper, in the same or a similar frame of mind, asked the question, &ldquo;Is it suggested that the National University will take Trinity College students for their final year in order to equip them with College of Science knowledge?&rdquo;  And Deputy Good spoke also as if the carrying out of the Minister's proposals meant the <Col N="1696" /> shutting off from students of Trinity College of the facilities which they now enjoy.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has dealt with that so effectively that I may deal with it very lightly.  It is assumed that because money comes to the rescue of the National University that that is inflicting some injury upon Dublin University, upon Trinity College, that is to say.  Deputy Johnson stated: &ldquo;I am afraid that it means that the present economic position is being allowed to determine the future of development in this direction,&rdquo; and I admit that it might appear so to the casual observer.  The great poet, Dryden, unfortunately, joined the Catholic Church at the moment when it was coming into political ascendancy. It happened that his own material interests were served by his change of religion and his conversion of heart was very gravely doubted by his enemies, who were many.  And there is an unfortunate appearance of coincidence here in this.  University College, Dublin, alone of the University Institutions in Ireland, has a building debt.  I have explained how that came about on more than one occasion here, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done so again.  We are the only institution with a debt.  That is not due to mismanagement on our part. On the contrary, University College, Dublin, ought to be attacked, as I have attacked it, for its economic policy and its parsimoniousness.  It committed a great blunder in the beginning of its days by attempting to live within the miserly endowment that was provided for it instead of doing, as the Minister for Education and I attempted to do, mapping out a proper scheme of university Chairs and making provision for university wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They prefer to balance the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit this is very complicated.  It is claimed that Trinity College, out of its resources, could not provide certain things.  For example, Deputy Good told us that the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, which recognises neither religion nor politics in the matters it investigates and promotes, went before a Royal Commission <Col N="1697" /> in Trinity College, held a few years ago, and pointed out that whereas the National University had a Faculty of Commerce, the Dublin University had not, and asked for money to provide that it should have such a Faculty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is part of the case made by the Deputies representing Trinity College.  We have a Faculty of Commerce, and they have not.  Very good. I was one of those few who stood for the introduction of the Faculty of Commerce into the University, and out of our very limited funds we were able to force the University Commission, in spite of its retroactive tendencies, to create this Faculty, and we paid for it out of our limited endowments, because we believe in progressing with modern progress.  We had to do without other things.  The salaries allotted to certain Chairs had to pay for it. There were other Chairs which we required, but we had to go without them. We saw to it, however, that we had our Faculty of Commerce.  Deputy Thrift also told you with regard to the explanation of the £100,000 given to Trinity College last year, that that money owed its origin to a fund provided out of the Irish Development Grant to compensate Trinity College in case of the sale of its Lands for losses accruing out of the Land Acts. The money accumulated, until last year it was £100,000.  Deputy thrift has not observed that the beneficent and paternal British Government was watchful for the interests of Trinity College that it might not be hurt by legislation meant for the betterment of the land system.  That fund was provided out of the Development Grant, but what Government provided a grant or a sum out of a grant to protect us from the inimical workings of the changes in the value of money and of the cost of building work in the period of the war?  We appear before this House year after year clamouring about buildings and unless we take time to explain that it is a war debt for which the British Government should be responsible, not us, the public will go away under the impression that we are not able to work the finances of our own institution.  Now, <Col N="1698" /> I go into the question of finance with a certain amount of detail.  University College, Dublin, was given a sum of £110,000 with which to build and equip a new college.  It is sometimes spoken of as a Dublin College.  It is not a Dublin College, and that must be remembered.  It is a college for Dublin, the Midlands, and the Northwest, so far as the territory assigned to it in its charter is concerned, but if you look at it in actual practice it is the College of Ireland.  For that college that was brought into being by an agitation actuated by the spirit of modern progress and science and the application of science to industry, £110,000 was allotted.</P>
    <P>Now, owing to the war we were only able to build a fragment.  We are still without the provision of a library.  That was the first thing we had to scrap.  In the architect's plans for the Earlsfort Terrace buildings, which were divided into two quadrangles, the library was the first to go.  We dismissed the library, the school of anatomy and the school of sciences as applied to medicine.  I stated last year that we would not give details as it might be hurtful to our progress, and I keep the same reticence now.  Trinity College last year got £110,000, and Deputy Good and others come here and talk about the Government treating the two universities with equality.  I started on that sideline from this point: what was the driving idea in the minds of Deputies who speak like that?  It was the idea that the Minister for Education was relieving our financial necessity by doing some wrong to education in general; that just as in my country a hotel company wanting to put up a new hotel laid violent and unholy hands upon a castle of ancient period because the stones were good the Minister for Education says here, &ldquo;University College, you want buildings and you want money; here are buildings and money, take them and leave us alone.&rdquo;  It looks like that, but it happened that two years ago or thereabouts this whole question of duplication and of unnecessary expenditure due to duplication was forced upon the attention of the Government, and ever since has been occupying their attention. Like the Minister for Education, <Col N="1699" /> I do not undertake to say how many universities a country should have. Scotland, a very small country, has four; Belgium has five, but the College of Science is doing work of pure science as well as applied, University College is doing pure science.  Through historical reasons which I do not like again to go into in too much detail, the one has been left incomplete, as I contend, purposely incomplete; the other is a portion of a university.  These two, financed simultaneously, mean overlapping. Deputy Good says that nobody will advocate overlapping, so we have Deputy Good on our side in this matter. We can provide in University College, Dublin, the chairs of pure science required, so far as agriculture particularly is concerned, and in some respects as regards technology.  A slight addition to our staff completes the whole work for a Faculty of Agriculture and for technology.  So much is to be done for University College, Dublin.  Is that something taken away from Trinity College?  A great deal of the criticism that came from here was dictated by the hasty idea that that was bound to be the effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, and I have referred to it already, that if Trinity College were to reduce its own expenditure, out of these very ample though not sufficient funds that it at present enjoys, there would not be the so called inequality.  Figures showing the cost of the various universities and university colleges were provided to the Conference at Oxford in 1921. I have seen other figures, but they were incomplete; but I remember that the cost of the administration for University College, Dublin, as shown in these statistics, was one of the lowest per student, with the exception of one university institution in Scotland.  We were actually step for step with Scotland as regards economical expenditure. Trinity College has internal students, commons, the upkeep of residential buildings, expensive administration, and all these things require looking into and readjustment.  We are a new university, and at the period of our creation these things were very narrowly looked into and dealt with <Col N="1700" /> in a very miserly fashion.  Suppose that what Deputy O'Sullivan said were not the case.  Suppose that what Deputy Major Cooper&mdash;he is gone away, unfortunately, I have chased him from the House; he does not want the light &mdash;suggests is the case, that this dreadful thing would be inflicted upon Trinity College students, namely, that they would have to go to University College, Dublin, for further scientific study, what then?  We created a Doctor of Philosophy degree at the request of the various universities, because after the war there was reluctance on the part of Canadian, American, and other overseas students to resume the practice of going for scientific research work to the German universities, and it was necessary to do that class of work, as, in order to qualify as lecturers and professors in their own university, they had to have a degree which would show the character of such studies.  The other universities created this research degree of Doctor of Philosophy.  Students, graduates of other universities, came to us to pursue post-graduate studies.  Some of ours go to other universities, notably to Cambridge, to pursue post-graduate studies.  Take the case of Professor Ryan, who happens also to be in charge of the State laboratory.  Supposing students came for a post-graduate course, are we to understand here, because of the fact that the buildings within which they breathe for the purposes of that study belong to us&mdash;the majority&mdash;that some hurt, some moral or intellectual damage, will come to them?</P>
    <P>That is what it reduces itself to in the last analysis.  That is what it comes down to.  Deputy Cooper asks where are they to go, where are they expected to go?  He had certain correspondence. I forget the exact words. I think he spoke of his bag being filled with letters.  I wish he had seen my post-bag.  &ldquo;There are hundreds of students in the College of Science who are reluctant to transfer to the National University from the College of Science and they are continually writing to anyone who they think has any influence in the matter.  But it is the case, and I suppose it is a product <Col N="1701" /> of past evils.&rdquo;  Deputy Cooper mended his hand a little later when he came to speak about it again, and spoke of it as &ldquo;they wished the right of choice.&rdquo; I am one of those who genuinely believe in the things that are protested by others, that in knowledge there is no political or religious distinction. There are no Catholic mathematics, no Protestant philosophy, no national geology, and no British astronomy. Let there be no such distinction, and if there be no such distinction, why then is it to be argued that the proper provision of buildings to University College, Dublin, is not to be provided, because there are still some people who would shrink from going to an institution of that sort?  I will leave the matter at that.  I could say a great deal more about it, and with more effect, I believe, but I prefer to leave it at that.  There was another point. The Deputies from Connaught came down like a cohort on the fold last evening.  For the first time we had the spectacle of Deputy O'Maille, not as a master of diplomacy, arranging for the disposition of controversies, but actually threatening a Six County Government in the West, if this dreadful thing that the Minister for Education proposed, or is alleged to have proposed, for the Galway College, were carried out.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been grievously misunderstood.  Today's newspapers are full of resolutions from Galway, protests, laments, and about what?  Because the Minister proposed to do for Galway what ought to have been done for it at the beginning, namely, to do it justice.  That agitation, to which I have been referred earlier, and which has been conducted for so many years with so much noise and, unfortunately, with so little results, claimed that the Queen's Colleges, as they were then, the Colleges of Galway and Cork should be put in harmony with their surroundings.  That was not done.  To a great extent, that still awaits being done.  The Minister proposes to do it.  It is an act of belated educational policy.  What I cannot understand is this.  They see in an Irish Minister in this Dáil, who has always <Col N="1702" /> stood for educational progress, an enemy, one who threatens their future. One of the proposals made to the Commission at the time the National University was being created was to see to it that the college in Galway was made in harmony with its surroundings, that it should have a Faculty of Agriculture, that it should be utilised for the development of Irish, that it had always scope for engineers, that there was much work to be done in the west that called for trained and skilled civil engineers, and that instead of spreading money over a miniature university institution so as to create the absurdity that was in Queen's College, Galway, earlier, it should be made an efficient institution by paying proper salaries to the professors and lecturers in it within the limits of the endowments it was possible to give.  Now, that is what has been so unfair to Galway College.  As a consequence, Galway College has lost Professor Trench, who now, happily for himself, though unhappily for Connaught, is transferred as Professor of English Literature to Trinity College. In Galway he was Professor of Mental Science, which includes Logic and Psychology, and he was also Professor of the English Language and Literature and Professor of History, and as well as I remember his salary was £250 a year.  He is not much better off now, Deputy Thrift reminds me. Financially he is not, but academically I am afraid he is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Afraid in the obvious sense that I regret so excellent a man should be lost to the National University.  Now, that system of having the window dressed, of having a number of Chairs in the College without sufficient money to pay for the proper sort of men, brought it about that Galway College, as the Queen's College, for many years was regarded as a taking-off place for the budding professor.  A Cambridge graduate would do duty there for a number of years to acquire proficiency in his work there, and then go elsewhere.  So that there was a constant stream, a changing population of professors.  That was not fair to Galway, and it was not fair to Ireland.  Our proposal was turned aside, I will not say by what influence <Col N="1703" /> or through whose machinations; but, at any rate, University College, Galway, was decreed to be the name of Queen's College, Galway, and the old system was pursued.  What is the result? The other night we passed in a few minutes an Estimate for the Dublin Metropolitan Police amounting to £405,200.  The Estimate for Galway University College which we are now discussing is for £21,000.  For the Police Force of the Metropolitan City, £405,200, and for the university institution of the Province of Connaught, which might through specialised courses serve also the whole of Ireland&mdash;£21,000! For the Gárda, £1,180,000.  But take all the Universities, the two rival Universities, and the University Colleges of the National University, and the total Estimate here we are discussing is £107,800; in round numbers, £108,000.  The Dublin Metropolitan Police, nearly four times that; the Gárda exactly ten times that the Army four millions, nearly forty times that; Property Losses Compensation&mdash; and this is not without its connection with the matter in hand&mdash;£7,333,000. Now, what sort of university institution could be efficiently worked on £21,000?  If it were not so dreadful in its reaction on the country, and the country's future, you would say it is a superb joke, the work of humorists. I have repeatedly pointed out in connection with the Education Vote that you cannot expect men to turn away from lucrative professions, or from business, men of the type, calibre, quality, and character to be professors and lecturers in university colleges, if you pay them as they are paid in University College, Galway.  Among the details of the Vote for the Dublin Metropolitan Police you will find details of the salaries of the constables and sergeants.  A constable of twenty years' service has precisely the salary that is vouchsafed to the secondary teacher.  The station-sergeant, with his five guineas a week, house allowance, and allowance for clothes, is financially better off than the lecturers in University College, Galway, and that in a country where education is supposed to be one of our proudest traditions. <Col N="1704" /> Reverence for the educator was a great thing in Ireland's past, and the one thing that every Irishman is proud of is that Ireland was a centre from which scholars went out to found universities in all lands.  It is only saints that Deputy Gorey is sceptical about; he admits the scholars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Galway College is not the only problem.  There is, I insist, without a want of due regard for the other colleges I have the honour to represent, a necessity for concentrating attention upon the Central College, because it is the College of the University situated in the capital, and more particularly, it is the college side by side with the ancient college of Dublin University.  That emulation and rivalry which we expect, and which in the past had, unfortunately, political and other horrid tinges, makes it necessary that more should be done for the Central College.  I do not say that because I belong to it.  I should say that if I did not belong to it; at least I believe I should.  We want to have that Central College in line with other institutions of the same type.  Take the University of Sheffield, the University of Birmingham, the University of Bristol, the University of Liverpool, the University of Manchester, and so on&mdash;each of these devotes itself to the development of whatever happens to be the most profitable kind of industrial development in the region that it serves.  I should have mentioned in that connection, in answer to Deputy Johnson, an interesting thing which was going through my mind when the debate was on, regarding forestry.  As everybody knows the great industry in the Province of Quebec is the paper industry, and the Government there has provided a Forest Products Laboratory, which is housed in Montreal in the building of the McGill University.  The students who are concentrating upon this side of technology study the chemistry of woods, wood pulps, and paper, in their final year, and they work and share in the research of that laboratory on forest products, so as to be in conjunction with the best minds, and see the work and to learn how to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> I refer to that because this question about the transfer of buildings and equipment of the College of Science was raised.  I was talking about other Estimates, and it reminded me that there is an estimate for a State Laboratory, a National Physical Laboratory, a National Technological Institute corresponding to the Forest Products Laboratory of the McGill University and the Quebec Government in the Dominion of Canada.  That is feasible here. That is not shut out by this promised development in the interest of University College, Dublin.  I want to end on that.  I want to reinforce this idea. The fact that what University College lacked is now to be its, through this provision, is not a diminution of facilities for education, but an enlargement of them.  It will not interfere with any special inquiries of a particular and limited kind, such as Deputy Johnson referred to in his speech.  Rather it will help all these.</P>
    <P>In many countries at the present moment where there is not this absolute agreement as to what a modern university should include or should not include, the great businesses combine in many cases to pay for the work of scientific research in regard to their own problems.  But it has been found in the cities where there is mass production in one industry that it would retard the profit-making if in the interests of development they were to scrap their models and have to make new models; and the result is that the British industries, for example, find it profitable to endow by contribution original University research work&mdash;to give it financial aid; and I hope that the Goods and the Hewats of the future Ireland will leave a portion of their enormous wealth gained in business to the enrichment of the laboratories that we are now trying to provide for, and to foster in our university institutions.

      <P>There is one question I should like to ask the Deputy. I am considerably disappointed, because when he touched on Galway I thought he was going to tell us something that the Minister had failed to say.  He twitted us about the anxiety displayed <Col N="1706" /> by the Galway Deputies and twitted us about these resolutions coming from Galway.  I took down what the Minister said he proposed to do for Galway, what should have been done long ago for it, that is, to do it justice.  I read the statement made by the Minister and this is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I leave Galway outside my proposals either one way or the other.  I do not propose to destroy.  I do not propose to construct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was hoping that the Deputy who has spoken, and spoken so well, would have discovered in what the Minister said something that I failed to discover, namely, what they are going to do for Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The proper thing is that the Minister should defend himself.  As I seem to have found something, according to Deputy O'Connell, which is not there, something which he cannot find himself, might I point out what the Minister said about provincial institutions.  It is column 4255:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not my view and not my intention that Galway&mdash;to put it in familiar terms&mdash;should be let down in the matter of educational work. I think that it should have an institution of higher education to which the people&mdash;I was going to say of the West of Ireland&mdash;could look up; I will amend that, and say to which the people of the whole of Ireland could look up.  I would like to see the idea of provincial institutions for higher education done away with altogether.  Instead of that, while it is well to have centres of higher education not all concentrated in the capital city, but placed at different points throughout the country, I think that each of those institutions should be of such a special kind and developed on such special lines that it would have a claim upon the entire country.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Ag tagairt do rud mar sin tamaill aimsire ó shin dubhairt Pádraig Mac Piarais: &ldquo;De réir cosamhlachta is 'sa teangaidh is mó atá an rud spioradálta sin atá riachtanach chun náisiúntachta (sin má chialluigheann teanga litridhéacht, béal-oideas, fuaimeanna is corr-chainnteanna), agus gurab í an teanga is mó a chosnuigheas í.... Sean-oideas ársa is eadh an náisiúntacht agus ní fhéadfadh an náisiún bás d'fhágháil an fhaid is a mhairfeadh an oideas sin i gcroidhe aon fhir dhílis nó <Col N="1708" /> gcroidhe aon mhná dílse amháin.  Ach dá mbéadh bás faighte ag an duine deiridh a choinnigh an oideas sin beo, nó ag an nGaedheal deiridh nár bhuaidh an Galldachas ariamh air, bhéadh deire go bráthach leis an náisiún Gaedhealach.  Pé brí stát saor, a chuirfí ar bun ina dhiaidh sin i n-Eirinn, ba chuma cé'n teidiol a baistfí air, ní h-é sean-náisiún na nGaedheal a bhéadh ann ..........

    <P>That is a statement by a man before the splendour of whose genius and integrity of whose patriotism we must all uncover.  In considering the position of Galway University my reason in rising is not to criticise&mdash;I do not think it is my function to criticise&mdash; but to try to elicit information as to what is proposed to be done for that university.  Is there any special treatment which might be called derogatory to its status?  Is its status to be reduced; is it not to have the same status as Dublin University College or Cork University College, and, if so, why is it not to have that equal status?  I should like some information about that and the reason is that I do not pretend to be able to follow Deputy Magennis into the various phases of university life which he has so lucidly and with such detail described.  But there is one phase I am very much interested in, and that is the Gaelic atmosphere which surrounds the University College, Galway.  The atmosphere of Trinity College internally may or may not be Gaelic; the atmosphere of Cork or Dublin University Colleges may or may not be Gaelic; but there is one thing certain, that the surroundings outside, the immediate surroundings, and the immediate atmosphere which the students come in contact with, when they leave these universities, are not by any means as Gaelic as the atmosphere of the Gaeltacht in which Galway is situated. That is one thing we should think of.</P>
    <P>We should endeavour, in the words of Pádraic Mac Piarais, to conserve <Col N="1709" /> what we have of Gaelic culture.  There is a certain amount of Gaelic culture in the Gaeltacht.  It was rudely broken, I know, at a certain period, and perhaps we have to pass over a gap between then and now.  Perhaps we will have to put English, French and Latin dictionaries into the pulping machine and grind them up in order to fill up the gap, but I believe we should bring the Irish mind, the purely Irish mind of the Gaeltacht, to bear upon the problems that confront the nation to-day in order to continue and preserve the continuity of that culture.  The conserving and the perpetuation are the two things that the University College, Galway, is peculiarly situated to do.  It is useless to deny&mdash;nobody has attempted to do it, and it would be useless to try it&mdash;that life in the university and the culture the university will impart, will not influence very largely the life of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it would be useless to deny it will not, and I would repeat what I said.  It would be useless to deny, nobody is attempting to deny, that the education and the culture and all the things that are acquired in University life, will not influence the life of the nation.  That is the reason when acquiring that culture and the knowledge and all the other potentialities that a university can offer, that it should be acquired in a Gaelic atmosphere. That Gaelic atmosphere we will get in Galway more securely than in any other university in the country. There is another aspect; that national teachers could also do a course of study in Galway University.  There are possibilities that when they come to take a training course, that they can also acquire that knowledge of the Irish language and the use of it in the teaching of the school programme which should be useful in their daily work. They can also, perhaps, get a literary degree or degree in education in that university.  I do not propose to stress that point particularly beyond this fact &mdash;that the atmosphere of Galway and its University for the prepetuation and the conservation of Irish culture and the bringing to bear on the problems of <Col N="1710" /> the country the purely Irish mind, is better suited than that of any other University College.  Instead of giving it special treatment in a retrogade fashion, I believe that Galway should get special treatment in a progressive fashion in this direction.</P>

      <P>I shall not attempt to imitate my friend Deputy Magennis in one respect, that is in the feat that he performed in his remarkable speech, but I hope I shall imitate him in one very important point, and that is in the spirit with which he dealt with this subject.  I rise particularly on this occasion to make two or three points as clear as with my humble capacity I can. I thought it was plain to every Deputy, with perhaps the exception of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that I did not approach this subject in any way with regard to a comparison of the resources and the revenues of Trinity College, Dublin, and the National University of Ireland, or University College, Dublin.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am sorry to say, appeared to think that I had, and appeared to criticise my remarks from that point of view, and to give that colour to what I said.  I disclaim that altogether.  I intend, in view of the remarks that have been made since, to confine myself to one point, namely, what I regarded as the university work of the College of Science, and its relationship to the university work as carried on, either by the National University or by Trinity College, Dublin. But I did not make any comparison, and I do not think that what I have said could be twisted or drawn in any way to show that I was thinking of the matter at all from the point of view of revenue or resources.  I did not even know at the time, but perhaps I may know now; I am not sure yet.  I did not even think at the time of any definite transfer of revenues; I did not know that was in question.  I am not sure yet how we stand in this matter.  I certainly did not contemplate that the proposal should be dealt with on the lines of whether it meant an increase in the resources of one body or the other. I was thinking, purely and simply, as to whether the university work of the College of Science could be best carried on on the lines indicated, or whether <Col N="1711" /> when it came to be considered as to the details on which the change that was in the minds of the Minister should be brought into effect, those details would involve with them certain implications which would operate injuriously on one university as compared with the other. That does not touch the question of resources.</P>
      <P>I put it up to the Minister at the time, and I put it up to him again, that with his statement I have very little, if any, fault to find.  I hardly criticised it even on the question as to what it meant, and I suggested to him that whilst on that line of general policy&mdash; and, mind you, I was dealing, as I said, with the purely University work of the College of Science&mdash;that while I did not question his general proposals at all, I did suggest and put it up to him definitely that he should not finally decide on the details in which that line of policy was to be carried out without consultation with the interests involved. I dare say it would shorten matters very much if we knew precisely whether the Minister would consider that suggestion favourably or not, or whether we are to approach the thing from the other point of view, which is that the whole of the details are settled and done with, and that we have got to face practically an accomplished fact.  I should dearly like to follow the Minister for Industry and Commerce along the lines he has taken in his speech, and I will do it another day, but I do not think he will get along with this particular problem at all if we take the line he took.</P>

I said at the time that that was a fair, and even a generous action, considering the resources of the country.  I say that again to-day.  That, as the Minister has stated, was accompanied by a promise on our part that <Col N="1712" /> there should be no request for any further grant or help from the State for three years.  I do not wish to modify that promise or to qualify it in any way.  My remarks were not accompanied by any thought in my mind at the time that this question involves in any way any qualification of that statement.  As I said, I was not thinking of it from the point of view of the resources of the two Universities.  But, at the same time, it is necessary, I think, after what has been said by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make it absolutely plain what that action really did, without, as I have said, withdrawing my appreciation of it.</P>
      <P>I think the Government, at the time, did all for Trinity College that they well could do, and I am quite prepared to applaud them if you like, for doing in a similar way something in order to help the resources of the National University of Ireland.  At the same time, I think it is absolutely necessary for me to state exactly what it means, both for Trinity College, Dublin, and for the Free State Government.  This has been talked about as a handing over of £100,000, approximately, to Trinity College, Dublin.  That is put in very carefully-chosen words, but it conveys one impression, and an impression that I do not think it is meant to convey at all.  I believe the proper way to put it is as I am about to put it now.  Trinity College had a certain endowment.  Some day we will go into that, and some day we will explode, and I think hopelessly explode, the fable we would like to believe is true, namely, that on the one hand you are dealing with a rich corporation that is only a spoiled child of one Government or another, and which has only got to hold out its hand and be supplied with milk and honey, and all that sort of thing.  Some day we will deal with that; I do not think it is advantageous to deal with it to-day.  But we had an endowment from landed property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1903 a certain Land Act was passed, which it was hoped would lead to the sale of all the lands and the handing over of them to the tenants. It was foreseen that if that policy was carried into effect, the endowment of <Col N="1713" /> Trinity College would be very seriously lessened.  In order to prevent that, after very considerable pressure on the British Government, Trinity College succeeded in getting a provisional clause inserted setting aside £5,000 per annum in order to prevent that loss accruing.  Land purchase, in fact, took place comparatively slowly, and ultimately was almost held up altogether, as members of the Farmers' Party will remember.  But the upshot of it was that it proceeded so slowly that our losses in any year did not exceed £1,600 or £1,700, and as a rule they were about £1,200.  The balance was set aside for that specific purpose, and had to continue to be set aside by the Act until the capital sum amounted to so much that there would be just £5,000 per annum accruing from the revenue on which Trinity College could claim.</P>
    <P>I say, deliberately, that with less difficulty than we had at the time when the Wyndham Act was passed, we secured from the Free State Government last year, when they wanted to pass their Land Act, the very same treatment, so far as they could go.  We secured that this £5,000 a year should be drawn on, and that in addition they would give a further £3,000 a year in order to meet these land losses.  That is specifically stated in the Government's own letter. We believed that the losses that would accrue to us under that Land Act would far exceed, when the whole sales came to be completed, that £8,000. Whether the Government point of view, that it would not amount to that sum, or our point of view that it certainly would at least equal it, is correct, remains to be seen, and in carrying out that line of policy the Government did us a further good turn when they enabled us to make use of these revenues, even before land purchase was completed. That was an additional advantage to us, because we got the revenues at once.  I admit all that frankly.  But I wish to point out this equally clearly, that so far as we were concerned, we believed that it was a line-ball arrangement, that when land purchase was completed our revenues would be the same as they were before the Government's Land Act was passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> As far as the Government was concerned, it was also a line-ball arrangement. £100,000 was there as an accumulated fund.  Under the Wyndham Act they were obliged to set aside a further £5,000 a year until the completed sum would produce a revenue of £5,000 a year.  That would have taken two or three years more.  I am not quite sure about that.  But because they were relieved of that liability of £5,000 they had to accept a further liability instead of it of £3,000, making £8,000.  They gave us a further lump sum of £5,000 which spread over three years, comes to less than £2,000 a year. We were to have that £3,000 without making a further appeal.  That will be adhered to both in the letter and in the spirit.  I hope I have made it clear that just as it leaves us in the position we were in before the Land Act was passed, so it was an advantage, a good turn the Government was able to do to us without impoverishing their own resources at all.  The money was there. It was not a question of their giving us £100,000 at all, and the Government themselves do not wish to make it appear that it was.  It was something that they could do, without straining their own resources, and I think the Government were glad to do it.</P>
    <P>Now, coming to this problem of the College of Science, I take it the position of the Government is this: they have a certain fund which they will be able to set free; by this arrangement and without further straining their own resources they propose that these funds should be handed over to the National University.  That is the way in which they are able to improve the position of the National University without straining the resources of the country.  I accept that freely.  I do not quarrel with it at all.  That explanation is a lengthy one, but I hope it will clearly meet these two points in a way in which they will not be challenged any more.</P>
    <P>Now, to return to this question of the College of Science work, which is, to my mind, at this moment a much more important point, and I do put it up to the Minister again&mdash;is the whole thing settled in detail, or may we have an opportunity of discussing the details <Col N="1715" /> of this proposal so as to see how the policy of the Government can be carried out, and so as to ensure that the University work and the College of Science work will be conducted in the best way under the new arrangements? Now, if we were to go into these details here, it would take us a week, and I do not think that even after that week we would do it as well as it could be done across the table by people talking over those proposals and putting their points of view to the Government. I do not suggest at all that the final people to decide this matter should not be the Government through the Minister for Education.  Of course, they must be.  But they will not be in a position to decide the matter unless they are in possession of the points of view of all the parties concerned.  I have only approached the matter so far from the point of view of the University work of the College of Science. There are several other aspects in which the matter has to be looked at and dealt with.  Some of them have been dealt with by previous speakers in the Dáil, so it will be only necessary to refer to them briefly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised this question generally on the last occasion I regret that I was not cognisant of the aspects of it on which I wish to touch to-day.  I wish to say, very clearly, that in raising this matter I want to have no misunderstanding and I desire that there shall be no apprehension that I have any desire that the Executive Council of this State should trespass upon matters that do not concern them.  I said on a recent occasion that I did not question the competence of the British Government to seek for information in whatever quarter they desired which would elucidate for them what appeared to them to be a constitutional dilemma.  I am not questioning the competence of the British Government to invoke the advice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in matters concerning them alone. Why I am raising this question at the moment is because they have invoked the intervention of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on a matter which concerns this State more vitally, perhaps, than even the British Government itself.  That is my reason for raising the matter.  This matter has been brought acutely to my notice by the publication within the past few days of the names of certain distinguished lawyers who are to act as a tribunal in regard to certain aspects of Clause 12 of the Treaty.  These gentlemen are called into being as a tribunal under a certain British statute. I want to draw attention to the purpose and the scope and the object of that statute, and to draw attention to and challenge the competence of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to adjudicate on this matter at all. This Act, which deals with the constitution of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, is an Act of William IV., passed in the year 1833&mdash; ninety-one years ago.  The President smiles at this weighty to me which I hold before me.  I hope this Act is not <Col N="1717" /> going to be as heavy upon the Free State as I feel it at the present time. It is an Act which has to be taken seriously.  It was passed in this particular year for a certain specific purpose, which is stated in the preamble of the Act, portion of which I will read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... And whereas, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain, certain Persons, Members of His Majesty's Privy Council, together with others, being Judges and Barons of His Majesty's Courts of Record at Westminster, have been from time to time appointed to be His Majesty's Commissioners for receiving, hearing, and determining Appeals from His Majesty's Courts of Admiralty in causes of Prize&rdquo;&mdash; captures at sea.</P>
      <P>That is the purpose for which this body was set up.  This Statute was enacted that they might consider cases like that, and to make that more emphatic, the concluding clause of this Statute&mdash;Section 31&mdash;states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided always, and be it enacted, that nothing herein contained shall be held to impeach or render void any Treaty or Engagement already entered into by or on behalf of His Majesty, or be taken to restrain His Majesty from acceding to any Treaty with any foreign prince, potentate or power in which Treaty it shall be stipulated that any person or persons other than the said Judicial Committee shall hear and finally adjudicate appeals from His Majesty's Court of Admiralty in causes of prize, but that the judgments, decrees and orders of such other person or persons so appointed by Treaty shall be of the same force and effect of which they would respectively have been if this Act had not been passed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the purpose, and the sole and entire purpose of this Act&mdash;to consider cases of prizes or captures at sea.  I come to another section of that Act. One day last month the London <i>Times</i> had an article on this matter, in which it quoted Section 4 of this Act.  I want to make it clear that the wording of this section is not contrary to the assertions I have made. Section 4 says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> And be it further enacted that it shall be lawful for His Majesty to refer to the said Judicial Committee for hearing or consideration any such other matters whatsoever as His Majesty shall think fit, and such Committee shall thereupon hear or consider the same, and shall advise His Majesty thereon in manner aforesaid.</P>
    <P>I want the House, and especially the Government, to consider the meaning of these words, and to consider the sections of the Act which I previously quoted; how they indicate the purpose of this Act, and how that purpose is not merely indicated but emphasised and reiterated in the concluding section of the Act.  I want the House to remember that this Statute was enacted in 1833&mdash;91 years ago.  I want the Dáil to put to themselves seriously the question whether an Act passed at a time so remote from the present and having a specific purpose for its objective is to be invoked and construed as having any bearing whatever upon such a grave matter as the construing or meaning of an Article of an International Treaty.  If we were to acquiesce in the idea that Section 4 could have a bearing upon this, we would be committing ourselves to something that would have implications of a much more far-reaching character than we at the moment can realise. &ldquo;It shall be lawful for His Majesty to refer to the said Judicial Committee for hearing and consideration any such other matters whatsoever as His Majesty shall think fit.&rdquo;&ldquo;Matters whatsoever !&rdquo;  Are we going to assent to that?  If the interpretation that the British Executive has put upon that section of the Act were true, it would have been quite competent for this Dáil to agree in all seriousness that the dilemma regarding the Liquor Bill should have been referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for decision.  According to those words, &ldquo;any such other matters whatsoever,&rdquo; the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council might be called upon by His Majesty to decide whether or not members of this House ought to wear straw hats or tall hats.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain <Col N="1719" /> matters have been referred by the British Government to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  The Deputy asked me to allow him to raise on the adjournment a question relating to these matters.  My first impulse in connection with the matter was that the actions of the British Government with regard to the Privy Council do not concern us and cannot be raised here.  It is not competent for us, and it is very improper for us, to discuss the domestic affairs of any other country.  I was hoping that the Deputy was going to put up some argument that the matters referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council could be properly discussed here.  He has put up no such argument.  He has put up an argument which, it seems to me, should not be put up here at all, with regard to an Act of Parliament of which the British Government have availed, and he seems to me now to be wandering completely away from the subject.  He has not proved, to my satisfaction, any relevancy of the matters which he is raising to our business. While I do not want to deny the Deputy any opportunity of raising a question as regards the Treaty or the Boundary Commission, I do want to insist that we shall not discuss a matter which is one only for the British Government and the British Parliament.  I feel that the Deputy is now doing that.  He has mentioned that the interpretation of the Treaty has been referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council by the British Government under an Act of 1833. If that were the case, there would be something to be discussed here.  But it seems to me to be plainly not the case.  There is nothing in this reference, which I have before me, about the interpretation of the Treaty.  It seems to me to be a reference connected with a doubt the British Government has as to the doing of certain things.  That does not concern us in the slightest.  It does not concern us any more than a reference by the Executive Council to certain judges as to what we should do with the Liquor Bill of 1923, would concern the British Parliament or the Canadian Parliament or the French Parliament.  I <Col N="1720" /> want to be very clear on this, because it is an important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that a British question?  In my opinion it is clearly a British question.  I will take an example which is perhaps feasible, perhaps not.  If the Minister for Justice decided to ask the High Court or the Supreme Court here a question as to whether there is any constitutional method of preventing the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1923, from becoming law that would surely be a question purely for us.  I feel sure that in another place the Speaker would not allow any member to raise that question. That is why it seems to me that the Deputy has raised a question that does not concern us.  I would not have allowed him to begin except that I thought he had some other point to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would concern us vitally if there were an authoritative statement that there was no method of carrying out the Treaty by the other party to the Treaty.  There is no such statement that I have ever heard of.  That is the important point.  An authoritative statement to our Government by another Government that the other Government could not carry out the Treaty would be a matter proper for us to discuss.

      <P>Am I in order in interrogating the President on these grounds?  I most certainly have not the slightest desire to go outside what is the legitimate scope of the powers of review of this Assembly.  I certainly have no desire to indulge in what you, sir, accurately describe as the highly improper attitude of intervening in the domestic affairs of any other country.  But this is not a domestic affair, in my judgment.  It is an international question.  A certain factor has been brought in to contribute to some decision.  It may be a decision satisfactory to all, or it may be a decision seriously adverse to this State.  It is a factor that is introduced without the consent and without the counsel of the responsible Executive of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>As to that, I may say that we made a Treaty. We carried it out.  Our methods of carrying it out were for themselves, and our decision as to the method of carrying it out, and as to what we did to carry it out, was our own.  If the other party to the Treaty takes advice from whom they like, by any method they please, as to what they are to do to carry out the Treaty, that method of taking advice, and the persons from whom the advice is taken, are not matters for discussion here.  What would concern us is a decision by the other party to the Treaty not to carry it out, but no such decision has been reached. I fail to see how we can discuss the other parties' operations to come to a conclusion as to what they are to do in a problem which is theirs, namely, the carrying out of their part of the <Col N="1722" /> Treaty.  The Deputy, I am afraid, is doing something which is not only improper, from the point of view of our proceedings, and from the point of view of our international relations, but he is actually suggesting things which, speaking for the Dáil, I could not allow him to suggest at all, namely, that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is deciding something which will be binding upon us.  I could not countenance that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour as well as I can to refrain from doing those things which you so rightly suggest should not be done.  All that I am concerned with is that we shall prevent, so far as it is possible, for us to do, a tribunal functioning and giving an adverse decision which may prevent the implementing of a certain clause of the Treaty, and which decision in that respect shall be regarded as authoritative and conclusive, and something which this State must acquiesce in.</P>

There is no such tribunal except the Oireachtas.  I could not possibly allow any such discussion to continue. The President is being asked what action he proposes to take to interfere in the proceedings of a tribunal, set up for the purpose of giving the British Government information upon certain points.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say will not interfere with any case the Deputy would make either now or any other time, or any interrogations he might care to put.  The action of the British Government in submitting certain questions to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is a matter solely concerning that Government&mdash;a <Col N="1724" /> domestic arrangement affecting their own position, and one which does not seem to call for any statement from me. I have already made our attitude in this matter perfectly clear in the reply which I gave on the 6th June to a question put to me in this House:</P>
      <P>The British Government is, I understand, seeking advice from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as to the steps which they must take to fulfil their obligations under Article 12 of the Treaty in the circumstances that have arisen.  The questions which have been submitted for advice appear to arise solely out of the relations between the British Legislature and its subordinate Parliament. The desire of the British Government to obtain such advice is a matter solely concerning them, and does not appear to call for any statement from me.  So far as we are concerned, we have made it perfectly clear that we are not parties to the request for advice.</P>
      <P>Whatever the outcome of the reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council may be, it will not and cannot alter the Treaty which is binding on this and every British Government, as it is on us.  Should any difficulties arise in the way of implementing Article 12 (we are raising none), the getting over of such difficulties and the working out of the procedure to give effect to the Article is a matter for the British Government and the British Legislature.  No decision of the Judicial Committee or of any other body can deprive the British Government and the British Legislature of the power to carry out Article 12, or any other Article of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.30 p.m. to Monday, 21st July, 3 p.m.</P>

      <P>This claim was disallowed on the ground of insufficient evidence of age.  An opportunity was afforded the claimant to submit more definite or conclusive evidence than was furnished in the first instance, but as satisfactory proof was not forthcoming the claim was disallowed on the 15th April last. No birth or baptismal certificate was <Col N="1648" /> produced.  The claimant was recorded as of full age when married on the 16th February, 1885.  Affidavits by two neighbours were submitted, but no detailed reasons were given in them for the statements made, and they could not, therefore, be accepted in support of the claim.</P>
