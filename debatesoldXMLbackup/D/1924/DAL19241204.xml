      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a number of Government trawlers are now undergoing some repairs at Haulbowline; that permanent employees of the Care and Maintenance Party are working many hours overtime on these boats; whether he will instruct that this work be performed by skilled workers from Cobh and adjoining areas, many of whom have been unemployed for a long period and whose families are living on Unemployment Insurance.</P>

      <P>Six &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; trawlers lying at Haulbowline have been sold; three for a Spanish, and three for a French destination.  These vessels had to be docked and cleansed before they could be sent on their voyages, and this operation was undertaken by the existing staff at Haulbowline, the purchasers paying for the work done.</P>
      <P>The purchasers were anxious to have the work completed quickly, and a certain amount of overtime was therefore worked, amounting up to the present to about £130.</P>
      <P>If the work had been more extensive, the question of taking on extra labour would have received consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that during the past year a large number of cattle and sheep-stealing cases have occurred in the neighbourhood of Rathangan, Miltown, and Newbridge, Co.

      <P>In the area to which the Deputy refers four cases of alleged cattle-stealing and two cases of alleged sheep-stealing, embracing in all four head of cattle and two lambs, were reported to the Gárda Síochána during the year 1924.  The closest inquiry was made in each case.  One of the cattle alleged to have been stolen was found to have strayed and was returned to the owner.  In the other three cases of alleged cattle-stealing the animals have not so far been traced nor has anyone been made amenable. The cases of alleged sheep-stealing occurred during the lambing season, and upon full investigation the Gárda came to the conclusion that the disappearance of the two lambs was due to causes other than larceny, with which conclusion the respective owners agreed.  No complaints have been made to the local officers of the Gárda Síochána of any inactivity on the part of the Gárda in investigating and dealing with such reported cases.</P>

During the past year there have been 72 prosecutions against persons found cycling without lights after lighting-up time on the roads between the city of Dublin and Nass.  I am, accordingly, satisfied that the Gárda in the districts concerned are taking all possible steps to enforce the provisions of the Lights on Vehicles Act, 1907, and that it is hardly necessary for me again to draw their attention to the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the termination of the reciprocal arrangements that existed between the Saorstát Government and the British Government in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Acts; and whether he is aware of the suffering that is in consequence being put upon merchant seamen resident in the Saorstát who have been serving in British-owned vessels; if he is aware that the British Government is prepared to consider any proposal that the Saorstát Government may make; that the British Government and the Government of Northern Ireland are at present considering such an arrangement, and whether he will take up the matter with the British Government and the Government of Northern Ireland with a view to the same arrangement being made for residents of the Saorstát in accordance with powers given to him under Section 10 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that reciprocal arrangements with the British Government have been terminated for the reason that the movement of labour from the Saorstát to employment in Great Britain, where the contributions are paid, is considerable, while movement in the reverse direction is negligible.  The result under the reciprocal arrangements was that the bulk of the contributions were paid into the British Unemployment Fund, but the greater part of the benefit had to be paid out of the Saorstát Fund, and no financial adjustment would be agreed to by the British Government. It is not the absence of reciprocal arrangements that causes any suffering to merchant seamen resident in the Saorstát, as seamen so resident serving in British-owned vessels are not legally liable nor entitled to pay contributions at all.  I have always been ready to make reciprocal arrangements on a basis fair to both countries, but my proposals for that purpose have not hitherto been accepted.  The fact is that neither the British Government nor the Northern Government has shown any real disposition to consider the only kind of arrangement that would be approximately reciprocal, namely, one to provide for the country which has to pay the benefit being credited with the value of the contributions.</P>

      <P>The papers in connection with this matter are with one of the Department's Housing Inspectors who is at present in the district.

It is expected that his report will be received in the course of the week, when the question will be dealt with immediately.</P>

    <P>I think it is necessary to give some little explanation of the need for this procedure, and to apologise for troubling the Dáil with a matter which is really one of urgency, as far as the Port Board is concerned.  My apology to the Dáil is that in so far as anything could have been done by the Port Board to avoid troubling the Dáil with this matter that has been done, and the <Col N="2013" /> reason it has to come up in this way is that the Port Board, acting under their Private Act of 1898, which lays down certain procedure to be adopted in connection with the election of members of the Board, found, in the first instance, that in the Act of 1898 the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland was named as the person who was to nominate the revisor for the revision of the voters' list.  As the Dáil is aware, the position of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland has terminated.  Consequent on that, there was a delay in getting that particular matter put right, and consequent on that delay the dates which are set down in our Act for the revision of the voters' list, and subsequently for holding an election, got out of gear, with the result that the Port Board is faced with the position that the seven members who are due to retire at the beginning of 1925 cannot be co-opted, nor is there any machinery for carrying out an election unless the Dáil will recognise that this is an urgent matter, really domestic, and, I hope, a matter which will not lead to any controversy.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil will facilitate the passing of this Private Bill it will put the Port Board in the position of holding elections a little later than they would be otherwise entitled to by their own Act of Parliament.  It is purely, in the first instance, proposing putting into this Bill the Chief Justice of the Saorstát in the place of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and to make an alteration in the dates which will enable the revision to take place, and the election to be held in due course, but at a later date than is set down in the Private Act.  I ask for the assistance of the Dáil, as a whole, in this matter, to get over this little difficulty.  I must say that the Government have recognised the desirability of putting the matter right, and have in this way given assistance by giving the Government time for bringing forward the measure.  I ask the Dáil to receive this Bill for First Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The consequence of this Bill not being passed would be to put the Board in this position.  At the present time we are short of the members nominated by the Corporation of Dublin as members of the Board.  The passing of this Bill would make the three shipping members and the four trade members who retire in the beginning of January eligible to be re-elected <Col N="2014" /> or else to have somebody else elected in their places, so that the personnel of the Board would not be further reduced by these seven members to a very small number of the remaining members to carry on the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has stated that the effect of not passing this Bill, at the present in these extraordinary circumstances, would be to leave the management of the Port and Docks Board in the hands of, say, 14 members.  That number would be seven or five less than the normal membership of the Board.  I wonder would he argue that that is too small a number.  I think he will probably admit that a constituency which elects those that would be left would be of a wider character than a constituency that will elect the men who have to be elected if this Bill passes.  To acquiesce in the passing of this Bill is to ask the House to acquiesce, by implication, in a system of election by a very small and select constituency which carries out its elections very largely by proxy. We have, for instance, a representative in one of the constituencies elected by one man carrying thirteen hundred votes.  He comes down on the day of the election and says: &ldquo;Here are my votes, I hand them in.&rdquo;  These are proxy votes, not votes given to a man in the proportion of one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven, or ten, but according to the amount paid in valuation or duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole system is one that would require a great deal of examination. It is objectionable from many points of view, and for the Dáil to pass this Bill, is for the Dáil to agree with, at least, one more election under an antiquated and unsatisfactory system.  If there was going to be any calamity arising from the non-passing of this Bill, there might be some case for urgency, but if there are fourteen people still remaining to carry on the business of the Board, who have been elected by the ordinary electors, then I submit it is quite unnecessary to have this special Bill. New conditions might be made when we have more time and opportunity to consider the constitution of the Board, the method of election, and generally to <Col N="2015" /> reconsider the position of the Port and Docks Board and its membership.  I think there is need for that.  It would be a pity to acquiesce, by the passing of this Bill, in the continuance, without any promise regarding the future, without any assurance that the Docks Board is willing to revise its electorate and method of election, and I think we ought not to pass this Bill.</P>

      <P>We are not asked to pass this Bill so far as I know.  We are asked to allow it to be introduced, which is rather a different thing.  As I read the title it is a Bill for this and other purposes: &ldquo;to amend the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898,&rdquo; and I think Deputy Johnson should welcome the Bill, because it will give him an opportunity of bringing forward amendments as to the method of election. The &ldquo;other purpose&rdquo; are wide enough to cover, I think, all that.  I think Deputy Hewat was ill-advised in making the title so wide, for, as it is, it gives an opportunity for introducing a great many amendments.  I deprecate Second Reading speeches on the introduction of Bills.</P>

      <P>Yes, they might, but they never do.  I should like to ask a question of Deputy Hewat: whether the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898, was introduced as a private or a public Bill.  If it was introduced as a private Bill it should not be amended by a public Bill, and I think that is a tendency which should be watched.  I do not know whether the Port and Docks Board promoted their own Bill or whether it was a Bill brought in by the then Chief Secretary for Ireland. If it was the former, I think you, a Chinn Comhairle, should exercise your powers under the Standing Orders and send it to the Examiner of Private Bills in order to have a report.</P>

It is not giving any special powers to the Board and so far as the methods of election are concerned the Corporation representatives take in the whole city, and I suggest though there is criticism and probably always has been, as to the method of electing members to the Port and Docks Board, it does not arise really on this Bill, for all this Bill asks is to let our Act of 1898 be operative for the coming elections, in the month of January, and not to deprive us of the service of those members who are going out, if they seek re-election, or somebody else in their places.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary that I should say very much on this motion, because the matter will have to be discussed on the Vote itself.  It is within the knowledge of Deputies that there is a very acute degree of unemployment through the country.

Coming up to Christmas each year special privileges and special advantages were always given to the unemployed, that is to say, a fortnight's work was usually given to two or three hundred men out of employment.

I want to see that, as far as possible, the money will be distributed in such a way as will meet the requirements of each locality or district.  We know that hitherto, at least in some cases, the distribution of money, when left to local authorities, may often not have been equitable, and unless supervision is exercised by the Ministry it is probable that the distribution of this grant may not be equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to see that no time will be taken up in preparing schemes for dealing with the land problem that he speaks about, because when the money has been passed by the Dáil we may be met with the statement that it will take a certain amount of time to prepare schemes to deal with land problems. I think the Minister should guard against that.  The amount of <Col N="2020" /> destitution prevalent throughout the country, because of unemployment, is very acute at the present moment, and I think that the Minister ought to see that this relief work is started as soon as possible, and that it should not be held up by the preparation of schemes. I would suggest to the Minister that he should give employment in the rural districts and in the small towns, in the rural districts especially which run along the edges of the bogs where the people are actually starving because of the loss of the turf during the past season.</P>
      <P>I have had numerous letters from my constituents stating that they have lost all their crops.  The crops were destroyed and they could not save any of the turf.  Hitherto they made their living by cutting and saving the turf and then selling it.  They were not able to save the turf during the last season owing to the terrible weather that prevailed, and the result is that they are now in a state of the most utter destitution.  I think if the Minister were to allocate this money for the improvement of second-class roads in the districts that I am referring to, it would mean a great lot to the people who live in these districts.  I do not think there is any work that we could embark on that would give relief so quickly as work on the roads, and I would strongly suggest to the Minister that he should take that point into consideration.  If the money is to be spent on land problems great delay may be occasioned, because you are likely to be met by engineers who will tell you that levels must be taken here, and that if water goes into a river at a certain point the consequences will be very serious.  That kind of thing would hold up the giving of employment, and hence I suggest to the Minister the desirability of starting relief work on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking the Dáil to agree to give a Second Reading to the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1924, I feel that I should give some indication of the numbers, in so far as the numbers have anything to do with the problem of unemployment which faces us, and which it is hoped to remove partically in this way.  Deputies will remember that the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924&mdash; the first Act&mdash;set out certain benefit years.  The present period falls within the fourth benefit year.  The third benefit year established under that Act came to an end on the 29th October. In the fourth benefit year, which commenced the day afterwards&mdash;the 30th October&mdash;claims for benefits were received from 46,341 people: that is to say, 46,341 claim have been received since the opening of the fourth benefit year.  Not all of these it is expected will be allowed.  It is estimated that about 41,000 will pass the requisite tests and that benefit will be allowed, for a varying number of weeks, to 41,000 claimants.  An analysis of the claims leads the Department to believe that the amount of weeks' benefit to be enjoyed, as a result of these claims, will work out as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>11,000 will receive from 1 to 36 days' benefit.</P>
      <P>5,000 will receive from 37 to 54 days' benefit.</P>
      <P>6,000 will receive from 55 to 72 days' benefit.</P>
      <P>19,000 will receive from 73 to 96 days' benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>When will the fourth benefit year close?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 25th March next.  The fourth benefit year <Col N="2022" /> has a total of 21 weeks, starting on the 30th October, and ending on the 25th March.  The maximum amount, under the previous Act, that can be drawn in that period is sixteen weeks' benefit. From the figures I have already given it can be seen that only about 19,000 have a prospect of drawing benefit from 12 weeks to 16 weeks.  32,000 will draw 12 weeks' benefit or less. The normal rate of unemployment in the country&mdash;that is, of course, ordinary unemployment&mdash;is about seven per cent. of the insurable population. At present unemployment amounts to eighteen per cent. or twenty per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, of insurable people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That simple statement shows the extent of the problem.  Unemployment, which normally amounts to seven per cent., has increased to between eighteen and twenty per cent.&mdash;probably, the lower figure is the more accurate one.  The first portion of the Bill which has been introduced, and is at present for consideration, makes a certain proposal&mdash; that is, to revive whatever benefit may have been exhausted in the benefit year which has passed: that is, in the third benefit year.  If that is joined on to the proposals in the previous Act, in which we multiply up and revive again in that third benefit year all contributions previously exhausted, it can be seen that what we are now doing is counting the third benefit year as nonexistent, in so far as that third benefit year exhausted any claim to benefit. That period of time simply lapses, in so far as it operated to do away with the right to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have certain other figures here which will show apparent disagreement with the figures I have already given. Under the proposal of Part I. of the present Bill the net result is estimated in this way&mdash;that from 1 to 36 days' benefit will accrue to 6,000 claimants&mdash; I am giving these figures to the nearest round number&mdash;that another 6,000 will be entitled to benefit of from 37 to 54 days; 5,000 will be entitled to benefit of from 55 to 72 days, 33,000 will be entitled to benefit running from over 73 <Col N="2023" /> to 96 days.  The total, of course, there is 50,000.  The total I previously gave was only 41,000.  The difference is to be explained in this way: My first figures referred to claims actually received to date for the fourth benefit year; certain people who had exhausted all their right to benefit in the third benefit year, and who knew that and accepted the hard fact, did not make application.  Inasmuch as their contribution will be revived, 9,000 will come on in addition to the 41,000 who have already claimed.  That is the calculation. It will be seen that under the provisions of Part I. a very considerable number of unemployed insurable people will get benefit for a longer period; that is, 33,000 out of an estimated total of 50,000 will get benefit for between 73 and 96 days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to go back a little and to explain the difference between the 11,000 one-to-36 day claims actually received, and the 6,000 whose claims are likely to be admissible.  Is the explanation that in one case the claims are likely to be admissible, but that in the other case the claims have been received but are not likely to be admissible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be only a partial explanation.  The balance of the explanation would be that just as the total is swelled from 41,000 to 50,000 by people who had their right to benefit exhausted, so the proportion of days will be somewhat reversed and will be extended by people who get days added on.  They move up from one class to another.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cost, it is estimated that under the No. 1 Act, the cost of the fourth benefit year will be about £378,000.  If the proposal in the present Bill goes through, the cost will be about £550,000, the difference being £177,000.  Against that, there are payments coming into the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  The net income of the Unemployment Insurance Fund for this period is estimated at about £305,000, so that the proposal in this Bill will mean borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister <Col N="2024" /> give us an indication as to what has been the increase of income into the Unemployment Fund within, say, the last six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give those figures at the moment.  Is the Deputy referring to a statement, which he may have seen lately, of expenditure and income from which it appeared that a certain sum&mdash;£20,000&mdash; was paid into the fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I wanted to find out, if possible, whether there has been any great improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there has been&mdash;if that simple answer will satisfy the Deputy. This proposal will involve borrowing to the extent of about a quarter of a million, and the Unemployment Insurance Fund is in debt at the moment over £1,000,000. The fund is in debt to the Central Fund to the extent of about £1,000,000. I said previously, when the Minister for Finance, in introducing his Budget, said that the Central Fund had a creditor in the shape of the Unemployment Insurance Fund to the extent of £778,000, that I estimated that with only normal unemployment and full compliance, that sum could be refunded by the Unemployment Insurance Fund in about four or five years.</P>
      <P>This proposal simply means adding on.  It is alleged that, by multiplying up these sums and by giving increased benefit, you are coming dangerously near the border line where this fund is no longer on a contributory basis and no longer a real insurance.  But I think it is still on a contributory basis and that it is still an insurance proposition. The £778,000 has been increased, since the Minister for Finance spoke, to over £1,000,000.  Now, we propose to put on an additional quarter of a million.  I agree that it is getting dangerously near the point where it can be said that the contributory and insurance basis has disappeared, but I think it can be maintained, with justice, that we have not passed that point. That is the effect, in numbers and in cost, to the State, of the proposal under the Part I. of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> The third section of the Bill contains what is rather a complete departure from the principle of Unemployment Insurance.  It is proposed to put in benefit certain ex-National Army men, who had not previously drawn any benefit from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, not being entitled to any benefit by reason of the fact that before entering the service they had not been in an insurable occupation and had not complied with the minimum requirements with regard to stamps, carried on under the 1924 Act.  It is now proposed that ex-National Army men, who had not previously been in insurable occupation and who had not previously drawn any benefit, should be put in benefit, so as to entitle them to a maximum of fourteen weeks.  The benefit year we are in consists of twenty-one weeks.  A certain portion of that year has elapsed and a calculation will show that, if payment under the Bill can commence somewhere about the end of this month, National Army soldiers, who have not previously received any unemployment money, may get this money for every week from the end of the month on to the end of the fourth benefit year&mdash;about the end of March. It is felt that this proposition is a proper one although it gets away from the insurance principle.  The State has been brought to its present position through the efforts of these men&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the army men to be blamed for the State being in its present position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked the other day who was &ldquo;Minister for Sarcasm.&rdquo; The answer is now supplied. It is felt that some benefit should be given to these men, inasmuch as it has not been possible to provide for them&mdash; as it was thought it would have been&mdash; by giving them preference when relief works, such as housing undertakings and road repairs, were entered upon. It has not been found possible to provide for these men in that way, and a recognition of that fact has forced the conclusion that some provision of that sort must be made for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a peculiar circumstance in connection with the demobilised men. <Col N="2026" /> About 30,000 were demobilised.  Of these, 15,000 had previously such insurable occupation as would have entitled them to benefit under the previous Acts. Of the 15,000, at the most only 10,000 claims were registered.  If the same proportion holds good of the remaining 15,000, ten thousand may fall due for unemployment benefit under Section 3 of the Bill.  It is on that that we base our calculation.  We are estimating that an extra one thousand may fall due&mdash;that 11,000, or a little more, may apply for benefit under this provision. If they apply and get benefit over the maximum period, it is estimated that the cost will be about £135,000.  That is the effect, in cost, of the main provisions of the Bill, and that gives some idea of the numbers that have to be dealt with.  A few points were raised when I asked leave to introduce this Bill.  One was that some statement should be made with regard to the position of those resident in the Six Counties, particularly ex-Army men. Another question was in connection with the reciprocal arrangements between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Saorstát.  That question can be gone into, but I would ask the Deputies who raised the point to meet me by getting publicity for what has been done&mdash;which I personally desire&mdash;in another way.  That question can be discussed apart from this Bill.  It could be discussed on a motion or on the adjournment, and I would welcome a chance of making a statement showing the efforts that have been made and the difficulties in the way of what are termed &ldquo;reciprocal arrangements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A question was asked as to what attempt had been made and what success there had been in connection with the starting of works.  I said previously, in a debate on unemployment, that any extension of this Act would have to be looked at in conjunction with relief schemes.  The fact that the extension is now before you in this Bill means, to a certain extent, that relief schemes could not be started sufficiently early.  There are certain schemes and there has been certain provision to keep work going.  May I just refer to one or two things in Dublin, as Dublin has been mentioned, and <Col N="2027" /> as the bulk of the unemployed are in Dublin.  The figure for Dublin is about 14,700.  On a motion, one evening, the question of the Port and Docks Board's application and the possibility of securing work through the Port and Docks Board were discussed.  I cannot say that the work has yet been started, but I can definitely say that guarantees and assurances have been given to the representative of the Port and Docks Board to warrant work being at least prepared, and it is hoped that a start will be made quite soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to say, from information received, how soon that may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could apply for that information, or the Deputy could apply for it, to other people.  The question of housing was also dealt with in a question and also by a deputation, and there was a plea for a very large extension of such a scheme as the Marino scheme.  I expect that certain advertisements will appear any of these days showing that at least development of the site has been taken in hands. There are then such other things as the reconstruction of the General Post Office, which is being proceeded with, and the question of clearing the site of and rebuilding the Four Courts; also the clearing of the site at the Customs House.  These will be put in hands at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>O'Connell Street has been often referred to, and we have been urged to put pressure upon people who own destroyed property there so as to speed up rebuilding.  I feel a considerable sense of disappointment and irritation over O'Connell Street.  It has been found absolutely impossible to get any real progress made with the rebuilding of O'Connell Street.  There are a great many considerations involved, and attempts have been made to meet all the difficulties that were raised; attempts have been made to smooth the way for the owners.  I must confess failure definitely with regard to O'Connell Street.  I have been in violent collision with the O'Connell Street proposition for some months past, and I must say it does not seem to be possible to get <Col N="2028" /> work started there.  Certainly, there is not such a prospect that I could make any statement with regard to it.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made to the Government with regard to meeting distress in the winter, and a considerable number of those suggestions will be dealt with to-morrow when the £250,000 estimate is under consideration. That is intended to meet distress in the rural areas, and particularly in the congested districts; but it is not confined to the congested districts. Further than that, there were two points raised.  There was the question of fuel, which will not come in directly under the £250,000 grant which is being introduced to-morrow.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture will detail to-morrow what is being done in that regard.  One other small item, urged with great vehemence as being a considerable benefit, was that certain money should be set aside for some sort of a rough meal for school children in certain districts in the country.  At the moment search is being made to see if a certain Vote can bear the £10,000 or £12,000 that would be required for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The thing has not been worked out in a detailed way; in fact, details are rather to be avoided.  It is not desired to have anything that would add to the cost by way of supervision.  It would be much better if the thing could be done in quite a simple manner.  I would like to have the Unemployment Insurance Act&mdash;the estimated cost of it is £370,000&mdash;considered in conjunction with those other sums; the £250,000 grant, details of which will be given to-morrow; the sum of £50,000 left over from the old Vote which I had specially asked to have set aside in preparation for the winter; the sum of £10,000 or £12,000 which may be secured otherwise for the purpose of those meals for school children; and finally £100,000 to be distributed through the Local Loans Fund.  The items on which that can be expended are already well known, particularly permanent improvement to land and drainage, drainage being one of those items.  In addition to that there are other items. Fuel alone might cost some £25,000. <Col N="2029" /> The whole thing would come roughly to £800,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that there is still unexpended, unallocated, and in some cases unasked monies under the Housing Act, and under the Roads Grant. It is estimated there is at least £135,000 not yet called for under the Housing Act.  There is something approaching half-a-million in connection with roads.</P>

All these form a contribution towards the relief of distress.  There may be other points which will be brought out in the debate. I would ask Deputies to leave the question of reciprocity and reciprocal arrangements over for another occasion and leave the ground clear for discussion on this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be commended for introducing this Bill; it certainly will be welcome amongst the unemployed in the country. The Minister is to be commended all the more in what he has said with regard to works of reconstruction, because what we really want is that the Government would make a very earnest, determined effort to start works of reconstruction and, as far as possible, endeavour to relieve the drain there is upon the Unemployment Fund. The Minister spoke of large sums which have been made available for the relief of unemployment.  It is one thing to have large sums available, but it is another thing to see them expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister could give us <Col N="2030" /> some indication of what amount of the one and a-quarter millions given for road construction over twelve months ago remains unexpended at the present moment.  Could he tell us of his own knowledge, or ascertain from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, what number of public bodies used the money provided for the relief of unemployment through the means of road reconstruction, for the relief of the rates?  As far as I can recollect, when that money was being made available, and was being allocated, a circular was sent out from the Local Government Department intimating that it was desired that the councils would not reduce their normal estimate for road expenditure.</P>
    <P>I will give one case as an illustration. One county council was allocated £23,000, £2,500 of which was earmarked for the purchase of machinery, which machinery was purchased outside this country.  At the first meeting of that council, it was proposed and unanimously carried, that the estimate submitted by the county surveyor for road maintenance should be reduced by £12,000.  The estimate was reduced exactly by one-third.</P>
    <P>The arguments which were adduced by the members of the county council supporting this motion were, that even after the £12,000 was taken off the estimate, they would still have more money to be spent on the roads than they had the previous year, because they were getting £23,000 out of the grant from the Local Government Department. At a subsequent meeting this matter was taken up, and fought, with the result that the amount taken off the estimate was only £6,000.  But they did take that £6,000 off the estimate. So that in that case, instead of the money which was given by way of grants for relief of unemployment and for reconstruction of the roads being used for that purpose, it was used in reality for the relief of the rates.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say, it is one matter to say that so much money has been allocated or made available for the relief of unemployment.  It is quite another matter when you come to see how much of this has been actually expended.  I <Col N="2031" /> might also mention the amounts which have been paid in compensation, and I would like to ask the Minister here now a question on that particular point, and that is: whether the Government is prepared to come here and ask for the necessary powers to compel people who have been paid compensation for the destruction of their property to rebuild that property or else to deprive them of compensation?  That is a matter that affects practically every district in the country.  We have had houses destroyed and other buildings destroyed in all parts of this country. and we have had people paid compensation, and there is no attempt whatsoever to rebuild those houses in very many cases.  Cork and Dublin are not the only two places.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in every country town, and on that matter I would like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Finance, whether it is correct to say that in the case of these people who have not started rebuilding their premises interest at the rate of five per cent. is accumulating on the amount awarded them?  With regard to the Bill which has been introduced, I think the Minister is to be commended, though, at the same time, I do not think the Bill goes far enough.  Because there will be, as the Minister will admit, thousands of people who will not benefit at all under the Bill, people who did not benefit with, say, the exception of the ex-National Army men, under the last Act.  Such people will not benefit under this Bill.  I certainly think that the section which deals with the ex-National Army men is one that is long overdue.  It is a very pitiful spectacle to see the condition these men are in. I think it is a disgrace to the people of this country, and to the nation as a whole, to see ex-National Army men outside in the streets, and put in the position of beggars, actually outside the gates of the approach to Leinster House, collecting money in tin-cans to keep ex-National Army men from, as they themselves say, starvation.  For that reason I am glad that the Minister has introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister the <Col N="2032" /> necessity there is for forcing compliance with regard to this unemployment insurance.  I want to put it to the Minister that if compliance were enforced in the proper way in this country, it would not be necessary to borrow the £250,000 that he speaks about now.  I do not think it would.  There is not the compliance that there should be.  I should say it would not be greater than fifty or sixty per cent.  The percentage with regard to the Unemployment Insurance Act may be greater than it is in regard to National Health Insurance. Fortunately for the matter of compliance the Unemployment Insurance does not extend to the agricultural districts, like the National Health Insurance. That is a matter in which I would like to see the Minister looking for stronger powers, especially in view of the state of unemployment in this country.  The employers whose business is going on, and the workers who are lucky enough to be employed should be compelled to contribute to the Unemployment Insurance.</P>
    <P>I say lucky enough in view of the extraordinary situation, and the extreme depression in employment at present.  I, for one, would be prepared, anyway, to support the Minister in asking for fairly substantial powers in that respect.  I might say, so far as I am concerned, I welcome this Bill and I am sure it will be welcomed in the country, and it will bring relief and consolation to many hundreds of thousands of people who are in a very bad way, and who certainly have, or up to this had, a very bad outlook facing them at Christmas, with practically nothing&mdash;being cut off from the unemployment fund and everything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it might be considered my function in the Dáil to criticise such a large expenditure of money as is outlined in connection with this Bill in a non-productive way.  I am not going to take up any such position, because I recognise as well as any member of the Dáil that there is dire necessity for some measure of relief in connection with such a large number of people who are at the present moment destitute.  I also commend the Minister for tackling this thing, because <Col N="2033" /> otherwise, looked at in a narrow and parsimonious spirit, I am afraid the result would have been disastrous. On the other hand the expenditure of this large sum of money must set us all thinking as to where the position is leading us.  Dublin, I think, has been mentioned as the centre of the largest number of unemployed.  Dublin under normal conditions is a city which, in the past, has never benefited by any large prosperity, in the way of what is known in trade as boom periods.  But I think, on the other hand, Dublin has not suffered to the same extent in depressed times, from unemployment and from want of work that industrial centres have.  To-day we find that in Dublin the situation is, I should think, as far as unemployment is concerned, as bad in proportion to the number of the population as in any other part of, what I may call, the three Kingdoms.</P>
      <P>Now, there is no use in imagining that the payment of these sums in relief or even that relief works are going to be anything more than a palliative, and very temporary at that.  What we want to get at is, I think, the root of the trouble, and what is the cause of the large amount of unemployment at the present time.  Of course it may be said that trade depression is worldwide. That is so.  But when you look at the local situation, and find the amount of reconstructive work that can be gone on with, and find a disinclination on the part of anybody to expend money in this direction, with, at all events few exceptions, one must realise that the whole confidence of the investors has suffered a very severe shock, and that the only real means by which trade will be restored is in the establishment of a greater and wider spirit of confidence than at present obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade, of course, rests on confidence and confidence creates credit.  Credit to-day is strangled in the country, because amongst the general trading community the story is the difficulty that they find in getting sufficient accommodation to carry on their trade, not to speak of any extension or development. I say that the spirit of confidence has been undermined, largely, of course, by the events of the last few <Col N="2034" /> years, and I think also&mdash;and I say this without any wish to criticise Labour in any way&mdash;that that confidence has suffered from the disturbed conditions under which trade has been carried on for some time past.  If Labour, and if the unemployed would recognise that they also could contribute to the improvement in the conditions that operate, either to the detriment or to the advantage of trade, it would assist materially.  It is not sufficient for them to say that employers of the State are not looking at the position sympathetically, because in the case of the Government they are naturally unwilling to expend large sums of the taxpayers' money if it can be avoided, and the employers will not expend money and assist industry to the extent they might because of the want of confidence in the future.  It is not sufficient for the unemployed to throw all the blame on the Government, or on the employers.  It would be well for them if they would take to heart the fact that they themselves have something to do with the position we find ourselves in to-day.  It would be well if they would examine their side of the responsibility without throwing, or attempting to throw, all the responsibility on other people.  While I agree with this measure as being necessary&mdash; without going into the details which will be considered in Committee&mdash;I say again that this cannot get us very far.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the roads is good if the money is well spent.  It is an expenditure which prepares the way for the development of trade and industry. Deputy Morrissey says that the county councils have grabbed some of the money granted by the Government and cut down the road expenditure. Well, to-day is not the time to cut down the expenditure on the roads, but I think I could equally say to-day is not the time for wasteful expenditure on the roads.  This is a very large sum of money to expend on the roads, and it is to the interests of every workman, earning wages on the road, to see that he gives sufficient and good value for the money expended.  All this money which is being raised on loan has got to be paid by the country.  Every one of us have to pay our share.  I would beg <Col N="2035" /> the House in general to remember that every individual will have to contribute his quota to the repayment of that money.  There again is a very important aspect of the case.  If it is not felt by the people who are giving that money, that that money is secure and will be recoverable, in due course, that in itself is going to undermine the confidence of investors and the people generally in the continuity and the prosperity of the Government.  I have, perhaps, said more than I should on the matter, but I do feel that the time has arrived when we should examine the reasons for the necessity of this Bill at all and examine them closely and with no idea of throwing blame on other people, but with the idea of seeing how far we, collectively and individually, can try to remedy the very appalling state of affairs that one sees in existence to-day.  If we can do anything in that direction, the money that is provided will not be ill spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the rebuilding of O'Connell Street.  The House must realise that that is exactly one of the cases in point.  The sites there are only suitable for every expensive buildings which it would not pay anybody to erect unless they could look forward to a very large measure of trade in these buildings.  I know myself that in that district there is a hesitancy to undertake the obligation of building these very expensive houses at present. At the same time, I think that all these things would be got over by the growth of a greater confidence.  I think it would be amazing to find how quickly all these things and the situation generally would develop in an improved atmosphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to commend and congratulate the Minister on, might I say, the sense of humanity that prompted him to bring in this Bill.  But like Deputy Morrissey, I think he might have gone a little further.  What this Bill really does, I understand, is to place the insured contributors in the same position for the fourth benefit year as they occupied in the third benefit year.  Under those provisions, or conditions, a large number <Col N="2036" /> of decent unemployed men who are anxious for work will still be without benefit, and I do think that as a temporary expedient, or temporary measure, in this fourth benefit year, the Minister might have introduced what people are pleased to call the dole system, that he should have endeavoured to persuade the Government to pay a certain number of weeks' benefit, say a maximum of ten weeks, during the period of this very heavy winter. I think he will agree with me that thousands of men are unemployed who were in insurable occupations from 1912, when the Unemployment Insurance Act came into operation, until 1920, when the slump came.  These men became unemployed somewhere in the middle of 1920, and by reason of the operations of the first Act of this year many of them are unable to receive unemployment benefit.  I do think that the Minister will agree that that is a great hardship.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat welcomes this Bill. There is a saying in this country that some people will cut your head off and then give you a plaster.  Deputy Hewat gave the plaster first, and then started to cut off the head.  He said he welcomed the Bill, saw that there was a necessity for it, and then in an indirect way started an attack on Labour.  Now, I am one of those who believe that when a man is employed he should give the best to his employer, and that at present it ought to be the desire of every workingman to co-operate with every other interest, with a view to getting the country back to normal as quickly as possible, and I rather think that the time has arrived when we should call a spade a spade.  During the recent elections I was reading some of the speeches made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was foolish &mdash;by some of the opponents of the Government. They spoke of the unemployment that prevailed and they condemned the Government for it.  I think it is only right for people other than the Government Party, to say in this House that these people made the greatest contribution of any party of <Col N="2037" /> the State to unemployment during the past four years, and I think the workers who are supporting them are foolish not to have recognised that by now and treat them accordingly.  We all admit that the country is in a bad state economically, but still the fact of admitting that does not fill the stomachs of the unfortunate unemployed who are on the verge of starvation. As I said, I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this new Bill, which is very necessary, but I would ask him to do a little more, and that is to endeavour even to vary the Bill a little further for this benefit year to bring in men who are genuinely unemployed and seeking work, who have been insured under the Unemployment Act from 1912 to 1920, and who have not had sufficient stamps to get any benefit during the third benefit year, not to talk of the fourth benefit year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the clause which brings into benefit ex-members of the National Army, I should say that during the Second Reading of the last Bill I advocated that these men should be brought in.  I think as Deputy Morrissey said, that it was a disgrace to see men who had served their country well going round the streets of Dublin with tins collecting money in order to prevent themselves from being hungry. I am wondering how the Minister proposes to allow stamps to these people, the number of stamps he will allow, and what will be the difference between ex-members of the National Army who are insured already and those who are not insured at all.  Are the ex-members of the National Army who were in an insured occupation prior to joining the Army to stop in the same category as they were in during the third benefit year, or will all ex-members of the National Army be treated under the same head?  I also wish to say that I welcome the proposal of the Minister for Finance to move for an extra Vote for distress. Everybody agrees that it is badly needed, and I do hope that the agricultural labourers will be attended to, because really there is more unemployment in agricultural areas than people know of.  I think it is necessary that <Col N="2038" /> this Vote should be passed, and I also congratulate the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are not intimately associated with what I will call the manufacturing industry and manufacturing trades of this country are wondering how it is that out of an insurable population of about 275,000 people there should be such an enormous number on the dole.  That brings you to reflect on the whole manufacturing problem of the country, and you have to reflect as to why or wherefore so many are idle while there is work to be done.  I think that Deputy Hewat indicated the reasons pretty well, and without being antagonistic towards Labour, if I were to direct attention to the fact that wages in the Saorstát are greater than wages in any part of Northern Ireland or Great Britain, I think that that alone would indicate to a large extent why we have so many unemployed.  I will not go into that question of Labour except to mention that fact, because I know the policy of the Labour Party&mdash;and probably they are right&mdash;is to get for their men the best possible wage.  But the result from that is that industries which otherwise would be flourishing are being kept back.  The saying: &ldquo;The higher the wages, the greater the purchasing power,&rdquo; does not operate in the way that Labour people think.  Unfortunately, too much of the wages is spent in a way which does not reproduce, and while the farmers would be very glad to see high wages spent on bread, butter, beef, and such things, they see that the wages are not being spent on these articles, and that of what is being spent, the farmers get very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to grumble with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I do not object to the advancing of this £378,000; it is not the advance, but the fact that it is overloading the Fund. It is to be repaid from the Unemployment Fund whenever that Fund is able to repay it.  But would it not have been a better policy that we should ask the employers of these men and the men themselves who are employed, to contribute double towards the support of their destitute brethren? <Col N="2039" /> Ten pence a week out of £3 or £4 is a very small contribution, and I consider that the Fund would be kept infinitely more prosperous while we are in such bad straits, by asking those who are employed to contribute double the present amount.</P>
    <P>I believe the workers themselves would agree.  I wish to refer to what Deputy Morrissey said about the ratepayers filching some of this Unemployment Fund, and incidentally I want to say that that £1,000,000 which has been granted for the roads is not taxable revenue.  It is money paid by the ratepayers on two special levies under the Malicious Injuries Act&mdash;6d. for two years.  That produced something like £600,000, and the other £400,000 comes from the Motor Taxes.  What is the evidence that the ratepayers are filching this money?  A surveyor estimated a certain amount, and the county council reduced it by £12,000.  A subsequent meeting was held and it was reduced by £6,000.  I ask Deputy Morrissey if he has ever known a council where a surveyor's estimate was passed without any reduction?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say in explanation that the estimate furnished by the county surveyor this year in the place I spoke of was a similar estimate to last year, and the reason put forward by the county council for reducing it was because £23,000 had been given out of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>The cards of the men would not be stamped unless in civil life they belonged to an insurable occupation. Some people have suggested that this money should be given as a subsidy to start or develop some industry, instead of being given as a dole.  I do not know whether that could be done or not.  If it were possible, it would be a good way out of the difficulty, because the men would be doing some work for the money they get.  Other people say that unemployment benefit has a demoralising effect on the workers.  I know from experience that during the last two or three years it was an absolute necessity and that many people would be in a bad way if it were not for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that agricultural labourers should also be included in this unemployment scheme.  We all hope that it will not be long in operation, and that industries will be opened up which will relieve the existing unemployment. There are many men employed under the Government who come under the heading of agricultural labourers, and who are not entitled to unemployment benefit.  In this matter I think the Government should set a good example and that every man in Government employment should be entitled to come under the scheme.  It is very hard to see men of the agricultural class walking around the country idle because their employers, especially during the <Col N="2041" /> past year, have had quite enough to do to look after themselves.  I think I am only doing my duty in reminding Ministers that agricultural labourers should be included in this scheme, especially those who are in the employment of the Government, and that it should be made retrospective in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome the Bill.  I think the Minister deserves and will receive the congratulation of workers generally on bringing it in.  I am personally interested in Section 3, which concerns ex-service men.  It is not a compliment to those men to allow them to draw unemployment benefit.  I would like the Minister to say why it is that agricultural labourers are not entitled to any benefits under this Bill, any more than under previous Acts.  There are hundreds of married men with large families in the country who have worked all their lives with farmers, and in winter time especially there is no work for these men.</P>
      <P>For the past two or three years probably they have not worked more than four or five months in the year.  That is not really the fault of the farmers. There is no market for agricultural produce, and the farmers say they cannot afford to pay the wages, although agricultural wages have been reduced.  The children of the agricultural labourer are of as much value to the State as any other children and should be looked after.  I do not see why the labourers who toil on the land should be denied the same privileges and benefits as those who work in factories.  We are told that 75 per cent. of the nation's wealth comes from the land.  Yet, we cannot see our way through the means of any Act to try and keep the wolf from the door of those people who work on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, before the Committee Stage, to have an amendment inserted, so that agricultural labourers will be entitled to some benefits to tide them over the hard time we are passing through.  I can assure the Minister and the Dáil that they are at present in a most lamentable condition. <Col N="2042" /> Their children are hungry and badly clad.  If they are to be looked upon as of any use to the State their welfare should appeal to the Minister as much as those who are engaged in less useful work.  I would also like that some of this money would be utilised in developing industries.  In towns there are schemes that could be brought forward that would prove very beneficial.  I know that there is a Housing Act, but people cannot be got to take advantage of that.  In the rural districts where there are thousands of acres of turbary, I think they could be utilised and that any money spent on them would repay the outlay.  I know that a gentleman came to this country and started a peat factory.  He also made tar, which was used on the roads of Westmeath.  Employment was given in that factory in Offaly to two or three hundred people. At the time, unfortunately, certain people were so anxious to destroy the nation that they burned the factory.</P>
    <P>I believe that if money was again invested in developing the turbary lands and peat works, it would be the means of giving a good deal of employment. The majority of the workers do not want money for nothing.  They are anxious for employment at a decent wage.  A pound or 15/- weekly is very little on which to support a family.  I believe that a man who gets £1 a week from the Labour Exchange would prefer to work if he could earn £2.  Accordingly I hope that the Minister will consider the question of including the agricultural labourer in this Bill.  I would like Deputy Wilson to know that the £378,000 does not come altogether from the farmers' pockets.  If Deputy Wilson is anxious that the contribution the workers pay should be doubled, I wonder will he advocate the insurance of agricultural labourers?  Is he prepared to advise the people who sent him to the Dáil to pay 1/10 weekly for each employee so that they may be entitled to the benefits of the Bill?  If he does, he will be doing a patriotic act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I desire cordially to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill. At the same time, I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy <Col N="2043" /> Lyons' advocacy of the cause of the agricultural labourer.  It appears to me that, when legislation of any particular kind for the relief of unemployment is brought forward and passed in the Dáil, the agricultural labourer is always overlooked.  The agricultural labourer appears to be unworthy of any Governmental consideration.  There may be a good deal of talk about hardships and sufferings in the cities and urban areas, and undoubtedly hardships do exist, but we scarcely ever find relief being provided for those who are suffering in the rural districts.  Even Deputy Wilson will admit that the agricultural labourer is suffering as much from unemployment as workers who are in insured occupations.  I hope the Minister will see his way to insert some clause in the Bill that will meet the requirements of unemployed agricultural workers.  Even if it was only temporary relief it would meet the destitution that exists amongst that class, especially now at the approach of Christmas.  The welfare of the agricultural worker should, I think, be of as much concern to the Ministry as that of any other class of worker.  That has not been so up to the present.</P>
      <P>Before this Bill passes, I hope the Minister will place the agricultural worker in the same position as he is placing ex-National Army men who were not previously employed in insured occupations.  At the same time, I would like to say that I appreciate the Minister's attempt to meet the serious situation that exists, by placing demobilised Army men who are unemployed in a position to benefit by the Bill.  I am glad the Minister has thought it well to provide benefits for men who gave such noble and valuable services to the country.  While appreciating that, there is nothing in my appreciation that makes me believe that the system of unemployment benefit, or the dole as it has been referred to in the Dáil, is the very best thing possible for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believed that the Government would seriously consider the well-being of the country, that they would, even during the life of the present Dáil, have <Col N="2044" /> considered seriously some means of developing the industrial resources of the country.  There have been no attempts in that direction.  Say, for instance, in agriculture, if the Ministry seriously considered the development of that great industry they should surely have given consideration far graver than that which they have given to the development of the flax industry. I asked a question the other day of the Minister for Agriculture, and as a result of the fact that, as I took it, he had to acquaint the Minister for Finance, he could not answer it with the usual notice.  The reply to the question was put back for four days, and when he did reply, he did not reply to the question as put down.  He dealt with the scutching of flax, but he made no reference in his reply to the weaving or spinning industry in so far as the flax industry is concerned, and it showed me how little care has been given to this industry, particularly as the climate of the Saorstát is most suitable for that industry, and if it were developed and more manufacturing mills were opened, more employment would be the result. There would be employment for every man who is unemployed, to a very large extent, unless his hands, according to his own way of thinking, were too fine to be engaged on such rough work. That is one industry that must be developed and there is every room for its development.</P>
    <P>Only to-day I have been told that owing to the fact that there is only one mill manufacturing the product of flax in the Saorstát&mdash;I refer to the mill in Cork&mdash;the flax growers have to find a market for their product in Northern Ireland.  I think that that is a serious situation, and if the Government would seek out some means whereby to develop the industry here, and give the people who are prepared to grow flax a market for it, there would be no necessity for transferring the flax produced here to Northern Ireland for manufacture.  There are many other things which the Government should attempt to do.  They should attempt, for instance, to see that Irish building materials are used within the Saorstát for reconstruction and building purposes, <Col N="2045" /> instead of allowing the foreigner to have first preference over the home producer.  I put up a case to the Ministry of Finance some time ago about a quarry out of which building material has been got for a great number of years, and while the reply of the Minister did not say that he was not prepared to give it sympathetic consideration, some time has passed, and nothing definite or semi-definite has since been done in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I am.  I am touching on matters relating to the relief of unemployment.  I say that for everything in the nature of an industry in this country there should be some Ministerial concern, so that by its development the large number of unemployed could be put into some constructive occupation.  We on the Labour Benches do not, and never did, stand for the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the workers who are unemployed to-day would prefer to be working and doing some constructive work instead of having to go to the Labour Exchanges and draw the dole. As the position stands, however, they cannot help it, and they have to get there to get some little means of subsistence. I am not as enthusiastic as some Deputies are for this Bill.  I do not believe that this Bill is going to be of very great good in any direction of relieving unemployment.  I do not believe that the attempt of the Minister to relieve unemployment will have any great effect.  Take the sum of money mentioned.  What does it mean?  I do not believe that it means to the mass of the unemployed anything like 30/- each.  It does not.  Then we have men who are out of employment for practically six to seven months, the men who have been mentioned by Deputy Lyons, like the agricultural workers for whom no provision is made and who cannot get home help.  The Minister for Local Government comes in there, for if a man is able-bodied he cannot get home help, and, if the board of <Col N="2046" /> health gives it, it is liable to surcharge, and that surcharge would be forced on the Minister for Local Government by the representatives of the ratepaying community who, in this Dáil, we are led to believe, consist of nobody outside the farmers.  Serious consideration must be given to this question of tackling unemployment in agricultural areas.</P>
    <P>The road grant and similar measures are not of much use in relieving distress. There is a stretch of road, say, in one area passing from Dublin to a point in another county.  Here employment is given to probably two hundred to three hundred men.  We have a stretch of country extending for about eighteen miles right and left where there is no relief given, and where the unfortunate workers must remain in starvation.  I do not think that that is a good system, and I do not think that that is a proper way of dealing with the problem.  It has been suggested by some Deputy here that the Minister should consider the advisability of giving grants for the reconstruction or repair of the second and third class roads. I think, if the Ministry believe in tackling the situation as they find it, that that is one of the things they must first do, that is, to give immediate relief. While, however, they are doing that, they should be considering some scheme that will put an end to unemployment instead of perpetuating it. They should develop the industrial resources of the country so as to put every man willing to work in a constructive occupation in order that he may by his services develop the country to that standard to which it should be developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot agree with the other Deputies in showering congratulations on the Minister over this Bill.  It falls short of my expectations. We have about 90,000 unemployed. The Minister has introduced a Bill to give relief to about fifty thousand, of whom eleven thousand, he states, may receive one day's pay.  No provision is made for about forty thousand of the rural workers who are unemployed.  I realise that the <Col N="2047" /> Minister may have had a difficult job in convincing the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce in the Finance Department to agree to even this measure, because the Finance Department is controlled by the Chamber of Commerce in Dublin.  This Bill is framed to give those who may be fortunate enough to have stamps to credit 15s. a week.  I hold, and in this I disagree with other Labour Deputies, that at least 60s. a week should be given to every unemployed man who is willing to work, and who cannot secure work, and 5s. for every child under sixteen years of age.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat and, I think, a Labour Deputy, suggested that Labour should give of its best.  We have no proof that Labour has not always given of its best. Why should everything be expected of the worker?  Do the employers give of their best?  Have the Government made any effort to stop the profiteering that is going on wholesale throughout the country?  No, because on the Government Benches there are large shopkeepers, publicans and others, with the result that the Government will not agree to the profiteering scandal being stopped.  Then we have Deputy Hewat making the suggestion that the workers and the unemployed should contribute their share.  They have contributed their share; but up to the present we have had no share contributed to the welfare of the State or the unemployed from the employers' side.  I suggested to the Minister last week that I would take certain action here in regard to other Bills if a satisfactory measure was not introduced for the relief of the unemployed.  To my mind, this Bill does not solve the unemployment problem, no matter what Deputies may state to the contrary.  If this is the only remedy the Government have, I say to the workers and to the unemployed: &ldquo;Our place is elsewhere, and not in the Dáil.&rdquo;  Other measures will have to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious crisis, and there is no use in deceiving the unemployed and the workers by telling them that we will be able to secure certain relief. When schemes, no matter how small, are put up to the different Departments, <Col N="2048" /> they are condemned, and refused sanction by the Finance Department. I agree with other Deputies who have appealed for an extension of this Bill to the rural workers.  I suggest to the Minister that the Bill is bad, and I ask him to improve it a little, at least so as to extend its benefit to the rural worker who is unemployed owing to the bad harvest and other things, until relief schemes can be started.  It is not too much to ask that.  These unemployed rural workers are unable to get the dole, and they are refused home help.  What will become of them?  Can Deputies who represent rural areas be expected to mislead them by promising that we are going to secure redress of their grievances, when we are unable to do so?</P>
    <P>I do not agree with others on the Labour Benches who think that we can congratulate the Minister on this Bill. I recognise that he has had a difficult job in persuading the Government, or their representatives, to agree to this. But unless some protest is made, or some action taken, they will not realise how serious this problem is.  I say that we would be traitors to go back to the rural areas where there are unemployed, hungry men appealing for assistance, and promise them that this Bill is going to give them relief. I will not do it, and probably I will have others on these Benches who will take a certain course here to try and convert members on the Government Benches who fail to realise their responsibilities. We tell the Minister that this measure will not solve the problem, and something will have to be done other than offering 15/- a week to those who may be fortunate enough to have sufficient stamps, while no provision is made for the rural workers or the unfortunate man who is in the position of being unemployed through no fault of his own, and has no stamps to get anything. I could not agree to accept this Bill, or to congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that Deputy Everett is nearer to my view in regard to the reception that should be given to this Bill than some of the other speakers.  Perhaps we should commiserate <Col N="2049" /> with the Minister who finds himself in a position to be obliged to introduce this kind of Bill, rather than to congratulate him upon having done it.  I was not enthusiastic, as you will remember, over the last Bill.  I realised that it was better than nothing towards relieving some of the hardships, but by no means did it meet the requirements, and I cannot be any more enthusiastic about this Bill, inasmuch as it only pretends to place the unemployed persons, outside ex-service men, in the position they were at the beginning of the last benefit year.</P>
      <P>I am afraid it is a case of &ldquo;To them that hath, much shall be given; to them that hath, not, shall be taken away even that which they hath.&rdquo;  We are still dealing only with persons who have been fortunate enough to be insured. While it is important that those people should be relieved from starvation, and even though we may save 50,000 men and their families by the operations of this Bill, there are the others&mdash;I do not know how many thousands&mdash;who have come into manhood since the year 1920, and who are not going to benefit a farthing by the operation of this Bill. They have been without assistance, and they will continue to be without assistance. That is an effect that will be detrimental, I think, to the general social stability in more ways than one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young men who have come into insurable age since 1920 and cannot get employment, who can only live upon what they beg, borrow or steal, are much more likely to steal them to beg or to borrow, and the effect of that choice being thrust upon men must be a very evil one on the State.  The Minister has insisted, both in the last Bill and this, that he wants to retain the principle of insurance.  I, too, would like to have that principle maintained if we were facing a situation which could be covered by insurance.  The whole insurance system contemplates a normal risk or something not very much removed from normality.  That is not going to be covered by insurance for a long time.  The Minister, notwithstanding his desire to remain within the bounds of the insurance system, has been obliged to depart from that system as he confesses in respect to the <Col N="2050" /> ex-soldiers, and, notwithstanding the fact that ex-army men may not have been insured, he is bringing them into insurance.  I welcome that.  I think it is essential and necessary.</P>
    <P>I think it is bad that any body of men, either 50,000 or 10,000, should be left in the position of having neither insurance nor employment; but I am going to maintain, as I have done frequently, that if that is true in respect of the ex-army man it is also true of the man who is not in the army. I am not prepared to say that the ex-army man, notwithstanding the services he rendered to the State and the Army, is entitled to privileges which cannot be considered in relation to the civilian who is willing to serve the State, though not in the Army, and who did serve the State in many cases.  It cannot be taken as any slur or reflection upon the men who joined the Army when we remind Deputies that, at least, they were clothed, fed and paid while they were in the service of the Army, while many other men in the same position prior to their recruitment, but not in the Army for one reason or another, had not the advantage of that payment or remuneration during that same period.  These people are worse off by the fact that they had not that period of service in the Army, and, therefore, were still further dependent upon charity or beggary, or some other kind of extraneous sustenance.</P>
    <P>I urge upon the Minister that, valuable as this increase in benefit will be to those who are lucky enough to obtain it, it is not going to assist the thousands of men and women who were not hitherto insured, and that it is as great a crime against the individual soul to allow a person to die of starvation whether he was insured or was not insured, or whether he was in the Army or was not in the Army.  People talk about the credit of the State and about the destruction of the national credit. It is a much greater discredit to the national character to allow large numbers of people to go hungry and to die of starvation.  That should be the credit that we should endeavour at least to sustain, that no man, woman or child in this country shall be allowed to go hungry if we can prevent and provide <Col N="2051" /> against it, and no man, woman or child should be allowed to live in luxury while there are others going hungry and dying.  In that way I say that this Bill falls far short of the requirements. It is going to assist those who have been lucky enough hitherto to be insured; it is going to put men and women in the position they were in at the beginning of last benefit year, but it fails to touch the thousands who were not in that fortunate position, and, as far as they are concerned, it is not adding one meal to their table.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat, with some support, I think, from the benches on my right, was obliged to refer to one factor as the cause of the general state of industry and unemployment in the country. He talked of the lack of confidence and said employers would not invest their money because they had no confidence. No confidence in what?  No confidence in the stability of industry, no confidence that the industry in which they would invest their money would return to them a normal rate of profit.  I will retort and say that the workmen have no confidence in the employers' ability to conduct the operations of industry in such a way as to ensure that the people will be provided with the things they need, to insure that the workman willing to work will be employed.  Workmen have a lack of confidence in the ability and capacity of the employing classes in this country to conduct industry in such a way as to provide for the needs of the people of this country. They will not do that unless they can see the normal rate of profit ahead of them.</P>
    <P>This question of confidence has two edges, and I maintain, as I have done, and notwithstanding Deputy Good's reference the other day to the same question, that when you can ensure confidence among workingmen that employment will be stable and guaranteed, then you can begin to talk about output and loyalty; when you can give confidence to the workingmen you may then be able to have some confidence amongst the investing public.  I think I asked Deputies on that occasion, by an interjection which was not picked up, or was not understood, whether <Col N="2052" /> there had been any promise given by the investing public that they were willing to accept a reduction in the normal rate of interest on, say, the National Loan.  I got no satisfaction, and I have not seen any evidence of any general desire on the part of the investing public, to re-inspire confidence in the country's welfare by offering to invest their money at a lower rate of interest than is current.  If that were obvious, if it were seen that the investing public were prepared to do that, and to show their goodwill to the country, and to have confidence in its future to that extent, then we might begin to look up, and challenge the workmen of the country to do this and that and the other to satisfy the requirements of Deputy Hewat and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I think a very little calculation would show that a reduction of one per cent. in the rate of interest demanded by the investing public would go very much further in reduction of prices and possibly towards profitable investment in industry than an equal <i>pro rata</i> reduction in the rate of wages.  I ask Deputies to turn that over in their minds, and to see whether that promise on the part of the investing public, capitalists small or great, is made, that they would be prepared to accept one or two per cent. less than the normal in the rate of interest on their investments; when we see that, then we can begin to talk about confidence in the future prosperity of the country.  It is a very ominous and a very terrible fact to be faced with, the figures the Minister gave us, that nearly one-fifth of the total number in insurable persons in the country are, and have been for twelve months, perhaps longer&mdash;I do not know how long more, probably for two years and a half&mdash;one-fifth of the insurable persons, wage-earners in the country had been unemployed.  To wait for the developments of trade, as the normal process of absorbing these people, is, I am afraid, to rely upon what is unreliable.</P>
    <P>We see, every week that passes, that political changes have brought about economic changes, have brought about readjustment of economic conditions, and are likely to bring greater and <Col N="2053" /> more frequent readjustments.  That will become more obvious as time goes on.  I agree with the diagnosis expressed several times in the House, and outside, by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Justice, that the economic balance in the country is awry, that there are too many persons, too great a proportion of the population engaged in distribution and transportation, too few engaged in production, too many engaged in professions and unproductive or only indirectly productive occupations.  I do not believe that until we are prepared to face the new situation frankly and boldly and deal with it directly, that we can cure the abnormal condition wholly.  I think we will never get down to the seven per cent. that is called normal until we have radically changed our economic methods; that we shall have directly to encourage productivity rather than distribution and transportation, and that we shall have to reduce the number of people engaged in the larger cities, the capital, and others, purely in shop-keeping and merchanting and exchange of goods.</P>
    <P>While we are content with that aspect, and continuing that process of importation and exportation in the way we have been habituated to, we are really not going to remedy this terrible evil.  I believe, until the Government is prepared to be very bold in this matter, to undertake direct works of production, either by their own direct employment of labour, or by support of indirect employment of labour on directly productive works, that we are not going to get even near the solution of this problem or bring down the number of unemployed to what was considered normal before the war.  The proposals to assist a little here and there, development of schemes at the Docks, Marino and other building sites, and so on, clearance of sites, and all little schemes of that kind, helpful as they are, are only being pursued in the hope that within a few months we shall be engaged in some big scheme of production, or in big schemes, that may indirectly and at second-hand, help production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> I hope the Minister will be justified in his optimism, but I think he will find that when the fourth benefit year is drawing to a close, he will want to make another bite at this cherry, and have to bring in another Unemployment Insurance Act, and that he will be forced to do what he ought to do now, that is, to take into benefit all people insured or not who prove their willingness to accept employment when it is offered and who prove to be genuinely unemployed workmen and workwomen.</P>
    <P>I want to add a little to that remark regarding workwomen.  The problem of unemployment amongst women is very serious.  The winter season is going to affect them perhaps even to a greater degree than it affects men. The number of women who will not have insurable interests in those unemployment insurance schemes, who will not come into benefit, or whose benefit will be very light, is, I am advised, very considerable.  I say, in regard to them, that we ought to bring them into the same category and treat them the same way as men in a similar position and as the Minister proposes to do in respect of those men who have served in the National Army.  Once he has given away the principle in regard to the bringing into benefit of ex-soldiers who have not been insured, there is no logical reason, and there should be no financial reason, why the same principle should not be applied to all other persons in a similar position.</P>

      <P>By some inverse process of reasoning, I find myself somewhat in agreement with Deputy Johnson in regard to his opposition to this Bill.  But that does not imply agreement as to its details or worth.  My agreement is more or less on the fundamental principle of discord, the agreement of irreconcilable quantities against a measure of common antipathy.  I cannot join in the chorus of congratulations extended on the advent of this Bill.  This measure which we are discussing proposes to continue and give certain advances to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and Deputies, availing themselves of this, have departed more or less from the mere text of the measure and have <Col N="2055" /> made speeches on the whole question of economics and employment.</P>
      <P>I suppose under the motion that is permissible, for it seems to me that in dealing with this question of unemployment we are gradually falling into a state of chronic helplessness.  Six years ago, I think, this practice first saw the light in this country.  Then, for the first time, as far as I am aware, in history, men received pay during the season of unemployment and idleness. It is true that relief measures were given at other periods, but I am not aware that men received money standing by the walls.  They had to work or give certain service for this money.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this question, it seems to me that the State cannot go on indefinitely on the present system, and that there has got to be a radical departure.  The State is eating up its small reserve of capital and is getting no useful return. All we are maintaining is the <i>status quo.</i> There is no advance.  There is positively a decline, and we are becoming less and less able to bear the burden of the dole.  Yet alternatives have been broached.  The question of security has been largely dealt with.  Business people have been told by the Deputies on the left that they ought to launch out and show some initiative and enterprise and that they should not be so reluctant to part with money to start productive work.  It is a question of confidence.  What is confidence?  Deputy Johnson said that they objected to put by this money because they could not get a suitable return&mdash;that the investment would not give a dividend. Business people cannot be altruists.  When they sink capital in any concern, it must at least give them some return.  I think the Labour Deputies are beating the air and doing themselves a positive disservice in protesting against a legitimate return for capital.</P>

Neither one nor the other have we got in the country now.</P>

      <P>The State necessarily must contribute out of its limited resources, but I see no reason why part of the funds created by those who are in insurable occupations should not be given to help to provide constructive work.  I see nothing radically wrong in it.  I see nothing immoral in the question of contribution by the Unemployment Fund towards constructive work.  Would it not be better and more self-respecting for the worker when he loses his post if he could get any kind of work, drainage work, road repairing, or the hundred and one things that are always open and for which there is ever a demand?  Would it not be better that he should go on that work for so many days a week and draw the sum that is given to him than stand as he does, idly, at present?  I maintain it would be much more self-respecting and would enhance the worker's character rather than injure it, as does the present demoralising system.</P>

I admit the scheme has its limitations. You will find men physically incapable of working on the roads.  I would still continue the process of paying those men the dole, but where men are physically fit, it would be better policy to set them a task and then allot them the sum that is given them under the present arrangements.  The contention was put forward here that not alone was this measure inadequate, but <Col N="2058" /> that there should be a radical extension of the principle to agricultural workers.  If I were to go very closely into it&mdash;and a long memory is oftener a curse than a blessing&mdash;I could tell of incidents which happened when this unemployment system first came into being.  I could tell of how agriculture was neglected and how all farming operations were suspended while this money was going.</P>

      <P>I am not. The very large question underlying the Bill has been dealt with, but none of the Deputies who have spoken has confined himself to a technical discussion of the Bill.  The larger and higher principles were rather dealt with.  It is also suggested that certain schemes of industrial effort should be embarked upon.  After all, that is a question of finding money and getting public security.  Somehow or other, it seems to me in connection with these matters that what we are suffering from in this country is dole and dope.  On the one hand, we have the dole and, on the other hand, we have the dope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can get industrial prosperity by hard work and hard work alone.  And that work must be applied in the true spirit of industrial economy.  Deputy Everett suggested, for instance, that men should get 65/- per week while out of employment.  He also suggested that the children should be paid 5/- per week until they reached the age of sixteen and, inferentially, qualify for the 65/- per week.  Might I ask how long the country could afford to carry on at that rate?  The country is hard pushed to pay 15/- a week, or whatever the sum is at the moment, to men out of work.  To multiply that sum by four, and, in addition, to give bounties for children is altogether out of the question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson, taking up the thread of Deputy Everett's discourse, said that no woman or child should be permitted to live in luxury while others are dying.  After all, is not that preaching class war?  Surely, the Labour Deputies at this period of the day have learned that the more intense the class-war the greater is their suffering and the greater is their ruin.  That is the lesson of bitter experience, and I am surprised that they have not learned it. It seems to me that the spirit of initiative and enterprise has been largely extinguished in this country by that kind of talk.  I would ask Deputies, and especially the Labour Deputies, to realise that the greater the unrest the greater must be their hardship and the greater their suffering.  I ask them to take up a more conciliatory attitude. While I appreciate the fact that those Deputies express themselves desirous of substituting useful constructive work for the dole, I would ask them to realise that no industry can pay greater wages than the profit which it earns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Dáil for pursuing this subject further. But some of the remarks that fell from the Deputy who has just sat down induced me to do so.  Most of us who are conversant with the Deputy's speeches since he came to the House, are inclined <Col N="2060" /> to look to them for some amusement. But the mournful wail he sends up here from time to time about the dole is getting tiresome.  His speeches in connection with the dole have already been repudiated from these benches. The Unemployment Insurance Act is one that is supposed to give men in insured occupations benefit for the contributions they have paid.  If the Unemployment Insurance Fund is bankrupt to-day, it is not the fault of workers who paid their contributions and who are now unemployed.</P>
      <P>The general trend of the speech so far as I could gather was, that he represented the unemployed workers of this country at the present time as loungers who are not anxious or willing to work, as absolute shirkers.  I repudiate that statement.  We on these Benches are very much inclined for some time past to take very little notice of any statement that this Deputy makes, but at all events we want to repudiate the statement made here tonight. He has referred to the demoralisation that was created in this country as a result of the operations of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I agree with him, and I have some knowledge of certain demoralisation which was caused as a result of that.  I come from a district in West Cork where some people drew unemployment insurance, and it was found that about 70 per cent. of them were farmers' sons. The result was that 30 or 40 of them were prosecuted.  Fortunately for themselves, but unfortunately for the people who ought to be receiving the benefits of the Unemployment Insurance Act, they were not sent to prison. They were fined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Connor Hogan would agree that they could come under the category of loungers, that he so glibly trotted out with regard to the workers a few moments ago.  He has said, as far as I can gather, that constructive work was necessary instead of unemployment insurance.  I agree if constructive work was available.  But in the very same breath he said that the Ministry, in their present financial position, were not in a position to offer a solution in the shape of constructive <Col N="2061" /> work.  Then if they were not, there is only one alternative, and that is to give temporary assistance through the Unemployment Insurance Act as the Minister indicated.  Again, as the Minister indicated here when he spoke a few weeks ago, if the Unemployment Insurance Fund is bankrupt at present, that is no reason why that fund should not right itself, if work is available, and we are all hoping it will be available in a very short time.  Deputy Connor Hogan emphasised very much the doleful story of the dole statement, about which we have heard so much in the Dáil.  I wonder when the proposal of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was introduced in regard to relieving the farmers in the matter of the rates, did the Deputy consider it a dole?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene for a moment?  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture did not relieve the farmers of the rates.  He gave them a loan.  That is a very different thing.</P>

      <P>But he gave them the sort of assistance that we are asking should be given in this Bill. Would he consider that a loan given to farmers in the shape of a grant for the purchase of seed potatoes a dole? Would he call the applications which members of his Party and other Parties in the Dáil are making on the Minister at present for the withholding of proceedings in connection with arrears of rent a dole or temporary assistance? This statement about the dole is about the most absolute piffle and is a result of the very same feelings that go to make the class war that Deputy Connor Hogan is denouncing.  As far as we are concerned, I believe that the Minister, from our experience of him, is out to do the best in this matter.  I believe that he is looking at this problem as a Minister in his position ought to look at it, and I trust he will not be influenced by the silly vapourings of men like Deputy Connor Hogan.</P>

      <P>Speakers, in the course of this debate, took up a double line.  They wandered as far as their speeches were concerned, very much <Col N="2062" /> outside the text of the Unemployment Insurance Act or outside of anything I had said in introducing this Bill.  At the same time, they very deliberately and very completely closed their eyes to some of the statements I have made. I am told, for instance, that people will be left without benefit, and that there are people for whom starvation may be in store.  That type of statement is founded on the fact that certain people who may receive benefit from this will receive it for a very limited number of weeks.  That would be so if the only possible monies that might go to the relief of unemployment in this country came through the channel of unemployment insurance.  But I have already indicated other monies.  The sum of money here is about £70,000.  I indicated sums of money almost up to £900,000, ready for distribution, or about to be asked for.  I think that when all these things are taken together there cannot be any great allegation that there is any failure to deal with this very urgent problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds would not be called upon.  But the other money we are supplying would be.  You can argue on both sides, you can say you have unemployment money to the extent of £370,000; you have so many people unemployed; the money will not go round them and some will starve. Then, on the other side, you have so much for works, so many unemployed, and so much a week in wages.  That money will not go round, and again you can say some people will starve. If you work the matter out in that way you will get one side of the picture. You will have a completely logical conclusion if you take that view only on one side of the picture.  But if you add <Col N="2063" /> both sides together, put all these moneys I have spoken of together, and add up the total of your unemployed agricultural labourers and others, then, I think, there will be money enough to go round.</P>
      <P>The agricultural labourer has been referred to here by several Deputies.  The £250,000 which is to be asked for tomorrow will go to the agricultural labourers in great part, and the roads money has already gone to agricultural labourers in great part, so that they are not entirely unprovided for, even though agricultural labourers who are not ex-National Army men do not come within the provisions of the Bill we are actually discussing.  There was one further point urged with regard to these agricultural labourers.  People do not seem to understand that this is an employment insurance Bill which is being amended; there is an Unemployment Insurance Act being amended by this Bill.  Agricultural labourers never were insured against unemployment. If Deputy Hall were here he would presumably ask why not.  I could refer him to Deputy Wilson and his colleagues. Deputy Wilson made the suggestion here to-day that instead of burdening the Insurance Fund I should ask the employers and those employees who are lucky enough to be in work at the time to pay extra.  Now, let us apply that to the farmers.  Will they pay even the ordinary amount necessary to create an unemployment fund for the agricultural labourers?  And, seeing that unemployment is abnormal amongst agricultural labourers at the moment, will they pay such double or treble normal payment as may be necessary to enable the benefit to be paid to agricultural labourers at the moment? Will Deputy Wilson, on the part of the Farmers' Party, approve with regard to agricultural labourers the principle he wants put in force for the employers in industrial occupations?</P>

      <P>I would say the class of people to whom the Deputy a moment ago referred as being kept by the farmers.  These are agricultural labourers to whom I refer.  That is the position with regard to agricultural unemployed; there has been no fund created for them.  That there is no fund is due to the fact that agricultural employers are not willing to subscribe their portion to create a suitable fund for agricultural unemployed labourers.</P>

      <P>When they are prepared to do that, the agricultural labourers' problem will be solved.  At present it is partly solved in this way by the provision of £250,000, by the road grant and other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> It is not fair, in discussing this Bill, to criticise it, because it does not do what it never intended to do.  It is not fair to take up such a line of argument as saying: &ldquo;Why is not something put down, and why are you so callous as to leave out the agricultural labourer?&rdquo; and at the same time close your eyes to the fact that provision is being made for them by a relief vote given definitely for their own particular relief. This item, as regards agricultural labourers, I desire to insist upon, because it runs through the speeches of many Deputies.  Deputy Morrissey talked about enforcing compliance.  It is quite true to say, and assert, that the borrowings would be much less if there were full compliance with the terms of the Act.  I would ask Deputy Morrissey to do his best to ensure compliance in this way: Quite a number of employees are ready to allow the employer to escape making his contribution to the Fund.  When they allow the employer to escape, they themselves escape certain deductions being made. If employees would complain in every instance in which they know that there is not compliance, we could very easily secure full compliance with the Act, and undoubtedly the Fund would benefit greatly and there would not be any great need.  We could possibly reduce the borrowing by thirty per cent., or even by a great amount.  The matter of compensation for destroyed buildings, about which Deputy Morrissey asked one question as to whether interest was accumulating for the benefit of those who had got awards, is also one upon which I would like to touch. There a distinction must be made. Awards for property destroyed prior to the Truce, awards made by the British Government for burnings by the Auxiliaries and the Black-and-Tans, do, I understand, bear interest.  That interest accrues for the benefit of the person who got the award; but in no other case does any interest accrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were the cases I was referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In those cases it is unfortunate that we have no control. That applies to the great portion of the burnings in Cork.  Over that money <Col N="2066" /> we have absolutely no control.  Whatever pressure we could put on the owners of the O'Connell Street property, we can only put very much less pressure on the owners of the destroyed property in Cork.  Deputy Corish raised a point which I want to stress, as it may be misunderstood.  That is the question of the difference between ex-National Army men who were in insurable occupations and those who had not been in insurable occupations. This new provision in the Act refers only to those who had not been in insurable occupations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may put a hypothetical case to the effect that an ex-soldier who had been in an insurable occupation may, under the present Bill, find himself with only six weeks' contributions revived, while a man who was never in an insurable occupation could draw benefit for the whole fourteen weeks. That will be the case, but it is not a complete statement.  The man who finds that now he has only six weeks' benefit revived will, of course, have had a previous six weeks' benefit, and some number of weeks' benefit in years previous to that, whereas, the non-insurable ex-soldier only now for the first time gets all his benefit heaped together.</P>

      <P>A man working will get full benefit for any contributions paid as a result of his work; he will get the revived contributions. He is not prejudiced, and nothing is deducted.  I cannot respond to the contention made by Deputy Everett that I ought to fight a fierce battle, or that I had not been able to fight a successful enough battle, with the Chamber of Commerce people who controlled the officials in the Finance Department.  If I knew those people, <Col N="2067" /> I might engage in violent conflict with them; but it is very hard to fight invisible folk.</P>

I hope I am not misrepresenting him.  I do not see any line in the Bill which takes away anything from anybody. There is no deduction made from anybody.

      <P>The Deputy went on to refer to the case of ex-Army men, and as much as insists that I had departed from insurance.  There was no logical reason, or financial reason, why that should not be further departed from.  His argument, in other words, was why uncovenanted benefit should not be given to all and sundry.  There is a logical reason.  These men have to be looked upon as people who were prevented from going into insurable occupations by reason of the fact that they were serving their country.  That is a very exceptional case.  Because it is an exceptional case, exceptional treatment has been given to them.  That there shall be no financial reason, is a thing we all hope will come about some day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody, in view of our present financial condition, can assert with confidence that the statement that there is not a financial reason is a true statement of facts.  There is a financial reason.  The £370,000 which I stated would be the cost of the present provisions, would have to be doubled; certainly, an additional £300,000 would have to be added on to give uncovenanted benefit to all and sundry.  There is a very definite financial reason against that.  The Deputy has gone a <Col N="2068" /> little further in the course of those debates. Previously I did put a question to the Deputy as to whether he thought nationalisation of industry, in general or in particular, would be advisable, and, without exactly denying it, he asked me if I ever heard him demand that.  I have now, for the first time, heard him demanding something approaching it.</P>

      <P>Where the Minister proposes to cancel the registration of any premises under this Act on the ground mentioned in paragraph (e) of sub-section (3) of this section, the registered proprietor may by notice in writing to the Minister require the matter to be referred to arbitration, and in such case the following provisions shall apply:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Perhaps it would be right for me to say a word on this amendment.  The Dáil will remember that it was an <Col N="2076" /> amendment debated here providing that the Minister should have power to cancel the registration of a creamery where the proprietor broke his contracts. That was discussed at great length.  It was rather an unusual power to take.  It was again discussed in the Seanad, where it was generally felt that there should be some little safeguard, and there was provided as a special safeguard in regard to that an appeal to the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 29, immediately before sub-section (4), a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may also by order make regulations prohibiting the placing of any particular mark or marks of any particular class or description on all or any classes, grades or descriptions of butter or on any packages or wrappings containing any such butter, or on any letters or invoices or other trade documents issued or used in relation to such butter and where any such regulations have been made and are in force any person who places any mark on any butter or any package or wrapper or any letters or invoices or other trade documents in contravention of any such regulation shall <Col N="2077" /> be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it right to explain this amendment also.  Deputies know that there is power in the Bill to provide that certain marks shall go on butter, and on packages and wrappers.  There is no power which would entitle the Minister to prohibit the use of certain marks on butter, or packages and wrappers.  The idea underlying this amendment is as follows:&mdash;When this Bill is in operation it will be pretty generally assumed in England and that butter coming from Ireland carries the Government guarantee with each consignment, and it is not outside the bounds of possibility that creamery managers, factory managers, and other people, would make full use of that assumption and put certain inscriptions on the wrappers or on their boxes which will give the impression that a particular consignment was guaranteed by the Government, in fact a misleading description.  That is rather a serious thing.  A good deal of this butter goes to shopkeepers in the Midlands of England.  You can imagine somebody going into such a shop, asking for butter, and when told the price, saying that it is very dear.  Then the shopkeeper would produce either the invoice or the box, and would say:&mdash;&ldquo;This factory is guaranteed by the Irish Government; it is best butter.&rdquo; That occured, I must say, with regard to Northern exports of butter, and they had to take certain steps to prevent it. In any event, we want to be in a position to prevent misleading descriptions of particular consignments of butter.</P>

      <P>I take it that the intention of the Minister is to provide that if a consignment is described in the English market in a certain way, as he conceives, he should be able to follow that particular consignment.  I do not know how he is going to legislate in <Col N="2078" /> respect of a consignment which is in the hands of a British shopkeeper.  Will the section allow the Minister to penalise a creamery which uses such a mark in regard to any other consignment that it might send away, or with regard to its registration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, is a penalty provided?  Certainly this sub-section does provide for a penalty. The other question is: Could the Minister cancel registration?  I think so.  It depends on the regulations made.  I have not the section before me, but I do remember one clause for contravention of the regulations, and it certainly contemplates making regulations. I think the Deputy misunderstood me, in view of his reference to trying to legislate for butter in England. My point is this: A very large quantity of our total exports are sold, comparatively speaking, to small retailers in the Midland cities of England. I am trying to paint a picture of what could happen, with the retailers' connivance and co-operation, if misleading descriptions were allowed on packages of butter, say, a description which leads any person to believe that this butter bears a Government guarantee as coming from a registered creamery; anyway, a definitely misleading inscription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A customer walks into such a shop and asks for butter.  He says that the price is rather too high.  The shopkeeper says that this is very good butter, that the factory is guaranteed by the Government.  It would be very easy to give an impression that way if that began to be done on a wholesale scale. It would tend rather to discredit the real guarantee which we are actually giving, because, in the first place, butter which would go out from a registered creamery which has not the right to use the national brand may not be choice butter; it may not be any more than average good butter for some time.  That butter may be the particular consignment of butter on sale.  The customer in England buys such butter, and is told that this particular consignment has been actually guaranteed by the Government&mdash;&ldquo;Look at the <Col N="2079" /> inscription on the packet.&rdquo;  It is possible to give a totally false idea in this way amongst our customers in England and elsewhere, and that is the reason why we are taking this power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendments&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 34 (3), page 23, line 1, the words &ldquo;(in this Act called the annual fee)&rdquo; deleted.</P>
      <P>In Section 34 (3) immediately after the word &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; line 2, the following words inserted: &ldquo;or, in the case of premises in respect of which a licence under Part IV. of this Act is in force, such lesser fee as the Minister may if he so thinks fit prescribe in respect of such premises, which fee or lesser fee (as the case may be) is in this Act called the annual fee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are two important amendments which I would like to explain to the Dáil, because they mean some alteration in the Bill.  Deputies will remember that the Bill, as it left this House, provided for the same fee for national brand butter as for butter coming from a registered premises; it must all be treated alike.  The point of view was put up in the Seanad that we should put a premium on the best creamery, and that we should be at least empowered to charge a smaller fee to creameries which were good enough to get the national brand.  We may do what we like in the matter, and the amendment does not coerce us to charge a different fee; we have a discretion.  But the point is this, that as the Bill stood previously, we had to charge the same exporting fee to all creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands now we may charge the same fees to all creameries, and if afterwards it is considered desirable, we may give special preference to creameries which earn the national brand.  It is not inconceivable that circumstances may show that this might be the most effective way, especially <Col N="2080" /> from the point of view of the farmers who are supplying the creameries, and who will want to know why such and such a creamery has to pay more for exporting its butter than another.  This might be the most effective way to make the distinction, though it is not worth very much in money, between a creamery that has earned the national brand and one that has not.  I think the principle is a sound one, and it was accepted as such by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>To discriminate between the creameries as to their ability to turn out butter that will entitle them to use the National Brand, and when they reach that stage that immediately this amendment will operate.  These creameries would really then have some incentive.  It may not be right to say some incentive; I am sure it will be there already, but it would be an encouragement to them, and it would be something to know that the Minister was appreciating their efforts even in a small monetary way, and that this question of the fee does mean something. There has been a good deal of discussion, perhaps I may say too much, but all the same certain prejudices have been created against the measure.  If the Minister could let it be understood definitely that it is his intention that <Col N="2081" /> this shall operate when the time comes that certain creameries can turn out an article that will entitle them to use the national brand, the Minister will have gone a good way to meet the objections of creameries in this respect.</P>

      <P>I do not like to give a firm undertaking to the Dáil that in a set of circumstances that will arise in five or six months time, and the elements of which we are not in a position to measure now, I would do a certain thing.  I think it would be unsound to do it.  I certainly say, however, that my mind is running in that direction and my opinion at this stage is that that should be done.  I do not want to give a firm undertaking to that effect, because we must measure all the elements of the situation before we can come to a conclusion.  The point about this is not so much the difference in money value in it.  It is the comparison. Either fee is not going to make any real difference.  What is really valuable is the comparison.  I accepted about thirty amendments to this Bill in the Dáil, and a great many amendments from the Farmers' Party.  I want to make it clear that the Farmers' Party or any other party did not put up this amendment.  They put up an amendment totally different in principle; that is to say, that every creamery should be charged a maximum fee, and if they were charged a maximum fee, the maximum fee should be smaller, and that was to apply to every creamery.  That is the direct opposite to this amendment which discriminates between two classes of creameries.</P>

Certain landlords availed of that war measure in order to prevent the County Councils getting back those courthouses again.

      <P>I would like to point out that this is a question affecting not one county but many.  I must say, from my experience, that it is very difficult to get the Ministry of Finance to do anything in the matter.  The county councils are ordered by one Department to provide courthouses, but the position is that finances are not forthcoming to enable them to do so. I think it is for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to bring pressure to bear on the Minister for Finance to discharge his liability in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>When examining that question, I would like if the Minister would look into another matter that has arisen recently in connection with the rents of courthouses.  Claims are being made on the county council for rent of the courthouses during the four years they were not being used.  The matter is rather important.  The county council I am interested in refused to pay, and the matters is now in the hands of solicitors.</P>

      <P>That makes it clear. The question of courthouses is important. Deputy Baxter has suggested that the Minister in charge of this Bill should bring pressure to bear on the Ministry of Finance with a view to paying compensation.  A worse aspect of the matter is that certain county councils have not made application in any court for compensation, in accordance with instructions issued by the Department of Local Government in the Second Dáil.  I do not think it would be a good thing for the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health to ask county councils to take over courthouses that were extensively <Col N="2086" /> damaged in pre-Truce days when no compensation is available, or without their position being made absolutely clear.</P>

I do not think that is the Minister's intention, but it is the import and purport of the section, if it is passed in its present form.  I do not think it is desirable that a council should be obliged, at the Minister's direction, to take over courthouses in these circumstances. The circumstances will be such that a council will have to pay rent from the date of surrender, and such other compensation as the Minister shall direct.  In these circumstances the councils will not have a discretion if the Minister decides to direct them to do certain things.</P>

    <P>5.  Any member of the council of a county may with the consent of not less than one-fourth of the members of such council at any time notify the secretary of the council in writing of this intention to propose that the membership of any member of the board of health of a county health district in such county shall be terminated, and the secretary shall thereupon summon a special meeting of the county council for a date not later than one month from the receipt by him of such notification, and shall give to every member of the county council at least fourteen days' notice thereof, and in the event of a resolution being passed at such meeting approving of such proposal by a majority consisting of not less than two-thirds of the council, the membership of such member of the board of health shall be thereupon terminated.</P>
    <P>6.  The membership of any member of a board of health who, for a consecutive period of three months, has not attended a meeting of such board, shall thereupon be terminated and the county council, at their meeting next after the expiration of such period, shall appoint one of their members to fill the vacancy so created in the membership of the board of health.</P>
    <P>7.  A member of a board of health may at any time resign his membership by writing signed by him and delivered to the secretary of the county council and to the secretary of the board of health, but such resignation shall not become effective until the meeting of the county council held next after the receipt of such writing.</P>
    <P>8.  Every board of health shall hold one annual meeting in each year, and shall hold a meeting for the transaction of their business at least once in each month and at such other times as may be necessary for properly <Col N="2089" /> exercising their powers and performing their duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Second Schedule&mdash;To delete Rule 1 and substitute therefor a new rule as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>A board of health shall consist of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  nine persons elected by the county council from among its members;</P>
      <P>(b)  two persons elected by each council of an urban district within the county;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  such number not exceeding five as the county council may think fit of persons not being members of the county council or of an urban district council to be elected by the county council after consultation with the councils of urban districts within the county, and with associations representing persons <Col N="2090" /> engaged in the administration of health services or actively engaged in promoting the health and welfare of the people in the county. The election shall take place at the annual meeting of the county council or of the urban district council as the case may be, next after a triennial election and shall be part of the first business of such meeting. If three or more persons are to be elected the elections shall be conducted on the principle of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>As the rule stands in the Bill, the board of health consists only of members of a county council, and there is no guarantee that an urban district will be represented on it.  The amendment provides that an urban district as such should be represented on boards of health.  Urban districts are contributory bodies in regard to finances.  We all know very well that nearly threequarters of the functions of a board of health are in relation to urban districts, which in comparison with rural districts are densely populated, and the applications for home assistance are much greater.  There is another reason, too.  The urban districts come under the superintendence of medical officers of health, provided under Section 19, and they come under the board of health for matters specified in the Third Schedule, such as tuberculosis committees, blind pensions committees, etc., and in the event of dissolution under Section 61 they would come under the board of health for a variety of purposes.  Therefore, the representation of urban districts on the board of health ought not to be left to chance.  As things stand at present a party with a bare majority on the county council could control the board of health altogether.  There are many reasons, which should be apparent, why urban districts should have the right to representation on boards of health.</P>
    <P>The amendment also creates a possibility of appointing on the board of health a small number of persons with special qualifications in health and social questions, and, to my mind, that is the most important part of the amendment.  A county board of health <Col N="2091" /> ought to be more than a county board of health in name, and I am sure that Deputies will agree that the most active and energetic workers in health and poor law administration are people who do not generally go up for election. I think it would be very necessary to have people of that class on a county board of health.  You can put up several reasons, and one of the most important to my mind is this&mdash;and this argument was put forward when we were trying to induce the Minister to agree to the appointment of local committees&mdash;that it is necessary to have people especially from the towns on these boards of health, because, as I say, most of the applications come of necessity from the towns for home assistance.  As the Bill stands, it is quite possible that you would have no representatives whatever from the urban districts.  The amendment also seeks to secure that the election to the county board of health by the county council should be conducted on the principle of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>I think that that will appeal to every member of the Dáil because, at the moment, a bare majority on a council might appoint all the members on the county board of health.  I do not think that that is wise.  I think, if there are three or four parties on a county council, each party should have proportional representation on the county board of health.  I think that that would ensure that there would be a greater variety of people than if the county board of health were composed solely of members of a particular party, I do not care what party it may be.  I think that that point in the amendment is important, that the county board of health should be elected on the proportional representation system.  I commend this amendment to the Minister and ask him to accept it in the interests of the working of the county boards of health and in the interests of the people for whom those boards will be administered. There is no reason to fear that the members of the county council on the county board of health can be outvoted or that they will be in a minority. The members appointed by the county <Col N="2092" /> council will always be in a majority, but I contend that it is absolutely essential to the successful working of the county boards of health to have representatives from urban districts and to have a small number of people with special qualifications in health and poor law administration upon these boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to accept this amendment.  Deputy Morrissey complains that committees, such as Tuberculosis Committees, will be under the county authority now, but in that respect they will be no worse off under the present Bill than they were before under the county councils.  With regard to the representation of county councils and county boards of health, I think that the rural districts have, perhaps, more to complain of than the urban districts.  I wonder that a somewhat similar amendment to that of Deputy Morrissey has not been put forward on behalf of the rural districts by our friends on the left, because previously the county council had representatives upon it from every rural district, and the chairman of every rural district was an ex-officio member of the county council.  Under the new system there will be no such additional representation of the rural areas, and, consequently, the representation of urban districts will proportionately be much stronger.  I see no reason why urban districts should not be well represented both on the county council and on the county board of health.  With regard to having nominated members on the county board of health.  I think that that would be a mistake.  The county boards of health under this Bill will probably be the most important body in the county, and it will share in all responsibilities, but it will not have control of finance.  It will be a busier body than the county council, and I do not think it is right that a body with such very heavy responsibilities should be independent of the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made to set up committees by the board of health, and that will give all the scope necessary for the appointment of individuals with special knowledge.  Where a committee dealing with technical or special matters is to be set up every facility is given to include upon it members with special <Col N="2093" /> knowledge.  I think that should meet the Deputy on that point.  With regard to proportional representation, I realise that there is a point in the Deputy's amendment, but it is not very easy to see how effect can be given to it.  I would like to see these boards of health representative in two different ways.  I would like to see them representative, particularly as regards areas.  I would much prefer that than to see them representative of parties, although if we must have parties on boards of health, I think it is a good things that we should have these bodies representative of different parties also. I do not think that the Deputy's amendment enables me to give effect to that desire and to make sure that on the boards of health we shall have representatives from every electoral area.  I would like to see that, as I think it would be a good thing so that no particular area would be neglected.</P>

      <P>I am only pointing out that and saying that I consider it is a weakness.  I think it would be a good thing if we could ensure that county boards of health would be representative of all parties in the county, but I do not think that the wording of the amendment will secure that effect.  Perhaps some other suggestions will be put forward to help us in coming to a conclusion on this question.</P>

      <P>In the first place, I want to say that I rather like the way the Minister appealed to the Farmers' Benches for support.  He suggested that, to his mind, there should be an identical amendment from the Farmers' Benches, and he said that so far as he could see there was more reason for it. There is no parallel at all, so far as representation from rural and urban districts is concerned.  A great part of the time of the county board of health will be taken up in the consideration of applications for home help, and I think the Minister ought to see the absolute necessity there is for direct representation of urban centres on the county board.  We are living in very abnormal times, when people are on the verge of starvation, because of the economic condition <Col N="2094" /> that prevails, and it is not unreasonable to ask that a minority of the board of health should be composed of members from urban areas, where there is the greater congestion, and the greater demand for home help.  Surely, it is not too much to ask that.  Personally, I would be well satisfied if we could get representation from the urban areas on the county board for the purpose only of considering questions of home help.  As to the point made by the Minister with regard to the rural population losing representatives from rural areas&mdash;that is in the matter of the chairmen of the district councils&mdash; I would point out that two men would be put on from each rural area in place of the one representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little, and I challenge the Minister to produce the figures in each electoral area, and he will find that the urban areas will get about one-third of the representation in each county.  Supposing the feeling prevails in the rural areas that the towns are receiving too much home help, it follows, as night the day, that the rural population, which will, I expect, have the greater number of representatives on the county boards, will combine together in order to secure that the urban population will not be represented on the board.  They are in the position to do that, because they will have the greater number of representatives. I ask the Minister&mdash;and this is a variation of Deputy Morrissey's amendment, but I think the Minister should concede the point&mdash;that for the purpose of the consideration of home help urban centres should have some representation for that purpose alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected when the Minister got up that he would give some reasons why he could not accept the amendment, but he has not put forward a single argument.  The Minister spoke, as Deputy Corish has remarked, about the farmers bringing forward a similar amendment.  I suggest to the Minister that the urban districts contribute their share to the finances of the county board of health, and the people I am asking him to put on that board are elected representatives, the same as members of the county council. The Minister knows, or should know, that the county councils are practically completely composed of farmer representatives. The number of urban representatives on a county council is very small.  Three-fourths of the business of a county board of health has to do with urban districts, and the Minister knows that also.  There is no use in people jumping to the conclusion that the only reason for putting on direct representatives from urban districts is to see that the people who apply for home help will get it.</P>
      <P>There is another reason, and that is those representatives will be there to see that people who are not entitled to help will not get it, and that the home help will not be abused.  I think the amendment should be accepted.  With regard to what the Minister has said about the small number to be nominated by the county council having no responsibility to the electorate, might I remind him that his commissioners have no responsibility to the electorate either.  A small number will be selected or nominated by the county council, and the council, as representing the ratepayers, are not going to select three, four, or five people, except they know they are people who will have a fair regard for the rates, as well as a fair regard for the people whom they are there to assist.  I can see nothing unreasonable in the amendment, and I can see no reason why the Minister should not accept it.  As to the Minister's reference to the farmers, I can tell him that several members of the Farmers' Party&mdash;I do not see them here now&mdash;told me they were in favour of this amendment, and would vote for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the <Col N="2096" /> discussion in the earlier stages of this Bill we had from the Minister, and several members of the Party behind him, and from two or three of the Farmers' representatives, statements all leading to the conclusion that inevitably localities would be represented on the board of health.  It is quite clear from the discussions that the members of the Dáil desire and expect that each district in a county shall have a representative on the county board of health. Arguments used by the Minister against certain other amendments were put forward to the effect that the claim for such representation was unnecessary, as committees were to be appointed, and it was said that these committees would certainly and inevitably represent the districts.  There is no certainty and no inevitability in the Bill in that respect, and this amendments attempts to ensure that urban districts will have representatives on the board.</P>
      <P>If there is any sincerity in the plea put forward in the earlier stages that the districts ought to be represented, here is the opportunity to prove that. With reference to the paragraph of this amendment which speaks of a number not exceeding five nominated representatives, the Minister has attempted to refute the argument of Deputy Morrissey on this point by saying that the board of health will be the most responsible authority in the county, except in matters of finance, and therefore it should be wholly an elected body.  But the sub-committee to be nominated by the board of health, either from districts or, for general purposes, not from districts, at the discretion of the board will have the working to a great extent of the system, and the Bill provides that one person on these committees shall be a member of the board of health, and others may be nominated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in relation to the board of health, the powers of these sub-committees will be just as great as the powers of the board of health itself. The county council, which is to be a wholly elected body, is to be the financial authority.  The nominated person in either case will not be the financial authority, but the financial <Col N="2097" /> authority will be the county council, which is to be wholly elected.  If there is anything in the Minister's point that there should be no nominated persons, no select persons but only elected persons on the board of health, because of the powers they will wield&mdash;if there is anything, I say, in that it applies to a very much greater extent to the sub-committee of the board of health which the Minister has defended, because the Bill only provides that one person on the sub-committee shall be a member of the board of health.  The others may be all nominated and you may have a majority of nominated persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>These committees will only have very limited powers, but this is a body with very great power.  It is a statutory body, and is probably the most important body in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>True, but the Minister referred to the question of finance. He has insisted upon the fact, time and time again, that the county council will still retain the financial powers and the financial authority, and that the board of health, which may have a minority of five in twenty, under this proposition it may nominate specialists, persons with special knowledge, but still they will have no final authority over finance.  Leaving that aside, the amendment attempts to put into operation what has been generally expressed in the Dáil, first that every district in the county should be sure of representation on the board of health. Now, as the Bill stands there is no such certainly.  The county council is to elect nine persons and a chairman from amongst its members.  So far as the Bill goes, apart from common sense, they may all come from one end of the county.  They may deliberately leave out of representation one or two parts of the county, and they may deliberately leave out the representation of urban districts on the board of health. If they do so there is no breach of the law and no contravention of their responsibilities. We are seeking to ensure that, at least, two persons in the urban districts shall be attached to the board of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely there is nothing extraordinary or extravagant in trying to ensure <Col N="2098" /> that the urban districts will have representation on the authority which, as the Minister says, is to be the most important public authority in the county, the most important administrative body affecting the area concerned. Now, the Minister would like to ensure that the board of health would be representative of the council.  He would like that it should be representative of districts but he is afraid to provide for it.  He would like that the board of health to be elected by the county council should be representative of all groups of opinion within the council. But he does not like the idea of parties, and for my part I would like that once a county council got, into business that the party idea should not prevail to any great extent.  There will be bodies of opinion, however, and there will be districts represented and the Minister wants to ensure that districts shall be represented.  Paragraph (b) would ensure that.  It would ensure that districts shall be represented as far as urban districts go.  He could, if he wished, ensure that electoral areas shall be represented, but he has not done so.  If he is not prepared to see the practicability of the proportional representation method being adopted with the practice that we are evolving in regard to the carrying on of elections by proportional representation, I at any rate cannot see where the impracticability arises.</P>
    <P>There is, perhaps, a precedent in our own Standing Orders to secure the same end without having the same machinery not perhaps as certain in its working but at least designed for the same end.  Standing Order 63 states: &ldquo;Committees shall, as far as possible, be representative of all parties and opinions in the Dáil.&rdquo;  If the Minister is afraid to introduce the machinery of proportional representation in the election of committees he at least ought to express in the Bill something of the same idea, even if it can only be called a pious expression of the Dáil's opinion. There should be no real difficulty in embodying in the schedule a provision that would ensure that the various bodies of opinion in the county council shall have representation on the board of health.  If he would also ensure, <Col N="2099" /> as we desire in this amendment, that each urban district shall have representation, and would go a little bit further and ensure that each electoral area and each rural district would have representation, then we should be satisfied and quite pleased to assist him. We are attempting to put into practical operation in this amendment what the Minister himself as well as several Deputies on his own side and several Deputies amongst the Farmers' have indicated as their desire.  I hope that they will again express that desire, and see if we cannot arrive at some practical scheme so that the various districts in a county, as well as groups of opinion in a county, shall be ensured representation on the board of health.</P>

      <P>I agree with the amendment and I say it is absolutely essential that there should be direct representation in the case of urban districts. Take the case of a county councillor who lives a mile, say, outside a town. It will be impossible for him to know the needs of the poor in that town.  He would need to live in the town to get an intimate knowledge of their condition, and it is only an urban representative who would be able to look after the interests of these people.  The amendment, in my opinion, is a very reasonable one, and I trust that no Deputy in the Dáil will object to it.</P>

      <P>They should at least be able to get one-third of the representation in any county.  I have no objection to having election by proportional representation.  I was trying to draft an attempt to give representation according to the electoral areas.  I think it more important to have each area represented than to have each party represented, and I was proposing to bring in, on the Report Stage, something to this effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members of a board of health for a county health district shall, unless the county council is of opinion that the most efficient administration of the powers, duties, and functions of such boards of health requires the contrary, include at least one member elected a member of the county council for each county electoral area portion of which is situated in the county health district.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was thinking of bringing in a proposal of that kind which would ensure that there should be representation for electoral areas in the county, but it would be a very difficult thing to ensure, at the same time, representation of each party.  I think it would be almost impossible to combine the two.</P>

      <P>You are making a great mistake.  I know at least two in the county I come from that are not county boroughs.  There are electoral areas for the county council and they elect people to the county council. There may be, in connection with the urban districts, perhaps a rural electoral division.  It was one of the old electoral divisions that was put in along with the urban district for the purposes of working proportional representation, but for all intents and purposes, elections take place and it is generally the urban member that is elected in that district, and that is <Col N="2102" /> the reason why I say that the amendment of the Minister will give representation to the urban districts.  I may say here that I am in sympathy with members opposite in representation being given to urban districts on these county boards of health, and I believe that what the Minister has sketched out when put in its proper form, if accepted on these lines, will give the representation desired.</P>

      <P>If what the Minister for Defence has said was the position, and that would be achieved by the amendment of the Minister for Local Government, I would be satisfied with it, but it is not.  It may be the position in a small county like that which the Minister represents with a couple of very large towns in it.  But I will give another case.  I know of a town in an electoral area, and that electoral area returns six members to the county council, and out of the six members returned by that electoral area I think two come from the urban district.  The Minister for Local Government said he was giving a special representative to the urban districts, but as Deputy Corish asked, does not the Minister realise that the position is at the moment, that any county council of the twenty-six counties could have if they wished the county board of health composed altogether of rural representatives? That is the position, and the Minister knows that is the position with regard to the two county councils in his own constituency.  They have more than two-thirds majority on these county councils and there is nothing in this Bill as it stands at present that guarantees that there should be even a single representative on them from the urban districts.  I ask the Minister to face the actual position and to try and consider for a moment that, as I said before, three-fourths of the business done by the county board of health has to do with the urban district, and it is quite possible under the Bill that although three-fourths of the business has to do with urban districts there may not be one single representative of the urban district on the board of health.</P>

In the electoral area where Clonmel is situated the urban electors would completely swamp the rural representatives. The electors of that town are almost sufficiently numerous to elect a Parliamentary candidate let alone a representative to the county council.  I am inclined to think that in the Deputy's own town of Nenagh, the urban would swamp the electoral area.</P>

      <P>I would like to back up what Deputy Morrissey has said in this.  In the constituency of North Cork there are two county electoral areas and one urban district council area, and in that urban area&mdash;Macroom &mdash;the total urban electorate is something less than one-tenth of the total in the Macroom county electoral area. In the constituency of West Cork there are three county electoral areas.  In one there is no urban district council at all.  In the other two there is one, and practically the same proportion applies, practically one-ninth or one-tenth in the urban area to the total, so that practically in West Cork and North Cork there would not be a single representative <Col N="2104" /> of the urban electoral area on the county council.  That same does not apply to East Cork, because they have a few towns&mdash;Cobh, Mallow and Fermoy&mdash;where the population is high, but in the bulk of the county Cork Deputy Morrissey's illustrations would be right.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of the absence in this Bill of any surety that people with a knowledge of the district and the people in the district will be brought into the administration of the health laws.  Let us take the question of home help.  Take a small urban district. Surely there ought to be somebody in that town with a knowledge of the recipients of home help.  There is nothing in the Bill to include that.  You have a plan of sub-committees of the board of health, but that does not provide that there &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be local committees. You may have local committees or you may not.  You may have general committees on which there may be no representation of the urban districts, and the only persons who would be in touch with the recipients of home help would be the superintendent of home help or the administrative officer. That is surely a difficulty.  There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that local knowledge will be brought to bear on local administration with respect to urban districts.  It might happen in three-fourths or nine-tenths of the cases, as a matter of common sense, but let us legislate to prevent even one-tenth being brought under that kind of disfranchisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the intention and the desire is that local districts shall have representation, that local committees shall be appointed for assistance in the administration of home help, we should express it.  We have failed to express it so far.  Let us, at least, try to ensure that some voice will come from the urban districts, so that there will be an added chance of ensuring representation of those urban districts on the sub-committees of the board of health.  At present we have no assurance that any local district shall be represented either on the subcommittee or the board of health, and any local area may be overborne by a county council majority.  I think there <Col N="2105" /> ought to be no hesitation in accepting an amendment of some kind or other which will ensure that such representation shall be secured.</P>

They are always able to look after themselves and I anticipate they will be able to look after themselves in the future.

There is nothing at all, as I read sub-section 2, or the section which gives him the power to incorporate an urban district in the board of health, which ensures that representation from that urban district should follow incorporation of the district.  If I am wrong the Minister will put me right.  As I understand it at the moment, the constitution does not take in the urban district, except the Minister decides under this section we are discussing to <Col N="2106" /> incorporate the urban district.  If he so decides, will he show us where he has power to give representation to that urban council on the board of health? That is really the point at issue.

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Good did not see his way to support my amendment last night, when I objected to that clause in the Bill.  The section was allowed to pass through and, in my opinion, it is one of the many faults in the Bill.  I do not think much can be said, beyond what has been said, to convince the Minister that the leaving out of the urban areas is a great weakness in the measure.  There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that it is from the urban areas that the greatest demand will come for home assistance.  They are the most populous <Col N="2107" /> and the most congested areas.  The people are huddled together in them. I know two urban districts which have only one resident county councillor.  All the other county councillors are rural representatives.  The electoral divisions are so arranged that the rural representatives predominate.  From that, it follows that they will predominate in the board of health and right down the line.  The most necessitous people will have the least representation.  There will be nobody to say who is in need of home assistance in the urban areas and who is not.  As a Deputy has said, a county councillor, to know the needs of an urban district, must live in the heart of an urban district.  He will not know the needs of the district if he lives on the outskirts.  To know who requires home assistance, he must live in the centre of the district.  I suggest that it is just as much a safeguard to Deputy Gorey's party as it is an advantage to the poor people seeking home assistance that there should be representation from the urban areas.</P>

      <P>Before Rule 3, to insert a new rule as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.  A board of health shall at its first meeting after it has been constituted and at each annual meeting thereafter elect a chairman from among its members, and may also elect a vice-chairman.  At every meeting of the board the chairman or, in his absence, the vice-chairman shall preside over the meeting, and if both chairman and vice-chairman are absent then such member of the board as the members of the board then present shall choose shall preside.</P>
      <P>The Schedule as it stands provides that the county council shall elect the chairman. I think it is an unheard of thing that one body should elect a chairman for another committee.  The amendment provides that the board of health as appointed by the county council shall at its first meeting select its own chairman or vice-chairman.  I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment because it would carry out the intentions, I believe, of the Department, which is to have the county council control the board of health committee.  The change is not very great, and if the amendment is accepted giving the right to the board of health to select its own chairman I believe it would lead to greater harmony and smoother working of the board of health.</P>

      <P>In Rule 13, before the word &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; line 24, to insert the words &ldquo;county council and approved by the.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the board of health is supposed to be a committee of the county council. As the rule stands the Minister is made solely responsible for procedure.  The amendment gives the county council, as the parent body, control in this matter. The acceptance of the amendment will not necessarily mean that the Minister will be precluded from issuing model rules.

      <P>I object to accepting this amendment, because it will mean lack of uniformity in those rules and it will mean considerable difficulty in the administration of the Act.  If every board of health can make its own rules difficulty will ensue.  In practice every such body is consulted, and if there are any necessary small changes to be made in order to keep particular circumstances right on the board of health, they will, as a matter of fact, be made. If I were to allow each board of health to make its own rules, it would mean very great additional trouble in administration and probably additional cost in the way of staff.  I would ask <Col N="2112" /> the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is more in this than the Minister would appear to suggest.  If the board of health, as he has been insisting, is a committee of the county council, and not entirely or almost entirely an autonomous body, if it has any responsibility to the county council, surely the county council can make some sign of its superiority by the fact that it, and not the Minister, shall draw up the rules of procedure for the conduct of its business, so long as the Minister has the right to approve or disapprove? We have another sign in this of the general trend of the whole scheme to make the county council merely an electoral college for appointing the board of health.  The board of health then can almost ignore the county council and get in touch with the Minister.  It is really to centralise the administration of health services in the Minister. This amendment at least will do something to indicate that that is not the intention of the Ministry or the Oireachtas. The county council in this case will draw up rules of procedure and not the Minister.  It may not be of very great intrinsic importance, but it has its symbolic importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection of the Minister, that it is not going to be uniform with the rules of procedure and the conduct of business on other boards of health in other counties, is again a sign of the desire to have perfect regimentation under the direction of the commander-in-chief in Merrion Street, the Minister being director of local government affairs, and every county council and every board of health doing exactly what is ordered by regulation and rule from the Ministry.  Let us at least allow county councils to diverge a little from the regulations set up by the Ministry in a matter of this kind as to how they shall conduct their own business. Surely the county councils can have that liberty, even though we do allow the Minister to hold a check over any extreme action that a county council may take.  I would ask the Minister to accept this, at least as a sign that he does not want to rule with a dictatorship <Col N="2113" /> over the county councils and boards of health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Corish I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>101.  At the end to add a new rule as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A board of health shall present to the county council as soon as practicable after the close of each half-year a summary account of its receipts and expenditure and a report upon the work of the board during the half-year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is again an attempt to make it appear at least that the board of health is in fact subordinate to the county council.  The county council, under Section 13, is in a certain position in relationship to the board of health.  &ldquo;A board of health shall be subject to such conditions or restrictions in relation to expenditure as the county council may impose with the consent of the Minister. The money required to meet the expenses of a board of health in the exercise and performance of their powers and duties under this Act shall be supplied by the county council to the board of health on an annual estimate and demand by the board of health, and shall be estimated, demanded and paid in the same manner as the expenses of a rural district council have been heretofore estimated, demanded, and paid, or in such other manner as may be prescribed.&rdquo;  There are certain other requirements respecting finances and the responsibility to the county council but there is nothing in that section or any other section as far as I can see, which imposes any responsibility upon the board of health for presenting any accounts, either financial or otherwise, either accounts of expenditure or reports of working to the county council.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to require the board of health to present to the county council such reports, both of receipts and expenditure and of the work of the board during the half-year. I hope that that at least would be acceptable to the Minister, or to Deputies behind the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule as a whole I would like again to impress upon the Minister the necessity for ensuring that a fair representation shall be given on the board of health to each electoral area.  I think that is a very essential feature in connection with the board of health, and we can quite understand that, as the rules have now been drawn, it is possible that the representatives on the board of health might be practically all drawn from one electoral area and the other electoral areas have no representation at all.  That, to my mind, is an exceedingly weak feature, and I would ask the Minister to look into that particular point between now and the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the representation of the county electoral areas will be sufficient to ensure what is required.  It is at least something in the direction, but in a very small degree, and I feel that the regulations are so far from ensuring representation of the districts that the whole plan is spoiled.  Because of that defect I am going to ask the House to divide against the Schedule as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that each electoral area will have representation on the county board of health. I quite agree that rural districts will have representation, but if in the county council the majority of the members belong to one party and the members from the town are not members of that party, then that town <Col N="2116" /> would be deprived of any representation upon the county board of health, or at least of any voice in its decisions. I think the Minister should undertake to have at least two members of an urban council on the county board of health, plus the members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite in order in making a speech now.  This is a schedule, and the matter is mentioned in the schedule.  I am not speaking to the other amendment at all; I am speaking to the Minister and asking him to agree that there shall be some representation from urban districts.  I am quite in order in asking that, and I demand that I shall not be called upon by any Minister to sit down when I am in the right and speak for the people I represent. If it is not accepted and inserted in the Bill that urban districts shall have representation on the county board of health to look after the poor and the old people in the towns the Bill is a farce.  It will be looked upon as a farce and nothing else.  I hope that the Minister does not want to make a laughing stock of the Bill and a sketch of himself by having people saying that the Bill is not worth the paper it is written on.  I ask the Minister to consider this point and to make some provision whereby urban districts will be allowed to appoint at least one or two representatives on the board of health.</P>

      <P>Might I point out to Deputy Good that even if the Minister would do what he has suggested, that is, to ensure that each electoral area will be represented on the county board of health, it would not necessarily mean that the urban districts would be represented, because most of the electoral areas are represented by four, five or six members of the county council, with perhaps two at most out of that number from an urban district. So that even if the Minister does bring in the amendment Deputy Good speaks about, it is quite possible that you will not have a single representative of an urban district on the county board of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2117" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And supposing a local authority is very anxious to deal with some minor questions&mdash;leave out questions of health and assistance&mdash; on libraries, sanitation, wash-houses and the like&mdash;surely one ought to ensure that these urban areas, which will be more likely to demand and require such facilities, would be able to voice the views of these localities, and generally advise with intelligence the whole committee, if they had and were ensured representation.  The Minister endeavoured to call for a rule against Deputy Lyons on this matter, because an amendment dealing with quite a number of matters had been defeated a short time ago, but Deputy Lyons was only dealing with one item in that considerable amendment and had no right to be called up in that way.  I think that the Minister would be well advised, if he wants to make this Bill acceptable to all in the country, to reconsider his whole attitude on the question of the representation and composition of those boards of health, and further, on the sub-committees of the boards of health.  I believe that unless he does that he will find that the scheme will be very unpopular&mdash;I think it will be unpopular in any case&mdash;but it will work badly and will mean a breakdown in the system of local government and a demand for very considerable <Col N="2118" /> changes, and perhaps the head of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point that I would like to mention in connection with urban councils.  An urban council is contained in a county council electoral area, but while it is in the electoral area it may not be part of the board of health.  If an urban council forms a considerable portion of that electoral area the urban council is not part of the board of health.  But in the proposal of the Minister, notwithstanding that fact, such an electoral area would get its due representation on the board of health.  There is representation where I do not think you are entitled exactly to claim the whole of it, because the whole of it does not come within the jurisdiction of the board of health.  There may be other cases which are different.  So the question is not quite as easy as it may appear to Deputy Morrissey on the face of it.</P>

    <P>This amendment, when it was sent in, had connection with an amendment, also in the name of Deputy Davin, but the other amendment was not carried, and, therefore, this amendment at the present stage ought not perhaps to be discussed.  The intention, of course, was to provide a minimum as well as a maximum scale, and I think it better not to move this amendment but to defer it until the Fourth Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment not moved.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FIFTH SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P>Rule 6.&mdash;The sum payable under the preceding rule in respect of each meeting shall be calculated as follows, that is to say, four pence for each mile of the journey from the member's official residence to the place of meeting travelled by railway, and five pence for each mile of such journey travelled otherwise than by railway.</P>

      <P>I am not moving amendment 103, but I beg to move amendment 103a, which is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In rule 6, line 31, to insert after the word &lsquo;journey&rsquo; the words &lsquo;to and.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will have no objection in accepting this innocent amendment from an innocent Deputy.  I am sure that if members receive 4d. a mile for travelling expenses the intention is that the 4d. shall cover each mile travelled.  The Minister may tell me that that is already inserted when he says 4d. for each mile, but I have put down the amendment to find out whether each mile means each mile to and from the residence of the member.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  In the rule it does not mean to and from.  This allowance is not intended to cover all the expenses of members and it was only put down to cover part of the expenses.  This is looked upon as the readiest way of paying a fair contribution towards members' expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Bill should read so that in place of each mile it would mean two miles?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill says for each mile, and I am sure that the Minister is not going to change the Bill.  I think when he considers the matter he will see that the 4d. should not apply to one journey only, as otherwise the member might have to get home by shanks' mare.</P>

      <P>I think that in view of the fact that we are going to have a reduction in railway fares, the Deputy ought not to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

      <P>I move &ldquo;In Rule 6, line 12, to delete the word &lsquo;five&rsquo; and substitute the word &lsquo;twelve.&rdquo;&rsquo;  I am sure the Minister will have no hesitation <Col N="2121" /> in agreeing with this amendment. Five pence a mile is not enough for travelling expenses.  I am sure no one will be able to engage a motor at that rate.  If a Deputy is entitled to the full amount of fare for travelling by rail, and four pence a mile might cover the expense of travelling by rail, why should he not also be allowed the full expense for travelling by road?  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the figure quoted in the amendment he ought to allow something more reasonable to cover the cost of motor hire for attending meetings, and I would be satisfied.  I will not let this amendment go as easily as the last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Lyons in this amendment.  I will not say that the Minister should agree to twelvepence, but I think, in all fairness, he ought to agree to an increase on the five pence per mile, for no one who wants to hire a motor car will get it at that rate for a single journey, not to speak of the return journey.  In some counties, like County Cork, members of the county council have to travel 60, 70, or 80 miles to attend the county council meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not intended to <Col N="2122" /> cover all the expenses of members attending those councils, and until the Act is in operation for some time it will be hard to know how it will work out.  It is better to begin low than to begin high, and have to reduce afterwards. It is quite true that fivepence per mile does not cover the expense of a motor car, but it must be taken into consideration that you will often have four or five people in these cars, and oftentimes a member travelling to council meetings will be able to attend to his own business as well as the business of the county council, and then it will be a great help to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>As to four or five men in a motor car, that may take place in some parts of the country, but is a member living six or seven miles away from any other member, or living away from a station in the heart of the country, expected to run a car to accommodate the people he represents?  The Minister should make an advance on the fivepence a mile, and if he does not he will never get through the Bill to-night if I can help it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 104a:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Rule 6, line 33, to insert after the word &ldquo;railway&rdquo; the words: &ldquo;Each member who is entitled to the above-named travelling allowance, shall receive ten shillings per meeting, plus the travelling allowance mentioned in this rule, if he is four hours away from his official residence, <Col N="2123" /> owing to the business he has to attend to at such meetings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order to expedite the passage of the Bill through the Dáil to-night, I do not intend to force this amendment to a division, but I think the Minister would be wise in accepting it, because I believe its acceptance would mean that a good attendance of members would be ensured at the meetings of public bodies.  Members of a public body who live in town are not allowed any travelling expenses, even though they lose their time and their day's pay attending meetings.  I put the amendment forward with the idea of securing some recompense for the time they lose.</P>

      <P>There is just one question I would like to ask the Minister. It is, whether rural district councils, before they are finally abolished, will have the power to grant any superannuation to their officials who may not be lucky enough to get transferred to vacancies under the county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that I think the Deputy had better discuss with me outside.  There is no possibility of rural councils paying their officials, because these officials automatically become officials under the county council as soon as the district councils are abolished.</P>
