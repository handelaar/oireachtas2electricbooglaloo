      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that awards made to Timothy Murray, Dunmanway; Cornelius Riordan, Dunmanway, and Jeremiah Collins, Paris House, Dunmanway, Co. Cork, by the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of the occupation and damage to claimants' premises by the National Army, have been refused by claimants on the grounds of being entirely inadequate; whether such awards were recommended by an official who only spent a few minutes in each house; whether the awards did not cover damage to furniture and furniture taken away in each case, and whether he will order that the claims will be again thoroughly investigated?</P>

The award made to him did not include any allowance in respect of damage to furniture, but it was arranged to make inquiry into this portion of his claim, and a further communication will be addressed to him.</P>
      <P>No awards have yet been made on the claims furnished by Cornelius Riordan, Dunmanway, and Jeremiah Collins, Paris House, Dunmanway.</P>

      <P>The total amount of the receipts from Motor Vehicle Licence Duty and Drivers' Licences paid in Tirconaill during the year 1923 was approximately £8,745, and the total claim for expenses in respect of the 18 months ending 30th September last was £269 6s. 11d., of which £226 2s. 9d. has been paid.

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make a brief statement more or less in the nature of a personal statement. When the matter of the Interim Report came on before the Dáil yesterday it followed a decision of the Dáil that was to be put into writing and submitted to the Dáil by the President.  That very largely put the matter, so far as I was concerned, sub judice.  I therefore, was careful to leave the Dáil when the actual Interim Report was on.  I did so quite deliberately Nevertheless, when I was gone I saw from the paper this morning that the Postmaster-General introduced my name in a still further connection.  I think that that was rather an extraordinary procedure to adopt under the circumstances; but seeing that it has been adopted, I cannot refrain from mentioning it and some of the circumstances attendant upon it. He stated, or inferred, or suggested, that I was moving in the interests of a company, that company being the Marconi Company.  I was linked in this connection with another Deputy who was not present then, and whom I do not see present now.  Before I go further into it let me say that I have not the honour or the advantage of knowing anything in regard to the <Col N="1100" /> Marconi Company whatever.  It was only after a suggestion to that effect was made in Committee, and made with a great deal of virulence by the Postmaster-General, that I learned even that they had an establishment in this country with certain persons attached to it, one of whom is a Senator.</P>
      <P>I only discovered that as a result of definite and deliberate inquiry.  The suggestion was made, and seeing it has been made, I want to point to this kind of procedure that has been adopted.  I do not wish to advert to any of the matters that are to be made the subject of inquiry.  But it was elicited in the Dáil yesterday that a document was handed in reflecting upon me and my actions long prior to wireless, long prior to the honour that was conferred upon me when I was made a member of the Dáil.  That has been put into the hands of a Committee to investigate. That matter not having been already investigated, I am precluded from referring to it.  But then immediately another charge is made.  I endeavoured yesterday very carefully to avoid using words that I was very much tempted to use.  But I do ask if this process be not a process of blackmail what else is it?  On what basis was this suggestion made yesterday?  I learned, when the matter was first mentioned, that it arose in this way&mdash;that the Postmaster-General appointed a detective to frequent the lobbies of the Dáil, and to watch the Deputies.  I learned that that detective saw a certain person speaking to me in the lobby.  That is true.  He did.  At that time I did not know that that person had any connection with Marconi.</P>
      <P>Now, there are two matters involved in this.  The first is, is this the kind of procedure that ought to be adopted; that a Minister, in order to make his inquiries, will put detectives into the lobbies of the Dáil?</P>

      <P>I would suggest to Deputy Figgis that the matters <Col N="1101" /> he is going into now would, perhaps, be more suitable for the Committee which it is proposed to appoint, and which it was understood would investigate all personal matters, and that he should confine himself now to asking the P.M.G. what his meaning was yesterday when he made use of certain words.  We might in this way be able to get rid of this whole matter.  It is not one which ought to form a subject of debate in the Dáil.  It is one which, certainly if it has any substance, should be investigated by a Committee which would report upon it to the Dáil.  That was the agreement yesterday, and while I sympathise with Deputy Figgis' desire to have a personal explanation in the matter, and while I do not wish in any way to restrict him, I suggest we might be able to dispose of the matter in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>So deeply am I in agreement with you that I deliberately refrained from referring to certain matters yesterday that I had desired to refer to.  I am perfectly willing to leave the matter for this subsequent investigation, with my emphatic deliberate denial of the suggestion that was made.  I only want, with your permission, to refer to one other aspect of it that I think it is proper I should mention and that would not contravene, as I may have contravened before. It is this: my only interest in moving for wireless broadcasting was not in connection with wireless or broadcasting whatever.  It had no connection with any company or companies that were interested in the matter. My only interest in the matter was that the White Paper, that was initially circulated, contained certain proposals that I believe contravene the Constitution of this country.  My action had no connection as to whether Marconi or anybody else has it.  That is a matter that leaves me entirely cold, and the Dáil has my hostages in that connection.  I have the proceedings of the House in my hand for Friday, the 14th December, on which day the resolution in my name was adopted, by which the Committee on Wireless Broadcasting was appointed.  I will read that resolution:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That a Committee of the Dáil be <Col N="1102" /> appointed to consider the circular addressed to Deputies entitled `Wireless Broadcasting,' especially in regard to the proposal by which it is intended that the State should pass over the right to licence and tax incoming apparatus through a clearing house under the control of a private company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was my interest in the matter, and not whether this company or the other company should do the business, but that these things that I considered to be the special prerogative of the Minister for Finance should remain absolutely in the charge of the Minister for Finance, acting on behalf of the State, nothing whatever to do with wireless, nothing whatever to do with broadcasting, nothing whatever to do with any companies who were or might be, interested in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>As you are, sir, the custodian of the honour and the guardian of all the rights and privileges of all the members of the Dáil, there is a matter I would like your permission to bring under your notice. There is nothing in the Terms of Reference to the Committee, which have just been read out by Deputy Figgis, declaring whether or not the proceedings of the Committee were to be private or public.  There has been persistent denunciation of the Committee in several newspapers on the ground that it arrogated to itself illegal powers of pursuing a secret inquiry, and a great deal of the awkwardness and unpleasantness that have ensued in the course of discussions, both licit and illicit, in the deliberations of the Committee, is ascribed to the alleged secrecy of the tribunal.  There is a very admirable leading article in the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal&rdquo; this morning, with everything in which I most heartily concur, with the exception of the demand that the further proceedings of the Committee should be public, and retrospectively, the criticism that the earlier proceedings should have been public. We had nothing whatever to guide us, except the Constitution and the Standing Orders.  Article 25 of the Constitution lays it down that &ldquo;Sittings of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public.&rdquo;  Standing Order 65 proceeds <Col N="1103" /> to elucidate and apply the imperative clause, &ldquo;shall be public.&rdquo;  In this official copy of the Standing Orders Rule 65 is headed &ldquo;Visitors.&rdquo;&ldquo;Visitors may be introduced by Teachtaí to such places as may be reserved for them by the Ceann Comhairle, and authorised representatives of the Press may be present at sittings of the Dáil and Special Committees,&rdquo; and in the index to the Standing Orders it is spoken of as permission for the Press to be present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;&ldquo;Press, representatives of&mdash;must be authorised; permission to attend the Dáil and Special Committees.&rdquo;  Now, the index is as much an authoritative and official publication as the body of the text.  The Constitution prescribes that meetings of the Dáil and meetings of the Seanad shall be public.  Are they to be open to all the public all the time with respect to every part of the accommodation that they might provide? These questions are determined by Standing Order 65:&mdash;&ldquo;Visitors may be introduced by Teachtaí to such places as may be reserved for them by the Ceann Comhairle, and authorised representatives of the Press may be present at sittings of the Dáil and Special Committees.&rdquo;  Our Committee was a Special Committee.  It was not, in the technical and strict sense of the words, a Departmental Committee, though it was an inquiry into departmental procedure, and projected departmental policy.  It was a Special Committee, and under Rule 65 of the Standing Orders, the Press &ldquo;may be present.&rdquo;  That makes it clear to anyone who should raise the objection that the Press are not at liberty to be present, but I submit, sir, that it does not confer upon the Press the right to be present.  Apart altogether from that, there are other Committees of this House that meet, and meet in private, and the Press never tender a request to be present.  I am a member of several Committees at present that are carrying on their investigations, and there is no Press present, and there is no complaint as regards the absence of them from those Committee meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> No application was made to the Committee on Wireless to have the Press present until the twelfth day of the sittings.  In order to keep the air clear of other issues than the central issues, and not to cloud any more unnecessarily the findings of the Committee by suggestions of secrecy that the public might ignorantly suppose to be secrecy in the interests of corruption, I am delighted to have the opportunity of making this statement that the reason that there was a majority vote at that twelfth sitting, when the first application for the presence of the Press was made on behalf of the Press, was that all these matters about graft and corruption, or implications of graft and corruption, had already been disposed of, and we were entering upon, let me call it, a calmer scene.  If the Press had begun to report at that stage the public would have got a wrong impression altogether.  It was not through hostility to the Press.  The declared sense of the Committee was that in view of what had actually occurred we regretted very much that the Press had not been there from the beginning.</P>
    <P>It was not in the spirit of restricting the privileges of the Press, or desiring to prevent publicity for our work, but it was merely that we, who had gone through all the documents and had heard the evidence, were convinced that if the Press were brought in at that stage, instead of helping matters it would only have made the difficulty greater.  So that it is necessary, in the interests of the proper attitude of the public towards the findings, so far as they are findings, of the Interim Report, to have it made clear that the meetings were secret in that sense: they were not secret because of any preconceived design to keep them secret.  They were non-public because the members of the Committee considered that it was better that they should be non-public. They simply, if I may use the expression, drifted into non-publicity, and then reaching the stage at which publicity did not seem beneficial.  It is for you, sir, and the Dáil, with your concurrence, to decide, if this Committee proceeds with its enquiry, whether further proceedings are to be made in the presence of representatives of the Press.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Was the Committee correct in believing in the circumstances that it had a right to decide its own procedure, and is it the wish of the Dáil that in future it shall be bound by the requirement to have the Press present?</P>

      <P>In the first place, the Dáil appoints its Committees. The Dáil itself is supreme, and can give to its Special Committees any instructions which the Dáil desires.  The Dáil, therefore, in appointing a Committee could instruct the Committee to conduct its proceedings in private, or could instruct the Committee to conduct its proceedings in public, or could, I think, instruct a Committee to conduct its proceedings in public, and if it thought desirable that certain sittings should be held in private to report accordingly to the Dáil for leave to exclude the Press.  No instructions whatever were given to this Committee when it was appointed with regard to the question of the presence of the Press. At a certain stage in the proceedings, after the Committee had held several meetings, the question was raised that under Standing Order 65 the Committee had not power to exclude the Press. I understand that that was the contention. It seems to me that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; means that the Press may be given permission to be present.  The Committee had no instructions from the Dáil, and I think, therefore, that the Committee was right in deciding the matter itself, and was within its right in deciding that the Press should not <Col N="1106" /> be present, just as the Committee would have been within its rights had it decided that the Press should be present. It may be necessary to frame additional Standing Orders bearing on this matter, with particular reference to the different kinds of Committees which we set up.  There is a certain difference, an obvious difference, between a Special Committee set up to consider a Bill, for example, and a Special Committee set up to consider some other matter, and it may be necessary for the Committee on Procedure to frame Standing Orders dealing with these matters.  But in the absence of these Standing Orders, and on the construction of Standing Order 65, the Committee, I think, was quite within its rights in assuming that it had itself power to decide whether the Press should or should not be present.  The Postmaster-General desires to make a personal explanation.</P>

      <P>It appears that the Press, in its report of last evening's proceedings, conveyed the impression that in the course of my speech I imputed certain motives to the Committee, or rather that I conveyed the impression that the Committee was influenced in its decision by exterior forces.  As a matter of fact, if my reference did convey that impression, I wish it to be understood it is not in any way applicable to what I had in my mind.  I had not for one instant conceived the idea that this Committee came to its decisions on any other grounds than that of its own unaided judgment.  I regard this Committee as being the maximum of integrity, and I have said so here.  I am perfectly satisfied that any decision it has come to, or that it will come to, is a decision based solely on honesty and the best interests for the country.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening, in moving the adjournment of this debate, I did not feel very happy about it, because this is a subject which would require very close examination and a good deal of study.  Many complexities arise from the nature of the case.  The Postmaster - General is an Extern Minister, and the Executive Council, as such, has no responsibility in so far as <Col N="1107" /> the control of his Department is concerned, outside of one particular matter, and that is questions affecting finance.  In listening to the Postmaster-General yesterday evening, and in reading the Press report of his statement, this morning, I have not been satisfied by the statement he has made that this Report should not be adopted.  They were faced with a certain difficulty in its adoption; first as regards its interpretation, and secondly with regard to the decision that was given, particularly one decision which is very definite. In Paragraph 4, Sub-section (e), the question is: &ldquo;Should the public necessity require that a concession be given to a composite company?  Is the Irish Broadcasting Company, as set out in the White Paper, such in its inception, formation, and composition as to warrant the grant to it of the broadcasting concession.&rdquo;  If I correctly interpret the Postmaster-General's statement yesterday, it was to the effect that the answer to that question should be &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  If I am wrong in that interpretation, I think it is due to the Postmaster-General that he should put me right, but that is the real question at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Postmaster-General went further, and said that if the evidence before the Committee were before the Dáil that it would scarcely adopt that suggestion, and the Dáil is in this position that it has set up a responsible Committee which has examined this problem and has given us the benefit of its advice, and there is no minority report from any person on it.  We should be fair in this matter to the Postmaster-General, whose main idea, I take it, is to provide a service for the public, which he believes the public needs, and which in his opinion, ought to be provided in the way he suggests. On the question of evidence, I think it will be generally admitted that the ritual usually prevailing where evidence is taken, is that one promises to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  The Committee was faced with the still further difficulty that I am sure it had to take into consideration what was germane in evidence.  This was the first Committee <Col N="1108" /> which was formed to deal with a subject like this, and obviously there would creep in, in the nature of events, matters which would be entirely extraneous.</P>
    <P>I have seen one document in connection with this business which would not fulfil or would not be within that ritual which is inseparable from a person giving evidence, that when you are telling the truth you must tell the whole truth.  The other question then arises: if you are going to tell the whole truth, how far will it be relevant to the matter under consideration?  I must say that I believe, in so far as any disability in connection with telling the whole truth is concerned, it was entirely unintentional.  But there is this unfortunate disadvantage, that the telling of the whole truth might reflect on an individual, and that reflection might be intensified by reason of the position he holds in the State.</P>
    <P>The next question that the Postmaster-General dealt with in his statement yesterday evening was that there was connected with this proposed company a gentleman of the highest standing in the country.  I accept that unreservedly. I do not know that there is a more eminent, more respectable or more honoured citizen than Mr. Dowdall. I would have the utmost possible confidence in any company in which Mr. Dowdall would be interested.  But while saying that, I must state my experience with regard to these matters. I recollect somewhere within the last quarter of a century a company being formed in Dublin, with one of the most eminent citizens of the country as chairman, the late Alderman Meade.  The company was to have provided motor or electric bicycles, or something like that, at a cost of £7 10s. A good deal of public money was invested, and Alderman Meade found that he had to use all his ability and all his industry to preserve for the people who had put their money into it, by reason of the fact that his name was associated with the company, their rights, and only succeeded in doing so. That is not a position I would like to see Mr. Dowdall placed in.  I take it the Report of the Committee was that this was the judgment of the Committee in connection with this matter, and I <Col N="1109" /> take it that Deputy Johnson subscribed to that.</P>
    <P>Looking over the White Paper, we find that the conclusion come to in the second paragraph was that an Irish Broadcasting Company should be established, the main capital of which should be provided by the chief firms interested in the industry.  In the recommendation that is made from the Post Office is that condition fulfilled by the various companies, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5?  If I am correct, outside of No. 4, I do not know of any firm that does. Possibly No. 1 may be interested in this business, may have some knowledge of it.  But the facts are, that we appear to be dealing in this case with company-promoting rather than with companies that are in the business.  I do not think that the Dáil would subscribe to a proposition of that sort.  If, on the other hand, these companies have all the elements indicated in the second paragraph of the White Paper, I think it was due to the Dáil that the Postmaster-General should give the Dáil that particular information.</P>
    <P>Going further and examining the lines upon which this particular company should be formed, we are faced with, perhaps, the greatest complexity that I have ever seen or heard of in connection with the formation of a public company.  The company is to be established with a capital of £30,000, and by some extraordinary reservation £7,500 of that money is to be reserved to firms which, according to the second paragraph of this White Paper, should have a predominant interest in this particular company.  But there is a further liability on persons interested in wireless or broadcasting who propose to take a £5 share, that in order to establish, as it were, their <i>bona fides</i>, they must buy £50 worth of our Savings Certificates.  There would be, to my mind, a case for insisting upon the purchase of an equivalent amount in some sort of security if the sum subscribed were to be a proportion of the capital.  In other words, if there was to be liability to a call on the shares there would be some justification for asking for security in respect to the amount of capital that would not be called up.  But I fail to see, through <Col N="1110" /> any examination or otherwise, how you are going to establish your <i>bona fides</i> by purchasing £50 worth of Savings Certificates, to be left in the custody of the company, and to revert to the individual when he separates himself from the company.  I presume in separating himself from the company he would have to confer upon any person taking his place the same liability that he had when he entered it.  The position then would be that a person wishing to leave the company should forfeit his £5 and say: &ldquo;I am no longer a member of the company,&rdquo; and make the company a present of his share, if he could not get some person who would undertake to put up a £50 Savings Certificate.  What would be the position, I wonder, in the event of our ceasing to issue these £50 Savings Certificates?  What would be the position of a person who could not get any equivalent security to secure his <i>bona fides</i>?  The proposition appears to me to be the most outlandish one that I ever heard of in my experience. That experience may have been short, it may not have been varied, but I have yet to learn of a similar case in connection with any parallel concern.</P>
    <P>The Government's position in regard to this is to consider whether, as a question of policy, the British parallel of handing over to a company the exclusive broadcasting rights should be adopted.  That is number one.  Number two is: What proportion of the licence fees paid by individual holders of wireless sets should accrue to the State and what proportion to the proposed company?  I take it, as regards the second point, our main concern would be as to whether any service we would provide in the matter would be covered by those licence fees.  Apart from that it is a question of policy and for the Postmaster-General to recommend. I understand that we were assured with regard to that, that the licence fees would pay for the service. But another point arises.  It is upon this point I would like to make the position of the Government perfectly clear.  It is a difficult position.  It is the first time this question has arisen and I would like in considering it that the utmost possible justice should be done to an Extern Minister.  It is a <Col N="1111" /> constitutional position that we have scarcely had an opportunity of dealing with so far.  My interpretation of it is this: In considering this matter as leader of the Dáil I do not associate with that position my membership of the Executive Council.  In other words, this is a matter that should be decided by a free vote of the Dáil.  The Postmaster-General is responsible to the Dáil and, therefore, the weight of the Executive and of the Government should not be thrown into the scales one way or the other.  It is a business proposition upon which every Deputy ought to be perfectly free to exercise his discretion and judgment according to the best of his ability.  In saying that I may say there is no limitation with regard to Deputies in matters put forward by the Government.</P>

      <P>With regard to that question, the interpretation of this Report is a matter of considerable importance. The Committee finds that it is not yet in a position to say what its answers are to B., C. or D. of sub-Section 4. That question was developed to some extent by Deputy Johnson.  I do not altogether subscribe to his interpretation of it.  Unquestionably if a sum of money is required by any Minister, extern or intern, that sum of money must be provided by this Oireachtas in the manner and form laid down by the Constitution.  I do subscribe to Deputy Johnson's view, to this extent, that if an Extern Minister comes to the Dáil and says &ldquo;I want £20,000 for a service and the Executive Council would not give it,&rdquo; it is in the nature of a vote of want of confidence in the Government.  The Minister ought to be in a position to move for that vote of want of confidence.  To that extent I think we would maintain the Constitutional position and give the Dáil full authority in the matter.  I do not know of any other way in which the matter can be solved constitutionally, keeping within the four corners of the Constitution, which will be as binding on the successors of the persons forming the Executive Council, who <Col N="1112" /> have been so deposed by that vote of want of confidence.  To that extent only is there a difference between the Deputy's position and mine.  In the event of the Dáil passing a resolution to that effect, it is a vote of want of confidence in the Government, and the Government cannot keep office.  With regard to &ldquo;B.,&rdquo; which is the main question, I do not subscribe, and I think the Dáil is not asked to subscribe, to the proposal that by not accepting the recommendation in the White Paper we are committed to this expenditure out of public funds to set up a broadcasting station.  Other than that I do not think I have anything further to say.</P>

      <P>I have not listened to all the speeches on this question of broadcasting, but, as far as I have listened to them, it struck me that the subject was one of great national importance. It is scarcely necessary to say that broadcasting in the future may develop into one of the greatest elements of our national life.  Perhaps in the very near future broadcasting may find its way into a good many homes, possibly into every home.  When one realises the great educational influence that broadcasting will have in this and every other country where it is operating, to my mind it will be almost as important in a national and moral sense as our schools.</P>
      <P>Any Government or any representatives of the people who are careful of the national, as well as the moral, life of the nation will be anxious to see the system controlled in the same way as our national education.  Who in this country, I ask, would think of handing over national education to a private company or to a foreign company? There is no doubt at all about the importance and the influence of the matter that will be broadcasted.  It is not a matter, I think, that ought to be passed over very lightly, or on which a quick decision should be come to.  It is new and has been sprung upon us, and consequently deserves the most careful attention we could give it in all its aspects.  That is what impressed me in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we have had complaints about the harm the films have done.  If <Col N="1113" /> we are not careful about broadcasting we will have the same complaints, and in addition to a film censor we will have to have a broadcasting censor.  I think the Government would be well advised to move carefully in this matter and not shut its eyes to the vast importance and to the far-reaching effects of broadcasting.  I believe that broadcasting should be controlled by the Government regardless of the expense involved.  The matter that will be transmitted should, in my opinion, be carefully revised from the moral and national standpoint.  We do not want the minds of our youths contaminated with some of the stuff that the youths of other countries have been imbibing. We do not want to have a repetition in connection with broadcasting of our experience of the films.  I would ask the Minister responsible to look at the question from that point of view.  It has been stated that this is only a business proposition.  It is much more: it is a national proposition.  I quite agree with the Postmaster-General's statement of yesterday that we ought to be careful not to make this country an English shire.  There are vast possibilities in broadcasting.  It is only in its infancy and we want to be very careful as to who controls it and how it is used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President cleared the air a great deal. Possibly the last Deputy devoted his attention too much to what were merely suggestions in the Report of the Committee for it to be really quite clear to members of the Dáil as to what is the actual issue before them and what they will commit themselves to if they agree to Deputy O'Maille's motion. I take it that there are three definite recommendations in the Committee's Report and three only.  There are suggestions, and the Committee has asked permission to discuss these suggestions further in order to work out a practical scheme.  I take the three points that are dealt with, not exactly in the order on the Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is the issue of licences. That was really within the power of the Postmaster-General, and I am glad to say that he has already acted on that recommendation.  I do not at all share <Col N="1114" /> the pessimistic feelings he has with regard to his action.  I think he will be very glad he did so in the end.  The second point, more important perhaps to us, is the recommendation that a broadcasting station should be established. That has been recommended by the Committee, not merely as a pious opinion, as the Postmaster-General stated, but recommended with equal strength to that with which they recommended the first point I referred to. It merely says that they recommend the setting up of a broadcasting station. Until the approval of the Dáil is given to that, as a general principle, it does not seem worth while for the Committee to proceed with its work, because they could do nothing useful.  The Committee asked for a provisional approval of that.  As the President stated, that does not in any way, I take it, commit the Dáil to any State expenditure. The Committee asked permission to consider further what would be the best way of carrying out that proposal. I think the Postmaster-General is, as I said, more likely to get nearer that realisation if the Dáil at this stage gave that provisional acceptance that is proposed in Deputy O Maille's motion. As to the third point, there may possibly be some difference of opinion between the Postmaster-General and the Committee.  I do not think he made himself quite clear, and I think the President was not quite clear as to what exact attitude the Postmaster-General was taking on that point.  They seemed rather to cloud the issue.  I doubt very much if the Postmaster-General would advocate in the Dáil, at the present moment, that this particular concession should be given to the particular company as constituted in the White Paper.  That, I think, is the only point upon which there is any difference of opinion at all possible between the Postmaster-General and the Committee.</P>
    <P>I do not refer to other reasons, and I do not agree at all with the Postmaster-General that the Report, as issued by the Committee, casts any reflections on any other people but one. I fear the Postmaster-General has failed to realise the very big issue that was raised in this question, quite apart from the broadcasting problem at all. <Col N="1115" /> The Committee was definitely of opinion that this concession should not be given to a company constituted as described in the White Paper.  I think the Committee has given sufficient reasons in its Report to the Dáil for the Dáil not to go with the Postmaster-General if he was openly to advocate that that concession should be given to that particular company.  That is quite a different thing from saying a concession should not be given to some other company.  I might pass on to say that the White Paper was such that it would not be a practical proposition to consider it at all at present.  I doubt if that particular company mentioned in the White Paper is still a matter of practical politics for us.  We were told yesterday, and I think it is true, that Mr. Belton has already left the country.  If it is true, the proposal falls, and I doubt if any real difference remains between the Postmaster-General and the Committee.  If it does come to an issue I hope that the Dáil will give a definite expression of opinion as to whether this or any other State concession should be given to a firm against any single one of whose members can be raised the points that have been raised against this particular one.  I do not think there are any other recommendations of a definite nature in the Report.  The Dáil is merely asked to agree to the Committee going on further with its work on those lines.  It is not asked to commit itself to anything further than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to say that the Dáil ought to be thankful to the Deputy who has spoken last for putting the matter so definitely and clearly before it.  There was a tendency, I fear, to wander into things that were not altogether pertinent to the question at issue.  The motion before the Dáil, I take it, is that this Report, submitted by the Committee set up by the Dáil, should be adopted.  As Deputy Thrift pointed out, it contains three definite recommendations and a request that it should be given authority from this Dáil to continue its investigations into other matters.  The three recommendations that it makes are set out definitely. It states quite positively:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" />&ldquo;That the control of broadcasting in Ireland must be rigorously preserved a national control, and that the transmission service must not be permitted to become a monopoly in private hands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not so very long ago since we, on this side of the House, put before the Dáil a Bill in which we endeavoured to take back again into the hands of the people what was in effect, and is in effect, a national service and we found there was very considerable difficulty in doing it.  We would advocate, therefore, any proposition which would prevent, at this stage, what should be a national service getting into the hands of private monopolists.</P>
    <P>The second question, which is answered definitely, is whether or not this special company that is mentioned in the White Paper should be given this power.  The answer to that is equally definite.  If any member of the Dáil wishes to make up his mind as to how he should vote on the motion, he has only to ask himself whether or not he agrees with the suggestion of the Committee with regard to this question and the other two questions.  From what has been put before the Dáil by members of the Committee, and from what is in the written Report, I think nobody can come to any other conclusion but that the particular company that was suggested should not in any circumstances be given this right.</P>
    <P>As to the question of an Irish Broadcasting Station, I think that there can be no doubt that it is highly advisable that we should have an Irish Broadcasting Station set up.  It is not often that I agree with Deputy Gorey, especially on educational matters, but I do thoroughly endorse the sentiments which he expressed, that broadcasting can be made a service of great educational value, and of great value especially to the main industry of the country. For that reason I think it is essential, in the national interests, that the national authorities should keep control of it.  I have no hesitation in recommending the Dáil to adopt the Report of the Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, on the whole, as far as I can see, the Report of the Committee is an admirable <Col N="1117" /> one.  There is only one small point on which I wish to take issue with them. They speak of &ldquo;broadcasting lectures, educative or entertaining.&rdquo;  I do not like the word &ldquo;or.&rdquo;  I should like lectures to be educative and entertaining. But there were two Professors on the Committee, and they, presumably, are authorities on lectures.  They laid it down that no lecture that entertained can be also educative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Or vice versa.  As an humble lecturer myself, from time to time, I am very sorry that lectures cannot be entertaining as well as educative, but it is definitely laid down here as a dogma that they cannot be.  With that exception, I endorse the Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also, on this occasion, must enrol myself under Deputy O'Connell's banner. I am not a believer in State monopoly, in many things, but I do hold that a broadcasting service has certain tremendous factors in the development of a people, and is such a tremendous aid to education, that it ought to be under direct State control.  That is particularly so in regard to one item. It is proposed, among other things, to broadcast market reports, as I gather that the farmers are going to have listening-in sets.  From all we have heard here, I do not know how they are going to buy them.  Perhaps they are going to get Government grants to buy them in order to receive market reports.  I hope the market reports will not be solely concerned with the rise and fall of the price of jute, which, whenever I read the market reports, seems to be the chief item.  I do not even know what jute is; I believe it comes from India. I hope the Report will also refer to things of more interest to the farmer, such as the prices of butter, eggs, and poultry.  Surely you cannot run the risk of allowing some outside source not under direct State control to distribute those market reports, because unscrupulous people by broadcasting a false report might conceivably reap an enormous profit and might cause serious loss to the farmer.  That, I think, is a very strong argument for direct State control.  But I think we <Col N="1118" /> would be going too far if we, as the Postmaster-General apparently desires, should try to create an entirely self-contained Irish broadcasting service. Perhaps it is necessary, as the suggestion has been made, to say that I am not interested in the Marconi Company. I have not the smallest financial connection with it, and I have never been approached by anybody on behalf of the Marconi Company.</P>
    <P>I sometimes feel intensely insignificant because nobody seems to think it worth while to approach me in connection with these matters.  Apparently other Deputies are approached in this way.  But the only people who approach me in connection with financial matters are people who want to get money out of the Minister for Finance. That is not infrequent.  I have not been influenced in this matter by any outside consideration whatsoever.  But if we are to have proper education, we are not going to obtain it by building a Chinese wall around our country.  That is particularly so in regard to music&mdash; and most of the broadcasting is concerned with music.  Lectures are a comparatively subordinate feature.  I saw a letter to the Postmaster-General in which there was talk of broadcasting art.  Broadcasting has made immense strides, but I do not think it is yet possible to broadcast a picture.  Music is, undoubtedly, the main feature of every broadcasting programme.  The Minister, in his speech yesterday, dismissed all wireless which comes from outside this country as &ldquo;British music-hall dope and British propaganda.&rdquo;  I do not know if he has studied the programmes of the British Broadcasting Company.  The last time I &ldquo;listened-in&rdquo; in London, the propaganda, whatever it was, was not British.</P>
    <P>I must say that I never experienced so much Scotch&mdash;externally&mdash;in my life.  There was not one word of English in it.  I looked up the wireless programme for to-night and I looked for the &ldquo;British music hall dope.&rdquo;  I find that to-night the principal feature of the British Broadcasting Company's programme is &ldquo;Hamlet.&rdquo;  Hamlet, I suppose, is &ldquo;music hall dope.&rdquo;  Hamlet, which I, personally, should think enough for an evening, is to be followed <Col N="1119" /> by the third act of &ldquo;Parsifal.&rdquo; I think we, in Dublin, have never heard &ldquo;Parsifal.&rdquo;  The Postmaster-General cannot dismiss all these things as &ldquo;British music hall dope.&rdquo;  Neither can they be described as &ldquo;British propaganda.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we are a small country.  We cannot afford the resources of places like London or Paris or even Manchester in the way of orchestras or in the way of music.  We can get a symphony by Glazounov played at Manchester that was never played in Manchester before; it has been specially arranged for.  I do not think a Russian symphony can be called &ldquo;British music hall dope&rdquo; or &ldquo;propaganda.&rdquo;  There are to be supplied, too, movements from Beethoven.  The Fifth Symphony was played in Dublin last year, but I do not think that for ten years the other symphonies were played in Dublin for the reason that we have not an orchestra capable of the task.  We have a first-class military band; we have the nucleus of a chamber orchestra, and we have also a number of able 'celloists, but we have not any great orchestra, and if it is the intention of the Postmaster-General to deny us any opportunity of picking up these British and Continental concerts we will be at a great loss.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Postmaster-General, as a good patriot, would like to see some great musical genius arise in Ireland. But that genius is not likely to arise if we keep in a narrow circle and if the young composer never hears any of the really first-class orchestras or any of the really great compositions of the masters, none of whom, with perhaps one exception, was English.  By this extraordinary invention of wireless, you can bring first-class music to the door of almost everybody.  Even the poor boy, who cannot afford a set, will find some kind neighbour who will oblige him, or on some public occasion&mdash;a bazaar or something of that sort&mdash;he will be able to pick up some of this music.  In this way, it may have an influence on his life and may turn his mind to great things.  An Irish station will never be able to provide this on a really satisfactory scale.  I am afraid that if we <Col N="1120" /> are to have wireless established on an exclusively Irish-Ireland basis, the result will be &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo; four times a week, with variations by way of camouflage.</P>
    <P>Every performer will be told: &ldquo;The Postmaster-General wishes you to sing something of an exclusively Irish character.&rdquo; The result will be &ldquo;Danny Boy,&rdquo; and then, of course, we shall have the Postmaster-General's speeches about the Tailteann games to follow up.  I am afraid that after a short time the people will begin to look for variety, and I urge that in any scheme set up some opportunity of obtaining that variety should be given.  It is not a question of cutting out Manchester or Cardiff or London; it is a question of cutting out Paris as well.  I never &ldquo;listened-in&rdquo; in Ireland in my life.  I am a law-abiding citizen.  I do not go about with pirate sets, but I am told by people who do&mdash;as a matter of fact, I have been told by a Deputy who supports the Government&mdash;that you can receive Paris admirably.  In time, no doubt, we shall receive the United States.  It is my very deep and profound conviction&mdash;if I have spoken frivolously on this matter it is not because I feel lightly&mdash;that we cannot set up a Chinese wall around the country or establish an exclusive civilisation. If we wish to do that, let there be no wireless broadcasting, let there be no telegraphic cables, no foreign postal service.  If we are to pursue that policy let us pursue it to its logical conclusion. We are not a little island in the Atlantic between America and Europe.  For good or evil we are a part of Europe. In the past&mdash;the distant past&mdash;we influenced Europe profoundly, and I hope it will be our lot to do it again.  We shall not do it by pursuing a policy of isolation and by shutting out the education that comes from European civilisation.</P>

      <P>My position in this House as an Extern Minister provides that I may report to the House, and to the House only, on any particular project, and that it is solely a matter for the House to accept or reject any of my proposals.  I have necessarily, because of that subordination and responsibility to the House, to accept the decision of the Dáil without question. There can be no doubting that position. It is one that I suppose is understood by the House generally and by Ministers in a similar position to that in which I am.  As a matter of fact, it would be very strange if it were otherwise&mdash;for instance, if I were to act in the capacity of dictator in matters of this kind, if I were not subordinate to the Cabinet, if I were not subordinate to the Dáil, in short, if it was my own affair to introduce any proposal concerning public policy, and that that proposal should not be subject to close scrutiny and revision where revision is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When opposing proposals of the Committee yesterday in this Interim Report. I did not move an amendment for obvious reasons, nor did I intend that there should be any vote on the subject, as many members of the Dáil concluded, apparently.  I tried to impress on the Committee the rather obvious fact that it would be inadvisable to come to definite conclusions in regard to the matters contained in Section 8, in the absence of some alternative.  In any case there was no pressing reason why the Dáil should be committed to conclusions in regard thereto.  Not only has the Committee not provided an alternative, but likewise the subject matter arising out of Mr. Belton's relations with a Deputy of the Dáil, are yet to form the subject of investigation, I understand from a resolution passed yesterday, and it strikes me, without in any way defending, or attempting to defend, Mr. Belton, it is a rather unfair <Col N="1122" /> attempt to prejudice his position in advance. It is purely a matter for the Dáil to accept or reject the proposal put forward by the Committee.  In either event I will not have any grievance. In accepting the proposals, they throw directly on the Committee the responsibility of providing an alternative programme.</P>
    <P>I only hope the Committee will provide an alternative programme.  I am not taking a narrow view-point.  I am not taking the view-point that because evidence which was not at my disposal at the time I agreed to the formation of this Company, may have actuated them in a decision contrary to mine; that decision may not be justified, or that had I been on the Committee with that evidence at my disposal, I would not say I would have agreed with the Committee. It is quite possible I would. That is the point I want to emphasise. It is quite possible, were I on the Committee, and had the further evidence which this Committee had placed at its disposal, I may or may not have been in agreement with their decision.  But for me to question the decision at this particular stage, beyond the fact that I believe it would be more advisable to come to no decision on it, or to question the justification for that decision, is not a thing I could stand over or attempt to stand over.</P>
    <P>A great deal of play has been made with some apparent desire of mine to exclude foreign music.  Now, everybody knows that even if I tried to exclude foreign music, I could not do so, once the instruments were in the country. The thing is obvious to anybody who wants to understand it.  I have never for one instant suggested that foreign music and foreign propaganda should be excluded.  As everybody knows, there is such a thing conveyed through wireless as dope that will not assist this country, and dope that the people of this country do not desire. Nevertheless, that is conveyed through wireless.  Even if I tried to prevent its dissemination here, I could not succeed. It is my obvious duty to see that that material which is of the utmost importance to the life of this country material concerning the country and concerning its culture, should not be quietly placed aside to leave the field <Col N="1123" /> free for this foreign material.  That is my only standpoint, and I am glad to see that at any rate the Committee is satisfied that this standpoint must be maintained.  I know that many Deputies have been asking themselves why, in the first instance, this broadcasting station was not put up by the State, and why, in fact, we worried to introduce private capital.</P>
    <P>I know sufficient of the Treasury mind of the Government to satisfy me that if I had presented a proposal which might eventually cost the funds of the State tens of thousands of pounds per annum for the erection and maintenance of a broadcasting station, my proposal would get very short shrift; it would be scouted out.  Even if I proposed it to the Dáil, which now, apparently, is so anxious to speculate State monies in a project of the kind, it would be very sharply turned down. I would not dream of doing any such thing.  It would not get one half-hour's consideration by the Dáil or the Finance Minister, for the reason that I could not satisfy anybody that in investing State monies in a broadcasting station it would not be a reckless chancing of monies which are not our own and which we should not chance. I determined, therefore, that there was only one alternative in this matter, and that was an invitation to private citizens to organise, finance and control this station as had been done in England. I may say in this connection were I a private citizen&mdash;I said so to the Committee&mdash;and had I been invited to put my money into a broadcasting station, I would not do so.  It may not appear perfectly honest to invite others to do it, but that would be their own outlook, and very few of them responded. If I took that course, it was because of the fact that I had no alternative.</P>
    <P>The President wants to know is there any parallel anywhere to this proposal of ours, that shareholders in the proposed broadcasting company should deposit a sum of £50 in Savings Certificates. It would have been some enlightenment to the President had he been enabled to read the evidence on that subject.  There are parallels and <Col N="1124" /> definite reasons for this course.  I do not suppose the President thinks for one instant that a Department deliberately inserted a proposal of that kind without having direct justification for it or without having a parallel.  He also speaks rather lightly of companies which were the main constituent element. At least, three of these companies were as much involved in electrical business here as any of the other agents of foreign companies, because that is what they all are.  There are no manufacturers of wireless here.  In all probability the whole five companies would eventually have been engaged in electrical business.  I cannot, at any rate, say they would not.  But to talk of electrical people in this country is to stretch one's imagination to some length.  They are all only agents of British companies.  There is no real live manufacturer here.  We hope there will be, but at present there is not.  To suppose we could raise the necessary funds for a project of this kind from people who at the present moment are engaged in the manufacture of wireless, is to anticipate something that is not possible.</P>
    <P>I only want to assure the Committee that I have no personal objection, nor do I take any exception to a decision of theirs contrary to my judgment.  It would be very small of me to assume that, even though I was at the Head of a Department and advised by my Department, my opinion is of more importance than that of the Committee specially selected or that the decisions of that Committee are not based on grounds solely in the interests of the Nation.  Now whatever decision this Committee comes to I hope sincerely they will get money from the State for the erection of a Broadcasting Station. I can assure them so far as I am personally concerned and so far as my Department is concerned that they will find in us the utmost loyalty and co-operation in the carrying through of that project.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to say much in recommending this Report for the adoption of the Dáil, but I would wish to remark at the outset that in introducing the Report here yesterday I spoke for a considerable time in Irish, and there was no mention made of that fact in either of the two morning papers I saw to-day, although one, at least, of those papers is not slow to make statements that no Irish is spoken in the Dáil.  The Postmaster-General in his speech yesterday made one suggestion that was resented very much by myself and every member of the Committee, and that is that there was influence inside the Committee to interfere with its independence.  I am very glad that he has withdrawn that statement unreservedly, because, as far as the members of the Committee are concerned, there was no spirit moving them except to bring in a truly impartial report before the Dáil.  The Postmaster-General seems to think that because the Committee did not think well to recommend the broadcasting project suggested in the White Paper that we had killed <Col N="1126" /> broadcasting in Ireland.  That is not so at all.  The chief factor that decided the Committee in rejecting or recommending the Dáil to reject that proposed plan was the character of one of its chief promoters, namely, Mr. Belton. The Committee had not the slightest desire or intention to cast a reflection or aspersion on the character, honesty or integrity of a number of gentlemen who were connected with that project.  We quite realised that they are honest-minded citizens, men of worth and integrity in the nation.  We were also convinced, and we can realise, that the Postmaster-General is disappointed because his proposed plan is not being adopted.  We know that the Postmaster-General and his Department went to considerable trouble in studying this question.  It was a new question in Ireland, and a very complex question, and it took our Committee a considerable time to go through it.  But as I said the principal reason that made us turn the report down was the fact of Mr. Belton's connection with the scheme.  The Postmaster-General in his statement to-day twits the Committee that they are not putting up any alternative programme.  It was not the duty of the Committee to put up an alternative programme, because the Committee, as he knows, was appointed to consider the White Paper on broadcasting and report to the Dáil thereon.  We have made a suggestion here in paragraph 7 of the Report, which we had not time to develop, and on which we could not express a definite opinion until we have heard further evidence.  Deputy Major Cooper found fault with the words &ldquo;educative or entertaining.&rdquo; I must say that his speech to-day has been entertaining.</P>

I wish to recommend this report to the Dáil, and I am glad to see that the Postmaster-General has withdrawn his objection to it.

      <P>May I ask would it be in the power of the Committee, in making the final Report, to recommend the publication of all the evidence that it took and all the documents referred to in the evidence.  I am not quite clear in my own mind as to whether the decision on yesterday evening's debate has made it impossible for the public to have access to the evidence that we took, and if I am not out of order, I should like to point out to you that a great many of the speeches that were made drew largely on that evidence.  Some of us speaking on the matter were careful not to draw upon it until it had been decided to make it public.  If the decision of the Dáil is to accept the Report mainly on the vote of the Committee members who have signed it and to leave the matter there, is that to hold good also with regard to the final Report?</P>

      <P>No. The decision yesterday was to allow Deputy Cooper to withdraw his Motion for the publication of the evidence.  But Deputy Cooper stated, and I think he was correct in stating it, that he still had a right to move that the evidence be printed and circulated, at any future time.  I have not given any consideration to the matter because it had not been raised before, but at the moment I see no objection to the Committee itself recommending in its Report that the evidence should be printed and circulated. Therefore, there is no doubt that the matter is still open.  Does that satisfy the Deputy?</P>

I am most anxious that the public should know what is the evidence upon which that Report was founded, and there seems to be an idea in the minds, not merely of the public, but of members of the Dáil, that that is not to be made public, that instead there is to be substituted an inquiry into the Figgis-Belton affair.  I suggested yesterday, and I would like to repeat to-day, that it is wholly unfair to the members of the Committee if &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion to delete the Section, I take it, would be taken on a vote as to whether the Section would stand.  This is a Section to which we attach very considerable importance.  As I mentioned on a former occasion, many statements have been made on this question of housing as to the contributing causes to its being an uneconomic proposition.  In one case I mentioned where it had been alleged that the builders were making an undue profit, we arranged that something in the nature of a competition should take place between a building guild and builders, and I think that the result of that experiment scarcely disclosed the fact that abnormal profits were netted by builders.  The question is now being further examined, by reason of this particular clause, which would enable us to see, and to take steps if we do see, that excessive prices are being charged for building materials. I think that within a short period the Minister for Industry and Commerce will introduce a Bill dealing with the cost of living.  To some extent this particular service, by reason of its high cost may also affect the cost of living, but, apart even from that, if it had no such relation at all, we thought that the Minister for Local Government ought to have an opportunity to examine this question, as far as this particular operation of the service of the provision of houses is concerned.  If there be no case for examination, we are not going to examine.  If there be a case, no justification that I have heard has been alleged as to why we should not take this power.  The facts of the case are that the State, and the local authorities, are called upon to bolster up an uneconomic service.  It is the duty of both parties to that particular expenditure that they should see that no unfair impost is placed on a service of this <Col N="1130" /> sort which, on examination, could be remedied, and that a responsible Minister, having discovered that the costs are prohibitive, may issue an Order.  In other words, he may regulate prices by the issue of an Order, having examined the subject and having found that a case lies for such a regulation.  It is said that the control of certain articles produces an increase in prices.  Well, whatever are the causes of the increase in prices, definite steps must ultimately be taken by persons in authority to see that the evil course is arrested at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, it may be taken by some that it is an interference with business.  Well, business, any more than anything in this country, is not absolutely independent, and is not going to have its independence guaranteed if it is operating to the detriment of the remainder of the community.  There are not opportunities for other activities to get exorbitant prices.  You do not find farmers making a corner in cattle and refusing to let them out, except they get certain prices.  To that extent they have a market, and upon that market they are existing.  Here is a different class of market, which is controlled by a relatively small number of people.  With their genuine, legitimate, normal profits we are not concerned. We realise they are entitled to that, and we do not intend to interfere with it; but we cannot lose sight of the fact that perhaps the most uneconomic service in the State is housing.  We have asked for co-operation between the two sections&mdash;the builders and employees&mdash;but there is this other service coming in and cutting across it, that should be equally responsible to such arrangement.  Unless we have a provision such as this, no corrective methods can possibly be adopted if advantage is taken of the fact that certain articles are required and prices may be kept up.  I am prepared to say that it is not our intention to have this permanently a statute, that it is only for the life of the Bill that it is intended.  If there are any misgivings with regard to that, I am prepared to consider, between this and the Report Stage, to see if it is necessary that some words to that effect should be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In replying to the different statements made in connection with this amendment, I would like briefly to refer to one or two of the more important.  First of all, Deputy O'Mahony, yesterday afternoon, in replying to an observation of mine where I pointed out that the effect of this clause would be to keep capital, particularly British capital, from being invested in Irish industry, answered that by asking: &ldquo;Do we want British capital?&rdquo;  Well, if that is the intention of the clause let it be so stated.  If the intention on the part of the Government is to prevent British capital being invested in this country, let us have such a statement officially from the Government, but, as I understand the situation, that is not the view of the Government at all. With all respect to Deputy O'Mahony's experience in this particular matter, I would like to point out to him that the very same influences that will keep British capital from investing in these necessary industries in this poor country will also prevent Irish capital from investing in them.  Reference was also made to combines and the possible effect of combines.  I think it was Deputy Johnson who instanced the case of the cement combine.  I do not know whether Deputy Johnson is aware of the circumstances which brought about that combine.  In the cement industry to-day there is a competition that practically does not exist in any other industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cement is being largely manufactured in Germany, France, Belgium, and Holland, and all are in competition with the cement manufactured in Great Britain and Ireland.  I do not know of any industry to-day where the competition is so keen as in the cement industry, <Col N="1132" /> and in order to prevent that industry from being overwhelmed by these Continental competitors this combine was set up, and it has succeeded in maintaining that particular industry, which but for the existence of that combine would have passed away from us.  I would like further to inform Deputy Johnson that it is due to the existence of that combine that Irish cement can be purchased at a much lower figure in Ireland to-day than it can be manufactured at.  When Deputy Hewat pointed out yesterday that the effect of a combine sometimes is to lower prices, many Deputies, I think, were sceptical.  There can be no scepticism at all with regard to the application of that statement to the cement industry in Ireland.  I am quite satisfied from the knowledge I possess that but for the existence of that combine it would be impossible to get Irish cement to-day at the figure at which it is sold. Deputy Johnson in his effort to produce some evidence of profiteering mentioned some figures in connection with a local firm of builders' providers. From what I know of Deputy Johnson in the Dáil, I am sure he had no desire whatever to put forward these figures in anything but an accurate form, but in giving the figures&mdash;possibly I did not get them correctly, and I am sure they are not correctly published in some of the reports in to-day's papers&mdash;he said, as well as I could follow his statement in connection with this particular company, that in the four years preceding 1916 its average distributive profits&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I understand the position, of course, the years he has given now are somewhat different from what I understood he gave us yesterday&mdash;<Col N="1133" /> the years 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920, the years following 1916.  The average distributed profit to the ordinary shareholders in these years, was £4,375 per annum.  That would be an increase of £1,375 over the four preceding years. Am I correct in that?</P>

      <P>Very largely new cash. It does not make any difference whatever as to whether it is a transfer of reserves or new cash, but I understand in this case it was very largely new cash.  That is a point which I cannot recall that Deputy Johnson mentioned. I certainly think it is due to the company to say that the capital of the ordinary shares has increased by 50 per cent. during that period.  If that is so, relatively per share the profit is less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only got the amount before me as mentioned by Deputy Johnson yesterday.  He mentioned a lump sum for distribution.  I think it is only fair to the company&mdash; and I am quite sure if Deputy Johnson had been aware of this fact he would have mentioned it&mdash;to state that the ordinary shares of the company were increased by 50 per cent. during the period that he mentioned.  Consequently the profit of the company, owing to the increased capital, was increased.  That is the reason for the increase.  I am sure if we came to work out the figures we would find that, relatively in proportion to the capital&mdash;I am only taking the figures as they appear before me&mdash; the rate of profit <i>per capita</i>, instead of being increased, was really less in the following years.  The President has pointed out that builders' profits have been alleged to be abnormal.  Before we include drastic Sections of this particular nature in any measure, I think we <Col N="1134" /> want some proof of these allegations. The allegations have been suggested.  I have not seen them put forward with any force.  I have seen allegations put forward in connection with other industries. They have been proved, but I have yet to see any action on the part of the Government in connection with those industries.  Here, in connection with an industry as to which I am satisfied no such allegations can be supported, the Government moves and includes a Section in this Bill.  Why are the others to go free, and why is this particular industry to be singled out for special treatment?  I think we require to know something more than the President has given us.  Outside, as Deputy Hewat has pointed out, this Section is looked upon as eye-wash.  It is looked upon very largely as a sop to Labour.  The Government of this country ought to be above these sort of things.  If we are going to have Sections inserted of a drastic nature, let us have justification for those Sections, and none of us will take exception. But, in the absence of such justification, we have every right to take exception to a Section of this drastic nature.</P>
      <P>The President has also pointed out that this particular Section is not intended to go outside the purview of this particular Bill.  On that point my information is&mdash;and I have every reason to rely on the information, knowing the source from which it comes&mdash;that this Section will operate after the other Sections of the Bill have ceased to operate, and that it is the intention of those framing the Bill that it shall so operate.  May I read from Section 9, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Minister, whenever, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it appears to him expedient for the purpose of facilitating the building, reconstruction or repair of houses (including as well houses to which this Act does not apply as houses to which it does apply).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the use of telling the Dáil that it was not the intention that the Bill should apply outside the houses which come within its particular purview? Is it not quite clear from Section 9 that the operation of this Bill is <Col N="1135" /> intended to go outside the houses covered by the Bill?  If that is not so, let us clearly understand it.  I have complained on more than one occasion during the discussion that the Sections are so ambiguous it would take so much time to understand the Bill, that the time limit laid down will have expired before we really understand what it means.  By that time its operation or usefulness will have ceased.  I do not want to criticise the Bill unfairly, but I think it ought to be the desire of those putting forward such Bills that they should be understood by everybody, and that they should be made as clear as possible.  I suggest that the President, in view of what has been pointed out in connection with this Section 8, should reconsider the Section in the interests of the Free State and its industry.</P>

      <P>In reference to the last matter mentioned by Deputy Good, as I understood the President's statement, it was that this Section would not apply outside the time-limit of the Bill.  If you consider this Section it is obvious that as it applies to building material, it must apply to building material used for other houses as well as the houses mentioned in the Bill.  I think the President made it quite clear when he said it did not apply, that he meant it did not apply outside the time-limit of this Bill. He certainly did not say it did not apply to materials used for other houses that are not built under this Bill.  Therefore, I think the point mentioned by Deputy Good had no reference to the President's statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The pressure from Deputy Good apparently compelled the President to exhibit his weakness in this matter.  Supported by Deputy Sullivan, he now tells the Dáil that the proposals in Sections 8 and 9 are only to apply during the time this Bill is in operation, presumably 18 months, if the amendment which has now been accepted is finally embodied in the Bill.  I put it to the President: had he not better throw the thing overboard altogether, rather than attempt to apply a <Col N="1136" /> big principle of this kind to an industry such as the housing industry and limiting it by a promise that it would only extend over that period?  If he knows anything about the operation of combines and trusts, and rings and private arrangements, which do not appear in evidence, he will know that it would take him a good part of that 18 months to ferret out the facts.  I suggest that it is useless to proceed with this Section in the Bill under the pall of a promise of that kind.  It would simply mean that the Section is not intended to operate, and, as Deputy Hewat said, it was merely intended to be eyewash, or, as Deputy Good said, it was merely intended as a sop to blind those people who were demanding activity to repress profiteering in housing materials.  Far better abandon it altogether and make no pretence if it is intended only to apply to the houses likely to be built under this Bill or the period during which this Bill will operate.  Far better, I say, to run a risk and wait until the Government are compelled to do a much more drastic thing by the force of events, than make a promise of this kind and practically tie the hands of the Department which would have the duty of putting the Section into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputy Good that he is quite right in saying that I had no intention of misleading or of quoting figures which would have the effect of misleading the Dáil.  The figures I quoted were taken from the Stock Exchange Year Book, 1923.  It is quite true there were some changes in the capitalisation of the company in question. The note that appears in the Year Book tells us that in July, 1920, £10,000 from the reserve fund were capitalised, 40,000 additional ordinary shares being created and issued to the ordinary shareholders in the proportion of one new share for each share held and credited with 5s. per share paid.  There is no information as to how much new capital was supplied, if any.  Reserve funds were taken to help in the creation and paying up of new share capital and the dividends which I quoted show that there has been a considerable increase in the rate of profit as compared with the years 1913 to 1916.  The <Col N="1137" /> years I quoted were 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922.  I did not quote them to show that there was profiteering.  I am not going to allege, I am too careful of facts to allege, that a mere increase in profits justifies the epithet &ldquo;profiteering.&rdquo; Increasing profits may be obtained by other means than the exercise of the power of extracting prices from the public.  I mentioned these figures simply to show that the pleadings of bad times in the building industry are not quite so effective when we are dealing with building material profiteers. During bad times, so far as housing is concerned, and during the slump in the trade, profiteers were able to maintain the rate of profit and to distribute larger sums from profits than during the years immediately preceding the war or the earlier years of the war.</P>
    <P>The necessity for inquiring into the profits of companies which are alleged to be charging excessively is quite a different one and I shall have something to say on this matter if my amendment, No. 44, is reached.  I would just say that there is ample proof of the necessity for some control of prices in the building trades.  There should be no shame and no hesitation on the part of capitalists to have their books examined by a tribunal appointed by the Government if there is nothing to hide. It is one of the curious characteristics of capitalists that they are so anxious to hide the facts whenever any question arises as between workmen and employers, between a trades union and the employers' federation.  There is a determined and united resistance to any demand to publish the facts about the business.  That secrecy is responsible for a great deal of suspicion, not only in connection with one phase of public life, but this particular phase of public life, or what ought to be public life.  I hope the Ministry will stand by the Section and remove the promise which is implied in the President's statement, that it is only intended to refer to houses built during the period of this grant of £300,000; remove the impression that the President's statement has created that the Section has no real significance, and is not intended as anything more than what Deputy Hewat described as eyewash.</P>

      <P>I quite accept the President's intention as he has stated it, but I wish to put it to him that if that is his intention some definite amendment in the Bill, as it is before us, is really necessary.  On the face of it, I think the wording of the Bill is definitely against that intention. The Bill is not for one definite purpose, but for at least two purposes.  It is a Bill to facilitate the building of houses and to provide materials at reasonable prices.  There are certain Sections in the Bill which are definitely made operative for a limited period.  Having left these Sections, we come to this Section which definitely says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister may at any time, if he thinks fit.&rdquo;  I submit that makes it quite clear to anybody who comes to read the Bill afterwards, apart from the President's intention, that it can only be interpreted as meaning at any time, even after the 18 months have expired.  I can find no Section in the Bill limiting the operation of this to a limited period of time, 12 or 18 months, or whatever it may be.  I submit, if that is the President's intention, it will be necessary on the Report Stage to insert an amending section, making it explicit that the operation of the Bill is for a limited period, as has been done with so many Acts that came before us.</P>

      <P>I have heard nothing to alter the views I expressed last evening with regard to the maintenance of this Section in the Bill.  I think it is most desirable that it should be maintained.  As far as a lay mind can measure the powers conferred on the Minister in this Section, I feel that its operation must necessarily be confined to the particular purpose for which the Bill has been brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 has been referred to by Deputy Good as warranting the suggestion that these inquiries into the cost of materials may continue to be held by the Minister at any time in the future.  But if you read the Section to the end you will find that the power that is given there to the Minister with respect both to houses built under this present Bill and houses to which this Bill does not apply is power not to hold inquiries, but power &ldquo;to purchase or manufacture, store, transport and sell <Col N="1139" /> any materials that may be required.&rdquo; The power of inquiry ceases with Section 8, and in view of the statement made by the President I think we may rest satisfied that these powers are not going to be exercised except in association with the necessities of this Bill. Can any objection be raised to the exercise of these powers?  You may take it that the Minister is not going to initiate an inquiry into the cost of building material or any particular class of building material, until a satisfactory <i>prima facie</i> case has been made for him.  If such a case has been made for him, then I say that there is a duty cast upon the Executive Government to hold an inquiry and to see that the purchasing public will be enabled to buy materials at a legitimate and reasonable price.  How can such an inquiry re-act upon any firm that is only making a legitimate profit in the sale of materials plus the necessary contingencies that big firms must allow for in such circumstances?  If it is proved and proved conclusively that a firm is profiteering, then I say that that firm should be called upon to pay the penalty for so doing, but if proof is not forthcoming sufficient to establish the fact that the firm is profiteering, what is the position, then, of that firm?  Why, its name for fair trading will have got a backing that otherwise it would not have.  Its position will be strengthened in the mercantile world.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Good to the question of the manufacture of cement in so far as Irish interests are concerned.  It is the first time that I heard that the action of any manufacturing Trust in England was directed with purely philanthropic intentions towards Ireland.  You will find that the determining factor in the Englishman's mind, as it would be in our minds in such circumstances, is to do the best they can for themselves. The present low price of cement in this country is not due to the fact that a Trust has been created in England.  As long as that Trust in England was free from the competition of the Continent, as Deputy Good knows very well, they made the people of this country bleed in respect of the prices they charged <Col N="1140" /> for cement.  He knows also that the only two cement manufacturing companies that we had in this country were bought up by this Trust.  He knows also that these works were closed down, or suspended, when it suited the English firms to do so.  If there is a resumption on a relatively small scale to meet the requirements of the country that resumption will be entirely due to the fact that the Government of Saorstát Eireann and not the English Government is now functioning here.  Capital and profits in the past, to my mind, do not affect the question inasmuch as the Ministry is not going to deal with what was earned in 1920 or 1921.  What the Ministry will deal with, if occasion should arise, is existing circumstances, and if it is found that the charges with respect to any particular class of material are considered too high and the Minister is satisfied on the evidence that he has before him that such is the case, then it is the duty to hold an inquiry to determine whether the charges are warranted or not.  Deputy Good suggested that this inquiry is a sop to labour, but I say that this inquiry will cut both ways, that when the merchant is making his case he will take very good care to show what part labour plays in computing the price of the article.  For that reason it is an inquiry that will cut both ways, and because of the convictions I hold generally on the matter I intend to give my support to the Section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to be an expert in the matter of interpreting a Bill or an Act of Parliament, but I think that the assurance that the President has given to Deputy Good that the principle embodied in this Section (8) is not intended to have a permanent effect should mean that a great deal of the strength of his opposition to the inclusion of this Section should disappear.  Under Section 2 a definite sum of money is laid down to be contributed by the State&mdash;a sum of £300,000.  As a matter of common sense I fail to see how, once that sum of money is spent, the provisions of Section 8 can apply at all.  It appears to me to be perfectly evident that the provisions of Section 8 simply refer to <Col N="1141" /> those building transactions which are covered by the sum of money which the State is going to put up in connection with building.  There is one aspect of the question that appears to have been overlooked by nearly every Deputy, and more particularly, I think, by Deputy Good.  There is an old principle that the man who pays the piper shall call the tune.  While I, as a matter of general principle, would distinctly object to Government interference in the management of a business, in this case they are interfering in the managing of a business in which they are investing some of their own money. For that reason I consider they have a perfect right to have some voice in the control of the operation of this Bill and in the spending of their own money. On general principles I think the question of Government interference in business is decidedly bad for business and bad for the commercial future of any country, because if a man is running a business and he is to be interfered with by outside agencies all initiative on his part ceases, and he can never build up an efficient business. For these reasons, I think it is perfectly right that the Section should stand as it is.</P>

      <P>The time of this Bill is a year and ten months.  I think it would be very inadvisable that we should pass legislation of this sort dealing with a temporary subject, and seek to make certain provisions of the Act permanent.  It would not, I think, be a respectable way of doing the thing.  It would be, as it were, using a sum of £300,000 to get a grip on services that you would be scarcely justified in getting. There is one danger that I put to the Deputy, and those for whom he speaks&mdash;that the mere fact that the State has got to go into this business, is doing more towards raising a state <Col N="1142" /> of Socialism here than anything that might be done to the contrary by us in seeking to limit our costs in this regard. Day after day, and year after year, new burthens are being placed upon the State, and the State is being called upon to discharge duties that 20 or 30, or 40 years ago would not be thought of.  We come forward with a huge sum of money&mdash;huge in relation to the amount we can afford&mdash;and we seek to take, as Deputy Egan says, some precaution, so that we will not be plundered.  Then we are told: &ldquo;Hands off our businesses; we must be allowed to develop them in our own way.&rdquo; Why do you not develop them?  What is keeping you from doing it?  Why not provide these services out of private enterprise?  You are not able to do it.  You may say the fault is not exactly your own, that the fault is with the people on the other side.

      <P>These inquiries usually take a long time, and they do not get farther than the allegations made on one side or other.  If we make inquiry on one side, and then are faced with making it on the other side, the man who requires the house, and who is the innocent sufferer at the hands of both, has naturally a grievance against us.  We endeavoured, by doing something like this, to bring a little common-sense to bear on both sides of the question, and to get some real result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not desirous of leaving the Dáil under any misapprehension in regard to building materials.  This clause will deal with building materials, whether for this service or not.  I have some justification for saying that.  It might be put up to us that, granted there was the co-operation we asked for by labour leaders, they would be prepared to accept a lower charge for building houses for themselves.  I would not accept that.  This Bill is not entirely a philanthropic measure on the part of the State.  In the first place, it is a duty.  In the second place, if by reason of this Bill we can bring down the cost of living, I expect our liability under the Damage to Property Act will <Col N="1143" /> be reduced.  I am not going to recommend to the Dáil that a great, big organisation, such as the Builders' Providers, should have an absolutely free hand at a time when, through misfortune, the State is called upon to construct a large number of houses throughout the country.  It would not be fair.  I think we agreed that this Bill will have a life of four months beyond eighteen months.  I objected to that extension.  I would rather the Bill had a life of only twelve months, and that we would be able to put up this number of houses each year.  I am not at all satisfied in connection with this measure that restrictive clauses, such as those clauses which would tend to embitter either the business people or the employees, are desirable.  I do not think it would be advisable to stereotype for all time any such statute as this.  I hope the time will come when it will not be necessary.  If that time did come, even within the twenty-two months during which this particular clause will operate, the Minister would not use it.  But it must be admitted that during the war period, during the period of control even of certain commodities, building requisites produced enormous profits.  I understand that in connection with the control of timber, something beyond colossal profits were made.  Men became millionaires.</P>

I do not believe anybody stands for it. I do believe that just the same as the people on the other side anticipate and expect a far better standard of living, the business people also expect a higher percentage of profit than they did during the war.  We must shake the two of them.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 45 and 46, to delete the words &ldquo;a local&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;an,&rdquo; and in lines 48 and 49 to delete the words &ldquo;in any county, county borough, town, district, or other area,&rdquo; and in line 50, to delete the word &ldquo;local,&rdquo; and in lines 51, 55, and 58, to delete the words &ldquo;in that area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to delete certain words which restrict these inquiries to local inquiries.  If the amendment is accepted, the inquiry which the Minister has power to institute <Col N="1145" /> may be a local inquiry, but it may also be a national inquiry.  It is unduly restrictive to say that this inquiry, which the Minister may order if he thinks fit, should only be a local inquiry in any county, county borough, town, district, or other area.  One might say, of course, that &ldquo;other area&rdquo; would include the whole country. But when one indicates localities in a Bill of this kind, the inclination will be rather to restrict than to enlarge the provisions.  And if one is thinking that &ldquo;other area&rdquo; would include the whole of the Saorstát, then there should be no objection to removing these limitations in the clause.</P>
    <P>There is reason, no doubt, for having local inquiries into local excess.  But unfortunately for the country the grievances which we suffer from may be in many cases imposed from outside, and restrictions imposed even upon local merchants and factors by outside authorities lead to excessive prices.  I would like the powers of this inquiry to include the whole country, and in so far as it would be possible, even to go outside the country.  In the previous discussion some questions were raised as to the possibility of regulating prices to the detriment of the consumer or to the detriment of the Building Materials Provider, and to show that this is not a mere local trouble, I propose to draw the attention of the Dáil to certain matters which came under the notice of an inquiry in England.  The importance of this is that combines and trusts in England restrict the customers of those combines and prevent the customers of those combines, for one article, buying outside the combine, therefore preventing an Irish buyer of light castings, for instance, going to Germany for light castings under pain of being refused any article which the combine might supply.  It would be of interest to the Dáil, and probably to Deputy Good who knows all about it, if I remind him that the British National Federation of House Builders was the body which last year demanded that there should be an inquiry into the activities of some of those trusts and combines, and I do that to show that is not merely a labour bogey.  The <Col N="1146" /> house builders themselves were the people who demanded that this inquiry should be insisted upon.  References have been made to the cement combine, and Deputy Good has asserted that but for the existence of that combine cement could not be bought in the Saorstát at anything like present prices.</P>

      <P>Does not that prove to the Dáil that that combine is able to fix and to regulate the prices?  Is not that an effective answer to Deputy Hewat? Even if it is a low price, it is the price which the combine is able to fix and, as Deputy O'Mahony has pointed out, but for the fact that there exists competition from other countries, such as Belgium and Germany&mdash;which competition may very conveniently be also bought up and brought into the combine one of these days&mdash;it might be higher.  It all goes to prove the necessity for some control, not only on local prices, but national prices, and the powers which outside combines are able to bring to bear upon local merchants and providers.  It may be found that the State, notwithstanding its powers, is not able to control effectively the big corporations, and it may be possible in the days to come to enter into treaties with other countries or governments, as may be friendly disposed to this view, to control effectively those combines, not only in England, but in Ireland.  Treaty-making of that kind will, I am sure, be highly appreciated by the general mass of the public.  But there is another association about which I want to say a word or two, the Light Castings Association. This was the subject of an inquiry by a British Parliamentary Committee. That British combine has had an effect here.  It has its hands on the throttle of the traders in this country, and should be able to influence the prices in this country, and should be the subject of an inquiry, so far as the State is able to inquire into the conduct of a body <Col N="1147" /> outside its jurisdiction.  The British Committee reported on the Light Castings Association that &ldquo;that Association had not merely controlled, but fixed the prices of 95 per cent. of all the material they produced for the purpose of house building.&rdquo;  That 95 per cent. effectively determined the price of the other 5 per cent.  I am sure Deputy Hewat would agree with that.  This Association was formed in 1911, and it declared its purpose to be as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The object the Association has in view is that of raising and keeping up the prices to the buyers of goods and articles made and supplied to its members.&rdquo; That is the first object.  The second is: &ldquo;This shall be done by means of pooling arrangements, so controlling production that prices will rise naturally and inevitably as they always do when supply is brought into equilibrium with, or as soon as may be, a little below demand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They laid it down that there should be a pool so far as the production of materials necessary for house building is concerned, and they were to take the output of pre-war times as a standard. They fixed a standard based upon the output of pre-war times, and any firm which produced a certain quantity over that standard was to be penalised to the extent of 7½ per cent. of its additional trade, not its profits, while the less efficient firm which did not produce up to the standard set by the Association was to be at liberty to draw from the pool 7½ per cent. of the total value of what it had produced pre-war.  &ldquo;In effect,&rdquo; said one witness, who had been a member of the Association, &ldquo;by this process of pooling the Association penalises progress and encourages laziness.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee reported that &ldquo;the powers of the Association, which wields such control over industry, are so open to abuse as to make it a menace to the well-being of the community. This Association, which controlled 95 per cent. of the output of light castings, which so largely enter into house-building operations, formed in 1911, immediately afterwards sent out a circular adding 10 per cent. to all prices <Col N="1148" /> which even had enabled profit to be made.  Within four months an additional 10 per cent. was added to the cost of the light castings.&rdquo;  This was not during the war, but in 1911.</P>

      <P>I am quoting this to show that it is possible for these combines to regulate prices.  &ldquo;Within four months an additional ten per cent. was added to the cost of light castings connected with house building, while in another three months an additional 5 per cent. was added.&rdquo;  So that within seven months, on the authority of the British Parliamentary Committee, that great protective Association had added no less han 25 per cent. to the prices charged for light castings.  The point is this, that it controls the profits and the prices that the retailers or the merchants may charge.  It penalises every merchant who buys from anybody outside the Association.  There is where I saw the necessity exists for having this wider inquiry.  One large London builder, for instance, sought to buy baths in Germany, and he was as enterprising as the President would like house builders to be.  He chartered a steamer and brought in 5,000 baths from Germany.  They were put into the houses at 38/- a bath, as against the price charged by the Association of 70/-.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government in considering the fiscal problem should have regard not merely to the admittedly restricted view of the matter taken by the Fiscal Inquiry Committee as indicated in their final Report, but should examine the problem in the broadest possible aspect&mdash;due regard being taken of all the factors affecting the general well-being of the Saorstát.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the only purpose why this discussion has been resumed is to enable me formally to terminate it.  I think the motion that initiated this discussion has fully served the purpose I had in view.  Deputy Johnson regretted, in his opening remarks, that these terms did not call for a declaration of Government policy. Now as a matter of fact I think it did secure that to a certain limited extent, but that was not exactly what my intention was.  I do not think there is any Deputy so foolish as to imagine that my purpose was to get the perfectly harmless and innocuous motion which I tabled adopted by the Dáil.  I think that would have been rather a futile <Col N="1150" /> achievement.  But what I did wish to obtain was a full, frank and non-party discussion on the question of fiscal policy in the Saorstát, before the Government mind had set into rigid mould in regard to it.  That, I think, was essential if the fiscal system and economic life of the State is to proceed on enlightened and intelligent lines of development.</P>
      <P>Certain Deputies have taken exception to the tone of my allusion to the members of the Fiscal Committee.  I think, though, that such Deputies fail to appreciate what I desired in that respect.  Sir, I came to bury Caesar, not to praise him.  I have dealt with no member of that Committee in any personal sense, and I decline to accept the invitation that Deputy Cooper issued to me to do so.  I have taken them as a body constituted to advise the Government and the people upon the best means of promoting the economic well-being of this State, and it is no answer to my analysis and exposure of the fallacies of the Report to tell me that its authors are men of notable academic distinctions.  In the absence of any rebutting arguments to the charges I have made, these distinctions add only to the seriousness of my indictment. I have seen a suggestion in a certain quarter that these gentlemen should be retained in the service of the Government to formulate a definite fiscal policy, and it would not surprise me in the slightest if from the same source it was mooted that the members of the Committee, or some of them, should sit as a permanent tribunal to determine Government policy in regard to the partial Protection foreshadowed by the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If such a statement was made seriously here I would feel it my duty to oppose it as strongly, as strenuously, as I could, and I hope I would have the majority of the Deputies with me in such an attitude.  If I am asked for proof, or evidence, to justify such an attitude I should refer to the Report as ample evidence of the incapacity of its authors so to act.  However, I trust to the commonsense of the Government to avert such a contingency.  I listened very carefully to what I might call the <Col N="1151" /> counsel for the defence, and in not a single speech directed towards that end did any Deputy rise to the height of confuting, or even challenging, my main contention, namely, that the Report was inadequate, incomplete in its survey, inaccurate in its premises, and misleading in its conclusions.  Not a single Deputy who differed from me on this matter has ventured to attempt to indicate where I erred in any one of these assertions.  I think they were very wise, indeed, to refrain from essaying such an impossible task. What was the nature of the arguments of those who endeavoured to defend this Report?  I think it is obvious to every person who listened carefully to them that they were feeble, irrelevant, and unconvincing.  I listened carefully to such speeches as were delivered when I was present.  I read in the Official Report the others that were made by those who criticised my analysis of the Report and, with one exception, there was hardly one of those speeches which was not at least a qualified admission of the wisdom of Protection under certain eventualities. That exception was my friend, Deputy MacBride, who, though he lustily belaboured Protection, gave us no case for Free Trade, and made no attempt to show that the countries that had pursued a Protectionist policy had not benefited by that policy.  Deputy MacBride, in the course of his remarks, said: &ldquo;Was it Protection that made Germany prosperous?  It was no such thing.  It was the despised professors who made Germany prosperous.&rdquo;  If Deputy MacBride would look up his history of pre-war Germany again, and trace the source of its sudden commercial and industrial uprise, he would find that it could all be attributed to the adoption of the economic teaching of Frederich List, whom no one could accuse of being a Free Trader.  It is quite true that the patriotic research of certain German professors added materially to that prosperity, but they were professors who followed List, and not Cobden, and certainly none of them told the German people that the principles of Free Trade would act like drops of petrol on German brains, and clean out the greasy blots on these brains&mdash;that <Col N="1152" /> is if there are any German brains. That kind of stupid insult is reserved for the Irish people, to be served out to them by, of all men of the world, the person who is paid by the Irish people to teach national economics in the National University.  I am sure that it is no wonder, if such are the national economics taught in the National University, that five professors brought in such a verdict.</P>
    <P>Take the other Deputies who spoke. Deputy Egan wound up by saying he had an open mind on the question.  Deputy Cooper was not a doctrinaire Free Trader.  Deputy Heffernan was only a conditional Free Trader.  The Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;I am not saying for a moment that it may not be possible even now, at this stage of our affairs, to select a system of protective tariffs which will help to develop certain industries in the country, without seriously affecting the position of the farmer, or affecting the position of the farmer to any extent.  I think it can be done, and I hope it will be done.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said: &ldquo;Moreover, I think it is recognised that it may be possible to devise a limited system of protective duties which will not injuriously affect overhead charges of our main industry, agriculture, and which can be modified, and, perhaps, extended, according as measures for the relief and development of the industry begin to show substantial results.&rdquo;  I was interested to note that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had become a convert, or a disciple, of Mr. Baldwin, because I noticed, in the course of his statement, he quoted from the declaration of the ex-British Premier, that the question of Protection is more one of expediency than of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the circumstances are somewhat different.  I am supporting the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his declaration, and I did not support Mr. Baldwin. When the Minister had finished his statement, I felt inclined to say: &ldquo;We are all protectionists now.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, the fall of the walls of Jericho does not seem to me to be such an amazing thing after witnessing the <Col N="1153" /> collapse of the doctrinaire Cobdenism. The report of the Committee is the first serious challenge.  But yesterday it might have stood against the world, and now none so poor as to do it reverence. There are two very significant things which I think have been amply established by this discussion.  One is that few, if any, Deputies accept the Report as an authentic guide in the framing of a tariff policy for the Saorstát, and the second is, that those Deputies who endeavoured to defend the Report, and rebut my charges against it, have, even to a limited extent, signally failed to make good their case, and, therefore, my task in reply to the few comments made, has been rendered comparatively easy.  The speeches, or the supposed criticisms of my statement by Deputies who do not see eye to eye with me, were, in the main, really criticisms of statements I did not make, and of views which I did not advance.</P>
      <P>Here and there in the Report there were occasional statements made in flat opposition to those by myself.  For example, Deputy Bryan Cooper stated that in his experience the cost of living in the protectionist countries of Western Europe is higher than in Free Trade Britain.  Fortunately that is a point upon which a good many Deputies, probably, have had personal experience, and can judge how far he is accurate.  I do not know, but it may be that when the Deputy travelled in Europe like one of &ldquo;The Innocents Abroad&rdquo; he fell into the hands of Continental profiteers, or it may be that this higher cost of which he complains is due to an alteration in the standard of his tastes and requirements when he travels in Europe.  At any rate, I know that my experience has been entirely the opposite to his.  When he states that in one city on the Continent he bought a hat and paid 8s. or 10s. more for it than he would pay in this country, I can only reply that he has been either unfortunate or extravagant, because in another Continental city I bought a pair of shoes for 10s. or 15s. less than I would pay here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone said Irish <Col N="1154" /> manufacture.  It so happened that when I was in this particular City I had a new pair of Irish shoes, and they were pinching my feet, and I thought I would test Deputy Cooper's theory on the relative prices.  I may have been lucky, and Deputy Cooper may have been unlucky, but these are not the tests to apply to an analysis or examination of this question.  The test to apply is the standard of cost of living of people ordinarily resident in these countries as citizens.  The Fiscal Committee stated that a protective duty acts as a hindrance to the development of an export trade.  We know that the protectionist countries of France, Belgium, Germany, and the United States are with increasing success capturing the markets from Free Trade England. I think it is universally recognised that that successful competition is attributable largely, if not entirely, to the benefits or advantages conferred on the manufacturers of these countries by the lower cost of living.  Quite recently the Bradford Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution calling for protection of the home woollen market against French competition, and I think the picture of the centre of the most highly organised woollen manufacturers in the world calling for help in that way points a moral that it is well for all interested in this matter to take notice of, and that is the kind of handicap that the protection of the home market imposes on the French woollen manufactures.  Deputy Cooper complained that I had not furnished him with sufficient stop press news about tariffs.  I made no pretence of exhausting the subject, though I think I dealt with it fairly fully, and I quoted instances from the experiences of other countries ranging from the present time back to the early forties of the last century, all pointing to the fact that a protective duty does not, and never did, increase the general prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper fastened upon the earliest of these examples I gave, and endeavoured to discredit my argument with the contention that it was out of date.  He ignored all the rest, and then complained that I had not given him stop press news.  I have no doubt that if I had confined myself to examples <Col N="1155" /> from recent times that the Deputy would have declaimed in an equally impressive way that I was basing the conclusions on the existing abnormal times, and that, therefore, such conclusions were unreliable.  That kind of tactics would be pardonable in a schoolboys' debating society for the purpose of scoring a small point, but one looks for a more serious treatment of this matter from a Deputy in an assembly that is charged with the well-being of the nation.  I hope if Deputy Cooper should again intervene in a discussion such as this that he will discard the transparent device of the Free Trade special pleader which looms so largely in the Report.  I am glad to see that there is still a Cassabianca among the Farmers' Party.  I was sorry, and it was tragic, I think, to witness the pitiful show that the Farmers' Party made in this discussion.  I would, however, make an exception in the case of President Wilson&mdash;I mean Deputy Wilson, and I am sure even the Deputy himself, if he were here, would not resent a little accidental prophecy.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Wilson made no pretence of understanding the subject, he did, in his very brief contribution to the discussion, display a commonsense readiness to learn facts and be guided by them.  But the other Deputies&mdash;Deputies Heffernan, Gorey and Baxter&mdash;certainly did not give me the impression that they had even the most superficial knowledge of economics of any kind.  Deputy Gorey, that distressed agriculturist who goes to one of the highest-priced tailors in town to buy his clothes, said: &ldquo;Those who are readiest to criticise agriculture are those who know least about it.&rdquo;  Then he and his colleagues proceeded to criticise Irish manufacturers and to lecture them on how to run their business. I think it may be taken for granted that the Irish manufacturer knows at least as much about his industrial concerns as Deputy Gorey or Deputy Baxter knows about agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan simply took as the text of his speech the Report itself and proceeded to re-state those contentions which I had already disposed of.  My answer to his speech is the statement <Col N="1156" /> I made in moving this Motion, a copy of which I hope to furnish the Deputy with at an early date.  I hope he will read, mark, learn and inwardly digest its contents.  If there was anything wanting to show the weakness of his argument it was supplied in his own words.  He said: &ldquo;My facts may be wrong, but these are the facts which I have been told.&rdquo;  In another place he says: &ldquo;It is rather difficult to prove statements of this kind.&rdquo;  Then, after quoting Harold Cox, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a quotation not from a German professor who lived eighty years ago, but from an English economist living at the present time, who should be thoroughly conversant with economic affairs, and his words are not meant to apply to the Irish question at all, and have no reference to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Heffernan would be well advised, the next time he intervenes in any discussion of this kind, to equip himself with more reliable authorities. He suggested in his speech that the Committee was restricted by the terms of its instructions from exploring fully into the question of tariffs.  I disagree with that suggestion altogether.  My complaint against the Report consists very largely in the fact that whilst the Committee inquired very fully into matters entirely irrelevant to such an issue, they have completely ignored certain considerations and facts which are fundamentally important and essential to such an inquiry. I did not see anything in the Terms of Reference requiring these five professors to apply the telescope to the blind eye in one case and to the good eye in the other.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there was very little in the speeches of the Deputies who opposed me that I need dissent from very strongly.  I agree that this subject is a very wide and many-sided one, and that, apart from its inherent importance, it requires the most careful study and thought in order to cope with its many complexities.  But I fear that there was a tendency, probably unconscious, amongst those who are sceptical as to the advantage of a tariff, or its effects on a particular industry, to misrepresent the facts which I have advanced, <Col N="1157" /> because they conflict with the views that they have imbibed or inherited, rather than arrived at by a process of reason.  I would say to them that this subject is wide enough and complex enough, and the relevant facts are numerous enough, to allow of honest argument and honest divergence of opinion, without the necessity to misrepresent each other.</P>
    <P>For instance, most of those Deputies to whom I am alluding, join issue with me for having introduced the example and experience of the United States in developing my argument.  As a matter of fact, I introduced the name of that country only once or twice, and then in association with the names of other countries, for the purpose of illustrating certain specific points which I was making.  I have never suggested, and I do not suggest now, that the example and experience of any one country afford conclusive proof one way or the other.  But that example and that experience are helpful.  The example and experience of a number of countries, spread over a long period of time, are so helpful and so good that to ignore them in this connection would, I think, be an act of the most egregious folly.  I find myself at variance with one or two points made by the Minister for Agriculture.  I am sorry he is not here.  In the course of his statement he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My statement is that the immediate effect of a comprehensive system of Protection would lead to an increase in prices.  I wonder does Deputy Milroy deny that?  He interrupted me a good many times, but he did not deny that.  Of course it is axiomatic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister would have realised that it was the severity of his rebuke that subdued me into reluctant silence.  It is quite true I did not interrupt him with a denial at that moment, but I shall repair that omission now.  I do deny his contention most emphatically.  This phrase, &ldquo;Protection will increase prices,&rdquo; has been championed by speaker after speaker, without a single attempt at proof, until it has become almost as familiar to our ears as that rather mournful watchword of the Minister <Col N="1158" /> for Finance, &ldquo;I must balance my Budget.&rdquo;  It has even found an echo outside.  I read that at a certain gathering the other day, when they were discussing this question, another gentleman, also a professor, delivered himself of this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was his opinion that Protection would make the country poorer. The country was not going to get rich by making people poor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He has taken one sentence of his own as an authority for making a subsequent declaration.  In my statement I cited several incontestable instances to show that the effect of protection in such contingencies has been to lower rather than to increase prices.  And what am I met with as a reply?  There is no analogy.  I suppose all these countries are thanking God that there is no analogy between themselves and Ireland.  We have had from Deputies and Ministers declarations and conjectures and the prophetic predictions of the wise young Minister for Agriculture.  You cannot argue with a prophet, now matter how young he is. You can only contradict him.</P>
    <P>The Minister says his contention is axiomatic.  If he had said it was rheumatic he would be much more accurate in his definition.  He says, &ldquo;There is no issue in reality as between Protection and Free Trade to be considered, but merely whether we can impose a tariff on any article of import or protect any existing industries or protect the birth of any possible potential industry in the country.&rdquo;  I hope he is right, and that the issue is in reality going to be narrowed down.  I have made it perfectly clear in my statement that I favoured Protection only in the special economic circumstances of our own country, and for its own particular industries.  If I were a Britisher my position on this question would not, probably, be very much different.  I might, quite possibly, be expressing the views that Deputy Cooper so ardently voiced here some time ago.  I did not advocate protection without discrimination.  Here are my grounds for dissenting from the statement of the Minister for Agriculture. Close on 40 Irish manufacturing industries gave evidence before the Fiscal Committee in support of protective <Col N="1159" /> tariffs, and each one of these, with one trifling exception, were prejudiced or damnified by the Report, not upon the merits of each case, but upon general principles.  The Committee went so far as to say, that so far as economic considerations entered into the question of protection of these industries they entered objections.  In other words the whole forces of the free trade economists were mobilised and drawn up in battle array to deny these industries the right which is accorded to small industries by practically all countries outside the one we are living in, and the one that Deputy Good referred to as the &ldquo;Sister Isle.&rdquo;  I think he should have called it the step-sister isle.</P>

To Ministers and Deputies I would say: &ldquo;Go to the files of evidence given before the Fiscal Committee, and you will get sufficient evidence.&rdquo;  To those editors of the newspapers I would say: &ldquo;Examine the advertising columns of your own journals, and in the advertisements of foreign wares you will find details, illuminating and conclusive.&rdquo; In the face of the evidence given, and the manner of its treatment by the Committee, what is the use of suggesting that the only issue to be discussed is the one advanced by the Minister for Agriculture?  I am very glad, however, if he speaks authoritatively for the Government, that the issue is going to be narrowed down to this small compass. I am also quite satisfied that the issue will be dealt with much more satisfactorily, and much more profitably, now that the Free Trade battle front has been broken and its generals, or shall I say, its retainers or camp followers routed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made another statement which seemed to me to impress the Dáil, or many Deputies, considerably, especially Deputy O'Sullivan, which rather surprised me, as I understand he is a Professor of Economics, and I thought he might know something <Col N="1160" /> about the subject.  The Minister stated in the most emphatic, deliberate and impressive way that 80 per cent. of the total wealth of the country is derived from agriculture.  I am not challenging that figure.  I ask, does the Minister ever reflect that that might possibly be a symptom of weakness and decay, rather than one of economic strength?  Supposing we had no manufacturing industries at all, and supposing the present system went on until industry was so depressed that it had vanished from the State, the Minister's percentage would go up to 100 per cent., even though agriculture went down to almost zero.  I am really surprised that such plausible and fallacious arguments should be put forward seriously, if the Minister really understood the implications of such an argument.  I tried to prove in my statement that Protection was more necessary for small farmers than for any other section of the community. Not a single Deputy made the slightest attempt to controvert that statement. Probably no Deputy was in a position to do so.  I deny altogether that Protection&mdash;I mean an intelligent, discriminating Protection&mdash;will inflict any hardship on the farming community. On the contrary, it will create employment in industrial pursuits for the surplus rural population.  It will lead to a cessation of the dole, which at the present time is paid in the main out of the farmers' pocket.  It will help to create a more diversified home market for agricultural produce, and, therefore, lead to the development of agriculture on healthy lines.  The Minister made one final desperate effort to put up some sort of case.  He was driven to his wits' end to discover something that may be described as a healthy tendency in agriculture at the present time.  He suggested, or implied, that we are developing our dairy industry.  The fact of the matter is that we have far fewer milch cows now than we had 60 years ago, and double the number of cattle of other kinds, which is quite the reverse, especially in regard to the matter of milch cows, in every other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>That certainly is not to me an indication of the development of that industry. <Col N="1161" /> I am perfectly at one with the Minister in his desire in regard to the necessity of ameliorating the lot of the farmer.  I cannot accept the idea that there is any antagonism between the farmer and the manufacturer.  On the contrary, I think they have much in common.  As Arthur Griffith once expressed it, one is necessary to the other, and an injury to one means a hurt to the other.  I am one of that small, but tactful, minority that issues no messages of goodwill to the Irish people at the beginning of the new year.  But you will note that there were others here not so considerate of the people's feelings.  There were several ministerial messages sent out.  There was one which struck me more than others. I forget the Minister who was actually responsible for it.  It had something to say about hard work, and I conclude, therefore, that it was issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  My additional reason for arriving at that conclusion is that if this Fiscal Report is to be taken as a clue to the means by which to provide work in this country, then, in a short time our homes, our shops, and our warehouses will be stocked exclusively with foreign affairs.  Hard work and efficiency, we were told, is the only way to build up the nation.  Hard work is a very fine thing.  I have had a very close acquaintance with it in my life.  It is a good thing, once you can get it and then get paid for it.  I wonder do the people who issue these admonitions realise that there are many thousands of people in this country to-day who are asking what are they going to work at, what are they to become efficient in?  Are they to work hard at drawing the dole?  I believe there is even a statutory limitation to the amount of energy that can be expended in that occupation.  Are they to become efficient in standing at street corners, watching the lorries bringing in foreign goods, the importation of which has been in a great many cases the cause of their unemployment?  Are they to become efficient in listening to their children crying for the bread they cannot provide, or are they to become efficient in dying like rats in a trap, or are they to become efficient in filling <Col N="1162" /> paupers' graves?  If there is any virtue in, or any sincerity behind, these messages that were issued at the new year, calling upon the people to work hard and to become efficient, if it is not a mere ghastly joke at the expense of those unfortunate people who are impotent to save themselves from social wreckage or expatriation, the Government will devise their policy and their administration so that those to whom these admonitions are addressed can give effect to them.</P>
    <P>I think this debate has served a useful national purpose.  I think the issue involved in it can yet secure something of even greater national value.  We are emerging now from a period of clashing hatreds, and though those hatreds have been forced into a sort of quietude, they have not yet been finally extinguished.  I think that some cause or some issue that would raise the minds of all sections above, and away from, those violent convulsions and those bitter antagonisms that swept the country during the past couple of years, would bring a blessing of infinite magnitude to this nation.  I believe this issue we have been discussing can do that.  The discussion on it will arouse not destructive passions but serious thought, and examination of what are the real factors that enter into a genuine conception of freedom. If that term is to be something more than a mere political shibboleth, it must be a synonym of national health and advancement.  Political institutions which are not based upon and expressive of economic freedom are simply instruments of servitude.  I believe we won a great battle in the Treaty of 1921.  We won fiscal powers, the use of which I am advocating to-day. England's attempt at the economic conquest of this country was thereby bottled.  Let us make sure, by using our fiscal powers to the full, that the bullocks of the grazier, which figure so largely in the calculations of my critics in this debate, shall not yet become the means by which that conquest will eventually be consummated. There are many other things I might say, but the time draws to a close.  I wish, before I sit down, to say&mdash;seeing that the Minister for <Col N="1163" /> Finance is present&mdash;that I believe I will have in him a staunch ally in what I am urging, and an ally who will advocate the achievement of the cause I have indicated on the lines I have indicated. I say this because I find in the &ldquo;Free State&rdquo; paper of May 27th, 1922, an article by him in which the following occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The plan adopted of excluding certain classes of British goods last year, though only carried out to a small extent, did demonstrate in its operation how quickly Irish industrial enterprise would respond to the stimulus of Protection.  Enough, indeed, was done to convince all who examined the results that the erection of an Irish tariff wall&mdash;even one of the most moderate dimensions&mdash; would immediately be followed by extraordinary industrial expansion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> I wish to finish by congratulating the Minister for Industry and Commerce on embodying in his statement the acceptance of the principle of Protection. It was a small, a cautious, perhaps even a timorous beginning, but it was a beginning on the right road&mdash;a road on which the Saorstát policy will yet go very far, according as it is realised that it is the only safe way by which we can now achieve the realisation of all that this country struggled for in the harsh and sorrow-laden days.</P>
