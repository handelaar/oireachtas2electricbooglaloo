      <P>Advances of the kind referred to by the Deputy are made from the local loans fund, and reference to the Estimates will show that provision to the extent of £107,000 is being made in the current year as a grant in aid of the Fund to enable it to make such advances.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I have not any information on that subject. But I should say that the extra cost of the interest that the Government have to pay would have a bearing upon the rate of interest that would be charged.  I do not think it likely it would be possible to make issues from this fund at the pre-war rate of interest, but I would undertake to make inquiries into the matter.</P>

      <P>Nicholas Nolan failed to prove to the satisfaction of the Committee of Inquiry into Resignations and Dismissals from the Royal Irish Constabulary that his resignation on the 10th September, 1920, was caused by his national sympathies, and his application was accordingly not favourably reported on to the Government.

In accordance with paragraph 26 of Defence Order No. 30, dependent's allowance, which was being paid to his wife at the rate of 28s. per week, should have ceased on that date, but was paid up to the 22nd March.  As from the date of reattestation, in accordance with paragraph 25 of Defence Order No. 30, marriage allowance at the rate of 10s. 6d. per week was issuable.  A cheque in settlement of arrears of this allowance, allowing for an overpayment of the former allowance, has been sent to Mrs. McCormack.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state why dependent's allowance has not been paid to Mrs. Margaret O'Gorman, Monabricka, Ballygran, Charleville, Co. Cork, in respect of the services of her son, John O'Gorman, No. 4066, who joined the National Army at Charleville on the 15th August, 1922, and who is at present attached to the 10th Infantry Battalion, stationed at Ennis, Co. Clare; if he is aware that this Volunteer's wages prior to enlistment were 16s. per week, plus board and lodging, of which, as the parish priest and local Peace Commissioners are prepared to vouch, more than 12s. per week was contributed to his mother, and if, in view of this, he will give instructions for the payment of allowance to his mother from the date of his enlistment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In her application for dependent's allowance dated the 7th May, 1923, Mrs. O'Gorman stated that prior to enlistment her son John had been in receipt of £36 per annum plus board and lodgings.  This statement has been verified.  When a reasonable sum is deducted to cover the cost of her son's clothing, pocket money and incidental expenses, it will be found that his net contribution to <Col N="464" /> the support of his home was less than the minimum required by regulations, namely, 12s. a week, before an allowance might be issued.  Mrs. O'Gorman's claim was therefore disallowed. I regret that the disallowance must stand.</P>
      <P>I may add that the regulations governing the matter were based on an obligation on the part of a soldier to contribute to his home a reasonable proportion&mdash;about a third&mdash;of his Army pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>TADHG O MURCHADHA (for Pádraig O hOgáin) (An Clár)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he has received complaints from ex-members of the National Army because of the failure of the Army Authorities to give the usual 28 days' pay, ration and dependents' allowances on their discharge; and from members of the National Army because of the failure to give proficiency pay to clerks, storemen, etc., in the different Commands, and because of the failure of the Army Authorities to give the 14 days' leave authorised by Defence Order No. 30, or pay and rations in lieu thereof, and if he will take steps to remove those grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the alleged failures of the Army Authorities have occurred recently.  Since the 31st March last, except in a limited number of special cases, the grant of 28 days' furlough with pay and certain allowances has not been made to soldiers about to be discharged.  That grant was properly authorised only while general demobilisation, which ceased about the date mentioned, was in progress.  Subsequently, except in the special cases referred to, soldiers who have taken their discharges have done so in the ordinary way on completion of service.  I am, however, considering the advisability of issuing grants in such cases on a smaller scale than formerly.</P>
      <P>As regards additional pay for soldiers employed as clerks and storemen, it was not, and is not issued in all cases.  Only men specially competent in the occupations mentioned receive extra pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Defence Order No. 30 does not authorise the grant of any leave, but a General Routine Order dated the 24th November, 1923, did so in the cases of soldiers who presented themselves for reattestation.  The grant was withdrawn on the 4th March last by Defence Order No. 45, which sanctioned the issue of a bounty of £3 instead of leave, but only to soldiers who re-attested prior to the 31st March.</P>
    <P>Having regard to what I have just said, I think the Deputy will find that most, if not all, of the complaints he has in mind are not justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that answer, in view of the fact that a soldier discharged from the Army on completion of service is bound to be out of work for a time, will the Minister not consider the desirability of giving at least twenty-eight days' leave on full pay with rations allowance, as is done in other armies, in order to avoid discredit to the Army and the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the period of enlistment of soldiers in other armies is longer than in the National Army, and to that extent there would be a difference.  The matter of issuing a grant in such cases on a smaller scale than formerly, is at present under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <P>A Committee of Inquiry (not a Commission) into the working of the Insurance Act in the Saorstát has been appointed.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  To inquire into and report on the advisability of the continued maintenance of the system of National Health Insurance in its present form, and to make any recommendations which the Committee consider proper in that connection.</P>
      <P>2.  To consider whether it is desirable to institute a system of medical treatment on a contributory basis, and, if so, to advise as to the form which such system should take, and</P>
      <P>3.  To examine into and report on the question whether the medical services at present assisted or maintained out of State or local funds can be improved as respects efficiency and economy, and, if so, in what manner, due regard being had to any recommendations made under the preceding paragraph.</P>

Dr. Rowlette took an active interest in the Irish Public Health Council and may be regarded as a specialist in that matter, and the Rev.

      <P>Robert McCullogh, of Coolnakeran, Old Leighlin, claimed unemployment Benefit at Bagenalstown on the 21st April last.  That claim was disallowed under Section 8 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, for a period of six weeks from the date of the termination of his last employment, as the claimant had left his employment voluntarily and without just cause.  Mr. McCullogh appealed to the Court of Referees against the decision, but the disallowance was confirmed, and both the claimant and the Secretary of the Association were duly notified of the decision.  Though it was competent for the applicant to lodge another claim after the expiration of six weeks from the date on which he had left his employment, it was not untill the 30th June that he renewed his application for benefit, and there will be no delay in dealing with this claim.</P>

It is urgent because of the fact that has come to my notice that the Committee has already been set up and has begun to discuss <Col N="473" /> its procedure, and it is certainly of public importance inasmuch as the future of several hundred thousand people under sickness has been discussed without any consideration being given to the representation of such people upon the Committee.

      <P>I want to refer to the form in which sub-section (2) of Section 7 and sub-section (2) of Section 8 left the Dáil and to compare or contrast them with the present form of the Bill.  Section 7, sub-section (1) provides</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;that the Minister may with the sanction of the Minister for Finance from time to time, by order, regulate and appoint rates of pay and allowances, including conditions applicable <Col N="476" /> thereto, to be paid to the several ranks and to the several grades of each rank, of officers and men, of the Gárda Síochána.&rdquo;  Sub-section (2) went on to state &ldquo;Every order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution is passed by Dáil Eireann within the next subsequent 21 days on which Dáil Eireann has sat annulling such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such order and any recommendations in respect of such order which shall be made by Seanad Eireann within the said twenty-one days shall be duly considered by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The important thing there is sub-section (2) of Section 7.  It was considered that these regulations with regard to pay and allowances were strictly analogous to money legislation and that the procedure with regard to money legislation, and the relative powers of each House with regard to money legislation, should be adhered to in accordance with Article 35 of the Constitution.  It is not claimed there is an identity.  These regulations are regulations, not legislation; but there is a very real analogy between regulations dealing with pay and allowances and money legislation.  We felt that the proper thing to do in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution was to follow the same procedure and to assign to each House the same relative powers as they would possess with regard to a Money Bill. That idea has been challenged in the Seanad, and the Seanad has inserted these amendments, No. 1 and No. 2, claiming the same power with regard to these money regulations as the Dáil. The principle underlying Article 35 of the Constitution, as I take it, is that the moneys levied from the people in taxation shall be disposed of only by the vote of those who are elected directly by the people and who are responsible directly to the people.  If we agreed that that is the underlying principle, then that principle applies equally to these regulations which are covered by Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> I am not claiming, and do not wish to be taken as claiming, that the Seanad by the insertion of these amendments, have contravened the letter of the Constitution.  They have, I contend, contravened the spirit of the Constitution and contravened the principle which underlies Article 35 of the Constitution.  It is well that the Dáil should know that, but despite these considerations which I have urged, I intend to ask the Dáil to accept amendments 1 and 2.  I will state very clearly my reasons for that course. The temporary Act under which the Gárda Síochána are at present functioning expires this month.  If in the meantime this Bill has not become law the members of the Gárda Síochána will have as much and as little powers of arrest as the members of the Dáil.  They will have exactly the same powers of arrest. That is not a situation which I would like to see coming about and I do not think that we, even, should take the chance or the risk of such a situation coming about.  Moreover there is this fact&mdash;that if in the future, the Seanad should annul regulations under either Section 7 or Section 8, and if the Minister or the Dáil felt that such regulations had been unreasonably annulled, or unproperly annulled, it seems to me that the obvious course for a Minister in such a situation would be to insert before the regulations &ldquo;Be it enacted by the Oireachtas of Saorstát Eireann that,&rdquo; and to pass these regulations in the form of a Bill through this Dáil.  I am not asking any ruling from the Ceann Comhairle in the matter but I venture to express myself the opinion that if that were done, such a Bill would be certified as a Money Bill and the maximum powers of the Seanad in the matter would be the powers, as defined in Article 35 of the Constitution; powers of recommendation, these recommendations to be considered in due course by the Dáil but to be in no sense mandatory on the Dáil.</P>
    <P>That is the position.  I disagree with the action taken in the Seanad in regard to these two sub-sections.  I think the amendments they have inserted are at any rate contrary to the general <Col N="478" /> principle underlying Article 35 of the Constitution.  I am not contending that they have contravened the letter of that Article but at the same time I submit to the Dáil we should not risk a situation in which the Gárda Síochána would really have no statutory basis and would have no more and no less powers of arrest in the country than civilians.  I do suggest, that if in the future, the Seanad were to act unreasonably with regard to these regulations dealing with pensions, pay, and allowances, of the police forces that any Minister in my position would simply put these regulations through the Dáil in the form of a Bill.  It would be passed through all its stages in one day and that Bill might be reasonably expected to be certified as a Money Bill.  I have decided to ask the Dáil to accept these two amendments but I thought it proper to explain very fully to the Dáil, and as clearly as I could, the exact significance of them and to state at some length my own views with regard to them.</P>

      <P>I am going to support the motion, but I want to say a word or two with regard to what the Minister has said.  I do not feel that he is justified in taking the stand which he has taken.  He said that while the letter of Article 35, no doubt, has been complied with the spirit has not.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to put it negatively rather than positively and say that the letter of Article 35 does not seem to have been contravened but that I suggest to the Dáil that the spirit and principle of Article 35 have been contravened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion as to what the spirit is.  I judge the spirit by the letter in this case, inasmuch as the second paragraph of the Article goes to considerable pains to define what is meant by a Money Bill, and as far as I can read it, there is nothing there which would suggest that a Bill which contains provisions relating to the conditions of service in the Gárda Síochána can be held to be a Money Bill.  The regulations which the Minister has proposed to make, or the <Col N="479" /> orders which may be made, under this section are to deal with conditions of service and, as I hinted yesterday, there ought to be some security for the men engaged in that service by which their conditions or their pay may not be variable entirely at the will of the Minister for the time being without check. The check of the Dáil, one would have hoped and expected two years ago, would have been more likely to be effective than the check of the Seanad, but my experience of the last two years shakes that faith, and I am looking forward to a Seanad which will be as directly representative of the electors as the Dáil is to-day, or purports to be, I think that the Seanad was entitled to claim that orders should be liable to the veto of the Seanad as well as to that of the Dáil when you are dealing with conditions applicable to service in the Gárda Síochána.  The Minister suggests a possible method which he would have to apply in future, namely, the introduction of legislation, and even suggests that it will be possible to pass such legislation in the Dáil in one day. That is, I hope, an expectation which will not be fulfilled except in very grave mergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that my desire in this matter would be better satisfied if we adopted the practice, not of putting orders or regulations on the Table, leaving them there to be read or not as Deputies may think well, then waiting for twenty-one days to pass, and if no motion is brought forward disagreeing or disapproving of the orders, they automatically come into operation.  If, instead, we adopt the practice that every order or regulation shall be formally brought before the House, and shall be subject to a resolution of approval, the need for legislation in this matter would probably not be so great and not be necessary at all.  It would be better practice to get formal approval of any regulation or order of this kind than to wait for positive disapproval. I think, in this case, when we are dealing, not merely with the collection or the spending of money, but with the terms and conditions on which money shall be paid to any public servant, that the Seanad is justly entitled under <Col N="480" /> the Constitution to take the line it has done.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister did rightly to raise this matter here because, although the question itself might not be judged to be of very great importance, its commitments in regard to these constitutional implications are of very considerable importance.  They do really call up a controversy that has engaged a very considerable amount of attention in other legislatures.  The actual wording of Article 35 is in very great part an echo of these earlier controversies. I think it will be found that the wording has been carefully designed to be inclusive of all matters that might justly be certified as belonging to the prerogative of the First House, and that the spirit and intention of that proviso are carefully covered and also that it cannot be really argued that there is a contravention of the spirit if there is not a contravention of the letter, because the letter has been designed very carefully not only here, but in the drafts which are embodied in this, so as to include every possible kind of question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made this statement that there was no contravention of the letter of Article 35 I meant this and no more: that these regulations are regulations under Bills and therefore are not covered specifically by Article 35, but they are regulations which are analogous to legislation and my contention was that the analogy should have been adhered to when we were deciding the relative powers of each House and so on, and the procedure and relative powers of each House should be the same as Article 35 prescribes for legislation.  Clearly these are money regulations, setting out the pay, allowances, and pensions which shall be paid to members of a particular police force, and are not Bills, but I am contending, if the subject-matter of these regulations were embodied in a Bill, that Bill from my view, would be certified as a Money Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I had gone one stage further than the Minister and assumed that if these matters, instead of being embodied in <Col N="481" /> regulations were embodied in the provisions of a Bill, the Seanad would still have a function.  I recognise in dealing with a matter of this kind, that one is necessarily dealing with it&mdash;the Minister also recognises that from what he said&mdash;under very great difficulties, because these are difficulties where you, sir, would have the decision, and no one has a right or desire to take such decision from you, and we are discussing by conjecture what you might, or might not do, under conceivable circumstances.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless the matter is of some importance, and where I think the difference occurs is this, that if these regulations were embodied in a Bill decreeing exactly what the salaries of certain persons were to be and the terms and conditions of their services, then the Bill, not being a Bill that specifically allocates money for these purposes, is legislation and not a money Bill.  If the various matters in Article 35 are taken one by one&mdash;and I have had an opportunity of examining them one by one and of analysing them from this very point of view&mdash;it will be found that they have all been specifically designed to let through legislation, the effect of which may be the spending of money as distinct from legislation, which itself orders the spending of money.  That is why I think, in respect to legislation the effect of which is the spending of money, the Second House would have a function, whereas as regards legislation which itself orders the spending of money, although the difference seems to be a distinction without a very great difference, it has been hitherto the case in the precedents from which this Article has been drawn, that in the first the Second House would have a function of criticism, but in the second it would not have that function.</P>

As I said, this is a matter where you, sir, have to establish precedents of this kind, and I imagine everybody is heartily happy that you have to do so.  I am only giving <Col N="482" /> my own personal view, seeing that it has been raised here, that after very careful consideration of Article 35, in regard to each of the separate items between semi-colons, the Seanad not only observed the letter of it, but, in observing it carefully, they intended to include every matter that could be excluded from its intention.  Even if the regulations were not regulations, but were clauses of the Bill, still the Seanad would have a function equal to any function it exercised in normal ordinary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest that my point in this matter is entirely on the words, &ldquo;including conditions applicable thereto.&rdquo;  That is, applicable to rates of pay and allowances. Inasmuch as the same question arises on the next section, I may point out that the conditions which the Ministed may by order apply to pensions and gratuities may be such as to bring them within the sphere of legislation, certainly within the scope of consideration by the legislature, not merely by the Dáil.  That is to say, they include more than the actual payment of money; they include conditions which have to be complied with before money can be paid.  Those conditions, even within the scope of this Bill, may vary considerably at the will of the Minister, and if we allow a Minister to make conditions of the kind, which, even within the scope of the Bill, may be variable as between one class of officer and another; between one class of Guard and another, it seems to me to require that the legislature should have the right of veto, and that the Seanad ought to be allowed to deal with a matter of that kind equally with the Dáil.  If we were dealing only with money, I think the Minister's contention would be right.  Where he has a phrase such as this, &ldquo;including conditions applicable thereto&rdquo;&mdash;that is applicable to payment of and rates of pay and allowances within the phrase and within the scope of the Bill&mdash;many varying conditions may be made by the Minister which ought to be subject to criticism by the legislature.</P>

      <P>In Section 8 (2) all the words after the word &ldquo;by&rdquo; in line 56 deleted, and the words &ldquo;a resolution of each such House&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>This amendment raises the same point, and I move it with the same reservation that I made in the previous amendment.  I think it is wrong that an assembly, composed as the Seanad is, without any constituents, without any responsibility, in the political sense, should deal with moneys levied in taxation from the people.  &ldquo;Pensions, pay and allowances&rdquo;&mdash;these are matters of finance, matters of money, and if the Seanad says that such a rate of pay is too high to pay to members of the police force, or, alternately, that it is too low, and on that ground annuls regulations, then you have a position in which men who were not elected by the people&mdash;some of whom were nominated by the President, and some of whom were selected by the Dáil&mdash;are interfering directly in matters of taxation. If the Seanad were to say that the rate of £3 per week is not enough for the Gárda Síochána, and that it ought to be £6, or alternately that it ought to be £1, or £2, you have direct interference with taxation.  It comes to that.</P>

      <P>The principle is wrong, and is recognised by Article 35 of the Constitution to be wrong.  I believe myself that no great harm is done by acceptance of the amendment because any Minister in the future who felt that his regulations had been unreasonably or improperly annulled by the Seanad would take the road of legislation.  I submit regulations with the words &ldquo;Be it enacted by the Oireachtas&rdquo; before them, would in due course be certified as Money Bills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again make clear that the Minister in his protest has misrepresented what I believe to be the intention of the Article of the Constitution, and the contention of the <Col N="484" /> Seanad.  He says if the Seanad desired to interfere with questions as to the rates of pay, that they ought not be entitled to do so in the spirit of the Constitution.  That is not the point.  If you had a Minister for Justice, and a subservient Dáil, prepared to say that one of the conditions applicable to fixing the rate of pay should be that a man shall be a member of a trade union or that he shall not be a member of a trade union, or that he shall never have been a member of a trade union&mdash;that, I say, is a condition that ought not to be taken out of the purview of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is in effect a legislative enactment. It is not dealing with the rate of pay or the payment of moneys.  It is dealing with conditions which might well be reserved to legislation, and it is because of the possibility that the Minister might make a condition applicable to the pay of the members which ought not to be allowed to pass without criticism, and if to be criticised, being in the nature of legislation, it ought to be criticised equally by the Seanad as by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>In the matter of explaining my own position quite clearly, I want to say that the Deputy is using the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; there in far too broad a sense.  He is really speaking rather of the conditions of membership than the kind of condition referred to under sub-section (2) of Section 7.  This regulation will deal with pay and allowance and pension; only.  The Bill, as a whole, may be said to be dealing with the conditions of service of the police forces and conditions of membership and so on.  One cannot talk about these regulations until they are in being, but with the samples and precedents of those regulations before me, I contend that they deal with money and money only and in their terms will be found to fulfil the conditions necessary for a Money Bill.</P>

He made them in a disorderly manner, and as you, sir, ruled the discussion out of order, there was no reply.  Of course I used the term &ldquo;disorderly&rdquo; in the technical sense.  Deputy Johnson objected to the provision in the Bill that a soldier should not join any political society, because he said it was a hardship on the soldier not to have an opportunity of expressing his opinion on a matter like the alteration of the terms of his service, and the Deputy practically put forward the suggestion that the soldier should form and join a political <Col N="487" /> society.  That is what I understood. At any rate the suggestion which the Deputy made was that the soldier should have the opportunity of expressing his opinion on Bills of this character.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to correct that very wrong impression. I hope it is not general.  I certainly had no suggestion to make that soldiers should be allowed to join and form political societies.  I pointed out that inasmuch as soldiers were to be precluded from such, they would be unable to reach Deputies in the Dáil, who would be in a position to voice their complaints.  I suggested that there should be allowed plenty of time between now and the permanent Bill for the soldiers' views as to regulations, and the effect of regulations to be made as well as for the views of the headquarter's staffs.  They might be considered as well as those of the headquarter's staff and of the people responsible for the formation of orders and regulations and the like which are carried out in the Temporary Act.  The Minister said then that the experience we had under the temporary Act would enable the Dáil and the Ministry to be more perfect in the presentation, shall I say, of the permanent Act, that not only would the experience of the headquarter's staff be available, but the experience of the men working under these conditions might be available.  Not having a political society is it to be that they should have access and freedom to approach Deputies.  The point was that there must be an opportunity provided for the men working under the temporary Act to be able to express their grievances or their contentment as well as the headquarter's staff.</P>

      <P>I hope that I have helped Deputy Johnson in order to get his meaning clear.  I read his speech and I did not gather that that was what he meant.  Even so he did not indicate how the members of the ordinary rank and file are going to give expression to their opinions.  I gather now that it is through Deputies, but that is forbidden by regulations.  I do not believe the regulation <Col N="488" /> is a good one.  The soldier has political rights; he has a right to vote for Deputies, and I think he might be allowed to approach the Deputy who represents his own constituency.  If the soldier does not approach a Deputy but complies with the order then his wife or his mother writes to a Deputy and there is very little difference except that sometimes we get a more inaccurate account of the case.  Approaching a Deputy is, I agree, a better way for the soldier to express his opinion.  What other way have any of us to express our opinions?  One way is to write to the papers, another is to organise a political meeting.  I am glad that Deputy Johnson has disabused my mind.  I think if you had men organising public meetings in barracks and passing resolutions it very soon would result in passing resolutions denouncing particular officers.  I am very glad that is not his view, because if it had been his view there would be no more discipline in the Army than there is in Dublin trades unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I want once again to press for some fuller information than has yet been made available in regard to Section 1.  I have twice raised this matter, and on each occasion I have been met&mdash; I do not say this in any spirit of complaint&mdash;by debating points rather than by an answer to the case that I put.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it was the intention under Section 1 to eject the application in this country of the British Trade Facilities Act, and the answer that was made was that it was not intended to eject the application of that Act.  I inferred from the answer made by the Minister that if any undertaking here were entitled to get the guarantee of the British Trade Facilities Act, the guarantee of the British Exchequer, that no objection would be taken to that course, but that it might even be welcomed.  What surprised me still more was that Deputy Johnson, in referring to that point, said that he imagined that very little difficulty would occur, and that if an undertaking were to be established here, the building of which was to be erected in this country, and that the application of the present Trade Loan (Guarantee) Bill were to be sought for that building, machinery put into the building might be guaranteed under the Trade Facilities Act.  I was greatly surprised at that answer from Deputy Johnson, and at his meeting the case in that way.  I understood that in other matters he rather objected to any guarantees of the British Government in regard to the expenditure of moneys on undertakings in this country.  I am not concerned with that at the moment, but what I am concerned with is this: either this Trade Loan Bill will, to a lesser or greater extent, eject the British Trade Facilities Act in its application to this country, and it is applicable in this country.  It is not merely applicable in the ordinary way, but it is applicable in the sense that the British Exchequer have made it available for this country if anybody here desires to have it or to make use of it, and it is applicable in the sense that <Col N="491" /> any gift is applicable if you care to take advantage of a gift so proffered.</P>
      <P>But this Bill will either eject it or it will not.  Let me take these two alternatives.  If it does, then it means that the Government in this country will look askance at enterprises established here, the moneys for which have been guaranteed by the British Exchequer under the Trade Facilities Act.  If that is to be the case I think a statement to that effect should be sought.  I may say that I myself had rather anticipated that some such statement would be made.  If that is the point of view to be adopted the statement ought to be made.  In the alternative what happens?  In the alternative, I suggest that there are one or two explanations due with regard to this Bill that have not yet been received, because the provisions of the Bill appear at once to be somewhat illusory.  The sum of £750,000, is stated to be available under Section 1, under the guarantee of the Free State Exchequer. Let me address myself quite frankly and candidly to the facts of the case.  The sum of £750,000, and no more within the next twelve months is guaranteed.  The effect of that guarantee will be at the present rate of the National Loan; it will mean about 6¼ per cent.  The British Government, as I mentioned before, offered to guarantee a large enterprise in Poland recently, the machinery for which was purchased in England. Guarantees were sought under the British Trade Facilities Act and were given under that Act, and a sum amounting at the present moment up to one hundred and ninety millions has been expended or guaranteed under that Act in contradistinction to our sum of £750,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only that but the market value of such guarantee is that you can get money so guaranteed for about 4¾ per cent.  There is a market contrast between the two.  All I am seeking to do now is to ask for some definite statement as to what is to be the effect in this country of two different sections of two different Bills, one our Bill and one somebody else's Bill, of which they have carefully studied the benefaction and of which they have received <Col N="492" /> the benefits.  That Bill is made applicable here.  It is available in Canada, Poland and other places. There a large sum of money is available, and we are asked to enact here another Bill, every word section for section, the same as that in regard to which I am raising the question now. It is word by word, and sentence by sentence identical with the other, and here you have two identical provisions with two different sums of money available.  I want to know exactly what purpose this new Bill is to serve unless it is that the Government has made up its mind, and there would be a good deal to be said in favour of such making up of mind that only enterprises to be established in this country should be guaranteed under this Bill rather than seeking guarantees from any other country's Bill.  If that is the point of view I think it ought to be stated.  I tried to get the Minister for Industry and Commerce to express a view one way or another before, and I failed.  I hope some definite statement will be made now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has reached the Report Stage at a gallop, and I would like to enter a protest against the want of time, not so far as I am concerned, but so far as the general public are able to get information about it, and take whatever steps they may consider necessary to protect business interests and otherwise.  In this Bill I think there is a very distinct need, and more than in the Bill, in the discussions that have taken place on the Bill, there is more need for definiteness of purpose.  In other words, the Government have given us very little information, if any, as to the purpose the Bill is going to be put to, in other words what sort of undertaking or what lines are to be adopted, when the Bill is passed.  In the discussions that have taken place on the Bill something has been said about co-operative societies. That would lead one to believe that the Minister has in the back of his mind the using of, at all events, part of the money in connection with co-operative efforts.  Now, that may or may not be right.  It depends altogether on the purpose for which the <Col N="493" /> co-operation has been secured.  I would like to make a protest if it is the intention of the Ministry to use Government money in connection with any form of co-operation that enters into competition with ordinary private enterprise. The ordinary co-operative society occupies a privileged position, irrespective of any moneys that may be concerned in this Bill.  It has, of course, freedom from payment of Income tax or Corporation tax to a very considerable extent, and it has other inducements that ought, as far as they are concerned, put them in a preferential position, which at this stage I am not going to question.  I question very distinctly the right of the Government to expend Government money to the detriment of individual traders. That is a position which is not very clear in the Bill.  Altogether, the Bill, when one looks at it, may seem an innocent, useful and proper Bill.  It altogether depends upon the use to be made of the Bill in connection with the advance of money, which I think has not been made very clear.  On the other hand, it does not outline any of the suggested dangers as being part of the programme.  In that way it is perfectly negative, being neither one side nor the other.</P>

      <P>I had not the slightest intention of saying anything at this stage of the Bill but I was surprised at the statements of Deputy Hewat, and his position as regards the co-operative movement.  Surely he does not wish to have re-hashed again the question of the co-operative societies paying Income tax.  I think that has been thoroughly threshed out in the other House, and I think the decision arrived at was that there is no reason and justice in asking co-operative societies to pay Income tax.  Deputy Hewat must know that business concerns do not pay Income tax.  As companies they pay Income tax on behalf of their shareholders, and the shareholders have a right to get a refund of the Income tax paid if the particular amount taken from them is greater than should have been taken having regard to their total income. Similarly with regard to co-operative societies.  Deputy Hewat must know <Col N="494" /> that they are not there for the purpose of making profits.  They are there for the benefit of the members of the society and if any profits are made the members get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Bill, anyhow the intention of the second section of the Bill is to advance money for the purpose of reducing the cost of living and one of the great ways, in my opinion, of reducing the cost of living would be by eliminating middlemen and a great many other traders about whom Deputy Hewat is so anxious.  This country is absolutely flooded out with an excess of go-betweens who are making profits and adding considerably to the selling price of all articles between the farmer and the consumer, and surely if anything is to be gained by this Bill it will be to put money into the hands of the producers, acting, as they will have to act, in most cases on a co-operative basis, and allowing them to place their produce in the hands of the consumers at a lower cost to the consumer, and it is to be hoped at a somewhat higher price to the producer.</P>

I do not see why the co-operative societies are not as much entitled to this as the trader, and I think Deputy Hewat should be ashamed to get up in this House and support traders, because it is my own opinion that the high cost of living and of products in this country is due to the large number of unnecessary traders and middlemen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would claim the right on the Report Stage to deal with the Bill as it has come to us from the <Col N="496" /> Committee, its principles and its details, and the principles and the details of any clause or section of the Bill.  I am not going to do that, but I claim that one would be entitled to do that under the Standing Orders and the Rules of Debate of the Dáil.  I want to call attention to a matter which was raised in the course of Deputy Hewat's speech in this matter, which reminded one of the fair and reasonable contention put forward by Deputy Figgis that the Advisory Committee to be appointed under Section 1 ought to be a different Committee from that appointed under Section 2.  Deputy Hewat's speech rather added to the weight of that argument.  One could quite understand that a gentlemen of the experience and interests of Deputy Hewat might be appointed upon an Advisory Committee under Section 1, but such a person with such an experience and outlook would not be a desirable acquisition to the Committee under Section 2, because the bias of his interests and outlook would militate against the proper working of Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, therefore, that the question of the constitution of the Advisory Committee might well receive further consideration in the Seanad.  But I want to raise another question that is involved in this whole Bill, and to point out to the Dáil the way it strikes me as to the effect the Bill is going to have and what it is we are actually doing by passing it.  I am glad we are passing it, and I hope it will become law immediately, and that it will not be the last of similar Bills that will also become law.  We are, by this Bill, authorising the Ministry to inflate currency to the extent of £1,000,000, authorising them, as a matter of fact, to do the work of banking institutions, and to determine the direction which industry to the extent of this advance will take.  I think it is a pity that this is not to be done direct, although it is quite conceivable that within the scheme of the Bill it might be done direct, but I rather anticipate that it will be done through the banking institutions, and they will give credit on the backing of the State.  I would rather these credits were given through a State Bank.  I hope, to some extent, that will be done.  The issue of <Col N="497" /> £1,000,000 worth of credit, which is in the greater part to be expended to promote employment, and presumably for reproductive purposes, will, no doubt, bring a quick reward, and to the extent that moneys of this kind are advanced, which, in their effect, cause inflation, inflation for quickly reproductive purposes, is not harmful but good. It will promote employment and will bring immediate benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>I am following in this contention no less an authority than the Chairman of the Midland Counties and Westminster Bank&mdash;I mean Mr. Reginald McKenna &mdash;and as a matter of fact there can be no question that if the State banks were to loan in this way, and were in effect to advance money on the future tax-paying capacity of the community, and if they were going to do that to the extent of £1,000,000 for directly productive purposes, without great harm and, as I think, probably with great good, I hope the lesson will be borne in mind, and that we might use the same method to an even greater extent and advantage.  We shall be using this money for capital expenditue, which will be slowly reproductive. We might use large sums of money by the same method, advancing State credit for the production of wealth which might be recovered within the year, I mean agricultural wealth.  I suggest that the method adopted by this scheme, if applied to the payment of wages for the production of food, would be quickly reproductive and would be entirely beneficial.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I want to make in this connection, and it is this.  If, as I contend, the granting of loans of this character, backed by the State, based upon potential taxable capacity, in effect inflates currency, the effect may be to raise prices generally.  The raising of those prices in reality means that the community is paying for the capital that is sunk.  Unfortunately, when this financial operation is done through a bank the community is not only paying for the capital expended in increasing prices through inflation, but is also paying over and over again through interest on the capital which <Col N="498" /> is being apparently lent by bankers but which is in reality lent by the State on the real credit of the country, which is based upon future potential production.  I may say that I am glad the Bill is passing, and I hope the lesson to be drawn from it will be learned and repeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The absence of capital was, he said, restricting trade.  Is that really so?  We here in the Dáil are men of the world, and I ask, what is the position of capital to-day in the different banks?  Are the different banks overloaded from their returns with useless capital?  I do not call capital useless in the ordinary way, but I use the word &ldquo;useless&rdquo; from the point of view of not being operative In other words, there is more capital available to-day than there is trade to employ that capital.  That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, trade is so bad that it cannot absorb the capital that is available.  Now, in the Government's desire to improve trade it offers to provide capital.  That is the proposal. But I think the question which ought to be considered when we are talking of capital, particularly in this country, is really what is the cause of bad trade. The proposal of the Government is to try to stimulate bad trade by offering capital.  The cause of bad trade in this country is a two-fold one.  On one side you have the State levying burdens on trade that the trade of the country is unable to carry.  The heaviest burdens in Europe are levied to-day on trade in the Free State by our own home <Col N="499" /> Government.  In addition to trade being handicapped and hindered by this burden of taxes, you have on the other side of the House here, Deputies representing Labour.  Labour demands from trade to-day the highest wages obtained in Europe.  The costs of production are entirely affected by wages. So that you have the two real causes of bad trade represented on the two sides in the House, and neither side anxious to do anything to remove these burdens.  We might as well, when we get to questions of this kind, be honest with ourselves and with one another.  There is no doubt about it, bad trade arises from the two causes I have mentioned, and if, instead of trying to pacify and satisfy ourselves with artificial stimulants of this kind, we were to devote a little energy on both sides of the Dáil to remove these burdens, we would do more to stimulate trade than we can do by passing Bills of this character.  There is only one other point that I would like to mention.  Deputy Johnson said when one is discussing a Bill on the Report Stage, one has a right to discuss all the points of that Bill.  I will not yield my rights in this matter in discussing this Bill, and I want, in discussing the question, to deal with co-operative societies and the effect of the opposition of co-operative societies in trade.</P>

      <P>Whatever I may be I have just as much right in the Dáil as any other member of the Dáil even though he may be very eminent in the profession he represents.  I may be more humble-minded but I have the same rights.  In regard to the question of trading by co-operative societies I am afraid that is a matter that is not exactly understood here.  Co-operative <Col N="500" /> societies are not subject to income tax or Corporation Tax.  Now, that may seem a small matter, but it effects profits to the extent of 30 per cent.  In other words, the Government take 30 per cent. of the profits of the ordinary trading concerns for the carrying on of the Government of the country. Where trade is carried on by a co-operative society it makes profits in a different way.  It distributes them in a different way.  Instead of amassing profits on which income tax would be paid the same as in ordinary concerns, a co-operative society reduces prices to the consumer, and thereby does not carry any of the burdens at all of the government of the country.  Now, ordinary trade is compelled to carry these burdens.  Further, I say that the trade done by co-operative societies when they come into competition with the ordinary trade is not fair, because both should be subject to the same burdens. We object to the monies under this Bill being used to provide capital for co-operative societies such as this. A considerable portion of the monies in the hands of the Government are provided from taxes and burdens which they levy on industry, and is it fair to take those monies from industry and to hand those monies over to the competitors of industry?  I think Deputies will see that point and see the fairness and equity of the point.  The money is taken from the trading community. The trading community is bearing its share of the burdens of the State.  Is it fair to take such monies from that community and hand them over to co-operative societies which come into competition with that trading community for the ordinary trade of the community and bear none of the burdens? Therefore, I say we are justified in objecting to these monies being utilised by co-operative societies and thereby taking trade from the ordinary trading community which support the Government of the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill empowers the Irish Government to give certain guarantees.  It does not profess to repeal any other guarantee that any other Government may be in a position to give.  To Deputy Figgis's specific question as to whether it is the intention of the Government to prevent an individual taking advantage of the guarantee that he may be offered for a specific purpose by another Government, the answer is that it will be considered when it arises.  That would undoubtedly depend on a number of surrounding circumstances which we cannot discuss in the abstract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that testimonial from the Deputy.  It is the first I have got.  There have been some complaints that this Bill has been rushed through.  I do not think those complaints are well founded.  I would like to remind Deputy Hewat, if he were here, that this Bill went through in accordance with the normal timetable under which other Bills go through.  Though perhaps we were anxious to get the Bill through rather quickly in the beginning, as a result of representations from different quarters in the Dáil we did not go so quickly; we had to yield to representations, and the Bill is taking the ordinary normal course that any Bill of its sort would take.  Deputies want to know the real purpose of this Bill, and they profess to see all sorts of hidden dangers and meanings in its sections.  I cannot see them, and I think that Sections 1 and <Col N="502" /> 2, which are the operative sections, are perfectly clear.  Section 1 permits the Government to guarantee money to an enterprise which is likely to lead to employment. Section 2 permits the Government to make a loan or grant to any association, corporate or unincorporate, of producers or consumers, or producers and consumers, so long as it is calculated to promote a reduction in the retail prices of essential commodities. I think that is as plain as the English language could make it.</P>
      <P>With regard to co-operation <i>versus</i> private enterprise, I do not know the position Deputies desire to take up. We deal with associations of producers or consumers, or joint associations of both.  Deputies want to know if it is intended to make loans to co-operative societies to the exclusion of other sorts of organisations which would come under the section.  The answer is that in the section there is no such intention. No such intention can be read into the section.  I do not know whether it is contended the Government should make loans to one form of organisation which would come within that section, and at the same time deliberately exclude co-operative societies, which would be an association of producers or consumers, and which would also come within the section.  If that is the contention, I absolutely disagree with it, and I do not think it is a contention that can be defended.</P>

      <P>It appears to be, but it is not put specifically.  That contention cannot be defended.  A co-operative organisation, the operations of which are likely to lead to a reduction in the prices of essential commodities, is entitled to a loan and will get it on the same terms as any other form of organisation.  The question as to whether a co-operative society should or should not pay Income tax does not arise now, and this is not the time to go into it.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that you require two distinct committees. The same advisory body would not be suitable under Sections 1 and 2. That is the intention of the Bill. Deputy Good rightly pointed out that the present position is that there is <Col N="503" /> more capital available than trade can absorb.  That is the position.  He went on to give an explanation for that state of affairs, the fact that you seem to have a glut of capital and very little trade, and he put the blame entirely on the Labour Party.</P>

While admitting all our own sins, and on behalf of the Labour Party while admitting their sins, I will tell you that one of the real reasons you have not more trade in the country is that it is not worth while to produce.  The people who are really to blame for that are the people who call themselves business men, but who are really dealers in what is being produced by the farmers and the labourers in the country.  That is certainly one of the principal reasons why you have not more trade.  It is not worth while to produce because the business men and the dealers go in for too much profit.  I am taking one-third of the blame, and Labour and Deputy Good must also carry a third.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good would like to have the co-operative societies paying Income tax both collectively and individually. That would be satisfactory from his point of view, but it certainly would not be either satisfactory or fair from the co-operative societies' point of view.  Last night we had an intelligent and a high debate on education. The debate, I think, dealt very largely with the question arising out of this Bill.  Deputies expressed the hope that the agricultural community would get an education to fit them to do the best in agriculture, to fit them to get the most out of their profession, and it is to be hoped, incidentally, that that education will also enable them to protect the fruits of their industry, will give them sufficient education to be able to protect themselves from the swarm of non-producers, or parasites, in the industrial community.  An education that will enable them only to produce is of very little use to them.  They must have an education that will enable them to protect what they produce.  I think this Bill is a step in the right direction towards laying the foundation of a very desirable state of affairs. When developed, as the idea can be developed, with proper co-operation and a proper point of view on the part of both the consumer and the producer, I think that, perhaps, in the near future a more desirable state of affairs may be anticipated.  It is extraordinary that at the moment agricultural produce is being sold for practically nothing in the country as compared with the price that it brings in the City of Dublin. The two poorer sections of the community&mdash;the producers and consumers &mdash;must be brought closer together. This Bill aims at that, and we welcome it for that reason.  Those swarms of non-producers, to describe them by a very mild name, must be made producers if they want to live in this country.  They must live on their own fat, and not on the fat of the unfortunate people whom they have hitherto been feasting on.</P>

      <NameTxt>The MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Minister in charge of the Bill which was under discussion just now was accused of galloping.  I think that Deputy O'Connell smiles at what is in my mind with regard to the present Bill.  Notwithstanding the purely technical appearance of this Bill, it is, in fact, a revolutionary measure.  At all events, it is the legislative completion of a revolution in the system and the basis of secondary education, as it has existed since the passing of the Intermediate Education Act of 1878.  Under that Act, the basis of all financial assistance given by the State to secondary schools was the results of examinations.  That system of paying schools in respect of the results of examinations had more than one vice, and I think it is now a matter of general agreement that the removal of that system, and it has been removed except for this particular enactment which becomes necessary to complete it, was necessary, and can be counted on in future as beneficial.  The object of the present Bill is not apparent on the face of it.  The Bill is necessary in order to abolish the payment of grants on the results of written examinations, and in order to substitute for that method payment by capitation which, I think, is the form of grant almost universal in modern educational systems.  I may sum up the conditions of the financial provisions for secondary education in a few words.  The grants that up to the present have been payable to the Intermediate schools come from two sources &mdash;first from the income on a capital fund which was created by former legislation for the Intermediate Education <Col N="506" /> Board, and secondly, from public funds, voted annually.  The present income on the capital sum belonging to the Intermediate Education Board amounts to about £27,360 annually, and there is also, under an Act of 1890, an annual payment from the Local Taxation Account, amounting to £35,000.  These two annual amounts bear all the cost of administration and inspection, and the cost of examination, and further a joint income of all the schools obtaining financial assistance&mdash;about £30,000&mdash;has been paid in the form of grants based mainly on the results of the annual examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, first of all, what is called the Teachers' Salaries Grant.  The Intermediate Education Act of 1914 provided an annual grant for the purpose of increasing the salaries of Intermediate teachers.  This grant amounted to £30,750 in 1922.  It is distributed to the schools&mdash;it is also practically based on the results of examinations&mdash; in proportion to the amount of grant which has been paid in the past on the results of written examinations, and so it may be regarded as a supplementation of the income of the Intermediate Education Board that I have already mentioned.  There also has been up to the present an annual grant called the Duke Grant.  The annual amount of that grant for all Ireland originally was £50,000; the proportion for the Free State is £39,000.  This sum is paid to the schools also as a capitation grant, with the exception of about £4,000 which is set aside for special purposes, Summer Courses and special grants to struggling schools.  It will be seen that out of the four sources that I have mentioned of State-provided income for secondary schools, no less than three have been dependent up to the present on the results of examinations, mainly on the results of written examinations, and that dependence is statutory.  The object of this Bill is to repeal the provisions which make these payments dependent on the results of written examinations.  The particular provisions of these Acts&mdash; not the Acts as a whole&mdash;are specified in the Schedule.  There is the Intermediate Act of 1878, the Local Taxation Act of 1890, and the Act of 1914, which provides the Teachers' Salaries <Col N="507" /> Grant.  I do not know that I can add anything further in explanation of the purpose of this piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he attempted to convey that the Bill is not quite as simple as it looks.  The object, as he explained it and as I understood it, is to rearrange the basis upon which grants have hitherto been largely paid for the purpose of Intermediate Education. Grants were, as the Minister stated, payable to a considerable extent on the results of examinations, and it is now proposed, and I quite agree with him that it is right, to change that basis.  But for the first time I have learnt that it is proposed to substitute a capitation basis.  That does not appear on the face of the Bill, nor am I aware that any regulations have yet been issued to provide that grants will in future be paid on capitation. I take it from what the Minister has said that is the intention.  As the Minister has stated, the Fund which is known as the School Grant comes from two sources, that is, from the interest accruing on the old Grant that was made in 1878 from the Church Temporalities Fund, and from the money derivable from the Customs and Excise Grant, or what used to be familiarly called the &ldquo;Whiskey Money.&rdquo;  So far as the first and second portions of the Schedule are concerned I have no objection to make beyond saying what I said in the beginning, that I was not quite clear of what basis the Minister proposes to introduce for the distribution of the grants.  The repeal set out in the first portion of the Schedule where it is stated that these words will be deleted, namely &ldquo;dependent on the results of the public examination of students.&rdquo;  As I say, I have no objection to that, and the same practically applies to the second one.  But when we come to the third mentioned in the Schedule, a new and wholly different question arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to dwell on the origin of this Act of 1914.  The Act was passed principally, if not entirely, because of the agitation which was carried on for a considerable number of years by the lay intermediate teachers. The Act in the first section set up a <Col N="508" /> Registration Council, and the second section, which it is now proposed to repeal, I shall read to the Dáil, because it is important that the Dáil should be aware of its terms.  This is the section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From and after the commencement of this Act there shall be provided to the Board in each year out of moneys provided by Parliament a sum not exceeding £40,000, and an amount equivalent to the sum so paid (in this Act referred to as the Teachers' Salaries Grant) shall be applied by the Board in the manner provided by rules made by the Lord Lieutenant under this Act, and approved by the Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the Teachers' Salaries' Grant was what its name implies, and was intended for the teachers, and the rules made under that section contained what I may call the Magna Charta of the lay teachers.  It was the first time that even the existence of the lay teacher was recognised in the Intermediate system.  Under no previous Act was there any reference whatever made to the lay teacher.  The rules which were made under that particular section provided there should be a minimum salary for lay teachers.  The minimum salary was fixed at £140. Even in 1914 that was not very much, but it was something; it fixed a minimum salary.  There was also a provision in these rules that one lay teacher should be employed for every forty pupils.  It is known as the &ldquo;one in forty proportion.&rdquo;  There was a guarantee secured thereby that a certain number of lay teachers would be employed in the schools.</P>
    <P>Now that did not mean that that particular regulation, the one in forty proportion, should apply to any individual school, but it was arranged rather by what is known as the group system&mdash;the Catholic schools and the Protestant schools&mdash;that in each group that proportion would be observed.  I may mention in passing that that proportion, so far as one group is concerned, the Catholic group, was, I am informed, never observed, although to some extent it was observed.  That, however, does not get away from the fact that it was there.  It gave a certain guarantee that lay teachers would <Col N="509" /> be employed.  There was a further regulation in these rules that a lay teacher would have a three months' contract of agreement.  Before that there was no such regulation and the people responsible for the schools might, at the end of the school year, simply tell the lay teacher, the very day on which the school was breaking up, that he might not come back after the summer holidays.  One of the provisions of the rules made under this particular section was that there should be a three months' contract.  It is proposed in this Bill to repeal this section which I have read.  I maintain, and I think there can be no possible doubt about it, that if the section is repealed, all these rules made in pursuance of the section must fall, because it states here that a sum not exceeding £40,000 must be set aside and shall be applied in the manner provided by the rules made by the Lord Lieutenant under this Act. If it is the case, and I think it will be generally admitted that it is, that if the section goes, the rules made in pursuance of the section must, as a matter of course, go also.</P>
    <P>Then the position is this, that by this simple act you are wiping out all the advantages which were gained by the lay teachers under the Birrell Act of 1914.  That is what it comes to in a nutshell&mdash; the teachers go back to the pre-1914 position.  It seems to me that that is clearly and obviously the effect of repealing Section 2 of the Intermediate Education Act of 1914.  If it were absolutely necessary, in order to establish the principle which the Minister says he wants to establish, and which I agree is necessary, there may be some reason for repealing this particular section but I hold it is not essential.  In the other two Acts it is definitely set out that the moneys which are paid depend on the results of examinations, but in this case, it is nowhere stated in the Act of 1914.  What is stated is that this money shall be applied by the Board in the manner provided by the rules made by the Lord Lieutenant.  The rules are made by the Lord Lieutenant and I take it, of course, that the Department has power without legislation to alter the rules which were made by the Lord Lieutenant then.  That being so, if <Col N="510" /> there is anything in these rules which makes the payment of grants dependent on results, I hold that the Department can change that particular portion without wiping away all the rules.</P>
    <P>So far as I can discover in the rules, there are two or three sentences, one of which says, in Rule 2, that certain sums shall be distributed annually by the Board amongst managers of the intermediate schools to whom results fees are paid, and the words &ldquo;result fees&rdquo; occur in at least one other place.  I maintain that if the word &ldquo;grants&rdquo; were submitted for the words &ldquo;result fees&rdquo; in the rules the position would have been fully met and the Department could not be charged with simply wiping away all these rules which do preserve certain rights for the secondary teachers.  I need not point out to members in this Dáil the deplorable position, I may say the scandalous position, in which secondary teachers find themselves to-day.  They are crying out for improvement in their positions, and the improvement is admittedly long overdue, but under this measure, I maintain, the effect will be that even the little modicum of right given in 1914, after a severe struggle and long continued agitation is wiped out as a matter of course.  It is not necessary that that should be done.  It is not necessary that it should even get the appearance of being done because, as I say, it is open to the Department to alter the rules, and the alteration required is not very much.  But if alteration is required in the rules, it is obvious that no alteration is necessary in the section which I read out, because it clearly provides that the grants may be applied according to the rules.</P>
    <P>If alteration is necessary it is in the rules and the Department are there without repealing the section to alter the rules to bring them into consonance with the objects they want to achieve.  My position in the matter is this, while I agree with the principle which is announced&mdash;the necessity for changing the basis on which the grants are paid&mdash;I do hold that it is not necessary for that purpose which the Minister has in view, to have that second section of the Act of 1914 repealed.  I hold, further, that if it is repealed a <Col N="511" /> grievous wrong will be done to the lay secondary teachers in the Saorstát, because it will be taking from them whatever rights they have secured.  They are not much, but such as they are, they are there without giving them anything in exchange, without giving them anything in return.  At present, as I say, they have a right to contract, a right to a minimum salary, a right to be employed in certain proportions, and if you take out this section of the Act and take with it the rules which must go with it, what is left to them? Nothing.  They are just back to the position in which they were before this regulation was passed.  I do not see my way to support the Second Reading of this Bill unless I am assured that at the next stage of the Bill this section, to which I have called special attention, will be deleted.  I do not know, when the section was inserted in the Bill, whether the full effect of it was adverted to.  I can hardly believe that it was, but I hope when the Minister is winding up the debate that he will give and assurance that the deletion of this section will not be insisted on.  As I say, if it is, I will have no other course open but to oppose the Bill as strongly as I can, and ask every Deputy in the House who knows, and from that knowledge must of necessity sympathise with the position of the lay secondary teachers, to oppose it also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise also to oppose this Bill.  I pass over the fact that it is introduced, as we hope, towards the end of the session.  I pass over the fact that it really does a great deal more than what is apparent on the surface.  The Minister very straightforwardly acknowledged that in his opening statement, but he will remember that that statement was made to a small number of Deputies in the House. That was not his fault, but nevertheless the fact remains.  I oppose the Second Reading chiefly on this ground, that it is purely a destructive measure, without a single constructive feature about it.  I am not going to argue at length a thing which is admitted&mdash; namely, the grievous case of the secondary teachers.  We know that they have practically no tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that they are wretchedly <Col N="512" /> paid.  We know that they do not know in a particular year what their income will be.  We know they have no right to pension.  The Minister knows that, the President has admitted it, and everybody knows it, and says that something must be done, but nothing is done.  We have urged this on various occasions in the Dáil, and we have been expecting every time that something would be done.  At length, after two-and-a-half years we are faced with a Bill which has the effect of removing everything that was favourable to the teachers, leaving them without anything to support them.  The Minister stated that it was proposed to remove payment by results in order to substitute payment by capitation.  The Bill does not even say that.  We do not know what the Ministry are going to do, or how they shall pay.  We shall know nothing if we pass the Second Reading.  All we know is that payment will be on results.  What is to be paid? What position are they going to be put into?  I oppose the Second Reading because the fact that we want to get rid of payment on results&mdash;and the Minister wants to get rid of that&mdash;is one of the levers we hope to use in order to get a constructive Bill from the Minister. If we accept in this way the repeal of this section which Deputy O'Connell has properly called the Magna Charta of teachers, up to the present, we shall have no lever to use.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy O'Connell that there is no urgency about this repeal clause.  The third reason why I oppose the Second Reading of the Bill has been extremely well put by Deputy O'Connell.  If you take away the boon that was given the teachers in 1914, by repealing the second section of the 1914 Act, you are really removing a very great advantage from them.  It was pointed out that they have very little tenure.  They have at least under that clause to be engaged under contract, and must receive at least three months' notice before dismissal.  If the second section of the 1914 Act is repealed, I agree with Deputy O'Connell that the Bill is taking away that right of contract from the teachers.  While that is not the most important ground for asking the Dáil not to agree to the <Col N="513" /> Second Reading of this Bill, I think it is a very important one.  I hope the Minister will realise, after this period, that when he asked the Dáil to pass an Intermediate Education Bill he ought to make it one that will be constructive, and not merely a Repealing Clauses Bill.  On these grounds, principally, I would ask the Dáil not to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the position that has been taken up by my colleague, Professor Thrift, and by Deputy O'Connell in this matter.  Last night Deputy Johnson tried to tempt the Minister for Education into stating his general educational policy.  I do not think the Minister was drawn very much.  This is the first real indication as to what that policy is.  It is a policy of obscurantism judging by the Bill before us.  It is a terrible specimen of legislation by reference.  Who would believe that the repealing of Section 2 of the Act of 1914 would mean so much, while apparently in the Bill it means so little?  As we know, the secondary teachers have been the orphan children in Ireland.  They have always been kicked and shown the door.  They had very few friends.  With great difficulty they got their case heard.  I do not know whether it was Mr. Birrell himself or his advisers decided to recognise that they had some rights as citizens. These rights were incorporated in the Schedule of the Act of 1914.  That was their charter, and a very small charter, indeed.  The first positive Act of the Ministry of Education is the repeal of that charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard of a stone being given for bread, but here you are taking away the bread and giving nothing. I am not in favour of very revolutionary methods of education, and when the Minister stated last evening that he was in favour of moving slowly I assented to that attitude.  But I want to move forward slowly.  This is moving backwards.  It is a crab-like movement, going back to the dark ages. Certainly I am not going to assent to the repeal of this section until I know that the secondary teachers are going to get something at least as good as what the section implied.  If the section is to be repealed I do not see why <Col N="514" /> these rules that it involves should not be re-enacted.  I appeal to the Minister who, as we know, is a man of liberal views, and with the courage to express them, to re-consider his decision in this matter.  I do not know what his difficulty is or why the section should be repealed at all.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I want to support the contentions that have been made by Professor Thrift and by Deputies Alton and O'Connell.  Unless they are thoroughly misinformed they made a case that is unanswerable.  Unfortunately I have no personal knowledge, nor actual acquaintance with intermediate education anywhere, but I do remember the tremendous agitation that took place some years ago and resulted in the passing of the Intermediate Education Act of 1914 and also the rules formulated afterwards.  I know that a great amount of feeling was stirred up and that a great deal of relief was expressed when something in the nature of a settlement was arrived at.</P>
      <P>I think the contention of Deputy Alton is perfectly sound, that by repealing two sections of the three Acts we are going to remove certain assurances in regard to payments without any substitute assurances, and we are going to remove from the lay secondary teachers the assurances that are provided to them in the Statutory Rules and Orders, 1915, No. 229, and that you are committing a grievous blunder which would not even be remedied, I am afraid, by the promise, which is a verbal promise, from the Minister, that he proposed to do certain things.  I think we should always bear in mind the risk of mortality&mdash;the risk surrounding Ministries&mdash;and it is a great risk for us to let go one thing until we are sure we have got hold of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going to say that I was satisfied with the Minister's intentions, but that would not be right.  I waited last night long and patiently for something that would give me ground to be satisfied. I dare not say now that I am satisfied with his intentions, but I still have faith in the Minister's goodwill, which is something different from his intentions.  But I do not think that is enough to rely upon if we are going to pass an Act in July, 1924, and perhaps <Col N="515" /> have to wait until October before we can bring forward a substitute Act. The Minister may have power to do things by rule, but I suggest he should bring the rules to us now before we pass this Act.  The secondary teachers have been for two years, since their condition came into the hands entirely of an Irish authority, hoping and expecting and pleading&mdash;and they have been promised by that authority&mdash;that their condition would be improved.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy in the House who has ever spoken on this matter has declared his sympathy and his desire that the position of the lay secondary teachers should be improved and that secondary education generally should be improved. If we are to pass this Bill, or even to give a Second Reading to this Bill, with the information available, it will be tantamount to telling these secondary teachers that all our sympathies were groundless, that it was only so much talk to put them off, and that we were not really in earnest in these assurances of sympathy.  They would have good ground for so thinking unless we are prepared to put something positive before them before we go any further in the process of taking away what they have already got.  If we could see, before this Bill goes any further, what the positive intentions of the Government are, and if we could see their proposals formulated and set out in actual order, and if we could see the actual Bill, in that way we would know with precision what the intentions of the Ministry are in this regard, and, then, I have no doubt, a case could be made for passing this Bill.  But I am convinced, ignorant as I am of the Intermediate Education System, from statements made by those who are intimate with it, that there will have to be a very conclusive reply from the Minister before I would agree to the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise with any professional knowledge on educational matters, but rather to point to some matters in connection with the Bill that is before us.  The Ceann Comhairle was going to call upon the Minister for Education to conclude the debate, but <Col N="516" /> I venture to suggest that the Minister might commence.  First of all, I want to ask why this Bill is put in amongst a mass of legislation that is coming before us now.  The amount of work involved in preparing the Bill can hardly be advanced as a reason for not bringing it forward at an earlier stage.  The Bill is a very short one and an innocent person like myself would not gather very much from reading it.  It asks us to repeal certain sections of Acts of Parliament passed in another place.  Were it not for the explanation given by Deputy O'Connell very few Deputies would have read into the sections of an Act of Parliament that we are asked to repeal anything more than a very innocent proposal.  I take exception to a Bill being brought forward in that way, especially at a time of great pressure like this, when we hardly have time to say our prayers.  The Bill asks us to repeal 4 &amp; 5 George V., Section 2., but then we have to find out what Section 2 is.  To bring a Bill forward in that way seems to be to ask the Dáil to take a great deal on the faith of the Minister and rather shows that the Ministry of Education or the Minister for Education is hardly up to date.  We have had instances recently where the protests of the Dáil have had the effect of improving the method by which Bills have been put before us. A case in point was the Bill we had before us yesterday.  That is a Bill that was preceded by a very full explanation of its provisions, and it was followed up by a very close analysis of its provisions by the Minister for Justice. I suggest that this Bill now before us in its present form is a contravention of the demands of the Dáil for a reasonable explanation of these measures.  It should not be put before us to have it shoved through by chance.  If a Deputy like Deputy O'Connell was not in the Dáil we would know no more about what we were passing than the man in the moon.</P>

      <P>I regret I was delayed outside the Dáil and was not able to be present when the Minister was making his statement, but I desire to join in the concern expressed by a number of Deputies here as to the position of secondary school teachers.  I understand from Deputies on those <Col N="517" /> benches in this side of the Dáil that the Minister has not made it clear at all what is the immediate necessity for repealing the enactments that were mentioned here.  Perhaps he would let us know what is the pressing necessity for bringing forward this Bill at this particular moment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat reminds me of a French remark that there are some compliments that, like a cannon ball, sweep your head away before you are aware of what is happening.

      <P>Deputy Hewat, as a business member, ought to appreciate the laconic character of this Bill.  It save expenditure upon printing and it saves a great deal of time and labour in reading.  Deputy Hewat would prefer to have Bills modelled on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is prefaced by a memorandum that dispenses with the necessity of reading the Bill, so that Deputies may hold forth eloquently and long on the Second Reading without the necessity of acquainting themselves with the terms of the proposed measure.  Deputy Hewat was mild as compared with my professional colleagues, Deputy Thrift and Deputy Alton.  One declared that it is a policy of obscurantism, and the other announced that the Bill was purely destructive. Both these Deputies and Deputy O'Connell applauded the new educational policy which derides and would remove the payment of teachers on a test applied by a written examination to the character of the work done. It is quite the fashion now to attack the written examination and to regard it as educationally indefensible.  These Deputies are keen for the new progressive idea to substitute payment on capitation.  Very well, then: they must <Col N="518" /> be consistent.  If under the existing law the new regime is to be introduced of payment without reference to the result of written examination, the statute which prescribes that the moneys must be distributed on the basis of the results of written examination has to be got rid of, and so far the earlier portion of this measure should win their favour, because it does away with the written examination.  I suppose I should be regarded as reactionary, and in any case I am not quite sure that I should not be out of order if I were to discourse even for a moment on the disadvantages to education of these sweeping changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill spoke about it as revolutionary.  It is revolutionary.  Deputies on the general policy of education yesterday evening were unanimous in attacking the fruitlessness of the primary system.  Now, the primary system has been at work all these years, that is the method of inspection without written examination, and there is absolute unanimity as to the bad quality, the utterly wretched quality, of the work done in the national schools although there have been cohorts of inspectors inspecting these schools and writing endless reports about them.  I am sufficiently a believer in written examinations well conducted to regret their passing. They have done good work.  They brought into existence excellent schools, and they have helped to create the Intermediate Education system, against which very few stones have been thrown, while all condemn the primary system.  Those who are acquainted with the high standing of secondary education in Ireland, and with the great work done by the vast majority of the schools, and the excellent quality of the teaching imparted in these schools, will agree that the methods by which these schools were brought into being, and in a large measure financed, cannot have been wholly bad.  We are now to substitute for that system a system of inspection and of capitation grants.  I am quite willing to admit with the Minister that the written examination had its vices. There was one notorious vice it lent itself to&mdash;cramming.  The schools that <Col N="519" /> were not resolved to do honest work, but that were anxious to secure as much of the results fees as they could secure by cramming, injured their boys for life, and defrauded the parents of the boys, and were, in short, public enemies.  That vice, however, was in a large measure corrected by the methods pursued by the late Intermediate Board setting out from the year 1900. It was the examiner who was condemned; it was the administrator of the system who was condemned where cramming had free scope, and where the crammer got off with his loot.</P>
    <P>I see advantages in a mixed system of part inspection and part examination. There are qualities that can be developed in the pupil by preparation for examination of a highly special kind, qualities of character, and it is largely because the written examinations take no account of that great educational element that they are to be condemned but where the examination system is supplemented by the inspection system the corrective is healthy and useful.  The Minister has explained to us that he proposes to substitute the capitation system.  In other words, the policy begun by the late Intermediate Board is to be extended, and what it recommended is to be carried out&mdash;a scheme of leaving-school certificates and the further intermediate school certificate, which will be accepted as an entrance qualification for universities and for a variety of other professional purposes.  I take it, that it is to get rid of the hampering restrictions of the statute that the first portion of this Bill is intended.  We now come to what is usually called the Birrell Grant. That is the Act of 1914.  I wonder is Deputy O'Connell correct in saying that if the section of that Act of 1914 that is to be repealed, is repealed, that the rules must fall?  He says it will wipe out the rules, and that the teachers will go back to the 1914 position. Others have said that a grievous wrong would be done.  That assumes that the Ministry of Education is a Ministry hostile to the education of the nation. It assumes that unless the British Statute is perpetuated the advantages that <Col N="520" /> accrued to schools and teachers under it will disappear.</P>

      <P>The words I am quoting I am asking a question with regard to.  The words I quoted are from Deputy O'Connell, that if the section be repealed the rules must fall. Again, he says: &ldquo;Wipe out the rules, and the teachers go back to the 1914 position.&rdquo;  He means the pre-1914 position.  &ldquo;A grievous wrong will be done.&rdquo;&ldquo;A grievous wrong&rdquo; was repeated by Deputy Johnson.  &ldquo;The Act is simply destructive,&rdquo; in the words of Deputy Thrift.  Surely those quotations in themselves are not misrepresentations. The misrepresentation must be in some supposed use I make of them.  I ask the question.  I am glad that asking the question has touched the educational, and the political, conscience of Deputy Thrift.  I ask the question are we to suppose that advantages that accrue to the schools and the teachers under a British statute will cease to be theirs if a section of that statute be repealed, and there will be left in sole control not the Lord Lieutenant of former times but the Ministry of Education?  Deputy Johnson suggested that to speak as I am speaking is to make an act of faith which might be defeated by some casualty or some disaster to a Minister. After all, the policy of the Government, of this administration, is not so completely personal as all that.  Deputy Alton says I want to make it personal. On the contrary I want it to be understood that there is an educational policy which has the approval of this House.</P>

I am merely trying to state here what I conceive to be the purpose of this measure.  If it were intended to do away with the position that teachers have secured under the growth of public opinion in this matter as expressed in legislation and in the code of practice I should oppose it bitterly.

      <P>The point appears to be that the Third Repeal in the Schedule involves a consequential abolition of a set of rules with the consequence of what the Deputies conceive to be a wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My contention is that it does not mean an abolition. <Col N="522" /> Those rules refer to the distribution of moneys following the distribution of results dependent upon written examination.  When results, dependent upon written examination, are no longer possible, that language has no meaning, and so a clean sweep is made to clear the ground.  There is no attack intended to be made.  I really must be particularly stupid, because I cannot understand the indignation of Deputy Alton.  I have taken the statements of Deputies Alton, Thrift and O'Connell.  I have quoted them.  They do not repudiate or question the accuracy of the quotation.  Is then what is objectionable some interpretation I put on their words?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">

Those Deputies dread something which is calculated to disimprove the position of the lay secondary teacher.  I allege there is no ground for that mistrust. It is surely unnecessary to argue that the Bill is not a complete Secondary Education Bill.  It is not claimed that it is, but so far as it goes, the only feature that seems to be objectionable is this repeal of the section of the 1914 Act.  I am directing my attention to that almost exclusively.  To me that repeal need not have the results Deputy O'Connell and others fear.  I say if it had, I would attack this Bill as strongly and as obstinately as any Deputy in this House, because it cannot be entertained that under the guise of policy to improve the education of the country, a step back of such a serious character would be taken.  It is unthinkable.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to the Deputy's speech.  One would imagine from this constant fusilade of interruptions that I was speaking against the interests that these Deputies stand for, whereas the reverse is the case.  I deprecate giving to the public, through the Press that will report this debate, the idea that something is being done which is bound to have in the natural course an injurious effect on the Secondary teachers. These Deputies do not desire to create such an impression, but what other impression could the ordinary reader derive?  These Deputies have not mentioned a very important factor of this situation, and I dealt with it on the last debate on the secondary education estimate, that makes the problem of lay teachers.  If this were a complete Education Bill, in which exhaustive treatment would be accorded to secondary education, as it is called, if it were an attempt to set up by legislation an entire scheme of intermediate education, this highly complex, delicate, and difficult subject would have to be dealt with in all its details.  For the moment a mere fragment is being dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> The great advantage that teachers have, and which they secured under the Act of 1914, was that at last the educational authorities prescribed to the schools conditions that made for fixity of tenure, or comparative fixity of tenure, and recognition of the position of the teachers.  Everybody knows that the cardinal difficulty in this matter is the fact that secondary education is not upon the same basis as primary or public education.  The secondary schools are private property.  It is most essential to remember that is the creator of infinite difficulty.  Every secondary teacher is in private employment. That creates the legal difficulty of providing pensions for the teachers so employed.  In so far as legal interference was legitimately possible it was made in the interests of the teachers, that is to say, grants were not payable unless the schools conformed to certain requirements.  That is really the efficacy and the operation of these rules.  That is undoubtedly the charter for the lay teachers.  If that charter is to be taken away, that is to say, if the policy in so far as regards secondary schools is to be condemned as reactionary, we ought to have evidence, for it should be more than mere suspicion.  Deputy Alton has the utmost faith in the Minister, and while he professes the utmost faith in the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor ALTON Professor ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Professor ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I really want to correct the Deputy.  I have complete confidence in the Minister's good intentions, though his intentions are very different from his acts, and secondary teachers can only rely on acts.  They cannot sell their birthright for a mess of pottage, even if it is a big one this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right, and consequently it is most beneficial for the teacher, that a supporter of the Government and of the Minister should announce in clear, unequivocal language, that his faith in the Minister is not a faith that is consonant with the suspicion that the scheme is to the detriment of the teachers and of the schools, and declare that if he thought it were he would not support it.  I am quite sure the Minister himself will disabuse these critical Deputies of any <Col N="525" /> suspicion they have.  It is intended henceforth that money will be payable on the basis of capitation.  In schools in which teachers are employed, who are registered, and properly qualified teachers, and who have a proper contract that secures them from being tenants at will, so to speak, and who have now got a fair prospect of being treated as men of their professional standard are entitled to be treated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Magennis's defence, so far as it was a defence of the examination system, I think that the vices of that system went further than he indicated; for one thing bringing the children of a certain standard and class over the country into one competition annually I think was a crazy system at all times. And it had other vices besides that, of which I could give illuminating details. Only the other day a boy spoke to me and said that a half an hour before the Intermediate Examination he was instructed, to his own surprise, and to the surprise afterwards of his parents, that he was not to be allowed to enter the examination that year.  Those are the vices inherent in that system an an illustration of these vices and they are the sort of thing we want to get rid of. Now I have been surprised really&mdash;well no.  I have not&mdash;at some of the criticism. Deputy Hewat thinks this is an extraordinary form of legislation; that instead of having enactments repealed here I should have set out the Act of Parliament in full, and the sections in full, and the rules based on them in full, and that they should all appear here in the Act, and that in fact the business of a Minister is to carry a kind of bottle to administer pap ready made and that the Deputies are not supposed to have any intelligence at all.  They are simply to take everything as I say in the most ready-made form.  I do protest also against Deputy Thrift's statement that this is a destructive and not a constructive measure.  Things may appear to be destructive that are really constructive. <Col N="526" /> I suppose if you destroyed a few miles of the bottom of the Barrow river, in a sense, so as to enable it to flow more freely, you could be accused of only carrying out a destructive measure whereas as a matter of fact it would be a constructive measure.  There was a destructive limitation put upon the supply of funds to those schools in the original Intermediate Act, and some Acts that followed, and the object of this Bill is to remove that destructive limitation. And the Act itself will prove in its working to be constructive.</P>

      <P>This is really another example of the Innocent Abroad.  I do not think that Deputy Thrift would convince himself that I am going to leave this particular Barrow without a bottom, or that the passing of this Act, if it were passed now, was going to leave things in that condition. It removes the unfreedom that was placed by previous Acts on the Intermediate Education Authority with regard to the distribution of the grant. It does not, therefore, by making them more free to distribute the grants, leave any blank whatsoever.  Now, again, Deputy Johnson made reference to my shortcomings with regard to the discussion on the Estimates yesterday evening, and I think I heard his remark cheered by Deputy Alton.  I was asked for a policy.  It seems to me that it was not a policy that Deputy Johnson expected me to produce at all, but a programme in detail.  That certainly was not what he asked for.  I did give a statement of policy.  A policy consists of generalities.</P>

      <P>If there were any details asked for and I did not supply them, I thought the occasion was appropriate to a general discussion. I am preparing to answer questions of detail in future, and the opportunity is given in the Schedule.  Now let me get to the point that was raised by Deputy T. O'Connell, and that is, <Col N="527" /> the effect of the repeal of the third item in the Schedule.  It is purely a legal matter, a matter of legal construction. Really, if the Deputies could think of it, what they have been finding fault with in me is that I did not produce their interpretation of that particular item instead of my own, and that I did not give an explanation of that item which is not my explanation of it.  Now the second section of the Act of 1914 provides that £40,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of the funds available shall be a separate grant.  If that Act remains unrepealed, that £40,000 will have to remain in the future as a separate item, and a separate grant from the rest.  Evidently if it were not for the belief and the opinions put forward by Deputy O'Connell and the other Deputies who have spoken, if it were not for the belief that certain other things with regard to the status of secondary teachers are dependent on that section, they would never for a moment advocate that we should continue as a separate item, as provided by a separate Act of Parliament, a separate grant of £40,000, as distinct from the rest of the funds provided for this purpose.  Now the object of placing these items in the Schedule is to do away with the separation of that particular part of the funds from the other funds.</P>

      <P>Really, the object of this Bill is that it consolidates the funds from which the expenses of secondary education would be defrayed. Now I will deal with Deputy O'Connell's explanation of that section, which explanation is also adopted <Col N="528" /> by Deputy Thrift and Deputy Alton, namely, that if that section be repealed the rules which were made consequent upon that section will also be repealed. I do not hold that is so.  I do not see that it can be so.</P>

      <P>The section, if any Deputy reads it, does not require any such rules as these to be drawn up. The section leaves it entirely at the option of the rule-making authority, whatever it might be, as to what rules it will draw up.  The section does not contain, even by implication, this Magna Charta.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that the effect of this repeal is to consolidate that £40,000 with the rest of the fund. In consolidating it, it consolidates any conditions attached to the expenditure of that £40,000 also with the rest of the expenditure.  In fact, my opinion is that so far from weakening the basis upon which these valuable guarantees for secondary teachers are based, it broadens and strengthens the basis, and instead of having only the guarantee of the Birrell grant of £40,000, that Magna Charta, when you repeal that Act, has the guarantee of all the funds that are at disposal.</P>

      <P>I am not pettifogging about this, nor do I desire in the slightest way to leave the slightest misunderstanding on anyone's mind.  It is surely inconceivable that any person carrying the responsibility I carry, and having cognisance, as I have, of these rules and that grant, and the connection between the two, should <Col N="529" /> approach this matter with the idea of getting rid of those rules and filching them away in some subterraneous manner.</P>

      <P>Until this discussion to-day I had not the slightest notion that it would be necessary to see the Attorney-General about it, but now I see it will.  I assure you that I give every guarantee to Deputies who have spoken that I am not going to permit regulations favouring the secondary teachers to be impaired, much less done away with, by implications through an enactment of this kind.  I think it will smooth the way if I undertake that, before this Bill passes through its next stage.  I shall endeavour to have that point completely cleared up as to whether this repeal would mean depriving secondary teachers of the protection of certain rules.  If it is shown to me, or if authority which I am bound to accept as better legal authority than my own satisfies me there is any such danger, I undertake, so far as in my power lies, to remove that danger.  I do not know whether it is necessary for me to give the assurance&mdash;I am not too proud to give it&mdash;but it has never been the intention of the Ministry to invade, impair or diminish in any way the position which has been created with, I think, general public approval, for the body of secondary teachers on whose behalf Deputies have levelled their artillery at me here to-day.

The circumstances have so often been before the Dáil that I do not think it is necessary to go into the matter in detail.  Parts 1 and 2 of the Schedule specify the persons affected. I think it will remove a cause of complaint that has been urged for a very long time, and it is the fairest and best way of dealing with these officers' claims.  In respect of any sum over and above what will be fixed by the Committee, of which Mr. Justice Wylie is Chairman&mdash;any sum over and above what would be our fair quota&mdash;the British Government is making up the difference.

      <P>I am not going to oppose the Second Reading, but I think it would be necessary to have some explanation as to why certain of the officers mentioned in the Schedule are to be paid by the Minister for Finance, and why local authorities in some cases are to be relieved of liability for doing things which they did, not in response to a demand made by the acting national authority.  Where it can be shown that local authorities, in taking steps regarding their business, acted in clear response to demands made by the national authority, I think a very good case is made for the responsibility being shouldered by the national authority, but until that position is made clear I would be inclined to criticise the inclusion within the Bill of clauses which would mean relieving local authorities for the consequences of their own acts in this matter.</P>

      <P>In any and in all of the cases that have been mentioned here, those cases were the subject of negotiation or advice or of order from the national authority at the time. But the national authority at that time did not undertake any liability in respect <Col N="531" /> of them, and it was in the main, with the exception of one particular lot, under orders of the Department of State that was working under the National Authority and in defence of the moneys and the property of local authorities under the Local Taxation Account. In so far as this particular method of dealing with all these cases is concerned, that is in substance made a national charge, but it is not a national charge that will fall upon the Exchequer because of the fact that the local authorities in question, by reason of this particular struggle, lost anything in the struggle, and in consequence they have no liability to meet in respect of it except that for which they were very well compensated in other directions.</P>

    <P>the expression &ldquo;military service&rdquo; means active service in any rank, whether as an officer, non-commissioned officer, private or volunteer in any of the following forces, that is to say&mdash;&ldquo;Oglaigh na hEireann&rdquo; or the <Col N="532" /> military body known as the &ldquo;Irish Volunteers&rdquo; or the military body known as the &ldquo;Irish Citizen Army&rdquo; or the body known as &ldquo;Fianna Eireann&rdquo; or the &ldquo;National Forces&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; or any branch of any of those forces.  For the purposes of this Act service as a member of the Irish Volunteer Executive or of the Headquarters Staff of Oglaigh na hEireann or in the Intelligence Branch of any of the said military forces or bodies, or in the Intelligence Service carried on under the authority of the First Dáil Eireann or of the Second Dáil Eireann, shall be deemed to be military service in Oglaigh na hEireann or in the Irish Volunteers, as the case may be; the expression &ldquo;National Forces&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923;</P>

      <P>The reason I propose this is because it has reference to a certain but perhaps small number of men who took part in the fight of Easter Week who were not connected with the Volunteers or with any of the bodies mentioned in this section.  They were organised as a fighting force and they went as an organised force into the fight in Easter Week and were mentioned specially in the Proclamation of Easter Week.  I do not know that they would be very many in number but there certainly were some.  I know one man who was mortally wounded in my Company in Parliament Street on the Tuesday of Easter Week and I believe he belonged to that but had no other connection with the armed forces.  I believe his widow has been drawing a pension as a result of his death.  It is to include such men who were attached to that force that I propose the amendment so that there will be no deserving section of men, no matter how small, who took part in that fight who will be precluded from benefiting, so far as this Bill confers benefits in this connection.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment is to extend the definition of National Forces in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, so as to include men who had pre-Truce service and who volunteered for any one of these three services.  These men volunteered at very great risk to their own lives. They did very valuable services and were really on active service during the particular period they were in these different corps.</P>

I take it that these were police-forces. If that is so it is a fairly strong argument for putting other police forces into the same position.  It may not have any practical effect.  I am not sure.  There may not have been any men demobilised from any other police forces, but I think that we ought to know quite clearly whether any other section is to be left out who did police work in the same way as these men are supposed to have done police work, police work which involved risk. These are three forces which, as far as I can understand, had no formal organisation, no formal legislative sanction. They were police forces, I take it, and I rather think that unless we are quite clear that there will be no other police forces left out which should be included as these are included, there is some fault in the drafting of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I handed in that motion, as a result of an unsatisfactory reply which I received at question hour. My question was: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a number of Custom watchers at the North Wall are under notice of dismissal at an early date; that there is an increased amount of work in their Department, and if in view of this he will see that their notice is withdrawn.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister, replying, said: &ldquo;The men who have been given notice are casual extra men employed on a daily basis.  In pursuance of the definite policy of the Government to give as much employment as possible to ex-members of the Army, any staff in this grade that may be required to meet additional work will be recruited from such men, and I regret that I am not prepared to cause the notices of discharge to be withdrawn.  None of the men concerned has served in the National Army.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to the inconsistency of the two parts of the reply.  The first part of his reply I thoroughly agree with.  When additional men are wanted in Government services I heartily approve of the idea of giving men in the National Army opportunities of competing for these positions, but here the answer says: &ldquo;Any staff in this grade that may be required to meet additional work will be recruited from such men.&rdquo;  There is no additional staff required.  Notice of dismissal has been served on existing employees with 12 months to two years' good service in order to create <Col N="537" /> vacancies.  Now I ask the Minister is that the policy of the Government, is that the way to remedy unemployment in the country&mdash;to dismiss married men without reason in order to make room for others?  I say it would suit the Government much better to leave these men alone, men who have given faithful service, and that these men who were demobbed from the Army should be reinstated in their positions.  I will give the Minister a case in which a former Government employee, for the past 12 months has been doing his level best in this House, in the Lobby outside, in endeavouring to persuade Deputies to induce the Government Department concerned to reinstate him, and they have not reinstated him. There are other means of providing work in the city for the demobbed men besides dismissing other men.  I merely rise to ask the Minister whether this is going to be the policy of the Government, because it is a serious matter for at least 1,000 to 1,200 men.  I am told there are 1,200 temporarily employed, temporary because they had never the good fortune to get their appointments.</P>
    <P>Their services range from practically twenty-five years down to the present day.  There is a great fear abroad that in order to smooth over present difficulties in the country with a certain class, that these men will, by degrees, in batches of twelve or thereabouts, be served with notice in order to get places for others.  I would ask the Minister whether that is the policy of the Government, and I would ask the Dáil whether they approve of such a policy&mdash;that citizens, some of them men of fifty years of age, men with large families, who could not join the Army, should be dismissed.  Is it fair because these men did not join the Army, that now they should be victimised, and told because they did not serve in the National Army, &ldquo;You must get out&rdquo;?  I would ask the Minister, in view of his own answer, that it is the intention that men will be recruited from ex-members of the National Army, while carrying out that intention to withdraw the notices on these men, and not to allow them to be victimised because they were not in a position to join the Army.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the appeal which has been made by Deputy Byrne in this case.  I assume, and I think I have a right to assume, that when these men were employed in the first instance, although they were employed in a casual way, they must have had some kind of national record in order to secure the positions.  Consequently for that reason there would be very little difference between them and the men who have served in the National Army.  At the same time I am not against the employment, where employment can be found, of any man who has served in the National Army. I think it should not be said that the only qualification for a position is that a man has served in the National Army. Where a man got into a position and got used to a particular class of work, he would naturally be more efficient, and I contend it is a bad policy on the part of the Government to remove men when they arrive at that stage of efficiency, and when they are fully acquainted with the conditions and the particular class of work which they are doing.</P>
      <P>I contend for these reasons that it is not good policy for the Government to remove men who, by their experience and length of service, qualified themselves as fit men for the positions, and simply to make room for men who have served in the National Army and who, perhaps, are not equally as well qualified as the men who have now been removed.  While I do not pretend to have the power or the patronage of those who sit on the opposite benches, I have been asked for a recommendation &mdash;although it may not be worth very much&mdash;by men who are looking for employment.  If a case comes before me of a single man or a married man with two or three children, I always give preference to the married man.</P>

      <P>I wish to associate myself to a certain extent with Deputy Byrne's appeal on two grounds. The first is that the whole question of temporary employment in Government departments is in a chaotic state.  Employment that endured for three or five years can hardly be called temporary employment.  I think it would be a very wise thing for the Minister for <Col N="539" /> Finance, when he recovers, to consider the desirability of seeing if men who have served three years in a temporary position should not be taken on the permanent establishment.  If a man serves three years in a position presumably he is a fit and suitable person for it.  I think that the whole question is one that needs reconsideration.  I do not go quite so far with Deputy Byrne in the second point.  I realise the immense difficulty that the Government have in finding employment for demobilised soldiers.  Under the present trade conditions it is very hard to find employment except what is provided by the Government.  I would not quarrel if the Government discharged temporary employees who had been fit to join the National Army and refused to do so.  All these cases require investigation. There are many men who by reason of age were not able to join the National Army.  Others, owing to wounds sustained in the European war or ill health, would not have been accepted by the National Army.  To me it seems a real injustice that men who could not join the National Army, even if they wished to do so, and in some cases they were rejected, should be discharged from Government employment now in order to make room for ex-National soldiers.  Cases of that kind have come under my notice and I have called the attention of the responsible Ministers to them.  On the question of reinstatement I think there should be a preliminary inquiry, as there may be other cases of people who do not know how to approach a Deputy and who may have suffered unfair treatment. If the Minister for Finance would set up some sort of a tribunal or inquiry, even if it were only a departmental body, to ascertain their family circumstances before their discharge, I think it would be a certain benefit and there would be a feeling that Justice had been done.  That feeling does not exist now in every case.</P>

      <P>I do not pretend to know the particulars of this case and as to whether the individuals who received notice have any claim from a national standpoint to be in the positions they are in to-day.  Certainly if <Col N="540" /> they are Dublin men, married, and forty or fifty years of age and are to be dismissed simply to make room for ex-National soldiers I would not be in agreement with it.  There may be other reasons and, perhaps, the President when replying will satisfy me in this matter.  I would like to point out that if the Government wants to place National soldiers in positions there are any amount of them available in the Government service if they dismiss men who are living well on the pensions that they are receiving from the British Army.  This is no new suggestion. Eighteen months ago I actually gave the names of, and positions that are held by ex-British soldiers who are enjoying really good pensions of £120 to £130 and £140, and who are at the same time drawing&mdash; between wages, house, fire and light and other things&mdash;up to £5 or £6 a week.  These are positions that should be given to ex-National soldiers who went through the struggle since 1916. If it is a fact that these men are Dublin men and are married men with families, and that there is nothing against them, I do not agree with dismissing them to make room for ex-National soldiers who are more likely to be ex-British Army men.  I could supply the names right away, and if the files are looked up it will be found that I pointed out a number of positions that could be given to ex-National soldiers, and that those deprived of those positions would not suffer very much.</P>

      <P>This case, to my mind, suffers very much from exaggeration. I think the exaggeration started in the first place with Deputy Byrne and extended all along the line until we had the most extraordinary exaggeration of all in Deputy McGrath's statement.  I do not know where these men with £5 a week are.</P>

      <P>In any case the statement is made in a general way that these eighteen men are men with families.  It is further stated that they may have amongst them a number who had pre-Truce service or national service <Col N="541" /> or something of that sort.  At most there are eighteen men affected, and they do not include either National Army men, men with any pre-Truce service, or dismissed or resigned ex-R.I.C. men.  This service, as far as I can go into it, came into existence eighteen months ago when we started our own Customs at the North Wall, and we have a right to give these posts now to men who served us in the hour of danger.  They have a right to demand it from us.  They fought for the peace that has been won, and it is their right and privilege.  If it is contended that these people who for ten, twelve or fifteen months have retained these positions during a time in which the other men shouldered their rifles, marched through the slush and fought for them at all hours of the night&mdash; men who were employed on a temporary basis at day rates&mdash;should be kept on, I do not subscribe to that.  I do not subscribe to the exaggerated statements made here.  Is there no one in the National Army who is married and who has children?</P>
      <P>Only last week I came across one man who was absolutely penniless, and who gave us good service.  It is intended, as far as Government employment is concerned, to give preference to ex-Army men.  That is the policy, and it was the policy when Deputy McGrath was Minister for Industry and Commerce, and when Deputy McCarthy was Parliamentary Secretary to the President. It was the policy all through, and it is still the policy, that these men should get what is their right and due, and that men who have been for ten or twelve months on a temporary basis should not be entitled to be put on a permanent basis.</P>

      <P>That was the policy. Some of us tried to do what the President is advocating now, and could not <Col N="542" /> get it done.  The men whom I mentioned were men who could well afford to live on the pensions they were receiving, and who, perhaps, were not in favour of the Government, while other men, ex-members of the National Army, who are now out of work, were fighting against the British Government.  I have not exaggerated, and if the files at the office of the Public Works are looked up it will be found that I have not exaggerated in stating the wages drawn by ex-British Army officers and men.  It is there in black and white.</P>
