      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is prepared to give temporary clerks in Government employment an opportunity of entering the established Civil Service by raising the age limit for the examinations in the case of such clerks or by holding special examinations limited to such clerks.</P>

      <P>The next examination to be held for permanent clerical appointments in the service will be limited to Temporary Clerks now serving in Government Offices, and a special extension of the normal age limit for such appointments will be allowed to entrants for this competition.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider the matter?  Does he realise <Col N="2126" /> that no civil service examinations have been held since 1913; that there is a very large number of clerical officers whose capacity would be such that if an examination of this particular standard had been held since then they would have been eligible by educational qualifications for it, and that if this examination is now held, without any provision being made by which temporary officers can sit for it, that they are practically excluded from entering by competitive examination the ranks of Junior Executive Officers, because it may be some time before a similar examination will be held?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Officers of that sort, of course, if they qualify by a clerical examination and are of the type suited for promotion, will have opportunities of entering the Executive grade by promotion. Exceedingly large numbers have in recent years entered the Executive grade by promotion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether new scales of salary have been adopted in respect of any Civil Service appointments, and, if so, whether they have been put into operation; whether different scales have been adopted for (a) married and (b) unmarried men; and whether he will withhold the putting into operation of any such new scales until he shall have an opportunity of hearing what the Dáil may have to say on the matter of different scales for married and unmarried men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>New scales of salary have recently been decided upon for the classes common to the whole Civil Service, including the Executive, Clerical and Shorthand and Typewriting Classes.  The new scales, which do not affect substantive rights existing at the change of Government, are being applied in their new posts to officers, who since the change of Government received promotion on an acting basis to higher grades, and have also been applied to new appointees entering the grades by examination.  The scales do <Col N="2127" /> not differentiate between married and unmarried men.  The principle of remuneration on that basis is one towards which I am sympathetically inclined, and in connection with the kindred question of pay of women as compared with men, I had already given directions for the collection and examination of statistics in order to ascertain how a system based on this principle would work out in practice.  The new scales now in force will not be a hindrance to introducing such a system of pay for future recruitment to the Service, if inquiry shows that it is practicable to apply it with advantage to the conditions of the Service in An Saorstát.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the old age pension granted to Mrs. Margaret Tiernan, Inchmore, Glasson, Athlone, has been reduced by four shillings per week; that her only means of income is two acres of land on the island, which is, during two-thirds of the year, covered with water; and whether he will, owing to the hardship which this reduction will cause to this pensioner, reconsider the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <P>At present the courts sit on those Catholic Holy Days upon which the public services generally are maintained.  They do not sit on Holy Days which are also Bank Holidays, not on Good Friday.  I do not see any objection to this practice.  The Sittings for the future of the different courts set up under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, will be determined by the rules of the respective courts.  As these rules have to be laid before the Dáil for its approval the Deputy will have an opportunity of dealing then with the subject matter of his question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if it is intended to make any change in the present system of Army supplies; if he is aware that practically every article required for military barracks is at present obtained from Dublin firms, and if, in future, local contractors will have an opportunity of quoting and will get preference, if they are in a position to supply at as low or lower prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to make any change in the present system of obtaining army supplies.  It is working admirably.  I am not aware that practically every article required for military barracks is obtained from Dublin firms.  Perishable foodstuffs, for instance, are mostly obtained locally. I should say, however, that I do not control the purchase of supplies for the Army other than foodstuffs, firearms <Col N="2129" /> and transport material.  Tenders for foodstuffs are invited through the medium of the Press.  Everybody consequently has an equal opportunity of quoting.  Preference is given to local traders in this connection if other conditions, for example, price, quality of goods, etc., are equally favourable.</P>

      <P>The Act is not satisfactory from an industrial point of view. According to the Act there must be a body of men or a corporation.

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1925, for payments in respect of destruction of or injuries to property within the period 21st January, 1919, to 12th May, 1923, inclusive, under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, as amended and otherwise, and in respect of damage to, or loss of property and payments by way of indemnification or recoupment under the Indemnity Act, 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a token estimate introduced for <Col N="2136" /> the purpose of bringing to the notice of the Dáil expenditure under this head.</P>
    <P>There will be more than ample savings, if I may use the word, to enable the liability which will arise under this particular clause of the Indemnity Act to be paid.  Deputies will, perhaps, remember that the Indemnity Act, 1924, provides that the Executive Minister may refer to a committee, set up under the Act, questions of claims for losses or damage arising out of acts of officers appointed by, or acting under, the First and Second Dáil.  Then there are certain limitations laid down.  It is said the committee shall not take into consideration any loss or damage arising from (1) billeting or quartering of troops; (2) sums paid or subscribed to any National loan or levy; and (3) fines imposed by any tribunal arising out of any order or regulation of general or local application, due to the existence of a state of war, or founded on mere loss of pleasure and amenity.  It is further laid down that the committee shall recommend payment of compensation only in cases where special or continuing hardship has resulted from loss or damage.  The committee has been appointed, consisting of Mr. Cussen, D.J., Mr. O'Dwyer of the Local Government Department, and Mr. Flanagan of the Finance Department.</P>
    <P>The number of claims so far received amounts to 4,000, and the total amount of them would be something over £160,000.  It is estimated, however, so far as investigations have gone, that a very large proportion of those claims&mdash; 25 per cent. or more&mdash;will immediately be ruled out as being outside the Act and the terms of reference of the Committee. Of those which will come within the terms of reference, the major part, by far the greater number, will come under four headings: (1) seizure of guns; (2) seizure of bicycles; (3) seizure of motor cars, and (4) commandeering of cars for use on active service during the war period. The work of dealing with these claims will be extremely difficult.  The certification of the damage done and the ascertaining of whether the loss was actually incurred through the action of some person who is authorised to act as he did, by either the First or Second <Col N="2137" /> Dáil, or was simply carrying out the duties of his office or position under that order, will take considerable time. That work will all be very difficult indeed.</P>
    <P>The Committee has been at work for some time and a great deal of preliminary matter has been got through, such as the classification and the registering of all these claims and the obtaining of essential details of various sorts.  All that work has already been in operation. It is not expected that during the financial year any very large sum will be required.  The amount set down in the estimate is £5,000.  Probably after this preliminary period which we are now entering upon, the work will go ahead much more rapidly, and possibly it will be completely dealt with inside the next financial year.  It is impossible yet, at the stage which the Committee work has reached, to say what the amount of awards will be in respect of the £160,000 claimed.  The awards will certainly be considerably less than that.  At the present stage, however, I could not inform the Dáil as to the total amount that is likely to be required.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister help us to understand where we are in relation to damage to property, houses and the like, occupied about the 28th June, by Free State troops, who caused great damage, which is very inadequately compensated for?  What opportunity will be given to us to deal with this question?  Will there be any supplementary estimate?</P>

      <P>There is one matter which I desire to bring before the Dáil. It is the treatment which some farmers have received in connection with property losses.  It applies in a special manner to one member of this Assembly who has been very unfairly treated, we <Col N="2138" /> consider, in the matter of the compensation awarded him.  He was offered a small amount, something like £479, for the reinstatement of his dwelling-house in a neighbourhood where the cost of building small dwelling-houses for persons, under the Army and Navy grants, comes to as much as £600 and £700. There is a general feeling that some people have not got the same opportunities as others in connection with those malicious injury claims.  Apropos of that, I wish also to direct the Minister's attention to a statement made by one of the judges in Waterford, which has, I think, a bearing upon this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In any matter like that, I am perfectly willing to discuss details, if the Deputy would give me some notice or raise it some day on the adjournment.  He should give me an opportunity to have the papers dealing with the case in my hands.  Strictly speaking, I do not think that the matter he has touched upon comes under this particular estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but in any case the estimate we are now discussing touches on a particular section of property losses, and deals with a particular class of case.  I could not, at the moment, deal with the matter the Deputy has raised.  If he cares to proceed with it he could do so at some other time, but let me say that it is absolutely impossible for any Minister to deal with individual cases unless due notice is given so that he can be supplied with particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me direct attention to one line in the estimate: &ldquo;Estimated savings on the sub-heads.&rdquo;  We <Col N="2139" /> contend that the savings on those sub-heads have been the cause of the particular injustice that I wish to bring under the Minister's notice now.  It is quite in order, and I wish to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that this is the only opportunity upon which we can bring pressure to bear on him.  It is all very well to say that this matter can be brought on afterwards and, when a case is stated, the Minister will have facts and figures to produce.  At the same time, you may be tied to the answer that building materials have fallen by 25 per cent. and so on.  In the case that I have referred to, unless the man builds up the house with his own hands, he certainly cannot put it up with the amount of money that has been awarded to him.  The matter is a serious one, and I would expect the Minister at least to give us a promise that not less than 50 per cent. of an advance would be given in this instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I know nothing about this case&mdash;I can remember nothing about it&mdash;except that the Deputy concerned came along suggesting that we should deal with it in some special way, and that it should not be dealt with under the Act, in the same way as all other cases are dealt with.  I refused to see him, because I took up the line that I would not give any more consideration to the case of a Deputy, or even a Minister, than I would to any other person.  I refused definitely to meet the Deputy referred to, or discuss the case with him at all.  His case was heard in the ordinary way, and he got the same crack of the whip as other claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regarded his case from one aspect as being very unreasonable.  If I had the file before me, and if I had had time to look over it, possibly, I could deal with it in detail.  As it is, I have only the most general recollection of the case.  There were cases where people had old houses, houses of inferior value, and where they got the full value of those houses it was extremely difficult to build new ones with the money.  They got, however, the real value of their old houses and that was not unjust.  That applies to everybody. <Col N="2140" /> I do not remember very well the details of this case the Deputy has raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>

      <P>No case could be. Public money can only be paid out in a regular way and only where an award of the court has been made.  I certainly would not enter into negotiations with anybody for the purpose of having any agreed settlement arrived at.  If the people responsible can arrive at a settlement with the applicant, and it is made a rule of court, well and good.  That will prevent litigation and the expenses attendant upon litigation.  But if it is not arrived at in the ordinary way by the people charged to do it and responsible for it, I would not intervene to get any agreement. When a case is heard there is nothing more to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the matter of guns taken by, or on the authority of, the Irish Republican Army in pre-Truce days.  On two occasions I asked questions in the Dáil, as a result of repeated communications to me from some districts.  I asked if anything could be done in order to have those guns returned, or otherwise have compensation paid where no return of guns could be made.  I was told on each occasion <Col N="2141" /> the matter was under consideration. The last time was previous to the Summer Recess.  I understand it is the Minister's intention now to refer this matter to a Committee, which will consider any claims sent in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to guns taken by the I.R.A. or the British?  This only deals with guns taken by the I.R.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am referring to.  There are three different classes of cases.  One is the case where there is definite proof, and where a written document can be produced by the individual whose gun was taken in pre-Truce days; he holds a receipt from the persons who took the gun.  That is clear and definite proof, if any proof is to be required or is to be acceptable. I want to know what steps have been taken by the Minister to see that those guns are returned.  In other cases complaints are being received in regard to guns supposed to have been taken by, or on the authority of, the I.R.A., but the individuals concerned can produce no receipt or proof that the gun was taken.  I only want the Minister to deal with the case where clear proof can be given, and I want to know from him why such cases should be referred to any committee, seeing that these claims have been continually coming in since 1922; in fact, some of them from 1921.  A case where guns are supposed to have been taken and where no proof could be produced is a different class of case altogether, and an inquiry into such a case would be justified.  But I think that to save Deputies repeated communications with regard to guns where proof can be given, some announcement should be made by the Minister in connection with this Vote.  I quite realise that numbers of guns were taken, as far as I can understand, by and on the authority of members of the I.R.A., and in the peculiar circumstances existing at the time they were not sent to any central headquarters; in fact, I know where guns were taken and were afterwards distributed amongst the friends of the parties who took them.  I want to know from the Minister what has been done, and if he is now in a position to deal with that <Col N="2142" /> particular class of case, and if the communications sent to his Department by individuals and by Deputies who are being continually communicated with will be attended to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why it is necessary to refer this matter to the Committee is that it is necessary to ascertain certain facts.  &ldquo;Any person holding office under the First Dáil Eireann, or the Second Dáil Eireann, in the proper exercise or execution of any power, authority, or duty vested in or imposed on him by virtue of such office or employment.&rdquo;  That is to say, that it was not because of a fellow seizing a gun, and the times being disturbed, simply deciding that he would have it.  It must be established that he did it as a military operation, as a member of the I.R.A., and not as a private individual.  That is a case where, even if a good deal of proof is given, there has to be a certain amount of investigation, even where it is proved that the gun was actually taken by somebody. These cases should be simple and should be dealt with very expeditiously.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that there are thousands of cases throughout the country where guns have been taken by the I.R.A. acting under orders, apparently, and where the names of those who took them are known?  If the Minister is given the names of the people who took possession of these guns will that convince him that they ought either to be returned or compensated for?  I do not know a thousand, but I know, I am sure, over a hundred cases where guns were handed over to individuals who, it was well known, <Col N="2143" /> were acting for the I.R.A.  These guns have never been returned, and we know that there are guns all over the country in the possession of those young men who were nominally in the I.R.A. at the time.  They are in their possession yet. That, I think, was a common practice.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if a case I have in mind will be covered by this.  It is the case of a farmer taken out of his house by people, and part of his claim was dealt with by the Personal Injuries Commission, or at least is in process of being dealt with.  But he has in addition to that a very considerable claim, which I personally can vouch for, in respect to damage to crops, and so on, that is to say, crops that were neglected owing to his absence from home.  He had to spend a very long time in Dublin when he was being medically treated, and when he was fit to go home he was told by the authorities that it would not be safe for him to do so, as the district was too disturbed and that he would be attacked.  He suffered a great deal of annoyance.  During the time he was away he had about twelve or fourteen acres of barely, a certain number of acres of oats, and other property of that kind, which went to the bad.  In addition to that he had to employ men to do some work during all the time he was absent.  I would like to know if the committee would deal with such a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that would come under the definition of consequential loss or damage, and that has been ruled out under the Compensation Act.  There has been a considerable number of people whose businesses or premises were destroyed and who were compensated for their premises and stock.  People of that kind lost a great deal, including crops, but no compensation has been paid in respect of consequential loss or damage, and I think that this would be the same kind of case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>

I want also to direct the Minister's attention in connection with this question of guns to a peculiar case where a farmer refused to give a gun to the I.R.A., and his employees, who were members of the I.R.A., managed to get the gun against his wishes.  Of course he has no receipt.  He was in this difficulty, that on the one side the R.I.C. asked him for his gun and he refused to give it, and then the other people came for it and he refused to give it also. On account of his men being members of the I.R.A. the gun was taken away, and he does not know where to get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £250,000, be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1925, for contributions towards the relief of unemployment and distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the sum previously granted by the Dáil the greater part, about £60,000, has already been allocated.  The major portion, certainly the most substantial portion, of that sum was allocated for works done by the Land Commission.  There was allocated, in the first instance, directly to the Land Commission for general works, a sum of £74,000, which included a sum of £2,000 for the extension of Dungloe Pier, in County Donegal. The remainder was for the ordinary works of land improvement, which the Land Commission carries out, that is drains, accommodation roads of various kinds, and bog roads.  Then a sum of £6,000 was allocated to the Department for forestry work.  That is the most substantial sum that was given. There was a sum of £35,000 allocated to the Dublin Corporation for various <Col N="2145" /> important works, building at Marino, various sewerage and drainage works, and paths.  Then £14,000 odd was allocated in the Counties Kildare, Wexford and Sligo, and for the Clonmel Council for road works.  Over £38,000 was allocated towards waterworks schemes. These included the towns of Drogheda, Arklow, Dingle, Rathdrum and Youghal. There was a small sum for road making.  These were the major sums. As the Minister for Industry and Commerce explained yesterday, the allocation of the full grant was held up because at first it was not contemplated that it would be absolutely necessary to devote a further sum, and it was thought that by holding over some portion of it and allocating it when we got into the winter, we might get through with the £250,000 that was voted.  It is now seen that that would not be possible, that there is a degree of unemployment and distress throughout the country which makes it necessary to make further sums available.</P>
    <P>Of the further £250,000, for which the Dáil is now asked, it is proposed that the most substantial portion shall again be given to the Land Commission for works of improvement in the various counties where they can carry out such works in an economical way, where useful and necessary work can be done, and where unemployment exists.  There is not exactly a final schedule from the Land Commission; various proposals have been put in, but I cannot say that all of these proposals will be accepted or that there will not be substitutions for some of them.  But there are proposals in from the Land Commission for over £180,000 for various counties, all, except a small sum, in the congested districts.  There will remain over of the new sum that is asked for some £60,000 or £70,000. That may be allocated to the Land Commission after further investigations; it may be given for works in towns and urban districts where suitable schemes may be put forward and where the need for employment exists. There remains, also, as I have said, some £60,000 or £65,000 of the first £250,000.  It is necessary that we should have this new fairly substantial sum granted in order that immediate <Col N="2146" /> allocation may be made, so that schemes for the giving of employment may be put in hand at once.</P>
    <P>We feel that as far as possible, where distress exists and where relief is necessary, the relief should be given by employment on useful works.  That is the most desirable way of doing it.  Of course, you cannot define those works, and in some cases the sum involved would be too great, and perhaps the work might not be of a type into which it would be desirable to put money at present.  But I think I can say that all the works that are proposed to be done under this particular Vote are works useful and necessary in themselves, and that the expenditure of this money will be very valuable towards relieving the hardship that does exist, both in town and country.  There is great urban unemployment, the figures of which were indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is rural unemployment not less serious, although there are not the same details available, owing to the fact that the Unemployment Insurance Act is not applicable to agricultural labourers, but there is most serious unemployment, and there is, in poor districts where the recent season has been something in the nature of a calamity, distress which can be relieved by employment, although the people in distress are not all exactly labourers.</P>
    <P>I believe that this grant should carry us through the winter so far as this particular kind of expenditure is concerned. The schemes of work that have been suggested&mdash;good schemes&mdash; do not seem likely to require more money than is now asked for, but certainly where distress exists we will deal sympathetically with all schemes put forward if they are good schemes, and if schemes in excess of the amount are put forward we will consider the matter afresh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he is making it a condition of these grants that they shall be expended within the winter period, that is to say, before the 31st March?  Allocation is one thing but expenditure is another and it is not going to be very much use to the persons who require <Col N="2147" /> this assistance if it is merely allocated and there is no assurance that it will be expended.  It will be a bad thing if in this case, as in several other cases hitherto, monies come back to the Exchequer because they have not been expended.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would see to it that there is a speeding up of these works, and that an effort is made by his Ministry and the other Ministries concerned, to have some of the relief work started before Christmas, because that is a season when there is great distress amongst the unemployed.  Another thing I would like to ask the Minister is, is it to be stipulated where a local council puts up a scheme, that they should provide a certain amount of the money themselves?  I do not think that that stipulation should be made, because ratepayers are suffering to a great extent at the moment, and in some places they have put up a certain amount in order that they would get a grant.  In this connection I would ask the Minister not to make a contribution necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that I am interested in this Vote particularly, as although I come from a constituency that is at times at least unfortunate enough to be outside the scheduled area of congested districts, the people are just as unfortunate at present as are the people in the congested districts with regard to fuel and distress.  I want one or two points explained in connection with this Vote.  It is not going to be an easy matter to make regulations about how this money is to be spent in various counties, and it can be misspent.  I must say that we have unemployment both in town and country. It is so in my constituency.  But I will say this, that the people unemployed in the towns generally, at least in my county, are able to make a good deal more noise about unemployment <Col N="2148" /> than the people in the country.  Consequently it is not unlikely that the towns will perhaps get more than a fair share of the amount to be expended.  I think that the money should be spent in proportion to the number unemployed in each district.  Unless in the allocation of this money consideration is given to this point of view, that it should be spent in districts in accordance with the scarcity of fuel, which must be the first thing to be provided, and in accordance with the number of people unemployed in these districts who want work and who are prepared to work, I am afraid there is a danger that the best will not be got out of this money at all.  I do not know whether it is proposed to spend the money through the county councils, or what the method will be, but this is a point of view that should be kept in mind, and I think if it were possible, it would be right to go as far as trying to ascertain how many people there are in town and country, either through the present clerks of district councils, or in some other way, who are prepared to work and who want work, before any scheme would be devised for relief of distress in any district.  If you have 1,000 men who want work in one district it would not be fair to spend the same amount in that district as where there are only 200 men.  Deputy Corish has raised a point about local authorities being called upon to put up a certain sum.  It seems to me that a certain sum should go to the local authorities to enable them to relieve distress in any way, because we have everywhere people in distress who would not in ordinary circumstances need relief.  These are people who are unable to work, and the local authorities must come to their relief.  These people will number thousands in every county.  I must say that it is my view that this will be too great a burden to put on the rates.  Relief or home help will be too big a burden for local ratepayers to bear this season, and I think consideration should be given to that aspect of the case.  In every county or at least in the counties where there is distress, a certain sum should be allocated to assist the county board of health to meet distress in the way that they have got to meet it.</P>

      <P>I think that some of this money could be very usefully spent in my constituency.  In my district we have 1,000 acres of good land left to us, in the hands of the military, if you like.  A sum of money could be very well spent there in the production of beet.  It is an industry that is in its infancy, and if it is to be started at all, I think that 100 or 200 acres could be set aside at Moor Park on which a number of men who are at present unemployed in the districts of Fermoy and Kilworth could be usefully employed.  These men have already been deprived of their main employment. The British Government employed hundreds, I might say thousands, of them.  They will be thrown on home help this winter if something is not done to relieve them. Relief is too often given without any advantage except to the poor person relieved, but relief of the kind I indicate would be very useful, especially if we intend to give the beet industry a fair trial.  The fillip should come from the Government.</P>

      <P>I do not think any Deputy is disputing the necessity of this Vote.  I do not think there is any opposition to the Vote, and the whole discussion is hinging on the manner in which the money should be expended. Now I have great sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Baxter about enquiries, as to the manner in which the money should be spent, but I think it is too late now to make enquiries.  Enquiries should have been made three months ago, when it became evident that the harvest would be a bad one.  I think that by now enquiries have been made and schemes have been framed, and if any time is spent on enquiries the worst of the winter will be on us before any money can be spent.</P>

      <P>I differ from Deputy Baxter because that would hold up the work by a week, and I do not want the work held up even a week. As to the manner in which the money is to be expended, I want to say a word. If any portion is spent in Dublin, there is no doubt what is the greatest need. The greatest need is housing.  There is £60,000 or £70,000 that the Land Commission have not laid their hands on or laid claim to.  If any portion of that money is to be spent in Dublin, it could not be better spent than in pulling down tenement houses and putting up decent houses to replace them.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>As regards the plans of the Land Commission, road-making is a good thing within limits, but one reason why our roads are so badly kept at present is that there are too many of them and those that there are are too wide.  In the country districts we have extraordinarily wide roads.  They were, I believe, made wide for military reasons to allow a company of infantry to march abreast.  That means a considerable tax on the ratepayers for maintenance. I hope the Land Commission will not devote their attention altogether to the question of new roads.  I would rather see the existing roads put into good order.  Another point that I would like to emphasise is that the methods of road-making are being revolutionised. A new type of road-making has been introduced in England, and a new system is being tested in Northern Ireland.  It would be a mistake to sink too much money in old methods of road-making when we may be on the eve of some improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to drainage, I will now follow Deputy Daly's bad example, and draw <Col N="2151" /> the Minister's attention to one particular scheme which is not in my constituency. Ten years ago the Congested Districts Board framed a scheme for the drainage of the Abhann Mór in Sligo.  They obtained a grant from the British Treasury.  The Government put the work in hand and partially carried it out.  Then the war came.  The scheme was carried on for some time, but then there came a period of financial stringency and the scheme was abandoned and never completed.  I presume the plans for that scheme are in the possession of the Ministry.  The work that has been done can be made use of.  If it is intended to expend any of this money in Sligo, where very considerable distress does exist, the carrying on of the work of drainage of this river, plans for which are in existence, would be one of the most useful and effective means of expenditure.  In view of the fact that a Parliamentary secretary represents Sligo, I hope his attention has been called to the matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other points as to the abnormal work of the Land Commission, it seems to me that we have almost enough done in road-making. Though there is not enough done in drainage, drainage carried on on a comparatively small scale does not add an enormous amount to the growth of the country.  I would like if the Minister for Finance would go a little further and consult with Ministers other than the Minister for Agriculture on this matter.  Has he consulted the Minister for Education?  There is no doubt that in the country districts there are a great many bad schools&mdash;dirty schools and insanitary schools.  Money spent on repairing or possibly pulling down and rebuilding these schools would be as usefully spent as it could be.  Then, again, has the Minister consulted the Minister for Local Government as to the various public bodies which could usefully use public money?  Has he considered the advisability of granting them sums of money, not by way of a gift, but by way of loan, on easy terms and at a low rate of interest?  Perhaps I might ask the Minister to go even further and consider&mdash;apart altogether <Col N="2152" /> from the Trade Loans Act&mdash;the lending of a certain amount of public money at low rates of interest to firms or individuals who are prepared to carry out work, extending their business and that sort of thing, but who cannot lay hands on the capital at the present moment. That would give more constructive and more useful employment than the interminable making of roads.  Some of it would, of course, be employment for more highly skilled workers than would be engaged on road-making.  I would like to know if the Minister has considered that?  I can quite see that there are obvious objections to it, but I would like to know what the Minister's objections are.</P>
    <P>I now come to the point which, I think, Deputy O'Connell raised&mdash;the question of fuel.  On the Western seaboard that is really the crux of the whole matter.  It is an evil that can be remedied comparatively easily.  You cannot restore the turf, which has failed this year, to the people.  But the Government, by tackling the thing on a big scale, ought to be able to supply these people with coal very cheaply.  It is very largely a question of organisation. On this point&mdash;to meet the one serious need: to meet a famine&mdash;I am practically a Socialist; that is, on this one point.  In a famine I would be a Socialist, and I would support the idea that in the case of plague or famine the State should take over everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that this is a big emergency and that in a fuel famine I would go a long way. I would be prepared to say that the State should organise a supply of coal to the districts on the western seaboard where the fuel harvest has failed. The Government could import the coal, say, from Scotland, in bulk from sea, and land supplies at, say, Killybegs, Sligo, Ballina and Westport, and make arrangements for its distribution at practically cost price.  By doing that, a great deal of expense by loading in small lots might be saved.  Of course, care will have to be taken not to ruin absolutely people in the coal trade in <Col N="2153" /> that area.  Coal should only be supplied under the State scheme to those in need who were not in the habit of buying coal in the past&mdash;people who were accustomed to rely on turf as their fuel and who now find that they have not got that fuel.  Subject to that limitation, there is a good deal to be said for the State undertaking some such scheme to meet the crisis.  A crisis is there and has got to be met in some way.  The way it is being met at the present time is largely by cutting down timber, which is an extremely bad thing for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to certain difficulties which appear to have arisen in the case of monies voted from the Relief Fund for expenditure in district council areas in three or four cases in which I am concerned.  In one district in my constituency the rural district councils have got into a sulky frame of mind owing to the decision of the Minister for Local Government to wipe them out.  They have been called together in three different cases to discuss a scheme likely to secure the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, and which, if approved, would relieve a considerable amount of unemployment in these areas.  I want to know from the Minister if he is prepared to take any steps to deal with a situation in which a district council will not come and do their duty in that way.  What action is he prepared to take in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government to deal with the holding up of consideration of such schemes?  Unless some special action is taken in the case of district councillors who refuse to attend the meetings or who are not prepared to form a quorum at these meetings, there is no use in money being promised for these particular schemes.  I know of two drainage schemes which are held up in two towns where those drainage and water works schemes are desirable from a public health point of view and from the point of view of the relief of unemployment.  I want to join with Deputy Corish in urging the Minister to see that no unfair amount is imposed on the local ratepayers in the <Col N="2154" /> case of any money voted for schemes such as drainage or water works or any other works the Minister may consider suitable for the objects which he has in mind.  I know the case of a water works scheme which has been under consideration for the past two years, where the local charge upon the town would amount to 4/11 in the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is ridiculous in the present state of affairs, with the burden on the ratepayers, and with the general depression that exists, to insist on a local charge of 4/11 for carrying out a drainage and a water works scheme.  I quote that as an instance of the necessity for giving attention to that, and I would urge that in any scheme that is to secure the approval of the Minister for Finance it is necessary that at least half of the money should be found out of the relief fund for this particular work.  Deputy Cooper has referred to the question of mobilising the State for the purpose of organising the coal and fuel supply.  I think he is gradually coming forward in the right direction and eventually, if he keeps travelling at that place, he will find himself, perhaps by accident, in the ranks of the Labour Party.  If he is prepared to go that far, I think he might also urge upon the Minister the desirability of setting aside money for putting the available coal fields wherever they exist&mdash;the Arigna, the Wolfhill, Castlecomer&mdash;or the peat districts in a position to supply our own home requirements.  That would prevent money going out of this country for imported coal.  We should keep that money at home as far as we can.  I think the State can only live when it first takes into consideration the desirability of producing as much as we can at home of the things we need, particularly coal and peat.  We have, according to the estimate of experts, available peat resources to supply us for 30 or 35 years.  I will not venture to suggest the amount of available coal we have, but whether it is available or not very little has been done by the present Ministry to encourage the development of our own coal in this country.  We are dependent on England at the present time for 55 per cent. of our heat-producing power, and there is little use <Col N="2155" /> in people here or outside talking about absolute separation from England so long as we are economically dependent on England to that extent.  I think these are the things we should tackle. We should reduce the quantity of imports by extending and developing our own natural resources, which are valuable and unlimited if we only realised it.  Deputy Cooper suggested another point for the Minister for Finance, namely, that the State should lend money to business firms for business purposes.  I wonder would he go so far as to suggest that we should have a State banking system, because from what I know of our banking system I would support him in that.  That is a matter not merely for the Minister for Finance but for the Executive Council as a body.</P>

      <P>I am supporting Deputy Cooper to that extent, and I will support him to a greater extent if he is prepared to go further.  Deputy Cooper seems very interested in Sligo. I do not know whether his interest in that constituency is due to the fact that there is a double-barrelled vacancy there at the moment and that there would be very little difficulty in persuading the Minister for Finance, in view of an early election, to spend as much as he can in that particular constituency and the other vacant constituencies. The matter dawned upon me that Deputy Cooper anticipated the election and urged Deputy Dolan to press for as much money as he could out of the relief fund in view of that coming on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to the serious difficulty that exists in <Col N="2156" /> the areas where money is spent under the auspices of the local governing authorities, particularly the district councils, when those schemes are held up because of their sulky attitude.  If no steps are taken by the Minister to deal with that particular situation, there is no use in the Minister promising to Deputies in this House money for the relief of unemployment by useful work.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister in whose power it will lie to administer relief schemes. Is it in the power of the district council, the county council, or the urban council, or can an individual or a certain number of individuals apply to the Minister to start a scheme in a certain district?  I should also like to impress on the Minister for Agriculture the desirability of letting us know who will have the promotion of those schemes of drainage in the different parts of the country alluded to by the Minister for Finance.  Will the different boards, or a certain number of individual tenants who are perhaps in a flooded district or otherwise, have power to apply to the Ministry to start a drainage scheme in their district?  I should also like to impress on the Minister for Finance that in dealing with this fund he should spend the major portion of it in the rural districts, because as a rule the town workers are all, or almost all, qualified for the dole. In the rural districts not an agricultural labourer can apply, and I can assure the Minister that there is as much unemployment in rural districts to-day as there is in urban ones.  In my own county the rural districts are in a deplorable way for want of employment, and I would impress on the Minister to earmark the bulk of this money for the rural districts, and not to hoard it all for the congested districts either.  In my own county there are districts in as bad a way as any congested district.  I ask the Minister to deal liberally with the rural districts in the promotion of schemes in them, and if other people fail to promote the schemes the Minister should take the initiative and promote them himself.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies <Col N="2157" /> who stated that there is a danger that money of this sort might be misused.  I want to assure Deputy Cooper&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;that the decision to spend this money is not an eleventh hour decision.  If a last moment decision was taken to spend a large sum of money on relief works it is almost certain that nearly half of it would be wasted, at least, as compared with money spent in the pursuance of schemes which got full consideration. Deputy Cooper pointed out that this was not the time to be looking for information, that this was not the time to be looking for statistics or to be diagnosing the problem, and that we ought exactly to know what the problem is.  I do not agree with his time table.  He said this information should be found three months ago, and he was most specific that the effects of the bad harvest should have been ascertained three months ago.  That could not be done. Three months would bring you into the month of September.  The month of September was going to make a great difference in regard to the harvest.  A fine month of September would have altered our problem considerably. There were certain tentative inquiries made in September but final information in regard to the harvest could not be gleaned in that month, and these inquiries have been brought up to date, and I am satisfied personally that I have in my office in map form an exact picture of the real position in regard to fuel, potatoes, grain and crops generally. This is not information that has been gathered during the past week, but it has been prepared, sifted, and analysed by particular officials whose duty it is to attend to those matters and to take part generally in the development of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing at a time.  I am coming to that.  All this talk about famine is nonsense.  There is no real famine in any sense of the word.  These scare statements about a fuel famine, a potato famine, and a corn famine are inaccurate and misleading, and it is just what Deputy Cooper fears, that we are <Col N="2158" /> coming to conclusions without adequate information, that leads him to talk of famine.</P>
      <P>From one point of view the use of the word famine might be correct.  If, for instance, in one townland there was a shortage of potatoes, you could say that there was a famine there, but that would not justify you in speaking of famine all over the country, and that is the impression given by speakers here.  If we do not envisage the problem properly we cannot consider it properly.  We know that we have no unlimited money to spare, and we are anxious to see that money spent in the right direction.  The first thing to do, if we are to achieve our object, is to refrain from making exaggerated statements in regard to the problem.  There is a shortage of potatoes in certain districts, and it may be that time will tell that potatoes generally will not keep very well.  We are not able to make up our minds on that at the moment, and, personally, I believe that time will tell a different story and that it will be found that they will keep.  The real fear from that point of view is not a shortage of potatoes, or a danger that they may not keep, but that there is in certain areas extreme poverty coupled with high prices for feeding stuffs, and that these two facts may lead people to use potatoes which they could keep for seed, and there may be a shortage of seed next year.  That is possible in regard to definite, limited areas.  That is the problem at the moment, and it is one that cannot be intelligently discussed, because we have to wait for a year to see how it works out.  In regard to fuel, I may say that the amount available is nothing like that of last year.  It is not.  There is an area where there is a one-third failure, and that is a very big area.  There is an area where there is a two-third failure, and that is a rather small one, and there is an area, which is very much smaller still, where the failure is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to face all those elements of the situation, not to isolate them, not as if they had not reactions on each other, but to face the fact that outside the harvest and other matters over which we have no control, you have a big agricultural depression in addition <Col N="2159" /> to a bad harvest, and bad results as regards turf, potatoes and grain.  In addition, you have special areas within the congested districts where there is chronic poverty, which is aggravated this year.  You have to face that whole problem and see what is best to be done.  In regard to that part of the Vote for the Land Commission, some Deputies seem to be under a misapprehension as to what the £200,000 is to be spent upon.  The Minister for Finance explained that most of the money would go to the Land Commission and would be spent on roads and drainage. This money, therefore, is not going to the local bodies, nor is it, as Deputy Cooper apparently thought it was, going to be spent on roads kept by the rural and county councils.  The money is to be spent through the Land Commission on schemes which have been under consideration by the Minister for Finance and the Land Commission for at least a year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that money has been made available already early this year for the Land Commission, and practically all that money, with the exception of £10,000, will be devoted to the completion of works on hands. When it was realised at the end of last year that it was possible that the works which the Land Commission would have to do between this and five years could be done this year, they were asked to put in schedules to have them examined from every point of view.  These are schemes which necessitate preliminary work such as drainage and the making of roads on new estates and other work of that kind necessary to be done in connection with land purchase operations and which would in normal times be done within about five years.  It was realised last year that quite possibly these considerations, which have now occurred, might make it necessary that that money should be spent this year instead of spreading it over a period of five years, and the first schedules were put in to the Ministry of Finance early this year.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not a secret to any Deputy that in dealing with the Ministry of Finance you do not always put up your first proposition on lines which are going to be agreed to.  The whole <Col N="2160" /> proposition was put up to the Ministry of Finance in the expectation that we could agree that some of the money would be spent early and the balance later on.  At any rate all the Schedules have been before the Ministry of Finance and they have been under examination. I wish to point out that this is not an eleventh hour decision and the money is not now being voted because somebody has got into a panic.  The schemes have been agreed to by the Minister for Finance and this money would have, in any event, to be spent within the next five years, but we consider it good business to spend it now when the needs are most urgent for this purpose. The Land Commission have got together an adequate staff and have begun to make arrangements for starting this work.  Deputy Johnson asked when this money would be spent. Assuming that the Land Commission get this £200,000 they would be able to complete the work within twenty weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point, I take it, is that as the works have already begun, and within a fortnight 50 per cent. of the men will be taken on, that that makes the scheme rigid and that it must go through.  The Land Commission, say, propose to open a road on an estate.  It is quite easy for them, even a long time after beginning, <Col N="2161" /> to decide to make roads not so costly, and they may consider that part of the money will be, for a month at least, in such a position that it can be transferred fairly easy.  You cannot, of course, have accurate proportions in these matters.  You have to take into consideration that you must start these schemes quickly, and you have first of all to realise that once a decision is taken the work has to go on, and waive as many objections as you can to the preliminary work starting quickly. That, to a certain extent, makes the scheme somewhat less elastic.  Ask yourself whether, having regard to the fact that at least one-half the money can be exchanged within a month, it is not right to go ahead with the schemes at once, and lose probably elasticity by being committed to a certain amount.  You have to put one against another.</P>

Every county is suffering at present, and the county I represent has about 2,500 unemployed scattered all over the county.  We want this money to be spent in such a way that all districts will benefit by the grants, as otherwise it would be of no use.  I would impress on the Minister that the need is immediate.  We want work to start at once.  I am afraid these land schemes the Minister thinks so much about, and that no doubt are requisite for the reclamation and improvement of the land, will take a long time to mature, and that during the time he is getting his engineers to work the people will die of hunger; but what we want is immediate employment under this scheme.</P>

      <P>The scheme I was addressing myself to does not cover the whole <Col N="2162" /> country.  We must begin at the beginning, and the right place to begin is with the poorer districts.  We had to take into account the relief of unemployment. The description, relief of unemployment, is likely to be misleading. These schemes will relieve the agricultural labourers, of which there are not so many, and the sons of small farmers, men who are half farmers and half labourers, and that class of people. It is relief of unemployment, but also relief of the farmer who is working on his land and ekeing out an existence by earning a certain amount of wages. In considering this problem we are faced with the fact that we have certain limitations financial and otherwise. As I have said, we have to begin with the poorer districts.  We could easily dissipate ourselves all over the whole country, and do nothing in any particular way.  This money I have mentioned will not be spent outside congested districts, except in Cavan, which is a congested county except in the legal definition.</P>

I want Deputies to remember that there is £50,000 more in this Vote which we have to deal with which is available for other districts, and as the Minister for Finance mentioned, £60,000 on the other Vote.  The suggestion, I take it, is that there is going to be an election in Cavan.  There is hardly a Deputy among the farmers who does not know that, outside the congested districts, Cavan needs more attention than any other county in Ireland. I would say that with the exception of one or two areas in the congested districts, Cavan needs most attention both as regards fuel and potato supply.  Why County Cavan?  The farmer Deputies know that this year you have an extraordinary phenomenon, that not only have the roots failed, but the grain has failed in most counties. When there is a wet year you would get a fairly big grain crop, though the quality may not be good, but in Cavan the root and grain crops failed because of the peculiar quality of the land.  Anyone <Col N="2163" /> who knows agriculture knows that in Cavan, and in parts of Monaghan, the quality of the land is extraordinary. As a matter of fact, the shortage of fuel and potatoes in Cavan is rather similar to that in Connemara.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies will appreciate that this is an extremely difficult problem. It was suggested that coal should be made available to be sold at cost price. I do not think that should be done. That would really mean tackling a very big area.  The particular area I referred to is only one-third short.  The Government could not go in and provide coal, and sell and distribute it in a huge area.  The real problem in regard to fuel is a limited one&mdash;it is the supply of fuel in the poorer districts in Connemara, Leitrim, and the islands off the coast, where there is extreme poverty, and no money to buy the fuel. I want Deputies to remember also that the Land Commission could not guarantee to find work in every district where there are unemployed.  Deputy Baxter suggested that we should get a census of the number unemployed, and give work to them in strict proportion. Deputy Cooper made a suggestion that we should go in for drainage work like that at the Owenmore, but any farmer will tell him that you cannot work on a drainage scheme in winter, and especially in this month, December.</P>
      <P>On the one hand you have Deputy Cooper's suggestion that we should concentrate large sums of money in one particular district, and, on the other, Deputy Baxter's, that there should be an exact census taken of the unemployed, and that the money should be divided accordingly.  We can do neither.  The Land Commission can only spend money where they have work.  They will take into consideration, so far as they can, that a certain area is poor, and that consequently money should be spent there, if we have work there.  But they cannot do it in that entirely accurate and scientific way that Deputy Baxter suggests.  Neither do they propose to do it by concentrating all the money in one little area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides this £250,000 there is available in the Board of Works at the moment £100,000 to be issued to farmers <Col N="2164" /> by way of loans for buildings.  The applications are coming in rapidly, and will be dealt with rapidly, and that will give a certain amount of employment outside the congested districts.  There will also be made available for individual farmers for drainage, sums up to at least £100,000.  I think farmers will agree with me that money spent in that way is far more remunerative than money spent on schemes.  It might take £20,000 to drain a river, defined as a drainage maintenance district. It is essential it should be done, as it might improve the holdings of ten or twenty farmers.  I do not want to suggest that that sort of work should not be done as soon as possible, but the £20,000 lent to an individual farmer, who knows just the amount of profit you can make out of farming, and who is not going to waste his money, would produce very nearly twice the amount of wealth.  I say that apropos of the fact that as well as money for farm buildings in the Board of Works there is also a further sum of perhaps £100,000 available for drainage.  If these applications come in, they can be examined by the time that you can do drainage on individual farms, say about March.</P>

      <P>That raises another point. If Deputies think the Government are going to go in and drain every stream that flows through their land and that of their neighbours they are making a mistake.  There are two sorts of schemes.  Take a river like the Owen-more. You could not expect farmers to drain rivers like that.  These schemes are dealt with under the Drainage Maintenance Act.  There are smaller streams, four or five feet wide, flowing by farmers' lands.  Farmers will have to make up their minds to keep these clean.  If the drainage system is so blocked that a farmer cannot drain his own land, then he is in an unfortunate position.  I hope farmers are not taking up the attitude that because they will not themselves do the bigger drains on their lands, then it is impossible to make loans to farmers to do the smaller drainage which, as I say, is highly remunerative and necessary.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about the Tolka.  I suppose, as it has a name, it is a rather big river.  There are rivers 15 or 20 yards wide which flow through and by the lands of farmers. I never expected farmers to clean them.  There are also rivers one or two yards wide.  They are expected to clean them.  There was never a suggestion that the State should clean those rivers.  Then there are small drains, a foot or two wide, that they make on their own lands, which it is absolutely essential to make and which yield immense returns.  Deputy Gorey's point was, I take it, that there was no use making small drains because they could not clean the river into which they flow.  If one farmer cleans his part of the river and his neighbour will not clean his part, we cannot help that. There are some things we must do ourselves and farmers must make up their minds that they must clean the bigger drains flowing by their lands.</P>

      <P>As to Deputy Gorey's point, I am perfectly certain that there are plenty of farmers, of whom I am one, who would be very glad to get money to drain land, and there are no engineering difficulties which would require anything more than the mere inspection by the Board of Works.  We appreciate what Deputy Johnson said, that the money has to be spent quickly. There is no use in promising it, and having it coming back again to the Treasury.  The money should be made available, and the actual work done as soon as possible.  We appreciate the point, and I think there is not likely to be any complaint on that head.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly approve of the action of the Ministry in devoting the major portion of this grant towards providing relief for the congested areas.  It is clear, I think, from what some Deputies have said on this, and on other occasions, that there is not an adequate or genuine understanding of the real problem that exists in these areas.  As the Minister pointed out, it is not a question of providing employment for people who are generally wage earners.  There you have the problem of the small uneconomic holder.  When speaking of the uneconomic holding we mean one that is not able to provide sustenance for the occupants.</P>

      <P>The small holders are in a state of chronic distress during the greater part of the year.  We know that especially during the war period the emigration of young men from these areas was very great.  It would be equally great now if the same facilities for emigration existed.  In those areas there were also small holders, and the <Col N="2168" /> sons of small farmers, who crossed to England and Scotland every year during the harvest.  They brought back what they earned, and that money kept the little place at home going.  That avenue is almost closed to these people now, and the distress is consequently all the greater.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is sufficient labour in England to do the necessary harvest work.  England, like portions of Ireland, is going out of tillage which provided work for these people in the past.  The problem is one, I am afraid, that many in the Dáil do not understand.  I know that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture thoroughly appreciates the position, and the Government have shown that by devoting the major portion of this grant towards providing useful works in these areas.  I think that is a wise decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with a subject that was referred to by Deputy Cooper. That was the question of the aid that might be given to the schools.  The Deputy spoke about the unsanitary school buildings that there are in the country. There are a great many such buildings, but that is not the most urgent problem at the moment.  The problem is to provide fuel for the schools.  Even though the buildings are unsanitary it is worse that they should be without a fire at this particular time of the year. I have heard from various parts of the country stories of the hardships the children are suffering.  Many of them have to go to these schools without breakfast, as no fuel is available.  They have then to remain in cold and cheerless schools during the day.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister for Finance to set aside a small sum of money with which to make provision in these areas for fuel.  Heretofore a small contribution was made by the parents of the children, and from 30/- to £3 was paid to each school by the State, for cleaning it and providing fuel.  That sum will be inadequate this year, and I hope the Minister will see his way to make some special provision for the schools <Col N="2169" /> situate in areas that are suffering from the scarcity of fuel.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Minister's statement about loans to farmers. Some time ago, when the Local Loans Fund was under discussion in the Dáil, I brought under the notice of the Minister for Finance the question of teachers' residences in connection with schools.  At that time the Minister said he was looking into the matter and would see what could be done.  I know that a great many managers of schools are prepared to build residences if they get loans on reasonable terms.  That would do two things.  Every house provided, no matter how it is provided, helps to remove the existing shortage of houses, and also provides work.  A great many managers are ready to begin the work at once of providing residences in connection with the schools if loans were set aside for the purpose. As attention has now been drawn to the matter again, I hope the Minister for Finance will consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin spoke about the development of the Irish coalfields, and I am compelled, as a director of the Wolfhill colliery, and as one who invested a considerable amount of money there, to tell him that it was the action of the party he represents that has thrown 200 men out of employment, and that has that colliery closed.  These men have now to receive relief from the Government, while, if they had remained at their work, earning the decent and the good wages they had been paid, they would have established in the country an industry which, if developed, would, in my opinion, be the means in the future of employing a very large number of people.</P>
      <P>That is no encouragement to the people who put their money into the industry and have lost it.  It is very hard to expect anyone under such circumstances again to subscribe funds for industries that are treated such as that one was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the relief scheme very sincerely. I know that some such scheme is very badly wanted, and I would like to suggest to the Minister that in certain counties like Westmeath, where the roads are good, a small sum might be <Col N="2170" /> set aside for small drainage grants.  It could be used, perhaps, by local authorities in towns in draining districts in which a number of houses are at present surrounded by water.  A small expenditure would enable the people to live in these houses during the winter. It is an important matter for those concerned, and I throw out the suggestion to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister that my constituency in the Co. Kildare deserves special attention. The facts are, that there is a great deal of unemployment there.  In fact, it is so great that it will become a regular menace if something is not done to relieve it speedily.  The break up of the big British camps that existed in that county resulted in a great deal of unemployment and a great deal of poverty, not alone amongst wage earners but also amongst other classes. The exit of the British, from the national point of view, was of course, a matter of great satisfaction, but it involved a great deal of suffering on those who had earned money from them. During the time of the British there was a great circulation of money week by week, and the fact that the people in that area have been deprived of the circulation of that money has, as I have said, caused a great deal of distress. The amount of money that is spent in County Kildare on home help is assuming enormous dimensions.  I read in a local paper recently the report of speeches delivered by members of the Home Help Committee, in which they expressed their deep concern at the tremendous sums of money spent weekly in the county under that head.  They stated that the amount was beyond the ability of the ratepayers to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the drainage scheme outlined by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, I am sorry he did not meet the point put up by Deputy Gorey.  I can give a case in point in regard to that.  I know a stream&mdash;it passes through my land&mdash;which discharges, after a course of two miles, into a larger one.  That stream is bordered by lands owned perhaps by a dozen farmers. It is impossible to get these men <Col N="2171" /> to join together to do the necessary work on that scheme, and, besides, it would require certain skilled direction in order to carry it out properly.  The result is that enormous damage is being done, and that the conditions which obtain there make it impossible for a farmer to improve his land by field drainage, because he has not got the necessary outlet.  As well as that, I have got in mind three or four minor rivers throughout the county in which much the same conditions exist.  In one particular district the people this year have lost all their crops on account of the floods.  It would be very useful if the Minister would elaborate his scheme by which joint action could be taken by groups of farmers and by which they could obtain loans.  I do not say that money should be given to them by way of a gift, but what I ask is that arrangements should be made whereby farmers could borrow money and carry out these drainage schemes under skilled direction.  I think that would be very useful work indeed, because the country is in a water-logged condition all over, and it would not at all interfere with the beneficent scheme that the Minister for Finance has for the drainage of the Barrow.  We do not deny that that is a matter of urgency.  At the same time we suggest that these minor works could be done.  If they were done they would provide a sufficient outfall for the small streams in the higher localities without at all touching on the Barrow scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word of appreciation as regards the attempt of the Government to deal with the very serious situation that prevails over the entire country.  Where you have well-to-do counties like Wexford, Carlow and Kildare, complaining of acute distress, what, one may ask, must the situation be in the poorer counties?  As the Minister for Lands and Agriculture said, a state of chronic distress prevails in these poorer counties.  I approve of the method by which the Minister for Agriculture proposes to bring relief to those districts, that is, through the Land Commission.  That is a good way to do it, because there you have the machinery and the officials and you <Col N="2172" /> can get to work at once.  That is very important, but it is a very serious limitation that you can only get to work on scheduled areas in which the Land Commission own estates and have the plans ready.</P>
      <P>If the distress coincided with these areas, that plan, of course, would meet the situation, but unfortunately that is not the case.  I admit that in nearly every case where it is proposed to carry out schemes on these estates the work is needed, but there are other districts, not far away from the estates on which these schemes are to be put into operation, in which the distress is equally acute, and in some cases I should say more acute.  It happened in the case of the Minister's first scheduled scheme that was carried through during the year that many complaints were received from the areas outside.  As the distress has increased since then, and as there is to be more money spent in the districts where the Land Commission have estates in their own hands what, I ask, is going to happen to the other districts? I have several of these districts in my mind.  In these districts the Land Commission have no estates on their hands.  These areas are in a very serious condition, and I would impress on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who will be distributing some of this other money, to take these areas into his consideration.  Otherwise, it will be very cruel to have one area relieved and another area, which is equally bad, disregarded and neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the large cities where, of course, there is a lot of distress, relief should be given, but there seems to be a difficulty in finding schemes upon which money can be reproductively spent.  As I remarked here before, with regard to poor places like the congested districts, there is no such want as that.  There are hundreds of instances in the congested districts where money could be reproductively spent even if there was no distress.  The roads are in a bad way, and there is drainage work to be done. The making of a number of roads was commenced in the days of the old C.D.B., but they were never finished. In other cases roads which had been <Col N="2173" /> made were allowed to go into disrepair and the result is that to-day they can hardly be called roads at all.  I would urge on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to inquire into these other areas that will not be touched by the scheme outlined by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  There is another point I wish to make, and it is this: That if there is one thing that the people are hoping for in these congested areas it is that the land will be divided soon.  I trust that while this work that the inspectors and engineers are engaged on now is very urgent work and should be done, at the same time it will not mean too much delay in the division of the land, because if there is anything that is giving the people hope in the West of Ireland, it is that the ranches will soon be divided and that they will get a chance of making a decent living.  I hope that that work will be expedited because the people are beginning to lose heart over the delay. They are impatient, and no wonder. On the other hand, of course, I see the enormous difficulties of the Minister, but I would urge on him that this other work should not be neglected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal has been said during the debate to-day as to the necessity for relieving unemployment, and certain suggestions were made towards that end.  I would like the Dáil to understand that there are a large number of workers who never look for outdoor relief.  They would not lower themselves to that position, but would rather suffer, their families and themselves, a silent torture.  They would not apply to the relieving officer for help, and they are in the unfortunate position that they cannot find employment. A great many of these workers live in urban centres.  Some Deputies here to-day urged that the larger portion of this grant should be given to the rural districts.  I agree that rural workers are certainly in a very lamentable position at the present time.  With reference to the grant which was given last year, the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us yesterday that a sum of £50,000 out of that grant was still unexpended.  What I want to know from the Minister for <Col N="2174" /> Finance is this: If an urban council succeeded in getting a small sum of money under last year's grant, will it get a further sum of money now under the present grants in order to enable it to complete the schemes it started last year, and in order to relieve unemployment?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, when he spoke a moment ago, mentioned that money would be spent in giving employment in drainage, but only in congested districts.  I would like to point out that although Westmeath is not a congested district, the whole of the county is flooded, and the very homes of the people are flooded, and they have to get in and out of their houses on planks.  Surely, if the Minister is going to relieve the sufferings of the people in what are known as the congested districts, he cannot refuse to give towns in Westmeath some money, so that the people may have a dry floor to stand on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shaw reminds me of Longford.  He stated he would like to see some of the money set aside for small drainage works, as the roads in Westmeath are very good.  I would like to endorse the opinion of a Deputy yesterday who said that grants should be given for the upkeep of second and third-class roads.  If money was spent on these roads it would relieve immediate and very acute distress.  Hundreds of men could be employed on these roads.  The district councils are directly responsible for the repair of these roads and a grant of money for their upkeep would be a saving to the ratepayers and the ratepayers would consequently benefit by a grant for the purpose of improving those roads.  Some of the district roads have more traffic on them than the actual trunk roads.  Sometime ago the Westmeath Council asked the Government to give a grant of £10,000, and said that they would raise an equivalent amount by way of loan for the purpose of relieving unemployment in the county.  The Roads Department have agreed, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, which it is sincerely hoped will be given, to advance <Col N="2175" /> £5,000 on condition that the Westmeath County Council raise another £5,000.  The expenditure of that total sum of £10,000 would keep 500 men employed, as stated by Deputy Shaw in the last meeting of the Westmeath County Council, and now, if it was possible to go further and give a further grant for the purpose of the district roads it would relieve unemployment to the extent of another 500 men.  We would then be in a position to have all the agricultural labourers who are not entitled to draw unemployment benefit at work, and not only would this be a saving in the district, but if the roads are properly made now, quarter of the usual expenditure would not be required for the next seven years.  All classes in the community would be benefited by the grant if expended in that way.</P>

    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, when he spoke of making roads through estates, who will employ the men to work on such roads?  Will these roads be made by direct labour or by contract?  Will he have the work done by direct labour, or will he follow the example of the Minister for Local Government some time ago when he tried to administer relief by taking half a loaf from one man and giving it to another man? Will the Minister for Lands and Agriculture act in the same way, or is he able to say at this stage whether the roads will be made by direct labour, and will the tenants who have been lucky enough to secure portion of the land have to make these roads themselves? That is one question.  The next question I want to ask is: Will the money expended on the making of these roads be added to the purchase money of the tenant when he gets the land?  If it is added, then it should not be called a grant at all, because it is the tenant who will have to pay it, and not the State.  Yet they are told that they get this money as a grant when in reality they get no grant at all. It simply means that the State says: &ldquo;Here is 5s. for you to-day, but you must pay it back to-morrow.&rdquo;  I would like to know what is in the mind of the <Col N="2176" /> Minister with regard to the relief of distress.  I would like to remind him that there are thousands and thousands of acres of turbary land that could be utilised in the real interests of the country, and upon which men could be set to work immediately.  Will he see whether any money could be advanced for this purpose, or whether private owners of turbary land who are not in a financial position to engage labour, will be entitled to receive a grant for the purpose of draining the land, even if it were only as a loan, so as to find employment for idle men?  To my mind, if the money is given for that work, every penny of it will be spent to good purpose.</P>
    <P>If that is so, then why not employ those people on direct labour, when they will be paying back again the wages they get?  All roads through the Free State should be made by direct labour.  As regards drainage, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture told us he would not drain small rivers or drains which would be about one or two yards wide.  Take the case of six or seven farmers who may have between them three or four hundred acres of land, with a river running through that area, three or four years wide.  Will the Minister have that drained in order to have the water taken off the different farms?  If he does that, it will certainly relieve distress amongst the workers in the county districts, small farmers with two, three, or five acres of land each. Such persons are in as deplorable a condition at present as the agricultural labourer.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Finance to answer a question in regard to urban councils&mdash;whether they will get a further grant in order to complete schemes, such as steam-rolling the streets, from the amount that is not expended out of the £500,000.  If the Minister for Lands and Agriculture can answer me on the points I have raised, it may, perhaps, save a long debate on the matter I will introduce in reference to the administration of the Land Act.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I heard with great satisfaction the speech of the <Col N="2177" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce. It led me to believe that a considerable sum of money would be devoted to the relief of distress in Dublin.  To-day I heard the Minister for Lands and Agriculture stating that for the past twelve months they had this matter under consideration, that it is not a relief scheme by any means, that it is well thought out, that a vast portion of the money, if not all, was for congested areas, and that the only exclusion was Cavan.  When I asked why Cavan was excluded, I had nothing sarcastic in my mind.  I want to have that point made clear, because of the Minister's reply.  Perhaps I should have asked: &ldquo;Why Cavan and not Dublin?&rdquo;  I am satisfied there is a greater amount of distress in the City of Dublin than there is in the rest of the Free State put together.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce practically admitted that yesterday.  He said Dublin had by far, unfortunately, the greatest share of unemployment to be dealt with.  I ask the Minister for Finance, when this money is being allocated, not to allow the greatest portion of it to be devoted to the areas mentioned by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told by Deputies representing different constituencies that there is great distress existing through the country, and I may say that if anything could be done to help by me, as a City Deputy, I would be very glad to do it.  I do not want to take anything from them in any shape or form. I am aware of the poverty that exists in the tenements in the City of Dublin. The question of fuel has been mentioned. There will be a shortage of fuel in the country districts.  I know houses in the City of Dublin that from one year's end to another practically never get a bag of coal until they get one from the Mansion House Coal Fund at Christmas.  That is not an exaggerated statement.  Will anything be done to consider those people when money is being given for relief?  I could cite cases here, but I might be accused of advertisement if I gave any special cases.  I might be accused of sarcasm or self-advertisement if I cited individual cases touching upon the deplorable state of poverty that exists in <Col N="2178" /> some of the areas in Dublin.  One point is very often forgotten.</P>
    <P>When unemployment touches the country districts, you invariably find that from every county in Ireland numbers of persons make their way to Dublin. I know men who have walked from country districts to Dublin within the past week.  They are now in Dublin. That is a point I want to bring out. When considering the Dublin unemployed and the grants you are about to make, remember that there is a large percentage of unemployed from practically all over the Free State in the City of Dublin.  They are almost hungry and they are applying for relief. If you visit any of the charitable institutions, the St. Vincent de Paul, Society and the Indigent Roomkeepers' Society, or the Commissioners of the Dublin Union, you will find that within the last six months they have had many applications from people who walked from the country districts into the City because of unemployment in the rural parts.  Now, unfortunately, they are drawing relief from various relief funds in the City.  That should not be forgotten when you are distributing the money we are now discussing.  I hope that Dublin will not be forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am compelled to intervene again in the discussion as a result of the misleading and inaccurate statements made by Deputy Shaw.  He referred to one matter which I could have also touched upon, but I thought an opportunity would be given later&mdash;I believe there will&mdash;to deal with it.  That matter refers to the closing down of the Wolfhill Collieries.  I have spent the greater portion of my time for the last ten or fourteen days working in conjunction with my colleagues, Deputies Egan, Wolfe, Bulfin and others, trying to save that particular colliery from being closed down.  We have succeeded in doing so for the present.  Deputy Shaw has alleged that the failure of this colliery, in his opinion, is due to the attitude of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He holds us responsible for whatever has happened to the working of the colliery.  Deputy Shaw, I am sure, would not deny that the Board of Management <Col N="2179" /> of this colliery is controlled, or is supposed to be controlled by a body of racing men, well-known gentlemen in the world of sport in this country.  Would the Deputy produce to the House the records or minutes of board meetings in connection with the management of the colliery?  I am sure if he only would, he could produce documents showing the number of times those people have attended meetings of the board.  That is by the way.  I mention it, however, merely to point out that there is some fault on the part of the people who placed themselves on the board of management of that company, and who refused on most occasions to attend meetings of the board that were summoned in the ordinary way.  The colliery closed down on last Saturday week and it was due to the fact that the Land Bank, acting on the instructions of the Minister for Finance, refused&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in order to get along.  I will be as brief as I possibly can.  The Land Bank are the receivers for the debenture shareholders, and they have failed to get the board of management to come together to pass the necessary winding-up resolution which would enable the business to go into liquidation, and which might enable other people, probably more interested in the working of Irish collieries, to take it up and make a better attempt to work it than the people who have been responsible for its bad management in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a strike in this colliery about four months ago.  It might be information for Deputy Good, Deputy Hewat and other business men, or alleged business men, to know that the cause of the strike was due to a demand on behalf of the mine workers for the bringing in of a system of payment by results.  Deputy Good, Deputy Hewat, and other business representatives in this House and also the Chambers of <Col N="2180" /> Commerce that claim to represent the real business element in this country, are continually demanding that payment should be by piecework or by the system of payment by results.  It is a peculiar coincidence that this was the cause of the strike at Wolfhill.  The Board of Management, composed of this body of business men, would not allow the men to work on the payment by result system.  Deputy Shaw did not put that information before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. The statement that has been made by Deputy Shaw should be corrected when it is incorrect.  I am sure Deputy Shaw will be interested to learn that a settlement has been arrived at which makes provision for the colliery to be taken over and worked by the men, no payment to be given to the men except what they can receive as a result of their own efforts in regard to the coal they are able to produce.  That is a new system of management.</P>
      <P>That new method of working the colliery is an experiment only until the end of the present year.  To prove that there is something like patriotism in the minds of the miners who are now undertaking to work the colliery under those conditions, they have actually forfeited their legal right to the unemployment insurance benefit during the experimental period, thereby saving the State expenditure to the extent of £250 a week.  Deputy Shaw referred to the Bolshevic attitude of the men towards the works and the destruction they have done.  He said that what they did prevented the successful working of the colliery.</P>

I would express the hope also that Deputy Shaw will persuade his fellow-directors to respond to the call made by the National Land Bank to attend a meeting which they, as directors must attend in order to pass the necessary winding-up resolution to enable others, even outsiders, if we cannot get people in this country to take over this colliery to work it in the interests of the people of the country.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister for Finance, that a scheme was just about to start about <Col N="2182" /> 10 years ago for the drainage of the Awbeg River from Charleville running on towards Buttevant.  In that particular district there are thousands of acres of land under water at the present moment.  Even stacks of hay are under water and cannot be removed.  I think that particular place should be included in the list of the areas to be drained under this grant that we are now about to pass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the responsible Minister just one question.  What I am going to say is more or less for want of knowledge or information of what was said by the Minister in the course of the evening.  I was not here when the responsible Ministers were making their statements.  I understand, however, that certain grants are to be given to congested districts.  Now, there are certain land-holders on the banks of the Shannon and Fergus, and these lands were banked up in order to keep out flooding.  Subsequently these banks were allowed to get into a state of serious disrepair, and when the tenants purchased their land under the Land Act they found these banks in a bad state of disrepair, with the result that there are hundreds of acres flooded.  Now, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture knows particularly well that it is entirely impossible for those people to make up these banks again, and keep out all these floods. I would like to know if any arrangement has been made whereby these people will get any relief for the making of these banks, or whether any scheme would be put into operation to enable these banks to be made.  I would remind the Dáil that the Land Commission are drawing annuities from lands that are covered half the year with water.  That is not a commendable state of affairs.  I am speaking now with the disadvantage of not knowing what the Minister said earlier in the debate.  However, I take it it is no harm to bring this matter again to the notice of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, in the hope that he will consider that point of view in preparing a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKNoonan" hpid="Mr. NOONAN Mr. NOONAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOONAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add to the <Col N="2183" /> claim put forward a while ago by Deputy Daly in connection with the great number of unemployed in Fermoy and Kilworth and other districts. In these districts they have a great claim on the Free State Government, owing particularly to the British troops having left the country.  While they were there they had always constant employment from the British Government in these big military centres of Kilworth Camp, Moorpark, and Fermoy.  In the Moorpark areas there is up to 1,000 acres of arable land. Now that the beet industry has been so much spoken about, and as that industry is one that is likely to bring the country something needed in the way of employment, and something also in the way of financing farmers who would need some stimulus in the way of agricultural industry, I would say there are lots of small farmers in the Fermoy district who would be only too glad to rent portion of that land at a good fee per acre.  Now, in that way, if they got that land, a great number of the unemployed in the district would get work in the district.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the manner in which the roads in our districts are worked.  I can see at the present moment that stones are being carted from the quarries out into the roads. These stones should have been broken long ago.  Now it is unreasonable to ask any man to sit on a heap of stones in this inclement weather.  It is barbarous. That is work that should have been done long ago when the weather was favourable.  I think if we look a little more carefully into the management of affairs and look a little more ahead, things will, in a short time, be put into a better state and there will be less unemployment and more prosperity for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. NALLY Mr. NALLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NALLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call the attention of the Minister for Finance to the conditions down in Mayo.  At the present time steam-rolling operations are being carried on there.  Men working at these steam-rolling operations do not work more than three days in the week. There are so many unemployed that that is all the men are able to get. <Col N="2184" /> They are paying them at present a wage of £1 14s. a week.  During the past month a small drainage scheme was started, and over 100 men applied for work there.  They could only take on 12 men.  There are over 5,000 men unemployed in Mayo, and if they even got £1 4s. a week they would be glad to take it.</P>
      <P>During the past twelve years several estates have been taken over by the Land Commission, and no work has been done on these estates for want of capital.  If the Land Commission wants to fence, stripe and divide these lands it will mean considerable employment in these areas.  If they do not go on with this work it will mean more acute distress and the economic position there will become more acute.  During the past month unemployment relief in Mayo has been almost doubled.  I do not wish to take up any more of the time of the Dáil on this matter, but I would urge on the Minister to put the work I indicate in the matter of these estates in hand at once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A good number of the points raised, both before and after the Minister for Lands and Agriculture spoke, were answered by him.  In the ordinary way, the Minister for Education is not one of the Ministers who has been, or who would be, consulted in connection with the distribution of this grant.  However, as a matter of fact, I have spoken to him within the last few days in reference to the expenditure on school buildings and pointed out that wherever there was expenditure necessary it could be put in hands and it would give needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, a difficulty in regard to new school buildings.  In many districts, and particularly in Dublin here, new school buildings are urgently needed and will be more needed if compulsory attendance should be passed. There is the difficulty that heretofore one-third of the cost had to be put up by the managers of the schools.  Whether it is wise to depart from that is another question.  The question of whether we ought to spend some of this money on educational buildings is under examination at the present time, and a decision has not been taken.  The <Col N="2185" /> Owenmore and the River Awbeg are rivers that are now being considered by the Board of Works with a view to having work upon them in the coming summer.  Whether it will actually be possible or not I could not say at the present time.  In all these schemes there are legal difficulties.  But a considerable amount of work will be done in restoring existing drainage schemes, and there are a number of drainage schemes which have lapsed in such a way, and into such a state of disrepair that they will have to be remade, with this difference, that were rock had to be removed in the first instance, only mud will have to be removed now.  A considerable number of new drainage schemes will be undertaken immediately, weather permitting.  They will involve new works or the restoration of existing works which have been allowed to fall into disrepair.</P>
    <P>The difficulty suggested by Deputy Davin that exists where local authorities will not move is not very easy of solution.  Matters that are left in the charge of local authorities can hardly very well be done over their heads, and I know that there is a tendency in some cases for local authorities, even if they are not wilfully dilatory, to be exceedingly slow in going ahead.  There is the difficulty sometimes of getting a meeting and all that.  I do not say that in every case that can be got over. In some cases I think it can hardly be got over, but we are exploring the question of doing work which might be done by the local authority or by some sort of local representative committee; we are exploring the question of having this type of local works entrusted to a suitable local committee, having an expenditure which would be approved and certified, so that none of the money can go astray.  I have only examined one scheme, where it was proposed that the work should be done by a local committee rather than a local authority, and on the examination which I gave it, I see no reason why it should not go ahead.</P>
    <P>It was contended that if the work were to be left to a local authority it would be impossible to have anything done for four or five months, or may be more, whereas the committee could possibly <Col N="2186" /> take it up within two or three weeks.  We will be prepared to consider every possible means of doing useful and necessary work in the most expeditious way where the unemployment situation is acute.  In places where the problem is not very acute it would be more difficult to justify going past the local authority, or setting up extraordinary machinery.  On a matter that is perhaps hardly seriously within the scope of this Estimate, that is the question of favouring districts, I might say that it has been suggested to me that if Deputy Davin or any other Deputy believes that there is a way of having favouritism shown to a particular district that he could help this particular area by creating a vacancy.  Perhaps he does not believe there is much in that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need say anything in reply to Deputy Doyle. It has already been pointed out that the major part of the money is to be spent in the rural districts.  A very substantial amount of the first grant was spent through the Land Commission in the rural districts, almost half of the entire grant, and a good deal more than half of the sum that is now asked will be spent in the rural districts.  At the same time, dealing with the point raised by Deputy Byrne, I may say that we are not neglecting Dublin or other urban centres.  Out of the first £250,000 a sum of £35,000 was allotted for expenditure in Dublin.  There has actually been received from the Dublin Commissioners an application for <Col N="2187" /> £50,000 more.  I do not say that all that will be given them, but in any case all the proposals put up from the city will be considered sympathetically.  It should be remembered, however, that it is the urban districts that will get most, almost all, of the £385,000 which is to be expended on unemployment benefit. You must realise when we are allocating this particular grant that the rural districts do not get anything corresponding to that.</P>
      <P>The difficulty raised by Deputy Gorey and Deputy Conlan regarding these small streams is not one we could really deal with at present.  They are not so small, and the farmers are not so few that they cannot in all reason be expected somehow or other to reach an agreement amongst themselves, as suggested by the Minister for Agriculture. Otherwise they would require to constitute a local drainage district, with a legal right to do the work, and to exact payment from all the people benefited, and that is not a thing we can do in relation to unemployment. That would take a considerable amount of time.  It would relieve the drainage problem for future years.  But so far as the members of one small group of farmers are concerned, they ought to agree amongst themselves and do the work, and if it is necessary that they should drain there is no reason why they should not all make their application together for a drainage loan to the Board of Works, and facilities could be given for having these loans considered together, and all granted. Deputy Lyons asked whether the work to be done by the Land Commission will be done by direct labour.  It will be done by direct labour, and the wages paid will be the wages current in the district.  I will also say in regard to his remarks that this expenditure will in some part be returned to the Exchequer. I should say that some 40 per cent. of this money expended by the Land Commission will ultimately be recovered by the Land Commission from the tenants of the holdings by way of a charge on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to talk about particular counties, but Deputy Nally has <Col N="2188" /> referred to the special distress in Co. Mayo. Co. Mayo is one of the counties where the Land Commission has a considerable number of estates, and where they could do a good deal of work.  They have all these estates to which Deputy Nally has referred.  I do not want to talk about the final allocation of the money, which has not been agreed on, but if the proposals at present before the Ministry of Finance are agreed to actually as they stand it would mean a very large proportion of the money going to that county.  The allocation of the money is to a large extent determined by the estates now in the hands of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture has said, this matter has been under discussion in one form or another between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance for a very long time.  The previous schedules have been sanctioned, amounting, as I said, to £74,000.  They were selections from proposals put up to me a considerable time ago.  This expenditure is really very carefully considered, and I think that it is not of a type that could be cavilled at.  There will remain after the Land Commission expenditure is carried out, some £60,000 or £65,000 of the old grant.  There will remain £60,000, or perhaps £70,000, of this new sum, so that there is a fair margin that may be given for works in other districts, that is, either rural works or urban works, and any proposals that come forward from any authority, or even very good proposals put forward by responsible people, will be carefully considered.  I do not say we will so readily consider the proposals merely put forward by a committee, but we are prepared to consider them if distress is great in a district and if a good scheme can be put forward.  The Government realises the need for meeting distress and is prepared to do everything that it can to meet it, but there is no use in either asking the Dáil for money that cannot be expended or in expending money on works that are not good works.  It would be better to give merely poor relief than make a pretence of doing works if the works are not in themselves good.  We have to try to see <Col N="2189" /> that there is actual value given for the money and that there is utility in the work that is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent we have tried to get them to do that for various reasons.  One of these reasons, which is relevant to the issue in this case, was that more money could be expended. If we were putting up, say, £5,000, the grant might be stretched by another £5,000 from the local authority, but we have not insisted in all cases, and we will not insist on the local authority putting up money.  With reference to Deputy Lyons's point, it is a question as to what extent money could be diverted from the trunk roads. There is a certain small amount which I think can be used for other important roads than trunk roads.  It may be possible that some necessary and useful works can be done out of the Road Fund on roads that are not trunk roads. We have already given a certain amount of money for road making out of the unemployment grants.  We have allocated&mdash;I could not state the amount expended out of the first £250,000&mdash;£14,800 for road grants.  It is a matter of the schemes being put up and they will be carefully and sympathetically considered.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Railways (Directorate) Bill, 1924, be read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> The Bill has already been circulated to Deputies, and the purpose of it is fairly well explained by the Preamble and by the provisions of the Bill itself. A certain amount of historical matter will have to be given to get this matter in proper perspective.</P>
    <P>It must be within the recollection of Deputies that while the Railways Act of 1924 was passing through the Dáil, it was provided that four of the larger railway companies should agree to amalgamate, and that if no agreement was secured, then it was for the railway tribunal, set up under that Act, to determine an amalgamation scheme. Three of the four companies mentioned as amalgamating companies, did come to an agreement, and negotiations were opened between that amalgamating group and the fourth&mdash;the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company. These negotiations did not result in any agreement.  The reason for the failure to agree was stated by the Chairman of the Dublin and South Eastern Company in a statement which he made at the end of July.  It appeared that the bone of contention was that the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company had as successors to a railway company named in a certain Act the right to appoint a Director to the Board of the Dublin and South Eastern Company.  Not by contract arising out of that right, but as a purely voluntary matter, they did grant certain concessions, amounting to about £20,000 per annum, to the Dublin and South Eastern Company.  The relations between the Dublin and South Eastern Company and the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway Company, as the inheritors of another company, were summed up in three things&mdash;(1) that there was a director; (2) that there were concessions amounting to £20,000 a year made to the Dublin and South Eastern Company; (3) by reason of the director and being one of the causes of the grant of £20,000, there were extremely cordial relations, and there was close co-operation between the London, Midland and Scottish Company and the Dublin and South Eastern Company. When negotiations for an agreed scheme were on foot between the <Col N="2192" /> Dublin and South Eastern Company and the group then amalgamated, the contention of the other three companies was that that sum of £20,000 could not be counted in as portion of the stable income of the D. and S.E.R. Co., unless what up to then had been voluntary was made binding by contract. As they could get no assurance that the £20,000 would be contractually guaranteed, the negotiations broke down.</P>
    <P>The matter was one mainly for the railway companies, but we were advised as to what the situation was and it seemed to be our duty, in the interests of the public generally and in the interests of the amalgamated concern, which we had been responsible for bringing about, that we should inquire into the circumstances and see if any agreement could be come to.  It will also be remembered that during the passage of the Railways Act through the Dáil I was urged from many sides of the House to continue&mdash;not to introduce as a new principle&mdash;the existing right of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company to appoint a director on the board of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company, and to extend it to the new Amalgamated Company.  That did not seem at the time a proper thing to do, because there was no consideration to the new Amalgamated Company for the extended right, which Deputies from various sides of the House claimed.  It was proposed to me that I should not only continue the right of the London, Midland and Scottish Company to appoint a Director, but continue it to the new amalgamated concern, which would have to deal not with the limited traffic which the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company had to deal with but with all the traffic of the Amalgamated Company. As no new consideration to the Amalgamated Company was promised, that application made by Deputies was refused and the Act did not continue that old right.</P>
    <P>This point was then gone into with the various parties concerned and it was found that the London, Midland and Scottish Company were agreeable <Col N="2193" /> to convert that voluntary and discretionary payment of £20,000 a year into a binding agreement, on consideration that they be allowed to nominate a director of the new Amalgamated Board.  The situation was consequently changed.  There was a new specific obligation undertaken by the London, Midland and Scottish Company towards the Amalgamated Company, and on foot of that, when it was represented to us that the agreement was in fact made and had to be implemented by legislation, I undertook to bring in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been objected that a question of principle is involved, and when that objection was put up I understood that the counter-suggestion was made that if this same proposition could be secured by agreement it would not be possibly entirely without objection, but that it would be less objectionable than the present form.  The difficulties in the way of agreement must be stated.  And, again, portion of the Railways Act must be quoted.  For the first year the directorate of the Amalgamated Company is to be chosen from amongst the existing Directors of the Railway Companies to be amalgamated, but after a year the appointment of Directors falls into the hands of the proprietors of the new amalgamated concerns.  It is obviously impossible to ask a company to guarantee a certain sum of money in perpetuity in return for a promise that the present directors of the amalgamated company would encourage or request the proprietors to appoint a director of the London, Midland and Scottish Company on the new Board.  It would obviously be inequitable to ask a perpetual right in return for a promise to endeavour to secure something from the proprietors, who might act in any way they chose.  It is necessary to have this right secured in some lasting way, because the railway tribunal will shortly have to determine what is the value of the receipts brought in by the Dublin and South Eastern Company, for the purpose of determining what issue of amalgamated stock should be made to them.  If this £20,000 disappears from the receipts of the Dublin and South Eastern Company, it will <Col N="2194" /> have considerable effect on the value of the amalgamated stock to be given to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Dublin and South Eastern stock I mention. The right, therefore, if it is to be maintained at all has to be maintained in some binding way.  The contract was bi-lateral.  There was an agreement proceeding from one side which was not going to be much good except it was put on a firm footing by way of legislation. On the other hand, there was then going to be guaranteed these payments as recited in the Preamble to this Bill. I think we should have agreement on that point, that it is absolutely inequitable to ask one party to guarantee sums set out in this Bill in return for some agreement or promise of agreement which might not be kept by the proprietors of the amalgamated concern when they meet to elect the directors next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters in connection with this which are <i>sub judice</i> the Railway Tribunal at the moment and I do not intend to encroach on them. Certain points have, however to be borne in mind.  The contention of the three companies already amalgamated, with regard to the Dublin and South Eastern Company, is that unless they (the Dublin and South Eastern Company) can guarantee that that £20,000 will be brought in, then their stock must suffer a certain depreciation.  The retort made to that by those who speak with authority for the Dublin and South Eastern Company is: &ldquo;If this sum is lost, as it was portion of the receipts which we ordinarily possessed and which we were likely to possess in future, had it not been for the Railways Act, then the loss should be made good out of public funds.&rdquo;  I am not saying that I have any opinion as to whether the contention of the three amalgamated companies is right or not, or whether the further contention of the Dublin and South Eastern Company, that the loss would have to be borne out of public funds, is right or not.  But those two contentions are there and the Railway Tribunal certainly must know <Col N="2195" /> before it can form a proper appreciation of what issue of amalgamated stock must be made, whether or not this £20,000 is going to be continued for a long period of years, or whether it is not going to be continued, or whether the question is in the intermediate stage that it is in doubt whether it may or may not continue.  The tribunal cannot properly evaluate the issue of new stock to be made to the holders of Dublin and South Eastern stock unless they have some certainty with regard to this £20,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a point to be looked into by the Tribunal, having the exact terms of the agreement, which are not here.  They will have to look into that, and the Tribunal will have certainty as to the continuance of the allowance.  There are two ways of looking at this matter. I suggest and contend that the only way it should be regarded is in the light of a business agreement.  If it is a proper business agreement, if it is &ldquo;good business,&rdquo; then, it should be carried out, and carried out in the only way in which it can be properly carried out&mdash;that is, by legislation.  The other contention is that an evil principle is brought in.  If this were the first time in the history of this country in which a foreign railway company were being allowed to appoint a director certain objection might be made.  Still, the argument of the business agreement would overpower that, though it would have a certain force.  But it is not by any means the first time that this has been done.  This is a continuance in <Col N="2196" /> another way under different conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President did definitely undertake that, and, to implement the President's promise, I travelled to London and opened up negotiations with certain railway people to see if a good bargain could be struck.  The President was far from saying anything against this on the grounds of principle.  He made it clear that he would not oppose it on grounds of principle, and following up that, I went to London to make a good business arrangement.  If this principle were to be logically adhered to, the Dáil would have to decide that no industrial or other company could get any right by statute in the Free State, and I venture to prophesy that if we set out with that idea we would soon have to depart from it.  I suggest, if any agreement is to be made, it should be made openly and by statute in this House, and not behind doors and by means of private negotiation.  I suggest that the best way to approach it is by means of statute.  The matter should be discussed openly in the House and voted on, and not decided by means of private agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the main points with regard <Col N="2198" /> to the Second Reading of this Bill.  I hold it is &ldquo;good business,&rdquo; and that it is going to secure for the new amalgamated company a matter of £20,000, which money, if lost, will have to be made up out of rates, or if not out of rates&mdash;if the Dublin and South Eastern Company's contention be approved of&mdash;out of Government grant. In any event, it would fall on the Irish taxpayer either generally or as a railway user.  It is good business, and it is a proper thing to be done by statute if it is to be done at all.  Inasmuch as it is simply the extension of a principle previously notified to the Dáil, which met with no vehement opposition in this Dáil, I ask the House to pass the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rather emphasised what he believes to have been the absence of vehement opposition to the proposal to give a right to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to a directorship on the Irish Board.  I can speak for myself on this matter, and I can say that if there had been any encouragement of such a proposal, I would have opposed it as strongly as I possibly could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making any claims for any Simon Pure Irish nationalism, but I am going to ask these members of the House who have protested years back &mdash;I am sorry so few of them are present&mdash;their belief in Sinn Féin and the ideal that Sinn Féin stood for to oppose this Bill.  Taking the Bill in regard to some of its details, the Railway Bill, as passed at the instigation of the Minister, sets out that the Directors should not exceed fifteen in number, or be less than twelve, and the qualification should be the holding in his own right of such amount of share capital as may be specified.  That was obviously intended to prevent companies and combinations of persons appointing a director.  It was intended to ensure that directors who would be appointed in future would be elected by the shareholders themselves.  Now, within a very few months after its passing the Minister comes along with a Bill to make an exception, not a general exception, which would allow existing shareholders of the Great Southern Railway, the Cork and Bandon Railway, <Col N="2199" /> or the Midland Great Western Railway, but only of the London Midland and Scottish Railway, a right by statute of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State to have a directorship upon the new Irish railway.  The excuse is given that the same company, by virtue of certain investments and certain concessions, had already a right in one of the companies that are to be amalgamated: a company with a capital of about £2,400,000, where they have one in seven of the directorate.  The same rights in the new company over the same area, and the privileges given to the same line, the Dublin-South Eastern, are to be continued, but in exchange they are claiming, and we are asked to grant, a similar right in the new company which covers the whole of the country.  That is to say, that for that one-seventh of the directorate of a company, with a mileage of 133 and with a capital of £2,400,000, they are to have one-sixteenth of the control in a company having probably 2,200 miles of line, and a present capital of, perhaps, £33,000,000 or £34,000,000.  That is a fair exchange! The Minister may speak of good business!  It is good business&mdash;for the London Midland and Scottish. The old arrangement which was paid for by the concession was one director for 20 miles of railway and £350,000 capital.  The new arrangement&mdash;good business from the point of view of the London, Midland and Scottish&mdash;is one director for 138 miles of railway and £2,000,000 of capital.  It is a fair business proposition!</P>

It says that &ldquo;so long as the continuance of the concessions, allowances and advantages, including special proportions in division of receipts from through passenger and perishable or other traffic,&rdquo; so long as that is provided for in the agreement with the new company, this right will be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The present right will be continued.  That is to say, that the rights and concessions in respect to the Dublin and South Eastern Company are to be continued for those concessions and investments.  They had one director out of seven on the Dublin and South Eastern Company.</P>

      <P>No.  The London, Midland and Scottish had the right in the old days to appoint a director of the Dublin and South Eastern Company. <Col N="2201" /> The consideration was not these concessions which are being continued. These concessions were voluntary and outside the consideration on the foot of which they got the right to appoint a director on the old Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether voluntary or not, these concessions to that particular railway are to be continued, and if it was a voluntary arrangement in the past there is no breach of any obligation other than the desire of the Minister to conciliate the London, Midland and Scottish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister tells us that the London, Midland and Scottish Company are buying this right and the Minister is prepared to sell the right over Irish railways to the London, Midland and Scottish for £20,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the Minister's explanations and interpreting them as well as I can, a thing which he did not do in introducing the Bill.  Perhaps we will learn more of the Minister's intentions and of the Company's desires when we get to the Committee Stage, if we ever get to it, but I hope we do not.  It is not because, in the words of the Minister, it is a good business proposition from the point of view of the London, Midland and Scottish Company that I want the Dáil to refuse a Second Reading of this Bill.  I think that the case which I tried to make, just a year ago to-day, in moving the Second Reading of the Transportation Bill still holds. and should hold, the minds of the Deputies.  I then urged, following the example of a much abler man, very much more concerned in the past with Irish railway policy, that the railways in Ireland should be directed towards furthering the development of Ireland rather than that Ireland should be an <Col N="2202" /> instrument for furthering the development of railways, and that railway policy should be subordinated to national policy and development.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out in the past, many times, that railway policy has been directed to conveying commodities and passengers, for as long distances as possible, to England, and conveying commodities from England, for as long distances as possible, to increase the revenue of the railways, and the effect of this policy has been to develop this importation and exportation, not because it is of advantage to Ireland, but because it would be of advantage to the railway companies, both in Ireland and in England.  As the Minister pointed out, the advantage of having a director upon the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company has resulted in some advantage to the London, Midland and Scottish Company. If it had not promised such advantage, then there would have been no such arrangement.  I said, a year ago, that we might well consider that the sending of a bale of bacon from Limerick to Leicester, and the sending of a parcel of boots from Leicester to Limerick, would be a good policy from the point of view of the railways, but bad policy from the point of view of Irish industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking that the Deputy is making a mistake?  The proposal is to give one London, Midland and Scottish director on a Board of sixteen, and not of fifteen directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. I will come to that later on.  I say that we must legislate here as far as we can, so that the railway policy shall be directed towards developing and encouraging transportation to and from points within Ireland as far as possible, and to encourage that rather than to encourage transportation with a view to markets in England, and from England to Ireland.  That I thought up to a year ago, was the common view of people who had been engaged in propaganda for an Irish Ireland, and Irish industrial development.  Now I am beginning to see that that was never <Col N="2203" /> seriously meant, but was only part of an agitation.  I am asking the Dáil to say that it was not only political agitation, but good national policy, and we should not depart from it.  Certainly we ought not to go and do something that would tend directly away from that conception of the relative position of the State and of the railway position. I am sure the Deputies in the first Dáil will forgive me for reading a few sentences from a speech by the late Michael Collins in advocating the acceptance of the Treaty, and there are some Deputies here&mdash;I wish there were more present, as I could remind them of certain influences at work at that time&mdash;who voted for the Treaty because of these special considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For our continued spiritual and national existence two things are necessary&mdash;security and freedom.  If the Treaty gives us these or helps us to get at these, then I maintain that it satisfies our national aspirations.  The history of this nation has not been, as is so often said, the history of a military struggle of 750 years, it has much more a history of peaceful penetration of 750 years....  It has not been a struggle for the ideal of freedom for 750 years, symbolised in the name Republic.  It has been a story of slow, steady economic encroach by England....  The English penetration has not merely been a military penetration.  At the present moment the economic penetration goes on.  I need only give you a few instances. Every day our banks become incorporated or allied to British interests, every day our steamship companies go into English hands, every day some other business concern in this city is taken over by an English concern, and becomes a little oasis of English customs and manners.  Nobody notices, but that is the thing that has destroyed our Gaelic civilisation.  That is a thing that we are able to stop, not perhaps if we lose the opportunity of stopping it now.  That is one of the things that I consider is important, and to the nation's life perhaps more important, than the military penetration, and this gives us the opportunity of stopping it. Indeed, when we think of the thing <Col N="2204" /> from that economic point of view it would be easy to go on with the physical struggle in comparison with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There would be acceptance of that, nominal mental acceptance, but I want to ask the Deputies who agree with it to apply it.  The proposition is to confer a right by statute upon the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, of a directorate on the new amalgamated company.  The Minister points out the difference between giving them one directorate and giving them a majority. You are not proposing to give them a majority, but one out of sixteen.  Let us assume that that one person is the same person who was a director of the Dublin South Eastern, or another person equally, or almost equally, conversant with English railway requirements and interests.  I can imagine that person being very frequently in touch with the general manager of the Irish company, having a much clearer knowledge of the railway affairs and what is required in respect of railway policy, being constantly kept informed of every detail of the development of policy, not merely financial, but actual development of railway policy, and probably, as I suggest, very much more conversant with the business of the new amalgamated company than any of the fifteen directors and because of his knowledge of railway business and being in constant touch with the railway management, having very much more influence in the direction of Irish railway policy than five or six, or even fifteen of the Irish directors.</P>
    <P>But considered from another point of view, this nominee of the British railways, having the ear of the general manager in a rather abnormal way as compared with the other directors, the general manager, knowing that there are no further prospects for him in Ireland, but that there are possibilities of development, of improvement in position, of extension of power and authority in England, what is more natural than that he will give ear and heed to the promptings and suggestions of the director appointed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway? In all those innumerable little ways&mdash; not matters that come before the Board &mdash;in which the general manager will influence <Col N="2205" /> policy, he will give ear to the director appointed by the London, Midland and Scottish railway.  In that way I say you are going to bring into authority and power over the Irish railways a nominee of the British railways, whose chief purpose will be to assist in the development of the London Midland and Scottish railway, to whom the interests of the Irish railways will be secondary to what he thinks are the interests of the British railways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If that man, with all this power as pictured by the vivid imagination of the Deputy, stood for election for the Dáil, we might close it, because he would have the same power in the same multitudinous way over Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If that director could get into the Ministry and have the same power over the Ministry that he will have over the directors and the management, then you might say that we may close up.  That is what the proposition of the Minister is&mdash;to put him into executive control, with not merely the right to criticise, but to get the ear of the departmental chiefs and influence them in all these wonderful ways that departmental chiefs can influence Ministerial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there such a man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  If we are going to give this right to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company for certain concessions, we are definitely setting it down that we do not desire, that it is not our intention, that it is not our deliberate view, that the Irish railways shall be directed towards assisting the development of Irish industry; that the policy which has led to special privileges for cattle exportation trade, special privileges to the manufactured goods importation trade, will continue; that the economic policy of the country, which we have been generally regretting for a long time will continue to be based upon the exportation of raw material, foodstuffs, cattle on the hoof, and the importation, covering as long a railway journey as possible, of manufactured articles. <Col N="2206" /> That will be British railway policy. That will be the influence sought to be exercised by the British railway director upon the Irish railways.  That influence will be much greater than that of one out of sixteen.  We are, by the passing of this Bill, quite definitely accepting the proposition that the railways are to continue in their policy of feeding British companies.</P>
      <P>I said that I believed railway policy ought to be subordinate to national policy in economic affairs; that we should rather hope that the railways would encourage transportation between points in Ireland than direct their policy towards transportation to and from England.  It is on these grounds I am asking the Dáil to refuse a Second Reading to the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another point that I want the Minister to make a note of; that is, the right to appoint a director is to last as long as concessions, allowances and advantages continue.  I wonder whether it is intended to restrict the powers of this director, at least, to the extent that he should not have a voice in deciding whether these concessions should continue.  Surely we are not going to give him the right to say whether or not&mdash;possibly even to have a deciding voice if it came to a vote&mdash; Irish railways shall relieve themselves of this, shall I call it incubus, or if you like, privilege, whatever it may be worth.  If a director is to be appointed I should say, at least, he should be restricted in that respect; that he should not have a right to a voice in deciding the question whether this agreement shall continue.  That is a small point, perhaps one that could be raised in Committee.</P>
      <P>The main principle of the Bill is a bad one, and I think the Dáil ought not to give it a Second Reading.  On the first Stage I said&mdash;the Bill was not then in our hands&mdash;that if this had been a proposal to allow the shareholders of the new company to elect a nominee of the London, Midland and Scottish, while the evil might be as great, we would not be to the same degree parties to it, and my opposition to it would not be so intense as it is to this proposal.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for the receipt of Unemployment Insurance Benefit it is necessary for a claimant to prove that he is continuously unemployed.  Continuous unemployment for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Acts is defined in Section 7 (2) (B) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as amended by Section 3 (3) of the (No. 2) Act, 1921.</P>
      <P>From inquiries which I have made in the case of Mr. J. McClosky, Ardcomer, Riverstown, Co. Sligo, to whom it is presumed the Deputy's question refers, I understand that Mr. McClosky is employed on alternate days in each week, and in these circumstances it would not be possible for him to prove continuous unemployment within the meaning of the Acts.
