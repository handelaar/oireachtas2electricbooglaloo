      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state how it is intended to deal with farms taken over under the auspices of the Land Bank some years ago, prior to the Truce; whether the Trustees who took responsibility for the large sums advanced by the Irish banks to purchase these farms will be recouped for any losses they have sustained through the fall in land values and the general depression in agriculture following the war; whether he is aware that the high rate of bank interest renders the position of these trustees and their holdings more precarious every day; and whether, in view of the sacrifices these trustees made in the interests of the national movement at the time, he will make this question of trustee farms one of the first he will direct his attention to in operations under the new Land Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Minister for Lands and Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which I am asking leave to introduce is entitled:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A Bill to enable county councils to give relief from rates on occupiers of agricultural land and for that purpose to abate the amount of agricultural rates to be raised off agricultural lands in the local financial year ending 31st day of March, 1925, and to enable county councils to borrow for the purpose aforesaid, and to make provision for other matters connected with the purposes aforesaid.</P>
      <P>I must ask the indulgence of the Dáil to make a slightly, or shall I say a somewhat, longer statement than is usual on First Reading.  The Bill itself tells Deputies very little, while its implications are considerable.  It will probably save time in the long run and certainly be fairer to all concerned if they are explained before the Second Stage is reached.  I can only make amends for any delay which is caused now by promising to be correspondingly brief on the Second Reading.  As the title shows, the Bill aims at giving immediate relief to agriculture.  It is not intended as a substitute for any of the measures necessary for the development of agriculture.  These measures are known already to the Dáil, and Bills for the purpose of giving effect to them have been, or will be, introduced according to time-tables.  This Bill is a relief measure pure and simple.</P>
      <P>I do not think that at this hour I need argue as to the necessity for giving some immediate relief to agriculture. The depression in agriculture is not peculiar to Ireland.  It is common to every country in Europe and in America.  It is probably, owing to a number of adverse causes, more acute in Ireland than in most countries, and since the agricultural industry is practically the only industry in Ireland at present, and is likely to remain our main industry in the future, we must be all the more concerned about its condition.  All this, I think, I am entitled to say, is admitted.  The real difficulty is to find the most suitable method of giving this immediate relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem has to be considered in <Col N="1819" /> the light of the special circumstances of this country, and from that point of view the first difficulty in the way is the fact that in spite of our high taxation there is no money to spare. We are learning every day that we cannot have our loaf and eat it, that we cannot waste twenty or thirty millions in destruction and be under the necessity of spending as much more in preventing further destruction, and have that money after all.  We are not in a position to increase the agricultural grant.  This grant, as Deputies probably know, is an annual grant paid by the Treasury to county councils for the purpose of giving relief to rates payable out of agricultural land.  It first became payable under the Local Government Act of 1898, and was, at that time, a recognition of the fact that farmers should not be asked to pay for services such as water, light, heat and sanitation which are not supplied to them by county or district councils. At its inception the amount of the grant was decided with a view to giving 50 per cent. relief to the rates payable out of agricultural land as against the rates payable out of what are called &ldquo;other hereditaments.&rdquo;  It is a fixed grant. It was fixed in '98 and the quota for Ireland was fixed at that date and remains the same, that is, £599,000 per annum.  The total rate, however, has increased yearly.  The result is that at present instead of the relief being 50 per cent. it is much less than 25 per cent.  Now, we could not in our present financial position, increase the agricultural grant, so we have to do the next best thing.  The rate for the current year beginning on the 1st April, 1924, has already been assessed and in the rural districts, that is, in the whole of the Free State, with the exception of the county boroughs and urban districts, it amounts, as I have already stated, to about £3,000,000.  Of this amount £2,315,000 is paid out of agricultural land, and the balance, £685,000, is paid out of other hereditaments, that is to say, farmers' houses, villages, railways, etc., in the rural districts and in towns which are not county boroughs and not administered by urban councils.  This Bill empowers each county council to borrow not more <Col N="1820" /> than two-thirds of the amount supposed to be raised out of agricultural lands, in the year 1924-1925, and to repay this loan within such period, not exceeding seven years, as the county council, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, may determine. The current rate payable, therefore, out of agricultural lands this year in any county where the option is exercised will be one-third of the actual rate assessed on agricultural land. Thus, out of a total rate assessed out of agricultural lands for the year 1924-25 of £2,315,000, the rate payable, if the option is exercised by all county councils, will be £771,666, and the amount of the abatement will be £1,543,334.  The whole scheme contemplates that this money will be borrowed by each county council from the bank which is its Treasurer, and may be repayable by an annuity extending over a period of not more than seven years.  The annual payment of interest on sinking funds for a seven year period would approximate to about £250,000.</P>
    <P>The total rate collectable, therefore, during the current year, if all the county councils exercise the option which they are entitled to under the scheme will be as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Without this scheme, the total rate collectable in the current year would be £4,550,000, made up of £3,000,000 full current rate and £1,550,000 arrears. To collect £4,550,000 in rates in one year, or fifty per cent. more than one year's collection of Land Purchase Annuities from people whose income is made out of land, is not, in all the circumstances, a workable proposition. On the other hand, the interest and sinking fund payable annually over a seven-year period on the loan required for the abatement contemplated by this scheme, will not add appreciably to the current rates for that period, and ought to be more than offset by savings resulting from the reorganisation of Local Government which is now under <Col N="1821" /> way.  In order to make the scheme quite clear I propose to give one example:&mdash;A owes one year's arrears and is, in addition, liable for his current rate, and B owes no arrears but is liable only for his current rate.  Assume that their rates payable out of agricultural land for the years 1923-24 and 1924-25 are the same, namely £60 for 1923-24 and £57 in each case for 1924-25.  A will pay his year's arrears, £60, plus one-third of the current rate, £19, that is to say, a total payment of £79.  Without the scheme his total payment would be £60 plus £57, namely £117.  His abatement amounts to £38.  B who owes no arrears, will pay £19 out of his current rate of £57, and will be relieved to the same extent, £38.  In each case, instead of paying £38 this year, each will pay it over a period of seven years by a small annual payment, the first payment to be made in 1925-26.  With the help of this scheme there will be no excuse for county councils who fail to collect their arrears and the only change which need be made in the Demand Notes which are now ready for issue is to divide the rate payable out of agricultural land by three.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has co-operated in the preparation of this scheme which, as I have stated, is primarily and directly for the relief of agriculture, because he believes that it will enable him to clear up the existing position of local taxation with its trail of outstanding arrears, and further give the necessary breathing space to prepare and initiate the schemes which are undoubtedly necessary in connection with the reorganisation of Local Government, and in particular to investigate the question as to whether the rural ratepayers who are paying £2,000,000 for roads and asylums alone out of a total rate of £3,000,000 are getting value for their money.</P>
    <P>We have just left a year, 1923, which, considered by itself, has undoubtedly been an extremely bad year for the farmer. Things seem to be taking at least a slight turn for the better.  Where prices are not improving, they are at least stabilising.  It is just at this period, therefore, that relief will be welcomed and will be useful.  This Bill enables immediate relief to be given. <Col N="1822" /> It, at least, gives a breathing space, and it is not too much to hope that by the time the comparatively small interest and sinking fund becomes payable it will be very much more than offset by the savings resulting from the re-organisation of the local authorities, the favourable tendency in agricultural prices which I have just mentioned, and the effects which ought by then to be felt from the operation of the measures for the standardisation of agricultural products, which either have been, or will be, introduced into the Dáil in the present session.  I move for leave to introduce the Bill.</P>
    <P>Leave to introduce, the Bill granted. Second Stage fixed for Tuesday, 10th June.</P>

      <P>This Bill purports to make provision for the future appointments of officers of the Metropolitan Police.  The appointments of Chief Commissioners and Assistant-Commissioners were formerly made under the Dublin Metropolitan Police Act of 1836, an Act which empowered the Lord Lieutenant to appoint two persons for the police district of the Dublin metropolis to act as justices of the peace so far only as related to the preservation of peace, the prevention of crime, the arrest of offenders, and the carrying into execution of the purposes of that Act.  Subsequent Acts applied the term of &ldquo;Commissioner of Police&rdquo; to designate the holders of the office established by the Act of 1836.  The offices were subsequently divided into those of Chief Commissioner and Assistant-Commissioner. It accordingly becomes necessary to make provision for appointments to these offices, and the Bill proposes to vest in the Executive <Col N="1823" /> Council power to make any such appointments. It proposes that in future the Commissioner shall be styled and known just as in the case of the Commissioner for the Gárda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The general control and direction of the Dublin Metropolitan Police will be vested in the Commissioner, who will be assisted by the Assistant-Commissioner, who will exercise such functions as the Commissioner may, subject to regulations, assign to him.  In the absence of the Commissioner, or during a vacancy in the office of Commissioner, the Minister for Justice will be empowered to authorise the Assistant-Commissioner to perform all or any of the duties of the Commissioner.  The Bill proposes to vest in the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Executive Council, the power to make regulations relative to the internal management of the force.  Formerly the power to make such regulations was vested in the Chief Commissioner, subject to the approval of the Lord Lieutenant. In the case of the Gárda Síochána, such powers are vested in the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Executive Council, and it is proposed that the practice in this matter should be the same for each force.  The oaths of office prescribed by the Act of 1836 are included for repeal, and it is proposed to substitute therefor a declaration in terms similar to that adopted for the Gárda Síochána.</P>
      <P>A provision is included in the Bill to enable the Minister for Justice to authorise the employment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police outside the Dublin Metropolitan Police District.  The existing statutes confer on all members of the force the same powers in the counties of Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, as in the Dublin Metropolitan Police District. As emergencies may arise which might render necessary the temporary employment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police outside these counties, it is desirable that statutory authority should exist to enable this course to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reinstatement of ex-members of the force who resigned or were dismissed for political reasons prior to the 11th July, 1921, was authorised by the <Col N="1824" /> Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, on the terms that the previous service and the period of absence should be reckoned for purposes of pension and of increment of pay.  In order that those terms might be awarded the Act required that reinstatement should take place before the 8th November, 1923.  A few cases have come to light of ex-members who retired or were dismissed for political reasons, and were not reinstated before the date mentioned, as they were on that date serving in the National Forces.  A section is included to cover these cases.</P>
    <P>The development of the office of Accounting Officer has rendered unnecessary the continuance of the statutory office of Accountant, which it is accordingly proposed to abolish.  All lands, buildings, fixtures, fittings, furniture, and chattels now vested in the Accountant will be transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works.  All other property (i.e., moneys, funds, debts, etc.) vested in the Accountant it is proposed to transfer to the Accounting Officer for the Dublin Metropolitan Police Vote.  The only funds affected are two accounts in the Bank of Ireland&mdash;(1) An account used for the purpose of paying pensions, and fed by drawing on the Vote Account with the Paymaster-General, which, of course, can only be operated on by the Accounting Officer and the other members of the panel nominated for that purpose by the Ministry of Finance. (2) A &ldquo;Forfeited and Unclaimed Monies Account.&rdquo;  These two accounts are, in fact, at present operated on by the Accounting Officer, and the proposal in the Bill is merely intended to give statutory authority to existing practice.  A section is included to authorise the holding of sworn inquiries to examine on oath into the truth of charges or complaints of neglect or violation of duty preferred against members of the force.  The section is in terms similar to one included in the Gárda Síochána Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three points I want to raise on the Second Reading.  The first is a very small matter, just to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that there has been an Act passed which alters the <Col N="1825" /> title of the Minister for Home Affairs. His title in the Bill that he is now giving second reading to is Minister for Home Affairs, whereas as a matter of fact a new Act altered that title.  A much more important matter is raised by section 8, sub-paragraph (b): &ldquo;A Minister may make regulations subject to the approval of the Executive Council in relation to the promotion, reduction, degradation, dismissal and punishment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that he is not entitled to, and ought not be given power, to punish in any way which he may make regulations about, for that might well mean imprisonment, or any sentence which the ordinary criminal courts are empowered to make.  If we are to give the Minister power to make regulations subject only to the approval of the Executive Council regarding the punishment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police it is putting the Minister, subject only to the Executive Council, in the position of a criminal court.  That certainly should not be agreed to.  It is a violation of what was intended to be a Constitution; unless we are prepared to say that this Bill is an amendment of the Constitution, we may find ourselves in a difficulty, inasmuch as the Minister is allowed the powers of a court and of a judge, subject only to the Executive Council.  I think probably it is only necessary to call the attention of the Minister to this, and that he will make it quite clear by an alteration of the section that he is not taking upon himself, or that he is not asking to be granted these powers.  I want to raise again a question I raised on another Bill with regard to the value of these declarations or oaths.  To begin with, I think they are of very little value from a disciplinary point of view, and I doubt whether any person who wanted to evade the obligation he entered into by making this declaration might not find it quite easy to do so. The promise that a member is asked to make, that he will not join, or subscribe to, or belong to any political society or to any secret society whatsoever, is a kind of promise that I think we ought not to put into legislation.  It would be quite enough, and much more <Col N="1826" /> effective in my opinion, for the Commissioner to make regulations in which he could define what he meant by a political society, a thing which you cannot do in a declaration of this kind. A man signs this declaration, and then the question arises as to whether he should join, let us say, the Gaelic Athletic Association, or the A.O.H. Friendly Society, and when asked the question are these political societies he would say: &ldquo;By no means; one is an athletic association and the other is a friendly society.&rdquo;  But we know as a matter of common knowledge that both of them have been in the past active political agents or societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite in conformity with such a declaration for people to join societies under the guise of friendly societies, athletic associations or gymnasiums, whose primary and obvious purpose was athletics or friendly or social activities of one kind or another, and yet be fully aware that the chief activities of societies of that kind were political; and I say that a declaration of this kind is not going to prevent membership of either political associations or membership of secret societies. Ten men can come together and say: &ldquo;We will form ourselves into the Blue Funk Club,&rdquo; and it may mean nothing or it may mean anything.  You could not put in a legislative measure as a declaration of this kind a form of words which could not be easily evaded by any person who wanted to evade them; and I suggest to the Minister that he is not serving the case that he wants to serve by asking persons joining a police force or any other State organisation of the kind, to bind themselves in this manner.  Unfortunately most people use the term &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the narrowest sense, but I think we ought not to do so.  I think we ought to set an example of a different kind; we ought not to assume that a political society is a society which only has to do with putting one Government into office, or keeping another Government out of office.  A political society may have for its purpose the good government of a locality, may have as its object good government, whether in the form of legislation or administration, or even might have as its object education in the principles of government. <Col N="1827" /> And a political society might be a most admirable organisation for a policeman to belong to.  It depends upon the interpretation of the word &ldquo;political.&rdquo; And I suggest to the Minister that it is not wise to put this form of words into a declaration, if a declaration is desirable at all.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to have from the Minister, if he can give it, some justification for continuing the practice of having two police forces.  I have no very definite opinions on the subject, and I am open to any argument.  But I fail to see the necessity, in the present circumstances, of having the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the Gárda Síochána, which may be interchangeable, as they appear to be by the provisions of this Bill, and both of which are to be centralised.  If you could argue that the Dublin Metropolitan Police was a local force in its inception and in its membership and locally governed and managed, then you might make a very good case in favour of a separate force.  But in this case, where you have the members drawn from all parts of the country, trained in the same manner as the Gárda Síochána are, governed by the Executive or by an Executive officer, and not by a local authority, where the force is merely a counterpart of the larger force, in these circumstances it sems to me that a case ought to be made for having the second force.  I do not know whether there will be any economy.  I am not urging it on that ground.  But I do urge that there should be some consideration as to the necessity for having the second force more or less parallel with the first and larger force and yet under different administration and both subject to the same Minister. It seems to me that a case has to be made why the continuation of the old practice should be embodied in this Bill, which is not a temporary Bill, not a temporary measure at all.  As I say, I am not urging that the force should be abolished.  I do not know but that there may be good arguments in favour of maintaining a separate force.  But I have not yet heard them; and as far as I can understand the position, I think that there is a strong argument <Col N="1828" /> in favour of a single force so long as they are to be centrally directed.  And therefore, until we are in the position, as I hope we shall be before many years are over, of localising the force, I submit that we ought to be convinced by argument that a separate force is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the arguments advanced by Deputy Johnson was that we should begin to localise the police force.  But, if Deputy Johnson desires to see the whole police force localised, he should not recommend the sweeping away of the one local police force that exists, but he should rather desire to preserve it.  The Dublin Metropolitan Police Force is local in name, and local also in its functions. It may be in an emergency transferred to Meath, Kildare or Wicklow, but the occasions on which it has been transferred, except for the regulation of race meetings, have been singularly few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Johnson's remarks as to the declaration, I agree with him that the formula in the Bill, which is the same as that in the Gárda Síochána Bill, is not an absolutely perfect watertight declaration.  If people wish to evade it, they will be able to evade it, just as they can evade any form of words that the mind of man could imagine.  It passes the wit of man to draw up a formula that a man who is guilty of bad faith, who takes the declaration as merely a matter of form, will not be able to evade, and to reason with his conscience to evade. But, in these matters, I think we are entitled to assume a certain amount of goodwill and a certain amount of good faith, and we are entitled to assume that the average man, confronted with an obligation of this kind, will either say that he will not take it, or else that he will take it in the spirit in which it is intended.  And as to the general policy of such a declaration, I think that it is emphatically sound.  A policeman, who is a servant of the State with regard to the enforcement of the law, should, as far as possible, free himself from all external associations whatever.  He cannot free himself from those of relationship, but <Col N="1829" /> that difficulty is usually avoided by transferring him to some district in which his family do not reside.  But all other relations&mdash;political, economic, trades union, if you like, tend to bias him, or tend, at any rate, to make people think that he may be biassed, and therefore they are undesirable.  I think the reason at the back of this declaration is a sound one, though I agree that the words are not perfect; and if Deputy Johnson would devise a better formula, I should be delighted to fall in with him.  Failing a better formula, I think we would be wise to accept this one.</P>
    <P>I rose, however, for the sake of getting a little more light from the Minister on the position and status of the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner.  For instance, up to now I believe, though I do not know, these positions were pensionable offices. Do they continue to be pensionable offices under this Bill?  Both the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner are liable to be removed under this Bill.  That may be a wise discretion to vest in the Minister and the Executive Council, but if they are removed, do they forfeit their rights to pension?</P>
    <P>It seems desirable on the whole that men holding high and important positions, exercising responsible functions in the State, should have something of the same nature of security as judges. I am not suggesting that, like judges, they should be immune from criticism, and that their salaries should not be placed on the Estimates, but that they should have some reasonable security, that while they do their duty they will not be liable to be sent about their business at a moment's notice.  I hope the Minister will enlighten us.  I should like to know why the name of the present Chief Commissioner appears in the Bill, while the name of the Assistant Commissioner does not.  Is it intended to differentiate between the two, or is the reason that the Assistant Commissioner enjoys certain rights under the Treaty that the present Commissioner does not, that therefore he is secure in his position, while the Chief Commissioner is not, or is it <Col N="1830" /> the intention of the Government to make a change in the position of Assistant Commissioner?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I answer that now.  The only reason is that the present Chief Commissioner, or Commissioner as he will be when the Bill is law, was not appointed validly in the manner prescribed by the existing legislation, and for the thorough validation of the appointment it is necessary to insert it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I take it that the invalidity was that he should have been appointed by the Lord Lieutenant, but there was no Lord Lieutenant.  Therefore, it is not the intention to make a change in status.  The only reason the name appears is to validate previous action, and that, I think, in the main covers my objection.  I think it would be wise, as I have thought in more than one instance before, that somebody somewhere, either in the Executive Council or elsewhere in the Government, should read the Bills so that you would not have on the outside &ldquo;introduced by the Minister for Justice,&rdquo; and on the inside &ldquo;the expression Minister means Minister for Home Affairs.&rdquo;  A little conformity in these things is wise, but that is a detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an intelligent anticipation on the part of the Clerk of the Dáil.  The Ministries and Secretaries Bill came into effective operation yesterday, or the day before yesterday.  Deputy Johnson touched on Section 8, sub-section (b).  The section empowers the Minister, subject to the approval of the Executive Council, to make regulations <i>inter alia</i> for the promotion, retirement, degradation, dismissal and punishment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. There is an identical section in the Gárda Síochána Bill which has passed through this Dáil and which is now in <Col N="1831" /> the Seanad.  The Deputy queried whether that would not have the effect of empowering me to prescribe imprisonment as a punishment under the regulation. That, of course, would be to constitute myself a court.  It would be contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>The form of declaration prescribed by the Bill is just the best that we could devise.  If the Deputy will put down amendments in the Committee Stage, I will guarantee to give them every consideration.  The alternative is to have none.  I am not prepared to take it that men should be enrolled in a disciplined organisation like the police with no undertaking to the State which means to their fellow - citizens simply that it is a casual employer and employee relationship with absolute freedom on both sides, and no particular undertaking beyond that they will direct the traffic and try to put down crime.  The Deputy suggests that they should have just the same freedom as anyone else to indulge in partisan politics, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is misrepresenting me.  I said the object would be achieved by regulations rather than by asking men to make a declaration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion largely.  If the Deputy thinks that he would like to convince the Dáil on the matter he can put down his amendment on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> Personally, I agree with Deputy Cooper that the declaration can be evaded by anyone who wants to do it. I query whether it is a case for its elimination or whether it is right that people entering an organisation in the State service like the police force or an army should enter it without some formal declaration of this kind; if not in these actual words I am prepared to consider alternative words.  But I do believe there should be some solemn, formal declaration to mark off service of this kind in a disciplined State force from the ordinary casual employer-employee relationship that exists outside.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper questioned whether the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner are pensionable.  They are, of course, pensionable officers and their rights in that respect are not in any way altered by the provisions of this Bill.  He pointed out that they were removable and asked whether in the event of their removal their pensions would be payable.  They are removable in the same sense and for the same reason as other officers of their force.  It is only in case of very grave misconduct that a pensionable officer is so removed that his pension rights would be forfeited thereby.  I think that as between that position and the alternative of saying that under no circumstances could the officer be removed, there is a good deal to be said in favour of just leaving the thing alone, because public opinion would, I think, endorse the position that whereas an offence should be very grave to warrant dismissal and loss of pension, public opinion would equally object to the position that particular men should be so placed that no matter what their offence, or no matter how inconsistent the offence with the responsibilities of their office and the implications of their tenure of that office, they should not forfeit their pension&mdash;in other words, that they could indulge in any activities however treasonable, however destructive of stability, and still having done that, be absolutely entitled, without possibility of question, to a pension from the State.  There are two sides of the picture.  My own view would be that the existing position is the right <Col N="1833" /> one.  Subject to representations Deputy Johnson may have to make on particular points in Committee Stage I have, I think, covered the ground and I ask the Dáil to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I overlooked it.  It is rather an important question.  The Deputy invited me to make a case for the existence of two forces.  I should not really be asked to do that, because the two forces exist, and we simply recognise that fact now. The Deputy should rather make a case for immediate unification, and I think it would not be easy to do that just at the moment.  The tendency of the Bill, as the Deputy will note, is towards ultimate unification.  Personally, from administrative experience, I would favour ultimate unification without being prepared to put forward proposals to that effect here and now. Unification would be administratively much more convenient.  I believe that a better service, a more efficient service, could be given in that way to the citizens.  But difficulties exist at the moment that will tend to disappear, and I would hope and expect that someone occupying my position in the future, and perhaps in the rather near future, would introduce a Bill for the unification of these forces.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  There is no matter of any importance in the Bill which has not already been dealt with in my statement introducing the Finance Resolutions, or in the course of the discussion on the Finance Resolutions themselves.  I think it is not necessary at this Stage to repeat any of that matter. It is not necessary, either, to go into the details of the measure until we reach the Committee Stage, so that I will content myself with formally <Col N="1834" /> moving the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter of some little importance which has not been referred to on the Resolutions, which cannot be referred to in the Committee Stage, and which I think can only be discussed now.  As there are certain remissions of taxation, I think one is in order in inquiring from the Minister why he has not proposed certain other remissions or alterations. I refer to the question of the Motor Vehicles Duty.  There is a very large and widespread opinion amongst users of motor-cars and others that the Motor Vehicles Duty on present lines is a mistaken duty, that it hits the man who uses a car comparatively moderately, very hard, and that it would be better to replace it by a tax on petrol. We must deal with this matter now, because, owing to the remissness of the last Dáil, the then Minister for Finance was enabled to get the Motor Vehicles Duty imposed until the Dáil should determine otherwise.  As no private member can bring in a measure imposing a tax on petrol, that means almost indefinitely. I do not know what Deputy Johnson was doing when the section passed.  As far as I can gather, it passed without discussion at all, except on the subject of the sugar duty. I would suggest to the Minister that in this respect the British precedent that he is following&mdash;a convenient one, I do not deny&mdash;is not altogether a sound one.  It would be much more satisfactory and much more businesslike if we had all the taxes we are going to levy before us, and if we were not merely called upon to vote for certain variations in some taxes, for reductions and increases in other taxes, and to allow certain taxes to go without discussion at all.  In this case, owing to the wide-awakeness of the President, and the neglect of the rest of the last Dáil, the Motor Vehicles Duty and the Mineral Rights Duty will not be discussed at all.  Deputies have no information before them as to the scale on which they are fixed, and I do say it would be wise if the Minister could get away from the British Treasury precedent and give us full particular of all these taxes, so that we would have a fair opportunity of discussin them.  With regard to the Motor <Col N="1835" /> Vehicles Duty, it is a tax which militates severely against the individual Private motor user, who only uses his car to a limited extent.  He has to pay exactly the same duty as the man who uses his car every day, either for business or for pleasure.  The Motor Vehicles Duty is supposed to go to the upkeep of the roads.  The man who uses the roads in excess pays no more than the man who uses the roads one day during his holidays.  Again, it is a very rigid duty.  It has to be paid for a fixed period.  You have either to take out a licence for a year or, at best, for a period of three months.  And not for those three months that happen to suit you.  Say, you want to use your car in June and July.  You have to take out the licence for the period from March to September.</P>
      <P>I believe that certain concessions have been made in the British Parliament to motor users with respect to the period of these licences, and I had hoped that the Minister would be in a position to indicate that he would consider certain concessions with regard to the period for which licences should be held.  Instead of having to take out their licences on the 1st of April or the 1st of July, holders might be allowed to take one out for the three months beginning on the 1st June. There are many people who leave their cars up for the winter, and who use them only during the summer months.  They ought not to be asked to take out a licence for the whole period.  In another way, the present system seriously affects not only the ordinary motor owner but the person who uses a commercial motor vehicle, such as a taxi or a char-a-banc.  The owner of a char-a-banc finds that he cannot afford to take out a licence for the whole year; he probably takes out a licence for the three months of July, August and September.  That means that if there is a fine day at Easter there are very few char-a-bancs going to the country, and people anxious to travel find there are practically no facilities for doing so.  At Whitsuntide a similar condition of affairs exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my argument against the existing method of collecting these <Col N="1836" /> duties.  The present method, in my opinion, is a wrong and mistaken one. I think the policy of charging a flat rate on the mere possession of a motor car, rather than having a tax on the use of the vehicle and on the damage done to the roads, is unsound.  I have no doubt the Minister will say that petrol is used for more purposes than running motor cars.  It is to a limited extent used for lighting, and it is also used for the cleaning of ladies' clothes.</P>
    <P>There can be another argument put forward that other things are used for the propulsion of motor cars than petrol.  There is, for instance, benzol. There are a number of people who use benzol, or a mixture of benzol and petrol.  I do not see that there can be much difficulty in taxing benzol.  When the Minister is taxing boots, bottles, and barley sugar, I do not not see why he should not tax benzol and have a four b's instead of three.  It is easier to collect the tax on the motor car than on the petrol; that is a perfectly legitimate argument, but it does not go so far as the Minister and his officials want to go.  Convenience of collection must be considered.  The convenience of the public should be considered as well as the convenience of the collector. The present system is very inconvenient to the public; it is working unfairly and inequitably.  There is a very strong feeling on this matter.  The majority of people regard this as grossly inequitable, and there will be persistent discontent until the matter is remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last Dáil we were promised by the President that by the next financial year this matter would have some attention.  The question was raised in the last Dáil and debated for some time, and as far as I can remember the President gave an undertaking of that description.  If there is one thing more than another upon which there is unanimity it is this question of motor taxation.  I have yet to meet the individual in this country who thinks otherwise than we do on this subject, and I have met nobody who agrees with the Ministry. Everybody's idea is that the tax should be put on petrol.  The users of petrol are the users of the roads, and the <Col N="1837" /> people who wear the roads most are the people who use most petrol, and therefore they should be taxed most. If the Minister has any regards for equity and fair play he cannot defend the present system.  Deputy Cooper says it is easier to collect the tax on motors cars.  I doubt that very much. I think it is very much easier to tax petrol coming into the country.  It is quite true that there are a lot of people to do the work of collecting in the country, clerks of county councils and other people.  I say it is much easier to collect a tax on petrol.  It is neither fair to the motor car owners, the public nor the tax-payers who pay for the upkeep of the roads.  I hope the Minister will meet us on this matter, because it is the unanimous wish of the country people.  I hope the Minister will give effect to the public feeling on the subject, and to what seems to be the common law of equity.</P>

      <P>It is simpler in operation and more effective.  We have heard the case of the man who seldom uses his motor car, and who takes it out only now and again.  What does the tax go to?  The tax goes to maintain roads for the use of motor vehicles, and if a man is disposed to entertain the luxury of keeping a car in his garage and only uses it when the spirit moves him, he wants the roads maintained in good order and for his convenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wants the roads <Col N="1838" /> kept up for him, if he wants the roads kept up for his convenience, that is against all the ideas that have been expressed here in connection with another Bill as to the ultimate object of the use of the roads.  Deputy Gorey is, of course, always personal.  He makes reference to Heiton's motors. Well Heiton's have other motors besides heavy lorries, and irrespective of that, I do not stand up here with a mind biassed in any direction of that sort.  If it is good generally that a tax should go on petrol, I certainly am no-one who will stand up here to deny the taxes on motor cars.  I stand up with the conviction and with the clear assertion that for convenience of collection, for justice all round, the tax as at present applied to motor vehicles, is more just than the tax would be if it were upon petrol.  One must remember also that petrol is a motive force.  It is not altogether for cleansing ladies' dresses that petrol is used.  It can be used as a motive force irrespective of motor cars altogether.  It is a fuel, and you might as well, in my judgement, put a tax on any other fuel that comes into the country as to put it on petrol.  I again repeat it is a motive force.  Now, what does most damage to the roads? Is it a petrol-driven vehicle or a steam lorry?  I will ask Deputy Gorey to say which does more harm?  Steam motors do not use any petrol, and is the steam motor perambulating the country with a double weight of chassis and propelled by another fuel, to go scot free?</P>

      <P>We are getting along. It is very instructive to come to this assembly and to find that the trend of the minds of some of the Deputies in this matter runs to the direction of taxing coal.  Of course, Deputy O'Sullivan is only following up what he has declared by his vote, to protect the country against any importation.  If that is so, then, irrespective of motor taxes, put an additional tax on petrol and on everything else.  Then you are consistent.  But to select an item of general use like petrol and to say that it is an equitable tax, because, forsooth <Col N="1839" /> some dandified gentlemen have motor cars lying in their garages and only want to use them once a month or once in six months&mdash;is that reasonable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When I interjected a question, Deputy Hewat ignored it. The question I asked him was why was the tax taken off petrol and put on the motor car?  He knows perfectly well that it was done in the interests of the British manufacturer of light cars.  The Government in England wanted to knock out the American high-power vehicle, and so they put a tax on the Ford car as against the English-made car.  That was what was at the real bottom of it.  But there is no equity in the change.  I quite agree with Deputy Hewat that these heavy vehicles propelled by steam power should be taxed.  The grievance is that those people, who use the road the most, are paying just the same as the other people, who use it on occasion, and that is not equitable.</P>

      <P>It was well known at the time that what I say was at the bottom of it.  There is a great agitation for the removal of taxes on horse power.  Everywhere you go, as Deputy Gorey says, the people talk of the injustice under which they suffer, and the question as to the amount which the collection would cost more than the present system costs is not one which should enter into the matter.  There is an injustice to those who use the motor-cars, and at the present time if you examine into the amount it does cost to collect these taxes you will find that it is pretty high.  I know in one county where the officer in charge is getting £150 a year for collecting a tax on motor-cars.  If you examine the whole Twenty-six Counties you will find a similar state of affairs, and I am sure that under the present system the collection is more than it would amount to if petrol were taxed at the ports.</P>

      <P>On this question of petrol versus car the experts differ, but it seems to me that the obvious deduction that the Minister for Finance should draw is to put a tax on both. Because it seems from one argument that petrol should be taxed more than it is, and from the other argument that the cars should be taxed more than they are or that they should be taxed on a different basis.  To arrive at something like equity there should be perhaps an additional tax put upon either petrol or motor-cars.  I do not know which, and I do not care which, if by its means it would allow of another halfpenny off tea or sugar.  Perhaps that is quite impossible, but it suggests to me that if there is this luxury trade in motor-cars and motor traction, apart from industrial activity, it might well be used as a means of raising revenue for the benefit and for the relief of breakfast table duties.  I want to raise the matter of the duties upon candles and soap which are coming into operation on the 1st July.  I want to ask the Minister as to the effect of this deferring of the dates for the tax upon the importation of these commodities, and what is the report regarding the supplies that are coming in day <Col N="1841" /> by day upon the total estimated amount of the duty and the protective effect.  Does he anticipate that the value of these duties for this year is nullified by the immense quantities of both soap and candles that are being imported and that are lying upon the quays in Cork, Dublin and other places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information I have received is that the quantities imported in recent weeks are so immense that the chances of any value coming out of these duties either to the Irish manufacturers or to the revenue will be very small indeed for the coming year, and that the tendency already is for the importers to delude the public by raising the prices of some articles on the plea that the tax is coming into operation. I do not know whether it is possible to amend this Bill.  I suppose it is not possible to amend it by changing the date to an earlier one, or by charging upon the present imports, but it seems to me that the policy of the Minister has been shown to be faulty in the deferring of these duties, and that the only value to be got either of an experimental or revenue-producing kind can be counted as only from the 1st January next.  I mentioned that there is a tendency already to increase the price on the score of the duty, although the duty is not yet in operation.  I am informed, for instance, that in the case of candles prices were raised for certain qualities of candles by 25 per cent., partly on the grounds that there has been an increase in raw material and incidentally on the ground that there was a duty coming on the candles.  On a protest being made an Irish importing firm&mdash;I do not think they are manufacturers&mdash;immediately said: &ldquo;We will cut down the increase we made by one half.&rdquo;  This was because a protest had been made, and information given that the tax was not in operation.  That is the kind of thing that is happening in the case of more industries than one, and it is a pity that we had not some kind of assurance from the Ministry that they will deal with this kind of overcharging and defrauding the public on the score of the coming duty. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us what quantities of soap and candles <Col N="1842" /> over and above the normal importation is coming into the country since the date of the announcement in his Budget.  So far as I can learn, the quantities are so great that we cannot anticipate any benefits of any kind either to manufacturers or to the revenue for many months to come.  There may be a way to meet it.  If the figures are such as I have heard it may not be a bad proposition to suggest the pushing forward of the date for a few months so as to checkmate the importers. There may be other matters one would have to raise in detail, but I shall defer them until we come to deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Cooper raised this question of motor duties, because certainly it is one that has been exercising the minds of motor users, both in this country and across the water, for a long time.  This duty was changed from the petrol to the car and to the horse-power of the car, and, as Deputy Wilson, I think, very properly said, in order to meet the wishes of certain classes of motor-car manufacturers in England.  No such condition at the time obtained here, but as we were subject then to the laws of another place we had to submit.  Now times have changed, and I see no reason why we should follow the precedent that was set to us, and that was adopted in those days.  My first objection to the present motor tax is this, that I cannot see upon what fair basis that tax is made.  The car is taxed because it is a certain horse-power, and not only that, but all cars of equal horse-power are not equally taxed.  You may have one car here which is of a certain horse-power, but has not the same diameter of cylinders, and that car is not taxed to the same degree as a car of the same horse-power but of another diameter of cylinder.  There fore, I cannot see upon what fair, or equitable, or satisfactory basis, or even upon what profitable basis, from the point of view of the State, this tax exists at present, and will be maintained. The question of the collection of the tax seems to be much easier of determination. If the article is taxed in bulk, if the petrol is taxed as it comes into the country, just the same as all spirit is taxed, and if it is placed in <Col N="1843" /> bond and is removed by the same methods as spirit is removed, I think that this would be by far the easier method for the State, and its incidence would be the fairest all round.  Take the present motoring public in Ireland, the great bulk of the cars used, especially among the working classes&mdash;and I include farmers in that designation&mdash;are Ford motor-cars. The Ford car is taxed very heavily, because of its horse-power, and some person who gets a light British-made car for pleasure purposes or otherwise gets off with less tax than the farmer down the country who requires a car which he can initially acquire at a cheap sum, and which has sufficient motor-power to do the work that he requires.  I do not think that is fair to the great bulk of motor-car users and proprietors in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard of the use of the roads, and the damage that is done to them.  Why, everyone knows that the greatest damage of all is done by motor lorries.  I do not at all quarrel with what Deputy Hewat said about some lorries.  There is no reason why there should not be a tax on steam lorries, but the great majority of the lorries used in this country are not steam lorries. They are rapidly disappearing, and motor lorries are being used that actually pay less tax than do some of the motor cars of the same horse-power. It is true that if the tax were placed once more on the petrol that motor lorries would have to pay more, because they consume more petrol, but besides consuming more petrol they do more damage to the roads.  One of the reasons why roads are so bad in certain portions of the South of Ireland is that they have been cut to pieces by motor lorries.  I think that it would, in all fairness, be better for the motoring community, and for the public at large, that this tax should be spread out upon the spirit, than that it should fall upon the individual make of car for no rhyme or reason, because there is no basis, there is no principle, certainly, involved in the method of taxation by horse-power or by the size of the cylinders.  As this question was raised last year, and <Col N="1844" /> as an undertaking, according to Deputy Cooper, was given that it would be investigated and looked into, I hope that the Minister will have some reasons to give, when he comes to speak, why a change has not been made and why the present incidence of taxation is being maintained.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, there is another question which I desire to refer to, and I think I am probably in the same category as Deputy Cooper in regard to it, for I may not have another opportunity of doing so.  It is a question that I have already mentioned in regard to the Estimates, namely, the tax upon cider. As I stated previously, this is the only country probably in the world, where there is an Excise and a Customs duty upon cider.  In the previous remarks which I had occasion to make, I stated that it was practically a one-man tax, and that there was but one cider manufacturer in the Free State.  I am glad to be able to state, that I was wrong. Since then I have discovered that there is actually another.  I have a communication from Messrs.  Rutter and Company, of Cork, informing me that they manufacture cider, as well as Messrs. Power and Company, of Dungarvan. But these are the only two manufacturers of cider in the whole Free State. And what took place?</P>
    <P>There is an Excise duty upon cider, and there is a Customs duty upon cider. That duty amounts to something like 4d. a gallon.  The amount which is derived from the duty, and which the Exchequer gains, must be of very small dimensions.  But when that amount has to be borne by two manufacturers, or, at any rate, by those who consume the products of those two manufacturers, I think that the burden they have to bear is a very heavy one, and I do not think it would be asking too much if I were to appeal once more to the Ministry of Finance and to ask if it would not be possible at any rate to abolish the Excise duty and to allow the import duty to continue.  What would be the result?  The result would be that the Exchequer would lose a very small sum&mdash;I do not know whether it even runs into thousands or not, I do not think it does&mdash;they would lose a very small sum and they would <Col N="1845" /> be promoting and encouraging the manufacturer of this very healthy beverage in this country.  At the present time the Irish manufacturer is at a distinct disadvantage.  He has not got the class of apples here in Ireland that they have in England, and, as well as using as many Irish-grown apples as he can, he has to import apples from abroad.  I hope to have the support of the Minister for Agriculture on this point, and also, indeed, the support of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Because, in the first place, if cider manufacture was encouraged here, it would, undoubtedly, encourage farmers to grow the proper kind of apples, suitable to the manufacturer of that beverage, and I know as a fact that in the factory or brewery&mdash;I do not know which is the proper term&mdash;at Dungarvan, over 700 tons of Irish apples were used last year.  Now, sir, if that is the case, and if this industry is managing to struggle along, which it is only barely doing, under the present conditions, I think that, if the Minister for Finance removed this duty, which means so very little to the Exchequer, he would encourage that industry.  In that way, I hope I may succeed in getting the support of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. This is the only industry, practically, in the little town of Dungarvan.  It has been a thriving industry, but in the last few years, of course, it has had a serious set-back, and I really think that it would be an act of grace on the part of the Minister for Finance&mdash;and certainly the Exchequer would lose nothing by it&mdash;if he would do away with the Excise duty on this article and maintain the import duty, and thus give to struggling Irish manufacturers, if not an advantage, at least an encouragement to proceed along their lines of industry and to compete on favourable terms with their rivals both in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  And, sir, I raise this question now because I do not know if I would have the opportunity later on.  And I do hope that when the Minister comes to consider it he will not turn a deaf ear to my appeal.</P>

      <P>It is not entirely in my own interest, as a motor <Col N="1846" /> user, that I raise to press upon the Minister to change the incidence of this tax.  I think I spoke at least twice in the last Dáil in regard to this matter, and I speak more particularly on behalf of my less fortunate brethren who are practising in the country, particularly in wild regions that are sparsely populated.  These men do not use their motor cars for luxury.  Not only do they use a cheap car, an American car on which the tax is high, a tax of £18&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>£20 on the Ford car.  Not only have they to pay that high tax for one car, but, in order to keep themselves going in the dispensary districts, many of them are forced to keep an old worn-out car as well, so that if anything should happen to the car they are customarily using they can fall back upon this old car; and they have to pay, not only the £20 tax on the car that they are using every day, but £20 also for the car that they may bring into use while the other car is being repaired.  This is a very distinct and a very heavy burden that the doctors have to bear throughout the country, particularly the dispensary doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About a dozen years ago I was paying £2 2s. 0d. as a licence tax.  The ordinary public were paying £4 4s. 0d. where I was paying £2 2s. 0d. because the medical practitioners were allowed by the British Government to use their cars at half the rate that was imposed upon the general public and, in addition to that, we received an abatement &mdash;I cannot remember at the moment whether it was 3d. a tin or 3d. a gallon &mdash;on petrol.  For the same car for which I was paying tax of £2 2s. 0d. in those days, I am now paying a tax of £15 or £16.  And the petrol abatement is gone.  I say it is hardly worth my while to make a complaint about it, because I can afford, I suppose, to pay the tax.  But I do think that it is a very serious matter for the majority of doctors throughout the country who require to have cars going and who, if they were able to use horse power, would not have to pay any tax whatever. In districts where they have to cover an area of 10 or 15 square miles, <Col N="1847" /> when they come back in the evening from a journey of, say, 10 miles, they find perhaps a red ticket waiting for them to go back in the same direction again.</P>
    <P>If they were using horse-power they would not be able to take their horse back again; they would wait till the next day.  Using a motor, which does not get tired in the same way as the horse does, they are able to make the journey again.  I hope when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill that the Minister will listen to arguments for the better treatment of the doctors. The British Government for many years considered that doctors in particular ought to be treated differently because they were not using their motors as a luxury.  I do not like to hear talk about luxury.  There is no great luxury as far as I am concerned. My car is now in its thirteenth year. I have taken as much care as possible of it, and the incidence of taxation as far as I am concerned would fall much more fairly upon me if I were paying a duty on petrol instead of this tax of £15 a year.  As far as Deputy Cooper's assertion that this matter received no attention in the last Dáil is concerned, I cannot agree with it, and I cannot agree with Deputy Hewat that it is fair that the man who does not use his car should pay as much as the man who is using big lorries and destroying the roads.  Is this money spent on the roads at all?  It struck me, and I use the roads fairly considerably, that there was practically no money spent on the roads.  I had to go out beyond Balbriggan the week before last.  When I reached Balbriggan I said to the people I visited that if I had known the state of the road from Dublin to Swords I would never have brought my car.  I would have waited until the following day and taken the train.  I think it is a disgraceful thing to talk about bringing people here to the Tailteann Games and other things if they are going to have roads of this sort.</P>

      <P>I suppose in considering any Finance Bill in the early stages of the establishment of this State it is inevitable that it should be as this Bill is, very largely bearing the <Col N="1848" /> imprint of financial conditions and financial policies that are not of our own devising, and not drafted for our own particular specific needs.  We have taken over in this Finance Bill a number of policies that were originally devised for conditions entirely separate from ours and wholly different from ours.  Mention has been made of the motor tax.  That is only one of them. An attempt is being made in this Finance Bill to make a change in that particular respect.  That change, in so far as it is a change, is for the good, but we nevertheless have here in this Finance Bill, and I think it right to mention it at this moment, the embodiment of a policy, woven in with the beginnings of a new policy, that was drafted originally by Great Britain, for the needs of a purely industrial State.  We have added to that what the Minister has described already in the Dáil an experiment in protection.  I feel it is a matter for regret that the word protection should ever have been used.  I have said earlier in this House, and I repeat it, that I think the words protection and free trade are words that have no application to this country at all.  What we really do want is something far more fundamental than the consideration of either of those theories.  What is wanted is a fiscal policy, the parts of which are to be explained by reference to the whole, not introduced piecemeal, something thought out as one considered system which may be tried and approved.  I take one case particularly of a tax that appears in this Finance Bill, and to which I refer now, because I think this is the proper time to deal with it, and because being a matter of detail, it cannot be considered adequately in Committee.  It is with regard to a matter which has been discussed many times here; that is in regard to the tax on boots and shoes.  This Finance Bill proposes to tax, and earlier resolutions of this Dáil have already taxed, not alone boots and shoes, but the parts that go to the making of boots and shoes, the uppers, as well as the soles. If my information is correct, there are no manufacturers of uppers whatever in this country.  We only manufacture soles.  In other words, although we are <Col N="1849" /> to charge a duty upon the manufacture of boots in order to encourage the manufacture of boots at home, we are, nevertheless, going to charge on nearly all the material that goes to the manufacture of boots.  What benefit will accrue to the manufacturer at home will be very small indeed, whereas the real method of creating an industry of this sort, I suggest, would rather have been to consider a different type of policy altogether, to let the financial and the fiscal grow out of the purely industrial and commercial, and by advocating and developing the dead-meat industry in this country to have grown up to the creation of an industry that will never be created properly by the method advocated and sought in the Finance Bill.  In other words a financial policy or a fiscal policy, and the two are closely interwoven, although they are not exactly the same thing, is really part of a national policy.  I fail to find anywhere in this Finance Bill any parts of a coherent and co-ordinated fiscal system.  I believe the country is looking just for that kind of coherency, so that its attention will not be directed to this duty or that duty, but only to this duty or that duty as explaining a general system that will benefit the trade of the country, and at the same time benefit the yield of revenue.  I feel that we have here embodied in the Finance Bill a number of duties, the yield from which is very small indeed.  I dealt with this matter on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill of last year, and I refer to it again now.  We have duties taken over here that were intended originally for the protection of certain British industries, and adopted for that sake.  They are transferred here, and they actually turn against that original purpose.  They serve no purpose here except to yield a very small amount of revenue, wholly disproportionate to the amount of administration that is required for their collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the tax on motor cars.  I am not now referring to the particular aspect of it that has been referred to.  There is a tax on musical instruments and a whole lot of different matters that are really only taken over because <Col N="1850" /> it is a well-known habit of the human mind that once you have adopted a certain tax or policy it wants very little less than a mine to shift or disturb it.  I support all that has been said by previous speakers, following Deputy Cooper, in dealing with the question of the motor tax.  The equitable method of dealing with this is the method that will make the yield in revenue proportionate to the use of the item that is taxed.  By charging the duty upon the motor car that essential principle in equity is wholly lost sight of.  Cases have been brought to my attention of people who use motor cars occasionally for the purpose of business and far less occasionally for their own pleasure.  But at certain periods of the year they use those cars very frequently.  When the total amount of use, spread throughout the year, is considered their actual use of the car is very small.  Notwithstanding that, they are charged on exactly the same basis as the persons who have their cares in constant commission day after day.  I should have thought that it appeared on the face of it that no tax that gave so disproportionate a result as that was a tax that was equitable in its incidence.  I hope it will be possible on the Committee Stage to effect a change in that particular matter and in several other matters.  I hope that between now and the introduction of the next Finance Bill an examination will be made in order that the next Finance Bill will be of a kind different from this one and different from that of last year, and that it will be, as these are not, a Bill framed by reference to some definite policy that has been adopted and the parts of which can be explained and justified before the people as parts of a coherent and co-ordinated system.  I think if that were done, we would be able to avoid a good deal of what has been already heard in the different arguments put before in the Dáil.  It is inevitable that Deputies will have had brought before them, as we all have had brought before us, particular cases of industries in our own constituencies where our own constituents have urged, seeing that Protection is to be considered, Protection for a specific industry that would help their own constituency and <Col N="1851" /> so far help the nation.  How far that is likely to be carried the future alone can say.  But it is not likely to be carried very far if all these matters have not a standard by which they can be judged.  That standard can only be arrived at by seeking to devise a system which, as I said before, can be justified because it will yield the maximum of industrial benefit, proportionate with the maximum of financial yield.</P>

      <P>I cannot let the Second Reading of this Bill pass without registering, at least, a formal protest against the protective duties that are imposed by it.  I do not intend to go over the old arguments again.  I think the matter has been argued threadbare, but I would like to say that I am convinced that these protective duties are going to increase the cost of living and that the benefit which will result from them will not be commensurate with the loss which will accrue to the ordinary person living in the country.  It has been said that those are to be experimental duties.  I sincerely trust the Minister will see that they are experimental duties and that he will be able to resist the efforts that will be made by every manufacturer in the country to get special protective duties for his particular industry. I am quite confident that, between now and the next Budget, pressure of all kinds and from all sides will be brought to bear on the Minister to have protective duties imposed on other articles.  He will find it very difficult indeed to resist the attempts that will be made in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am sorry also that the Minister did not see his way to take off portion of the duty on sugar and at least to keep on the same level in that regard as the British Budget. I know he will say that the finances of the country would not allow him to take such a step.  But I am inclined to think that a special effort might be made in the direction of reducing the cost of living by reducing the cost of those articles, tea and sugar, which are so much used by the poorer classes and <Col N="1852" /> which constitute such a large proportion of their daily sustenance.</P>
      <P>I referred, on the debate which took place on the Financial Resolutions, to the question of income tax, and I proposed then that there should be a reduction of 6d. in the £1.  I am sorry that the Minister did not see his way to agree with the suggestion which I made.  I think it would be a very useful thing if the income tax and the other taxes in this country, such as the sugar tax and tea tax, could be put on a level with the British taxes.  I think the present system will induce the people who are free to leave the country to do so, and live in other countries and spend their income in those countries where taxation is lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support Deputy Redmond in his suggestion that the excise duty on cider should be removed.  As he stated, it only applies to two cider manufacturers in this country, and I think the result from this duty cannot be at all equal to the trouble involved in the collection of those taxes.  I know that there are possibilities of this industry becoming of considerable importance, at any rate in the South of Ireland. There are a great many orchards and it is well known that it is rather difficult to bring the fruit grown in this country to the same state of perfection as the fruit grown in the warmer countries, with the result that it does not sell easily in the market.  It does not appeal so well to the eye, and for that reason it might be useful to divert the attention of the apple-growers to the making of cider. I know that this industry has been greatly hampered by the excise duty of 4d. per gallon on the cider made in this country.  I need hardly tell the Minister that there is very little alcohol contained in cider and that it is almost impossible to get intoxicated on cider, except it is subjected to special fermentation or special treatment.  The ordinary cider is almost a non-intoxicant. The farmer who manufactures cider at his home is, strictly speaking, liable for this excise duty, and there is a considerable amount of difficulty in the collection of it.  It would free those people from the tendency to evade the law and it would free the officers of the law from a very onerous and troublesome <Col N="1853" /> duty which produces very little result.  I would impress upon the Minister the necessity for giving his attention to this matter and seeing if anything can be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the duties on foreign motor-cars, commonly known here and in England as the McKenna duties, I understand from the Minister that these are purely revenue duties in this country.  There is no manufacturer of motor-cars in the Saorstát.  The actual result is that the users of the cheaper types of motor-cars, American and Canadian, have to pay the extra duties of 33? or 22½ per cent., according to whether they are manufactured in the United States or in Canada.</P>
    <P>It is well known here that the users of these cheap motor-cars are mostly people who use them for business or for hiring purposes, and the actual result of these duties is that in England the buyers are already getting these cars at a considerable reduction in anticipation of the abolition of these taxes.  The agents are selling these cars already at the lower prices.  Of course the wholesale abolition of these taxes would have the effect of allowing all classes of cars at very high prices to come into this country free. Although I am not going to advocate that the duty should be maintained against these cars&mdash;it may not be found a practical proposition&mdash;yet if the idea were entertained that it would be inadvisable to allow these cars in free, there still could be a duty kept on them.  In the interests of the users of motor-cars and trade and commerce, and in the interests of those who have to earn their living by the use of motor-cars, I think that these duties should be removed.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that the English Labour Government have the courage to face this matter despite strong agitation to the contrary.  As regards the import duty on the spare parts of motor-cars, I believe it is still maintained, and I know from actual practice that it is causing a great deal of inconvenience.  I do not know that it is fulfilling any useful purpose, either from a revenue or any other point of view.  It was suggested that the maximum value of the parts which might be imported free should be placed at £1, <Col N="1854" /> and I thought that the Minister was going to give that favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister insists on retaining the duty of sixpence on packets coming by post or by any other means into the country.  I believe that will have the effect of keeping out a great many articles which people get in this country by means of advertisements and which are not obtainable at the same price here.  I believe it is an obstructive duty, and it will not have the effect of increasing any industry in this country.  It will have the effect of preventing cheap articles being brought in.  I would suggest that some consideration should be given to the removal of these small duties.</P>

There is a great deal of difficulty in differentiating between the motor car that is bought and used as a luxury article, and the motor car that is part of a man's business equipment and which he employs in the exercise of his profession or business.  That there are luxury cars is beyond all dispute, and many of these cars are highly expensive, ranging from £1,500 to £3,000. The car itself provides no comfort or convenience either as a carriage or as a speedy means of transit over a less expensive article, but it asserts the social position, and affords a certain amount of additional kudos to the owner, and it has always been the practice to extract revenue for the State from the vanity of the citizens who are in a position to pay for the indulgence of their vanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, none of those, I fear, are among my constituents, and I therefore raise no plea of mercy on their behalf.  The car which is part of the farmer's equipment, replacing the old familiar horse and gig, for the purpose of visiting fairs and markets, and for getting to the trains, is to the farmer <Col N="1855" />&mdash;if the farmer Deputies will forgive me putting it in this fashion&mdash;very much what the milkman's delivery car is; it is a part of his ordinary day's routine, and it is in the same category as his ploughs.  No tax has been yet inflicted upon the plough, harrow or the reaping machine.</P>

      <P>As regards these gigantic lorries and vans which are used for the quick delivery of very heavy traffic material, they are part and parcel of the national life.  The more of these there are and the more they use the roads, the better for the whole community.  Therefore, though they do proportionately destroy the roads more than any other users, and consequently in equity should be made to pay a fairly large contribution to the upkeep of the roads, at the same time I would not agree that they should be treated in a spirit of penalising them, and saying to them: &ldquo;You destroy the roads and therefore you must pay heavily.&rdquo;  After all, the users of the roads contribute their share to business and commerce, and assist materially in the progress of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old regime these questions were discussed in very great detail and a modification of the incidence of the tax upon motor cars was made to meet the case of the country doctor. The clergyman at that time was not included in the scope of the survey, because clergymen had not realised the advantages of reaching their congregation and of visiting the members of their flock during the week, and they had not realised the spiritual advantages that the facilities of motoring provide. At that time half the tax imposed upon the ordinary motorist was what was chargeable to the doctor.  Where an ordinary citizen paid four or six or eight guineas, the doctor correspondingly paid two or three or four guineas. Not only that, but he paid only half the tax imposed on the spirit, whether you call it petrol or not.  Something of an allowance, I forget how much, was made also to the business man, and immediately, as is usual in cases where <Col N="1856" /> exceptional treatment is allowed, abuses crept in.  Doctors in the cities were allowed petrol at the diminished rate, and their wives and sisters, and their cousins and their aunts, motored in their own vehicles with the doctor's petrol.  Similarly, those who were on friendly relations with business men were able to get the loan of their tins of their petrol from time to time.  They motored at less cost than the ordinary citizen.  There will be that difficulty if the tax is transferred from horse-power to petrol.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson spoke as if he thought those who advocated the transfer of the tax to petrol did so because they had in view some reduction in the cost of tea and sugar for the non-motorist.  The idea prevails that you have an increase in the consumption of petrol for the amount of use of the roadways, and that in that oblique or intricate fashion, by taxing the petrol you are taxing the use of the roads.  The same argument would justify the imposition of a tax on tyres, and it would be just as readily collectable.  If you think this out into the furthest detail of practice, you will see that the country doctor or clergyman who has to cover a wide area and wants to be preserved against the inclemency of the Irish climate, which is one of the things which we are not in a position to boast about, will be very seriously affected.  If we wish to protect these classes and do it by the transfer of tax from horse-power to petrol, how does it work out? The Chevrolet car, as was mentioned by Deputy Heffernan, has a tax of £18, and the tax on the Ford is £20.  These are usually the cars employed by the country practitioner.  Suppose he does 20 miles to the gallon, and we have a sixpenny tax per gallon on petrol, he will pay anything between £12 10s. and £18 a year as petrol tax.</P>

      <P>With 1/3, we would have something like £30 to £45 a year.  No reduction in the licence tax would compensate for that.  The thing in practice presents quite a number of difficulties.  I quite agree with Deputy Sir James Craig that it is an exceptional <Col N="1857" /> hardship on the country practitioner that he should be taxed on his car in the earning of a very meagre income.  His professional brother who lives in the big city obtains a relief which he does not get, because just as in the case of a barrister, who deducts as part of his costs the rent of his study and so on, for the deduction of overhead charges the medical man in the City of Dublin is allowed to deduct from his taxed income his outlay on his motor-car, his chauffeur and his petrol.  I do not mean to suggest that they deduct unfairly, but they are in a position legitimately to deduct from £300 to £500 under that head.  That accounts for quite a considerable amount, whereas the ordinary country practitioner would not make an income of £300 a year.  He would not make an income which would bring him within that privilege, so that the tax he pays for his car is totally without reduction, and there is no rebate and no equivalent reduction to him.</P>
      <P>It is not for me to suggest how this difficulty is to be met.  It might be met in the case of cars that are and can be used for business if the tax could be reduced, say, to half.  That would meet the case only to a very slight extent; at any rate, it would have the psychological advantage, which is something after all, that it would relieve the sense of grievance in a measure.  The future of transit is undoubtedly with the motor.  There was a time when it was merely a carriage. Unfortunately for this country our carriage and coach-builders and the men engaged in cognate industries have been gravely affected.  They have gone to Coventry, not in the sense in which we familiarly know, but they have gone to work there, and efforts to restore the trade here are useless.  It is irretrievably gone.  This is a case where the experiment of protection might usefully be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone some way. Help is given to those who build motor bodies for motor lorries and motor vans, but if chassis of foreign manufacture were allowed in with a very slight tax, and the tax imposed on the ready-to-drive-away car, opportunity would be provided, as I pointed out before, <Col N="1858" /> during a number of years for the experiment of reviving the coach building, coach painting, and coach upholstering, and all the cognate and subsidiary industries.  Closely connected with this subject is the question of income tax.  Deputies on the Labour Benches are the strongest supporters of the Ministry in regard to this income tax policy.  I wonder is that because their constituents, as a general rule, pay so little income tax, if they pay any at all?  Now, I would like the Minister to make all incomes that can be estimated, that can be set down in writing, that can be traced, subject to income tax, however slight. There is an association of ideas at work between income tax and the rich.  Why should that be?  It is one of the checks upon the growth of a full sense of patriotism.  It is impossible to persaude a man who does not pay direct taxation that the administration of the country is carried on not merely for him and through representatives voted into power by him, but carried on at his cost, at his expense, and that he is entitled, not as a mere growler, to utter his comment on the administration if it displeases him, or to praise it if it pleases him, but that actually it is his, something that he pays for, something that he is deeply and vitally interested in, in every relation and every direction of its operation.  That will not be brought home to the ordinary mind until we have a system of direct taxation universally applied.</P>
    <P>It seems to me unfair that those who pay income tax, and especially those who pay a high amount of income tax, should be left under the impression that they are the financial supporters of the State, and that those who do not pay any income tax do not contribute. It is said, of course, that it is easier to collect a tax that a man does not know he is paying.  I dare say from the point of view of those who collect the tax that is a very sound argument.  On the other hand, there are those who are interested in the development of the civic sense which is so lacking in Ireland at the moment that it would be a very valuable policy, if only for its educational force, to make the incidence of income tax go lower down than at present.  The Minister is aware <Col N="1859" /> that, like Deputy Heffernan, I would like to vote, only that I know the vote would be ineffectual, against the retention of the income tax at the present level.  I have argued this before, but argued it in vain.  I hold, and I submit, that a great deal of what is said about the necessity of balancing the Budget while thoroughly sound, is misunderstood and misapplied.  It is, of course, the duty of the Minister and of the Exchequer to keep the expenditure in any given year in proper balance with the national income, but let us not forget that until quite recently we had an army at a charge of 11½ millions sterling a year.  We have a huge and bloated Civil Service, which we have taken over, and which we dare not reduce because of the operations of the Act, facetiously known as the Better Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  There are ever so many charges I could enumerate that are really overhead establishment charges in connection with the setting up and stabilising of the Free State.  Is it right, or is it equitable, to call upon the taxpayers of these years immediately following the setting up of the State to bear the total cost of that?  I used the analogy to the President in the last Dáil, when he was Minister for Finance, and he refused to see the analogy.</P>
    <P>No township or corporation laying down new roads, creating new sewerage, providing for the better housing and the better living of its taxpayers, would dream of raising the total cost of these services out of revenue of a single year, or even of two or three years.  These things should be met by a loan, and while I advocate as strongly as the Minister the policy of balancing the Budget, I would distinguish between meeting the expenses of the current year out of revenue raisable in the current year and this particular sort of charge which presses so heavily on the Free State.  I think neither the Minister nor his predecessor cares to have a deficit.  It is natural for everyone who is responsible for the balancing of books to like to have them well balanced and to have something to carry over to the profit side if possible, but, on the other hand, look at the damage that is done in the zealous pursuit <Col N="1860" /> of good book-keeping.  I believe, if we were only to consider it as politicians, that the value of the political pull would more than compensate for the five millions that would be lost by the foregoing of 6d. in the income tax. What is more, I am confident, and I believe my confidence is shared by others, and is justified, that no better advertisement to the world of the healthy state of Ireland under the new administration, and no better indication of the absolute faith that we have in its future, could be given than that, even now at the very moment when we are demobilising our Army, when we are introducing so many Bills and when so many different projects are in contemplation involving the expenditure of money, we should cut down the income tax.  There is such a thing as advertising in the State as well as advertising in business.  If we are to raise another loan, undoubtedly the loan will be more freely, forthcoming, and at a lower rate, if the money-public, who are the people who pay income tax, are made to feel that all is well.  I believe that all is well, and that is one of the reasons why I advocate this policy.  There is no reason why these extra charges that have been incurred in the setting up of the Free State, and in the warding off from it of an attack which might have unsettled its foundations, should not be met out of loans, so that the generations after this would bear a share of the cost of creating that which yielded to them the advantages which they after us would enjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The President promised last year that he would look into the question of the road tax on motor vehicles, and I know that he did look into it.  I myself, as Minister for Local Government, discussed it with him several times, and we felt that it would not be advantageous to make any change.  We felt that this clamour about the motor tax is simply the usual one that arises against a direct tax.  A person who has to pay £15 or £10, or £20, wants an indirect tax which he will pay out in small driblets week by week, but there is very little further behind the agitation about the motor tax than that.  A person who can afford to have <Col N="1861" /> a motor-car lying up in his garage, really, I think, can afford to pay the tax, and the injustice is not worth talking about.  It would require a very substantial petrol tax to give the same amount of revenue as is given by the vehicle tax.  It would require about 1/3 a gallon, and if you were to have petrol taxed at 1/3 a gallon it would press very hard upon people like doctors, clergymen and others of that kind, who have to go about a great deal in their cars.  And we should have an agitation arising, as Deputy Magennis has indicated, that some exemption or rebate be given to them.  We should have abuses arising or people getting tax-free petrol, or petrol that is partially free of tax, from those people; and the abuses that existed in regard to the petrol tax in the past would arise again; the difficulties and the cost of administration would be greatly increased; and we would have no greater fairness than we have at the present time.  I do not say that it may not be possible to adjust the present tax by including something else than merely horse-power, as it is calculated. It may be quite desirable to include weight as a factor, but as between the vehicle tax and the petrol tax, I think it is much more desirable to continue the vehicle tax than to attempt to substitute a petrol tax.  If we did substitute the petrol tax, in addition to the doctors and others who may justly claim a rebate in the petrol tax, we should also have to give rebates to those who use petrol for lighting, for driving Ford tractors, or anything like that, and in the case of fishermen who use petrol for their boats.  And in all those cases there would be leakage and evasion of the duty, and the discontent that arises from the knowledge that your neighbours are evading the law. President Cosgrave and myself having considered the matter, were clearly of the opinion that, because of these difficulties, and because of the difficulties of giving a definition of motor spirit and because of the difficulties that would arise out of the use of substitutes, it would be quite undesirable to propose any spirit tax in substitution for the vehicle tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other matters have been mentioned, <Col N="1862" /> such as the forestalling in the case of soap and candles.  In regard to this matter, I have not, unfortunately, information that is quite up to date.  But, up to about ten days ago, although there had been, undoubtedly, a certain excess of importation over the normal importation, it was not at all as serious as Deputy Johnson has been indicating. It was appreciable, but nothing such as one should get excited about.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig referred to the state of the roads.  It seems to me that he wants to have the road tax increased. The money that is raised is spent on the roads, and if it does not make them good enough, obviously the remedy would be an increased tax.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether that was what he had in mind.  I do not think that I need reply any more to Deputy Heffernan's remarks in reference to the remission of the duty on sugar.  I think he will recognise himself that we could not do what the British did, or that, if we did do it, we should have to put on other taxes that would be in no way preferable.</P>
      <P>The difficulty about the remission of the Excise duty on cider lies in the fact that we have a duty on spirits, on beer, on cider, and on table waters. If we were to remit the duty on table waters, we could very well remit the duty on cider.  But I do not see how we could, at the request of a couple of firms or Deputies take cider out of the list, and leave the tax upon table waters.  The tax on table waters does give a substantial revenue, and I do not think we could afford to lose that, and, under the circumstances, I do not see that we could agree to take the tax off cider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the question of cider, Deputy Heffernan was quite inconsistent, it seems to me.  He was clamouring <Col N="1863" /> for Protection, although he poses, in general, as a staunch Free Trader. The Customs duty imposes no hardship on cider manufacturers, and there is a general feeling that with the Excise duty they are not a bit worse off than if the tax were removed from cider altogether.  Deputy Heffernan advocates Protection for one particular article; perhaps he is coming around.</P>

      <P>I will leave the Deputy to think it over.  I promised to consider any representation that the motor traders would put up in regard to the duty on parts.  I hope to see them.  I have not seen them, but I have had written communications from them, and, on an examination of them, I found that they were not able to put up anything.  I could not, as I explained in the Dáil, remit the duty on parts.  That would be facing a loss of £100,000 a year in revenue, and that is a thing that we could not afford.  If they could put up anything that is practicable, I should be very glad to have it, but they have not been able to do so, so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Magennis's remarks about encouraging the building of motor bodies here, the position is that there is actually protection to the extent of 33 1-3rd per cent. on motor bodies, or 22 2-9th per cent., as the case may be.  That is the duty paid on motor bodies at the present time.  Anybody who sets up the manufacture of motor bodies here is free of that duty.  I do not know whether, after the lapse of some time, that duty will prove sufficient to encourage people to undertake the building of motor bodies here or not.  I do not know.  But I believe that the duty which is being imposed in this particular Bill on commercial bodies will cause the building of commercial bodies here to a very considerable extent; and perhaps firms which have developed the manufacture of commercial bodies may turn to the making of bodies for ordinary cars.  They certainly have a very substantial degree of protection at the <Col N="1864" /> present time; and we would have to consider, and, I think, very seriously, before we should propose to give a protection exceeding 33 1-3 per cent. in any particular duty, which is what would be really involved if we made the change suggested by Deputy Magennis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will not have to pay it all.  I think I need hardly say much more in reference to the question of the reduction of income tax.  I appreciate the arguments in favour of a reduction of income tax, and I would be most anxious to propose it to the Dáil, but I think I should say that we are not endeavouring to meet out of revenue any of these abnormal expenses such as arise from Army charges or from the cost of compensation. We are simply trying to bring ourselves to the point of being able to meet our current expenses out of revenue. Those ordinary current expenses, in certain respects, might be regarded as swollen.  The establishment expenses might be regarded, I think, as somewhat excessive.  The superannuation charges are excessive, but still I think that if they were normal we would not be able to do more than simply meet the expenditure from what we get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, and having regard to the debt charges which we must meet, we cannot proceed to reduce taxation.  I think you can only reduce taxation if you have a surplus secured either by an improved yield in your taxation or by reduced expenditure, or if you can anticipate from your reductions some speedy imporvement in the situation that will give you back your revenue and restore the balance. So far as I have been able to learn&mdash; and the matter has been gone into&mdash; there is no doubt that the reduction of the income tax by 6d. would involve the loss of half a million.  For some time, at any rate, that would be a net loss, so that our position would be that we were going on to the market to borrow, and that we were facing that borrowing with measures that were leading to an increase in our deficit&mdash;a <Col N="1865" /> deficit which took into account only current expenditure and not expenditure on the Army or on compensation. I cannot feel that it would be at all prudent&mdash;although we would desire it very much&mdash;to reduce income tax at the present time.  It is a handicap.  The difference between the rates in this country and in England perhaps further operate to increase the handicap that arises from the very weight of the tax.  That is a matter we cannot afford to overlook, but, at the same time, I think, as we stand at the moment, we must keep our taxation at the level that it exists at.  When we are dealing with the question of unemployment or discontent in the country, that is a matter that can be faced by expenditure on works of construction. I think that no matter what our position might be financially, if we can see the possibility of spending well on constructive works, which will remain as value for the money spent, it would be the greatest wisdom to spend in that way.  The Government is dealing with such matters.  The question of the scheme on the River Shannon should indicate to anybody&mdash;even to the least informed&mdash;that that aspect of matters is kept in mind.  There is also the question <Col N="1866" /> of the Barrow, on plans for which we have people working at the present time.  That is expenditure that would be justifiable as constructive work, no matter what our financial position was. But, at the same time, even work such as that you can only do, especially in a country weak financially, as we are, if you take every care to see that the capital expended is really capital invested and that there is value got for the money spent.  We have to look into matters, and we must have a technical examination and other examinations that make it difficult to rush ahead, as some people would desire.</P>

The House will remember, of course, from their general reading, that there has been fairly persistent agitation for interference by the Ministry in the conduct and working of the Dublin Corporation by people who professed to have knowledge of matters that they complained about, and more particularly certain newspapers.  Presumably the Ministry have come to the conclusion, as a result of that agitation or a result of that knowledge or a result of political antipathies, that something had to be done to interfere with the activities of the Dublin Corporation, and, consequently, they found a way, or they thought they found a way, and they decided that they would appoint an inspector to conduct the sworn inquiry into the performance of their duties by the Dublin Corporation.  That inquiry was held and the report was issued, that is to say, part of a report was issued to the Dublin newspapers, and following upon the issue of that report, or concurrently with it, an order was issued disestablishing the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted to satisfy the demands of the public or the curiosity of the public, or the demand of the Corporation itself, as to the reason why he took the action he did.  So far as I have been able to find out, no one knows what the reasons are for the suppression of the Dublin Corporation, and I am taking this opportunity to try and extract from the Minister some explanation of this very extraordinary and unprecedented action <Col N="1868" /> of his.  I am not able to grow eloquent upon the history of the Dublin Corporation.  I know it has a long history. I gather from the little handbook they issue that its first Charter was granted by Henry II. in 1171, and that that has been succeeded by 102 other Charters, and that since the establishment of Municipal Corporations it has continued its work, subject to popular criticism undoubtedly and subject to denunciations from the public, until finally it was broad-based upon the people's will and established as a representative body with a wide franchise.  I do not know whether any Minister or Deputy in this House will suggest that a Corporation elected in 1920 was of a character that could not bear comparison with any of the Corporations that existed under the old regime for a generation or two back.  If it is suggested that nothing so horrible as the character of the Dublin Corporation, which is now being suppressed, existed even a generation ago, I can understand the state of mind the Minister has got into.  It was never thought desirable, or never thought politic, at any rate on the part of previous Governments, never thought desirable even on the part of the citizens of Dubline, to demand that the Corporation of Dublin as it hitherto existed should be suppressed.  Reform was called for many times, but never suppression.  It seems to me that the House is entitled to consider the position that Dublin occupies in the public life of the country, and that Dublin city particularly has the right to demand some justification from the Ministry for this most extraordinary action.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated a couple of days ago that it was not only the report of the inspector which justified his action in suppressing the Corporation.  Well, of course, one cannot understand what motives inspired a Minister so secretive as the Minister for Local Government, but, at least, we have the fact that the Minister ordered an inquiry into the performance of their duties by the Dublin Corporation, and that that inquiry was held, and that the inspector made a report, which report has been published, or rather partially published, and we have a right to assume that having gone through that procedure, <Col N="1869" /> the main reasons for the action of the Minister was contained in the report of the inspector.</P>
    <P>Now I have been careful to read this Report as it appeared in the newspapers. I have sought the publication of the Report in full in the hope it did exist and that there must be in the full report something of a more damnatory character than appears in the Report of the Inspector as submitted.  We have only got to deal with the Inspector's statement, and as far as I can read into it, it is in the main a very strong commendation of the Dublin Corporation for its activities and for the general method of conducting its business, and is a general testimony to its good character.  And there appears to be a strain of regret on the part of the Inspector that he is not able to find anything to condemn of a very serious character.  Mistakes of judgment undoubtedly there were, but nothing heinous.  He admits quite frankly that the work of the Committees of the Corporation appears to have been carried out very satisfactorily.  He speaks of their very onerous duties, and dealing with one Committee after another, he intimates he has nothing to complain about, but rather on the other hand, that their work has been very satisfactory, but he contends that the Corporation as a whole justified condemnation. One gathers in the final that the condemnation he wishes to pronounce is due to the fact that the Corporation has not been inclined to obey the orders of the Ministry of Local Government that wages should be cut down.  Everything seems to lead to that conclusion; a general regret that the administration has been found to be satisfactory, but that the Corporation, in its collective capacity, has refused to obey the orders of the Minister for Local Government to cut down wages.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, find that the Minister for Local Government has suppressed the Dublin Corporation because the Corporation declined to be instructed and ordered by him to reduce the wages of the workmen in their employment, or to cease paying the maximum pensions, although he appears to admit that the case for the pensions is a good <Col N="1870" /> one, and was justified by the fact that the old Corporations, the preceding bodies, left the present Corporation with a legacy which they had to deal with.  &ldquo;There were many old men in the service whom it was no longer a sound proposition to retain.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister for Local Government that it is his duty to say frankly whether or not it is because the Dublin Corporation refused to reduce the wages of the Corporation employees that he suppressed the Corporation.  It has been suggested that the Corporation has been suppressed, not because of the rates of wages paid, but because of a general lack of attention to business, of slackness of attendance at meetings, of certain extravagances, or to coin a word, incorrectitudes.  I want to ask the Dáil to consider what would happen to this institution if the same criterion of conduct was applied. Is it shortage of attendance at the Corporation meetings that is at fault? Twenty-five minutes ago I counted one member of the Party which sits behind the Government, supporting the Minister for Finance when he was discussing the Finance Bill, which is one of the most important measures of the year, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance.  We have 150 odd members elected to this Dáil.  Some of them have not been able to attend because they have refused to comply with the conditions precedent to taking their seats, but one hundred odd members have, as a matter of fact, complied with these conditions.  What, I ask, is our average attendance?  Is it as good as the average attendance at the Corporation meetings?  Then let us take the Committees.  I wonder are we going to apply the same criterion to attendance at Committee meetings?  Is the average attendance at Committee meetings of the Dáil better than the average attendance of Committees of the Dublin Corporation? I doubt very much.  If there were a comparison of records could anything be said in favour of the Dáil?  Secondly, we have to ask: why should the Dáil be allowed to exist, and the Dublin Corporatión be suppressed if these are the counts on the indictment?  It may be said that there have been extravagances, <Col N="1871" /> that there have been faults in the administration, even grevious faults, in the administration of the Dublin Corporation.  Supposing it were so, have there been no grievous faults of administration on the part of the Government, have there been no extravagances on the part of the Government, has it nothing to regret in the matter of administration, even in the payment of salaries?  Have there been no jobs committed by members of the Ministry responsible for this suppression of the Dublin Corporation?  If you are going to apply the same judgment, you will suppress the Dáil and the Government.</P>
    <P>It is said in defence of the Government that they have lived through abnormal times and extraordinary conditions. Excuses have been made and generously conceded to the Government because of the abnormalities that existed.  The Dublin Corporation was elected in 1920, and most of us know the circumstances of the election, most of us know who ran the election, how the election was run, how the votes were got to put members in, and most of us know that there has been a very considerable failure to act in the Corporation on the part of those who were elected because they have chosen to do other work.  If the Dublin Corporation has not been satisfactory, is it because Deputies here, who were members of the body, have preferred to resign their membership of the Corporation? Is it because of faults committed while they were members of the Corporation, or is to be assumed that the faults were only committed after they resigned?  I have a list of the members elected in 1920 who are no longer members.  Several have died, but the great majority have resigned because they have instead gone into the service of the Government or have become members of the Dáil.  Now, some of the responsibilities, if there has been failure on the part of the Dublin Corporation, lies with those members who preferred to resign rather than face their responsibilities. It may be said that you have a membership of the Corporation nominally of 80, of whom 20 or so have resigned or have died.</P>
    <P>But, then, what is the remedy? <Col N="1872" /> Surely the obvious remedy is to order a new election.  Surely the obvious remedy is to order elections for these vacancies.  Unless you have it as a deliberate purpose to refuse to allow the public to have control of the affairs of the municipality, the obvious course to adopt was to call for a new election, certainly for these vacancies, and possibly, if it was within the power of the Minister, to order a new election for the whole Corporation.  But that was not done.  No.  There is some reason. What is the reason?  I suggest that the political fears of the Ministry are very largely responsible for the action they have taken.  I suggest that that is not sufficient to justify such an action on the part of the administration as the suppression of a body of the great importance of the Dublin Corporation. If the Government is going to be motived by political fears, by the fear that the political results of a municipal election or an election for a local authority would be detrimental to their prestige, then, of course, we shall know that we are rapidly going towards oligarchy and dictatorship.</P>
    <P>I say that the position that has been taken by the Minister is one that would require to be defended by the production of the fullest evidence of guilt in matters of administration, of corruption, and of utter inability to carry out the work assigned to it. The evidence that led to the report of the Inspector quite obviously does not warrant the Minister in saying that there has been either corruption or mis-application of funds or inability to conduct the work that was assigned. It then lies with the Minister to produce other evidence, evidence which would satisfy not only the Dáil, but the City of Dublin, to disprove the allegations that none of those other possible lines of justification can be the real meaning of his action, that political feeling and political fears only remain to warrant the work that he has accomplished. I do not think that the political results will be quite as satisfactory as he would wish.  I think the slur that he has cast upon local government generally, and upon the Dublin Corporation in particular, is one that will take <Col N="1873" /> a long time to wipe out.  There were obvious remedies to adopt if he were dissatisfied, and could prove bad administration; failure on the part of the Corporation to carry out the wishes of the people.  The obvious remedy to adopt was to hold elections and to fill the vacancies.  I want to know why he has failed to take those obvious courses, and when he intends to have an election for the Dublin Corporation?</P>

      <P>With regard to this question of the Dublin Corporation, of course Deputy Johnson, as well as the other Deputies, should be aware that there has been a considerable movement on foot in this city for some time in connection with the Greater Dublin Scheme for the whole re-casting of the City of Dublin administration.  This is a general movement not confined to Dublin or Ireland.  Our system of city administration has been found to be inefficient as compared with most of the progressive countries of Europe and America.  That, alone, is one reason why I would be justified, without having regard to the personnel of the Corporation or as to how they are administering their duties, in appointing Commissioners temporarily, in order to have an opportunity of looking into and investigating this question of what system of administration would be the best suited to the city under modern conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the general position. <Col N="1874" /> During the war a situation arose here which was very difficult for the local authorities to meet.  As a result of that situation the rates became very high, and local administration to a great extent became inefficient, apart altogether from the personnel.  For that reason they have a position here in Dublin at the present time, that I believe, no Corporation as at present constituted, would be able to remedy. The question of trying to bring down the rate to a normal figure, a rate which is at the present time paralysing business in the city, is a propositions that I do not believe could be effectively handled by any body situated as the Dublin Corporation was.  That is a difficulty that could not be remedied by an immediate election, even if the personnel were to be changed in that election.  Now, with regard to the Corporation itself&mdash;that body was not by any means perfect.  I think that even Deputy Johnson will be willing to admit that.  We held an inquiry into their conduct and Deputy Johnson complains of what I might call the courtesy of the Inspector in giving them credit for everything that was praiseworthy.  I think our Inspector acted properly, and as I wished him to act in that matter.  But he also called attention to many glaring defects in their administration which certainly justified their abolition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the question of wages.  A person need not be a terrible autocrat to disapprove of the policy of the Corporation in refusing even to meet a deputation of the representatives of the employers to discuss whether or not the exceptionally high wages of the workers in the Dublin Corporation would not be brought down.  Deputy Johnson himself will remember that in the Report my Inspector drew attention to the Stanley Street workshops where extravagant prices were paid for goods that could be acquired at a much more reasonable price from local merchants.  But the general apathy and incapacity of the Corporation i pretty generally admitted.</P>

      <P>As a body he paid a tribute to certain members of the Corporation in acting on Committees, but I do not think that anywhere did he give any particular praise to the Corporation acting as a collective unit.  I might also refer the fact that the Government made available a free grant for the relief of unemployment in Dublin which was very rife at the time, and I consider the action of the Corporation in turning down that grant in the way they did was very callous, and certainly did not justify any commendation from Deputy Johnson or anyone on his side in the Dáil.  Then, as to their action on the question of housing&mdash;the Corporation has been particularly slow in dealing with that exceptionally vital problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>We deny that.  On the whole, I do not think it is necessary to say anything further on that point.  The rates of wages paid to the Corporation workers, with all the other advantages they received, are very much higher than the ordinary rates prevailing in the city, and on that alone Deputy Johnson challenges me to make a statement. I believe that fact alone justified us in taking action.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Deputy Johnson yesterday called attention to a case in the Pembroke Urban Council of some employee who did not get a pension.  This case received particular attention from us, and was the subject of close legal investigation.  Deputy Johnson hauled us over the coals for inquiring into this matter at all.  The reason it was necessary to make a special legal inquiry into it was that it was a matter that did not come under this department.  In the days of the old Local Government Board it was under the jurisdiction of the Lord Lieutenant, and, accordingly, when it <Col N="1876" /> came before us for the first time, it was necessary to have our legal experts make an investigation, and it was necessary to have certain doubts that arose cleared up by the Attorney-General. The Corporation of Dublin has power to grant pensions to employees who have over 20 years' service.  That right was given to them by a special Act of Parliament.  Otherwise employees have no right to get pensions. In England in certain cases employees do get those pensions.  But those pensions are founded on a system of contributory superannuation.  That is the employees themselves contribute towards their final superannuation.  So we are nothing remiss in not paying, seeing that those employees contribute nothing towards the superannuation themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey called attention to the fact that we increased wages in Limerick under the Road Grant.  I think that that was rather an unfair criticism for Deputy Morrissey to make.  I think that that criticism could come better from any benches rather than from the Labour benches. Deputies from the Labour Party have come to me on several occasions seeking to have road wages increased in different areas.  Before we finally fixed on that rate we went very carefully into the matter.  It was fixed, as I said, generally on a standard of about 3s. a week above the agricultural rate of wages; and in the town the rate was based on the standard wages current in the town at the time.  That was the basis on which we went as a general rule.  We did lay down that rule, and so far as we could, we made it a hard and fast rule, but I was prepared, where very good reason was shown, to relax perhaps a little in cases where, owing to exceptional circumstances, the rate we laid down was not altogether equitable.  Deputy Morrissey seemed to leave the impression on our mind that Limerick was the only place in which I increased the rate that was fixed by our Committee.  I think Deputy Morrissey is very well aware that that is not the case.  I increased the rate in the case of Bray, and also in the case of Roscrea, in the Deputy's <Col N="1877" /> own constituency, at his suggestion, or I let it be increased, and in several other cases exceptions were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I might say that I did not raise any objection to the Minister giving an increase in Limerick.  I wanted to find out, if he was going to make it a general increase all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason for making it a general increase.  In the case of Limerick I was appealed to, to have it increased to 50s.&mdash;which is the rate in Cork, and the Limerick people insisted that the same wages that obtained in Cork should obtain in Limerick, because the cost of living is about the same in both places.  I agreed to alter the rate to 47s. 6d.  I can assure Deputy Morrissey that political considerations had nothing to do with giving the concession.  As a matter of fact I delayed longer in the case of Limerick than in any of the other cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin raised a question yesterday with regard to relieving officers. In every case where as a result of amalgamation these officers had become redundant, they had been granted superannuation if they had been whole-time officers.  In cases where they are not whole time officers we have no power to grant them such compensation.  I am not aware of the particular instance to which Deputy Davin refers, and if he states the facts I will be willing to look into it, and consider it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that the particular case I have in mind was before the Minister?  In one case a pension was granted, and in the other the pension was turned down, because the officer was not regarded by the Minister or one of his officials as a full-time officer.  There was no difference between one and the other, and I want to know what is the definition of full-time officer, so that the question of compensation may be rightly decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Off hand I cannot give a definition, but if the Deputy inquires into the case, he will, no doubt, find there was some important difference in the status of the two officers.  Another <Col N="1878" /> point referred to by Deputy Johnson was the Army shaving brush contract. An order for the supply of 15,000 brushes was given to the Belgica-Hibernia Trading Company, Dublin. Their price was much below the other prices, and a guarantee has been obtained that the brushes to be supplied will be free from infection.  I do not think there was any other question raised on the general question of the estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry that Deputy Johnson has asked in this amendment to reduce the amount, because I am a thorough believer in the case of the man who fights and runs away, and his moving in the matter and criticising the action of the Minister in connection with the Dublin Corporation brings it home to me that I am a representative of a Dublin constituency, and I have had to ask myself what is my responsibility in this matter in endeavouring to speak for the people I represent.  I have, perhaps, no great admiration for the Corporation, and as one engaged in business in the City of Dublin, I have often felt grievously inclined to abuse the Corporation roundly and soundly.  That is as far as I am personally concerned, and of course a great many of the business people have taken up that attitude. But on examination of the question of the responsibility of the Corporation in connection with the administration, I have never found that charges levelled against them for maladministration have been proved. The administration of the affairs of the city may, and I think has been, largely responsible for the high rates that we are called upon to pay.  On the other hand, in listening to Deputy Johnson I was convinced that he had made out a strong case that would require a strong answer from the Minister as to why the unusual and extraordinary step was taken of suppressing a representative body like the Dublin Corporation. The members of the Corporation may not represent my views, but they have been elected by the majority, and I suppose they are a democratic body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action of the Ministry in suppressing them seems to me to have <Col N="1879" /> been extreme, and, as Deputy Johnson said, on the face of it the case as reported in the Press did not seem to call for such a drastic and unusual action, and for such a very contentious decision as the Minister has arrived at.  I, therefore, have to judge my sense of responsibility in this matter as a Dublin representative, and if this goes to a vote I am afraid, notwithstanding that I have no wish whatsoever to do so&mdash; my inclination is to support the Government in every possible way&mdash;that on the merits of the case as it appears before the Dáil there will be no alternative for me but to vote for the amendment as a condemnation of the somewhat hasty and, I think, ill-advised action by the Minister in this matter. I have tried to show to the Dáil the difficulty I find myself in.  Three Commissioners have been appointed to administer the affairs of the Corporation. I believe that three Commissionsers operating and going closely into matters will find that the administration of the city can be carried on more economically than it has been in the past. That is beside the question.  The big question that arises is, are the Government going to deal in this arbitrary fashion with Boards without, at all events, justifying their action in a better way than the Minister has been able, as far as I can see, to justify their action in connection with the suppression of the Corporation?  I am not going to say anything more than that. I have discharged the responsibility.  I feel that I have as a member representing Dublin.  I have disclaimed any partiality for the Corporation, and I have tried to show that in voting with Deputy Johnson&mdash;personally, perhaps, I should rather vote against him&mdash; my conviction is that fundamentally the expression of opinion he has put before the Dáil is a right one, and that in travelling on the road that this action by the Minister initiates, we are travelling on very dangerous road, and that certainly is a course that I think the people of the country as a whole will not endorse.</P>

      <P>I, as an interested party, would be wise if I said nothing, fearing I would be expected to give a one-sided view of this matter.  I only <Col N="1880" /> wish to reply to a few points made by the Minister.  May I say, as regards members of the Dublin Corporation, that in many matters politically, I differ with probably the majority of them; but, on the whole, I must certainly say of that body that I have found a good type of men and women in it anxious and willing at all times to do their best in the interests of the city.  Sometimes, and I think this weighs more with the Government than anything else, I had reason to complain myself that the Corporation gave a little too much time to politics. The Government recognise that the Corporation, to a certain extent, has been a public platform for their political rivals.  Very many resolutions emanated from that body&mdash;resolutions which, I think, did good work for the city recently, resolutions asking for the release of the prisoners, proper treatment of the prisoners, examination of the jails, inspection by our Medical Officer&mdash;all these probably the Government have taken into consideration, and not the Inspector's report.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that this motion before the Dáil is a controversial one.  It merely asks for a return that will be very useful to the Dáil and useful to the country, as a whole, in considering and in coming to any decision that they may have to come to in relation to local government. It is a return which will put us in the position of being able to compare the work done by the different local bodies and the position in which they stand with regard to the collection of rates and finance generally.  I believe also that it will be very useful in many ways in relation to the question of this Bill proposed by the Minister for Agriculture this morning for the relief of rates.  I therefore content myself with formally moving the motion.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to speak at any great length upon this, because I think the Bill has killed itself. I approach this Town Tenants Bill from the point of view of the great scarcity of houses existing all over Ireland. Should this Town Tenants Bill go through, the situation would be even worse than it is, because, as I pointed out when I was last speaking on the subject, should this go through there would be no landlord who would be inclined to let a house to a tenant. And it is because I am interested in housing that I would oppose this Bill from that point of view.  There is a clause in the Bill, too, which is very objectionable and which will lead to endless trouble between landlord and <Col N="1882" /> tenant, and it is this: In the Bill a tenant will have the right to compel his landlord to come along and do certain repairs, and sometimes, as you know, tenant and landlord fall out, and they are not on friendly terms; and the tenant may demand a very unreasonable repair to his house, and if the landlord refuses, that tenant, according to the Bill, can bring in an outside contractor and get the work done, and send the bill on to his landlord.  That will lead to endless friction between landlord and tenant.  It is a very objectionable clause.  No good landlord will allow his house to go into disrepair or go into ruin.  To my mind, it is quite unnecessary to put in a clause of that kind, for any landlord, who will want his house to exist and to be a source of income to him, will not allow it to go into such ruin and disrepair that a clause of that kind will be needed.</P>
      <P>I would support a Bill that would include tenants, such as those who would have started a business, and from their energy and ability would have built up a business there and made it a very valuable house.  I certainly would support a measure that would safeguard a tenant of that kind, that would give him an interest in that house, so that if the landlord or the owner wanted to dispossess him, he would be recompensed for the ability that he had displayed and the work that he had done in making the house more valuable than it had been when he got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons spoke about certain tenants that he knew whose rents were increased from 5s. to £1 5s.  Deputy Lyons would want you to believe that all tenants were absolutely perfect, and landlords quite the reverse.  Well, I should like to say something that I know about tenants.  I happen to be chairman of a certain council, and under that council there are 750 tenants. In pre-war days the houses of these tenants were let at very low rents, absolutely as low as possible.  In the course of time, with the increased cost of repairs and other things, the Council found that there was a deficit yearly of between £2,000 and £3,000, and they thought that it was only reasonable to ask those tenants to bear their part of the burden.  They did not like to put <Col N="1883" /> all the burden on the tenants, and they said: &ldquo;We will divide the difference.&rdquo; The councillors thought that it would be well to divide the deficit, and they said: &ldquo;We will not put it as an increase of rent; we will simply ask the tenants to pay the amount represented by the increase in rates.&rdquo;  Those 750 houses are not all of one type.  The rents vary from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. and 4s. 6d., and so on; and the increase that we were asking them to pay would, in the case of the cheaper houses, only amount to 5d. or 7d. or 9d., and so on.  It was not looked upon as an increase of rent at all; it was an amount equal to the advance in rates, and the council were prepared to go half in the deficit.  I am speaking of the facts.  A deputation of three was appointed to wait on these tenants, and we certainly thought that they would jump at a thing like that, because it was so reasonable.  They turned that proposal down and they would not accept it, they would not pay any increase, they would consider the matter in three months' time; and for six months they never paid a penny to that council, and to-day they owe £6,000.  We hear about profiteering. What did we discover amongst those tenants who refused to pay a paltry sum equal to the amount of the increase of rates?  We found that where they had houses themselves, and the whole house at a rent of 6s. or 6s. 6d. a week, and where there was a small family who could afford to let a room, they had rooms let at 7s. and 10s. a week each.</P>
    <P>A good deal can be said on both sides.  Perhaps there are bad landlords, and I think there are also bad tenants.  Something must be done, and I think it is a great mistake to introduce a Bill of this kind, because it will not lead us where we would like to get.  As I have said, the great cry to-day is for more houses, and a thing like this will certainly put a damper on house building.  I would also say that these Rent Restrictions Acts and all those things will prevent house-building. What would regulate the market would be to allow a free hand to speculative builders and people who <Col N="1884" /> would be inclined to put their money into house property.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Bill, and I do so in advocacy of this fair rent court which Deputy Redmond seeks.  I do not agree with everything in the Bill, but I believe in asking for a fair rent court at which the landlord, the tenant, and the State will be represented.  Such a court would mean fair play, and surely no Government and no landlord will object to fair play.  I do not wish to put any block on the progress of building.  I speak against the existence of what I describe as a tyranny, poor people being forced to live in insanitary houses and men allowed to draw rent from them, which is against Christainity and humanity. The landlord simply takes the rent, is invited in by the tenant, and he can see nothing wrong with the house. There is no sanitation about the place, nothing but misfortune, and through want of proper housing the poor tenant is compelled to live under these circumstances. Consumptives are being taken out of some of these houses away to the sanatorium, or in coffins, and the houses are then criminally let to those who perhaps do not know what was there before them, and the result is danger to the incoming family, every one of whom may be stricken down by that dread disease in a short time.  This is the class of house that I have risen to speak against, and that is the class of landlord that I condemn.  If men are afraid to build houses there is nothing to prevent the State from saying that this Bill should not apply to future houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A licence might be granted which would safeguard those who would build decent houses and let them at reasonable rents.  But the houses that the poor people in the villages and towns are forced to live in at present are a disgrace to Ireland; they are a shame to the country, with no sanitation, no comforts and no improvements. The landlord will not spend a penny on them, and, worse still, the sanitary authority will not compel him to do anything.  There is one provision in the Local Government Bill regarding the appointment of independent doctors <Col N="1885" /> which everyone will welcome.  Everyone would welcome an independent doctor or an engineer who would inspect the premises.  There is nobody to look after them at present for various reasons.  Another point is the right of pre-emption.  If a landlord is about to sell a house and the tenant has sufficient money to purchase, I think that the tenant should have a preference in purchasing that house.  I do not endorse everything that is in the Bill; I am merely trying to put forward what I think it would be very hard for the Government to refuse, and that is fair play to the tenants as well as to the landlord.  That could be meted out to both by an independent court set up by the State.  As we know, proper housing is vital to the lives of the people, because upon their comforts and upon their sanitary surroundings depend the people's health and the health of their children&mdash;never mind their wives.  I think that it is mandatory on the Government to provide that any such obstacles as those in the way of rearing up people who would be able to compete in the future Tailteann Games should be removed immediately. If you want good men you must have good houses and rear the children in healthy surroundings.  I take my courage in both hands, and I ask Deputy Redmond to withdraw almost everything in the Bill if the Government would adopt the fair rent court and the right of pre-emption.  The Local Government Bill, although it passed its Second Reading, has gone to Limbo for a bit, and you would make a very good Coalition Bill if you were to combine the independent doctor in that Bill with the fair rent court and the right of pre-emption, and clear out the remainder of Deputy Redmond's Bill.  If the Government would adopt these three essentials I think we would have a good Town Tenants Bill.</P>

      <P>If the suggestion that Deputy Daly made to Deputy Redmond is acted on, I do not know how much of this Bill we would have for discussion.  I, too, would take the line that Deputy Daly has taken, not in support of the Bill, but against it.  I, too, would ask Deputy Redmond to get a scissors and cut the Bill, beginning at line 39 and ending after Section <Col N="1886" /> 4 or Section 5, and then I think we would support it.  This Bill, in my opinion, would not only kill the building of houses at present, but would put in his coffin, screw down and bury the speculator in the building of houses for all time.</P>

      <P>If we want to have houses for future generations the only alternative to doing away with private speculators is to build by means of State funds.  You must either have the private speculator or the State.  Must the houses for the future be erected by the State?  Is that the proposition of Deputy Redmond?  Is that the real meaning of this Bill, or its effect?  If it will not be done by the State, if private enterprise is to have a chance, what is the meaning of this Bill, and what is the meaning of Section 2? There are grievances; everybody knows that town tenants have grievances, more grievances in the country than in the cities.  All the towns and villages in the country are old and have been erected, practically speaking, by the occupiers.  The property in most cases has been put up and improved by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case certainly exists for granting compensation to those people for any improvements they have effected, but a different state of affairs altogether exists in Dublin and its townships and some of the cities, where the whole property has been put up by people who build houses&mdash;speculators, landlords, call them whatever you like.  I call those people public benefactors, and I will continue to describe as such, those who are prepared to build.  Comparison has been made between this Bill and the Land Acts.  What is the actual comparison and what are the facts?  Land Courts were set up to deal with land cases sometime in the early eighties or earlier. Those Land Courts were to take into consideration those who effected improvements&mdash;that is to say, those who put up the buildings, who did the drainage and the fencing, who perfected the approaches, and credit was given to whoever did these things. <Col N="1887" /> whether it was the landlord or the tenant. In cases where the landlord did those things, rent was charged on the land in proportion to the value of the improvements he made, whether building, drainage, or fencing.  Anything the tenant did was put to his credit, and that was the groundwork of the Land Acts.  What is the groundwork of the propositions in this Bill?  It is to set aside whoever did the work and created the property, and give no compensation whatsoever to the men who put up the property, and did the work.  Section 2 begins: &ldquo;The tenant of every holding to which this Act applies, notwithstanding any provisions in the contract of tenancy to the contrary.&rdquo;  Whoever would stand over what is contained in lines 2 and 3 would, to my mind, be devoid of any semblance of equity and fair play.  We go on here to sub-section (4), clause 2, and we find that the landlord's interest in this property is valued at not less than 10 or not more than 15 years' purchase.  Now, we come down to sub-section (3), section 3, when the tenant's interest comes to be valued, and we also find the same value&mdash;not less than 10 or not more than 15.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to deal with this Bill, if we cannot deal with it as it is printed.  If we have to deal with somebody else's interpretation of the Bill, it is a different matter. I understood we were giving a Second Reading to the Bill, and not a Second Reading to Deputy Redmond's speech. I am trying to get along with what is in front of me, and I find it difficult to get on.  Apart from that, I come to the figures in sub-section (6) to Section 3.  I find the very same figures here for the buying out of ground rents.  It reminds me very much of the old method we had long ago in a publichouse of calling for &ldquo;the same again.&rdquo;  Here in this Bill it is the &ldquo;same again,&rdquo; also.</P>

      <P>The Bill appears to me to be a boozers' Bill.  I do not know what was in the minds of the people who framed it.  That is what I am trying to get at.  Does any sensible man stand up here and say that if a speculator builds a house, finds a tenant for it, and in five or six months time his tenant says: &ldquo;I want not less than 10 years' purchase for my interest,&rdquo; if the speculator wants to get it back, he must pay that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find great difficulty in agreeing with any sentence in the Bill.  The Bill is so bad that I do not think a decent Bill could be made out of it.  The correct thing to do is, I think, to kill the Bill and give us one that the times demand and that a case can be made for.  I see here &ldquo;long leases&rdquo; and &ldquo;unexpired leases, either for lives or <Col N="1889" /> for a term of years.&rdquo;  Those tenancies are not to come into the courts.  Statutory obligations in that connection are to hold; statutory obligations in regard to other classes of tenancies are not to hold.  It seems to me they want to have it both ways in this Bill.  I do not think in justice they can have it both ways. If statutory obligations are good in an-one sense they ought to be good in another; if bad in one sense they ought to be bad in another.  I suggest to Deputy Redmond that he should withdraw the Bill and put up one that we can support. I recognise that town tenants, especially down the country, have just grievances that must be met.  The man who improves property ought to get 100 per cent. compensation for anything he has done.  I cannot, however, stand over a Bill of this description that is not right in equity, justice, or anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I voted against a Bill, many of the provisions of which I approved of.  I voted against it because the general purpose of it was to centralise local government in a bureaucracy.  There are many things very objectionable in this Bill, but the general intention of it is to protect the interests of tenants in towns, to set up Fair Rent Courts to prevent the rapacity of landlords who show rapaciousness, and to enable the tenants of houses, shops, and other establishments to have fixity of tenure.  For these reasons I intend to support the Second Reading.  The general feeling of the Dáil, I think, is that there should be established Fair Rent Courts for town tenants and that occupants of houses and shops should have fixity of tenure. I am against speculation in land or in habitations.  It is, I think, a bad practice and an evil principle to legislate on the assumption that land can be played with in markets and bought and sold for profit, or that houses can be played with in the same way.  We know, as a matter of fact, that very many people in towns, as well as in cities, find themselves in the position, having entered into a tenancy, established a business and made the property valuable, that the landlord evicts them or demands a very much higher rental, not for any value he has created, but purely as a closure upon the values that other <Col N="1890" /> people have created.  We have evidence that very many people are simply waiting in the hope that something may be done to protect occupants of houses, and more particularly of shops, from the confiscation that so many Deputies are afraid of when it comes to confiscation by a public authority for the public good.  Here is threatened confiscation purely in the interests of private landlords. That, I think, is a practice that ought to be legislated against, and there is some attempt to do that in this Bill.  The question of fair rents is also attempted to be dealt with, and provision is made for the establishment of courts for the fixing of fair rents. That I do not think is at the moment so urgent as it was two or three years ago, except in regard to business premises. Nevertheless, there is need in those cases for a Fair Rent Court so that some equity can be established between the landlord who is attempting to extract the last farthing in a competitive market and a tenant who is bound by his necessity for a living to continue his occupation of a particular premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reason that the Bill does make some attempt to move in that direction I am going to support the Second Reading.  But there are defects in the Bill even from the point of view of fixity of tenure.  I find, unfortunately, that the Bill is drafted so as to exclude from its provisions the great majority of the people who might be termed town tenants.  In Section 1, for instance, I find (I am dealing now with the case of the weekly tenant of a house) that the tenant shall not be compelled to quit his holding except in consequence of a breach of certain conditions. The first condition which he must not break, on pain of being compelled to quit, is that he shall pay his rent at the appointed time.  I suggest to those responsible for the Bill that that simply says to every weekly tenant, &ldquo;If you fail to pay at the beginning of every week, then the protection that this Bill is intended to confer will not apply to you.&rdquo;  Nearly every tenant of a weekly holding is supposed by the terms of his agreement to pay in advance, but he seldom does.  If he fails to pay his weekly rent on the <Col N="1891" /> Monday morning, then he is no longer protected by the provisions of Section 1.  That in itself proves that the interests of the householder are not the primary interests thought of in the drafting of this Bill, but rather the interests of the shopkeeper and business premises occupier.  The provisions of Section 2 and the consequential sections have been criticised very severely, and very rightly criticised.  I think they are quite impossible, but I am not criticising from the point of view of the landlord.  I am criticising them from the point of view of the tenant.</P>
    <P>I say the effect of Section 2 would be, simply, to impose on all the present occupiers of houses the liability to pay compensation, if ever they wanted to remove.  For instance, if a person lost his employment in Dublin, and had to seek it in Cork, it is impossible to get a house in Cork without paying £10,£20, £30, £40, £50 or £150 to the occupying tenant.  As a matter of fact, this section of the Bill should appeal to the economic sense of Deputy Hewat, and Deputy Good particularly, and also to Deputies who are so insistent on the rights of private property.  Here you have an attempt to create new properties for the benefit of the individual. Deputy Good and Deputy Hewat should be delighted to support a Bill of this kind.  I have a record here of a resolution that was supported by Deputy Hewat which testifies to the accuracy of my contention.  Deputy Hewat suggested that an inquiry should be instituted into the possibility of solving the housing problem by utilising the State's inherent right to control and issue credit.  The Bill is founded on the assumption that occupancy of houses and premises creates the value. That is, that the demand for premises and houses creates the value.  Deputy Hewat, and I assume that Deputy Good thinks with him in this matter, obviously takes the line that it is the occupier creates the value because, as I say, he suggested the Government should make this inquiry into the possibility of utilising the State's inherent right to control and issue credit.  The whole philosophy behind the resolution, which the Deputy supported so <Col N="1892" /> eloquently in opposition to this Bill, was strongly at variance with his speech.  This section in the Bill is based on the assumption that it is the occupier who creates the value, and that, therefore, it is to the occupier compensation should be paid.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not differentiate as to the amount of value which the occupier is supposed to have created. If he has been in occupation for one month he has created as much value as if he was there for twenty years.  When Deputy Lyons and other Deputies gave illustrations of persons who had occupied houses for many years, and paid rent upon rent without being any nearer ownership of the houses, I sympathised, but unfortunately that view is not embodied in any way in this Bill. A person who occupied a house for three days is in an equally good position with the person who occupied a house for forty years.</P>
    <P>I object to the second section also, because quite apart from the amount of compensation, which Deputy Redmond is now inclined to throw over, this section says that the tenant of every holding shall be entitled to sell his interest.  That is, to go directly contrary to the Act we passed last year prohibting the right to demand key money.  In view of the present and future shortage of houses, key money simply means that the person who is better off is going to have all the advantages against the person who is less well off.  Key money is to be perpetuated by the adoption in this Bill of Section 2, quite apart from any question of the amount of compensation the tenant is entitled to sell his interest for.  I think that is entirely wrong.  I do not think the tenant, by mere occupancy, has a saleable interest in his holding.  On the other hand, I think if he is to be removed by the landlord he is entitled to be recompensed for removal, or preferably that he should not be allowed to be removed except with his consent.  The Bill, in its effects, would be unfortunate for that very large number of people who are tenement dwellers in Dublin and other cities.  I put it to Deputy Redmond, <Col N="1893" /> what is to be the position of these persons? Supposing a great acceleration in the house building schemes of the Government came to pass, and that the tenement dwellers might look forward to the occupation of houses, there would be a general movement from house to house.  Houses that were hitherto occupied would be available for tenement occupiers to remove into.  Unfortunately the Bill simply says to the tenement dweller:&ldquo;Unless you can find key money or compensation money to purchase the existing tenant's interest we are not going to allow you to get out of your tenement.&rdquo;  That in itself, I say, is a blot on this Bill.  I do not know whether it is Deputy Redmond or Deputy Lyons, when collaborating in the production of this Bill, who is responsible for this particular section.  There is evidence throughout the Bill, I think, of collaboration.  I am sorry to see that so much of this Bill seems to be badly drafted, and in its present form is not worthy of being passed without considerable amendment or alteration. However, I feel that it is desirable we should indicate that we believe in the general intention of establishing fair rent courts and giving fixity of tenure to town tenants.  If it does nothing more then tell the Government that it is its duty to bring forward a measure of this kind, and to do it quickly, the Dáil will be justified in giving the Bill a Second Reading.  To adopt a phrase of the President, let us give it a conditional Second Reading.  I have no doubt that that is a procedure that may have to be adopted on many occasions. It is something novel, and perhaps one of these accidental strokes of genius that might be applied to this case.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil, on the lines I have indicated, to support the Second Reading of this Bill, conditional upon Sections 2 and 3 being dropped, and conditional upon the Government, not after a Commission has sat, producing a Bill to establish fair rent courts and to give fixity of tenure to tenants of town holdings.</P>

      <P>I regret, as one who has an interest in housing and in the building <Col N="1894" /> of houses, that for the credit and dignity of this Dáil this measure should ever have been introduced into it.  I agree entirely with the criticism of the Minister for Justice on this measure when he stated, in a sentence, that the Bill was an attempt to legalise the confiscation of property.  The Minister proceeded to argue, and I think argued correctly, that housing is an investment.  If we want houses, and I take it the view of Deputies is that we ought to do all in our power in view of the crisis that we are faced with, then we ought to encourage the building of houses.  The only argument that we can use in order to encourage those who have money to put it into houses is that it is a safe investment. Now, in view of this Bill, and the drastic terms of it, can anybody say or urge that housing is a safe investment? Why, I ask, should housing as an investment be treated differently to any other investment?  We are all agreed, I think, with the Minister for Justice when he said that housing is an investment, and that is the only basis on which we can encourage housing. Having settled that point as a preliminary, the next question I ask is, why should housing be treated, as an investment, differently to any other investment?  The Minister of Finance some months ago called for a national Loan, which, I am glad to say, was largely over-subscribed.  If the Minister for Finance were to say to the people who invested money in the National Loan: &ldquo;I have received your money, and I am now going to make a claim on that money, and I tell you if you want to sell that you can only sell to me.  The price I will give you for your interest in it is not less than ten years, and not more than fifteen years' purchase&rdquo;&mdash;it is an easy matter to figure out what the Minister for Finance would pay on that basis to those who invested money in the loan.  This Bill attempts to legalise procedure of that kind. There is no difference between investing money in house property and investing money in the National Loan or in any other security that you like.  It is an investment.  This Bill attempts <Col N="1895" /> to give to the person with whom the money is invested the right to purchase the principal at a sum not less than 10 years' purchase and not more than 15 years' purchase.  Would anybody, supposing the Minister had to issue a further loan and that he had confiscated the property of the investors in the first loan on a basis similar to this Bill, invest any more money in a further loan?  Would anybody, even a member of this Dáil, be inclined to invest money in a further issue?  On that basis I hold that it is a fair and reasonable argument.  If this method is adopted for confiscating investments in house property, will anybody invest a penny in house property after this Bill goes through? Would anybody, I ask, invest in the National Loan if the same treatment had been adopted?  Nobody would. Then we are agreed on this conclusion, that this Bill will kill housing as an investment.  If we cannot get the public to invest in houses, if it is not safe for them to do so, the only alternative is for the Government to invest in houses.  But, I ask, will the Government invest in houses?  Again, I ask have any of the Deputies here ever considered that problem or the magnitude of it?  I say as one who knows a little about this question that the problem is beyond the ability of any Government to solve.  Governments much stronger financially than ours have found that such a problem is beyond the ability of any Government to solve, so the conclusion is that the alternative is not a practical solution of the difficulty.  We are forced back then on the original question of how you can make investment in house property a safe and profitable investment.  Houses are urgently needed, not alone for the working classes but for all other classes, because, recollect, houses are decaying property and must be renewed.  They do not stand in perpetuity, and there must be a certain number of houses built each year if we are to keep up even to the present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I say that we must move along a different line altogether to the line proposed in this Bill.  This Bill, I hold, is going to kill any further investment in house property.  There can <Col N="1896" /> be no doubt whatever about that, and I do not want to press the argument any further.  The Rent Restriction Act, and the other measures passed recently, have had the effect of tieing up the hands of those who invested money in houses, and have tended to depress house property as a security.  If we want to build houses we must get rid of all these troubles, and we must inspire confidence in those who have money to invest in houses.  That is the line, and the only line, along which we will be successful.  Therefore, I say that even the consideration of such a Bill as this is has done an infinite amount of damage.</P>

      <P>I wish as briefly as I can just to give the views of the members sitting on these benches. Deputy Gorey asked me to mention that when he spoke he spoke only for himself, and I am supposed to be the exponent of the views of the Deputies sitting here near me.  We contend that this Bill, in some respects, can be supported.  We say there is nothing revolutionary in the doctrine that fixity of tenure should be given to the occupying tenant.  We agree with that doctrine, but we disagree with Section 2 for the reasons given by Deputy Johnson and also by reason of the fact that the restriction of Rents Act forbids the owner to raise the rent, and forbids him to take advantage of the scarcity of houses.  We think that the tenant should also be forbidden to get advantage from the scarcity of houses, because if there were plenty of houses he could not ask for key money.  It was the war brought about the scarcity of supply, and the tenant should be debarred from taking advantage of it.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to the question raised by Deputy Good, I would point out to the Deputy that men investing in house property do not merely get 5 per cent. for their money; they get from 7½ to 10 per cent. for their money on an average.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And I might point out that it would be very easy to change the number of years purchase from 15 to 20.  We are reasonable people; I can <Col N="1897" /> see nothing wrong in giving the occupying tenants the right of pre-emption; that is not revolutionary.  It is freedom. I know houses that were purchased in the city of Dublin in pre-war days for £300 and that were let for £40.  The rent was increased under the Rent Restrictions Act up to £50, and, under this Bill, if such a house was sold at 12 years' purchase it would realise £600. There is nothing confiscatory in that. Deputy Good can contradict that statement if he likes, but I know it is a fact. Clause 1 we stand by, but Clause 2 we do not stand by.  We agree with Clause 3, and Clause 4 is covered by existing legislation.  There is no such thing at the present time as raising rent; no one can do that until 1926.</P>

      <P>But there is the question of disturbances under the Rent Restrictions Act.  Clause 4 brings in the provision that fair rents may be fixed. Rents cannot be raised until 1926, and I am sure the Government will see to the condition of things then, and will make the necessary changes in the law if required.  For these reasons, and without occupying any further time, I say we agree to give this Bill a conditional Second Reading, on the understanding that the pre-emption clause will be amended, that clause 2 will be obliterated, and that clause 4 will be amended.</P>

      <P>Many years ago, when I was editor of a monthly review called the &ldquo;Lyceum,&rdquo; we published a series of three sonnets in one issue by the late Dr. W.P. Coyne.  Unfortunately&mdash;for accidents of this sort happen even in the best regulated printing establishments&mdash;the headings got interchanged, and what ought to have been a sonnet on Millais' Angelus was headed a sonnet on quite another topic, and it had to be explained to some readers in the next issue that it was a printer's mistake. A little later another sonnet appeared, and some inquisitive reader wanted to know if it also was a certain sonnet or whether it was a printer's error.  I am reminded of that little bit of autobiographical incident by the strictures of <Col N="1898" /> Deputy Johnson on the present Bill. He has discovered that it is not merely as regards Section 2 a printer's mistake, but that practically the Bill is a huge printer's mistake.  As I mentioned Deputy Johnson, perhaps I may, for the sake of artificial unity, pursue the line that he followed.  I am not quite sure that he really holds that the fact that a tenant occupies a house adds a value to that house which hitherto it did not possess.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson lived too long in Belfast not to know the pleasant ways of the speculative builder in that beautifully progressive city.  A road of little houses is run up hurriedly.  The character of the building is represented by the comment that the dweller in one of these houses can hear the lodger in the next houses changing his mind.  I know actually, though I do not expect it to be believed, that a man who had drunk too much collided with one of those rows of buildings, on a certain Saturday night, and knocked down three of the houses.  He was not an auctioneer. These houses were run up hurriedly in the most approved form of jerry building. Tenants were inveigled into them, some by paying no rent, and after they were all occupied, and blinds and curtains on the windows, they were auctioned as being in occupation of most desirable tenants.  The unwary buyer, when he came to collect his rents afterwards, discovered that there was no contract for rent.  Now, undoubtedly the occupation of a house by a tenant does add a great deal, to its selling value, and if he is a desirable tenant it will add enormously to it because he will attract others to the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is more, he usually makes improvements. Though it is alleged there is no parity between the occupant of a farm and the occupant of a house, I think when you come to consider improvments, where there are improvements, that there is a measure of parallelism which must not be ignored. It is possible, more particularly in the case of a shop, for the occupier to acquire, or it ought to be <Col N="1899" /> possible for the occupier to acquire, a saleable interest.  Deputy Good spoke in defence of the speculative builders. There are speculative builders and speculative builders.  There are those of the type I have spoken of who are notorious in Belfast.  There are others in the better sense of the word who build houses by way of investment, or build houses for investors to let to tenants in the normal course of business, but that is very often accompanied by an evil.  This building is in conjunction with building estates.  The building estate is a piece of ground which is to be exploited.  The consequence is that the space allotted for human habitation will be limited by consideration of the profits that can be extracted; the size of the house, the size of the rooms of the house will be limited in view of that.</P>
    <P>The amount of land, if not the backyard or garden, will be conditioned by that, and you can have hopeless congestion with invitation to disease and immorality.  You can have the warrens of the poor created in the name of speculative building and the development of eligible building estates.  In connection with the building estates there is also the infarmous leasehold system.  Is it fair to a man who has created business in a district, by opening a shop, and who brings others there who also open shops in other lines of business, and develops what had been a backward little quarter of a city or a town into a business centre, that the value that accrues to the neighbourhood should be altogether the house-owner's, and that the community whose joint action, and the occupiers of the shops whose enterprise contributed so largely to the creation of this value should have no share in it whatsoever?  There has been talk about confiscation.  Undoubtedly in Section 2 of the Bill, perhaps by a printer's mistake, there is confiscation naked and unashamed, but let us not forget that there is confiscation secret, but not necessarily ashamed, confiscation of a most indefensible kind of values that belong to the municipality or the community and not to the individual house owner.  One of the most infamous things sanctioned by law and by custom at the present day <Col N="1900" /> is the fact that a man becomes a tenant of a house or a shop for a term of 25 years, let us say, and the conditions of his tenancy set down in the contract are that at the end of 25 years he is to re-build the whole front and to expend not less than £1,000 on improvements and his rent will then be increased by £275 a year or £300 a year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good talks about the inhibition of building enterprise.  What about the restriction of development and enterprise due to that?  If there were something in this Bill that dealt with some reformation of the leasehold system I should commend it.  But to my amazement, when I read the Bill, the very people who are exempted from the operation of the Bill are the leaseholders. That I confess is a First Reading amazement, for when I read it the second time I realised that the framers of the Bill intended to break such contracts as I have illustrated, and their purpose was to instal, at the termination of his lease, a leaseholder on the new conditions set up by the Bill, so that that merely postponed relief to the leaseholder rather than denied it to him altogether.  Such a proposal to break contracts must be very shocking to Deputies in this Dáil.  The law is so sacred and the traditional rights are so reverent!  I say this, not in support of the Bill as it at present stands, but in support of the spirit which I detect as having led to the production of it.  The spirit indeed was willing but the hand of the draftsman was weak.  The intention I think was sound; it was to reform obvious and glaring abuses.  There is one thing also that inspires the Bill to which Deputy Good is altogether deaf.  That is the nature of a house as a home.  Deputy Good asked the question directly: is there any difference between a house as an investment and National Loan? It seems to me the answer to that is exceedingly easy.  There is an enormous difference.  I quite agree that thrift should find an outlet for investment in house property equally with any other property.  I believe, contrary to Deputy Johnson, in the rights of private property but I do not believe in any divine right of private property to do what it likes to the community. We speak of those rights nakedly as <Col N="1901" /> if they were unconditional and absolute when they are really limited and conditioned by the relations in which all the individuals stand to each other and the duties that arise with respect to others out of these relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson and I disagree, perhaps, on the fundamental point, but as regards collaterals we are agreed.  There is a vast difference between my becoming a hirer, say, of a piano on the hire system, and becoming a hirer of a house as a tenant, because there is the natural instinct to convert that house into a home, and certain affections and sentiments begin to arise with regard to the bare walls.</P>
      <P>No Irishman needs to be told of that, when we realise how hard it was to evict tenants by brutal force from wretched hovels that were not fit for the habitation even of a dog.  There is that natural sentiment, furthermore&mdash; the desire of the man to transmit his house, which he has improved and with which he has family associations, to his children and their children. That sentiment can be rudely cut across by the owner saying: &ldquo;I own the house, and I will do what I like with my own.  You must go unless you pay me increased rent, because certain people have begun to covet the house,&rdquo; seeing how beautified and improved it has been by this tenant who loves it as a home.  Those are abuses, and those abuses should not be permitted to flourish any longer than can be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson rightly remembered the parallel between the agricultural labourer and the ordinary wandering pursuer of trade, who goes from place to place to find his occupation.  There was a time when the agricultural labourer was, if anything, worse than the serf of the medieval period, because if he was to have employment with anything like constancy and any hope for the education of his growing children, he was obliged to live where he could get a roof near the employing landlord's estate.  And the noble landlord, not infrequently, took advantage of his necessity and paid him what he pleased in return for that accommodation. It was impossible for the man <Col N="1902" /> to improve or for his children to have access to the facilities of improvement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, he was bound to that estate as much as if he were one of the trees rooted in its soil.  Deputy Wilson remembers the great service done to civilisation and freedom in this country by the Agricultural Labourers Act, which provided decent homes for casual workers as distinguished from small farmers.  We have all seen with unspeakable satisfaction the enormous improvement in the country side in the last 25 or 30 years.  Anyone who goes along the country roads on Sunday will see well-dressed, well-cared, happy-looking children, and will see people with a decent sense of self-respect, because they are living human lives under distinctly human conditions.  Why is the town dweller to be obliged to live in squalid back streets and worse&mdash; noisome lanes&mdash;and have no pride in his home?  We lecture about patriotism and civic duty and a sense of civic responsibility and, at the same time, we are willing to sentence hundreds of thousands of city dwellers to conditions of living that make it an absolute impossibility for them to develop not merely civic pride, but home sense or anything that belongs to decent civilisation. So long as there are those facts, to which we are all unfortunately only too much alive, I sympathise with the town tenant advocate who, aware of these evils, vaguely and blindly strives after some measure of amelioration, tries to formulate a Bill which, if carried into law, would make life better for so many people, would give security of tenure to the decent family who are willing to pay a decent rent for the house they occupy, to turn it into a home and to make it a better asset if, at any time, it comes about the they have to leave it and transfer to others.  But this Bill does not satisfy the requirements.  This Bill sins, as Deputy Johnson pointed out, both by excess and defect.  It attempts to do what it should not do.  It reminds me of the confession in the prayer book: &ldquo;We have done, and that which we ought not to have done, and we have left that undone which we ought to have done.&rdquo; If Deputy Redmond would withdraw his Bill and allow a measure animated by the same beneficent spirit but more <Col N="1903" /> carefully drafted, to be brought in, I think the House and the country would be willing to concede that in ventilating this question in the way he and the backers of the Bill have done, they have done a decided service to the State.</P>
