      <P>I hope I have made it clear that in my remarks I am not objecting in any way to an increase in the resources of University College, Dublin, or the National University of Ireland.  But I am thinking of the work which is to be done in the country both by Trinity College, Dublin, and by the National University.  I do feel that the proposals outlined by the Minister may have a very serious effect upon the work carried out by Trinity College, Dublin.  That work is, I agree with the Minister for Agriculture, in the educational way small, but I feel that there should be an important future ahead.  Besides educational work there is research work, and it is about that I am particularly uneasy. I believe that these proposals may be carried out without doing this injury which I fear.  I believe that discussion between the different bodies involved would in all probability enable a satisfactory arrangement on these lines to be effected without affecting at all the question of whether this proposal can be carried out in such a way as to increase the resources of the National University.  Now, those who have argued on one side seem to be of opinion that the injury which I fear can be avoided out of the present resources of Trinity College, Dublin. With great deference to the judgments and opinions of those who have spoken in that way I venture to say that I know more about the resources of Trinity College than they do.  Their means of getting information upon the matter have not always been the fullest. It is possible to learn a great deal, no doubt, from reports of previous commissions, but I do say that it is not possible to learn anything of value from the opinions that are expressed by different people, whether they happen to be graduates of our institution or not.  It is really only very few who know intimately the state of the finances of Trinity College, Dublin. It is quite true that it is not now the case that our accounts are in any way <Col N="1728" /> hidden.  They have to be submitted to the Government year by year in the future, and it is quite right that that should be so.  When once an institution becomes State-aided, it must necessarily submit to that, and it would not, and in this case does not, object to that at all.  In the very letter from which extracts were read there is contained that clause specifying that in future years the accounts of Trinity College, Dublin, must be submitted to the Government, and that is not objected to on our side, and it will be done.  Furthermore, I am perfectly prepared, for my part, to go through those accounts with any Ministers who are anxious to clear up any points that may not be clear if there be such, and to argue with them as to whether there is this possibility which they seem to contemplate in our resources.  Beyond that, I should not think there would be the slightest objection to any inquiry the Government may think fit to institute as to whether those resources are being used to the full or not.  I think it is perfectly right that a Government should consider the total resources of all institutions which seek for aid, to see that those resources are being used in the best and fullest way, even though, as in this particular instance, they can only, to a comparatively small extent, be said to be resources which have come from the State.  The question still remains: Is university development in this country to take place upon lines that will mean that overlapping in different departments would necessarily ensue?  I do not think that is likely to be the most profitable way of considering the problem of university development in the future.  We are a small country, and it seems to me that it is much more probable that improvements can be effected in a more economical way by developing both universities, not along identical lines in all respects, but by developing them so that each university will specialise along its own lines, not one to the exclusion of the other, but each making its choice as to the particular lines it is going to take up.  I hope that will develop and tend to healthy rivalry between the two universities, but a rivalry in which co-operation will also be possible.  Whether <Col N="1729" /> that co-operation can be secured in this case or not will, I think, come out when once what I suggest should take place does take place&mdash;that is, that the Minister should consult with the different bodies and see whether there is a possibility of that co-operation or not. We cannot, I think, with advantage, go into such details here.  They can be much better dealt with, in the first place at all events, in separate discussions, such as I have outlined.</P>
      <P>There is a further question as to what should be done with the present students.  I have here a letter received last week from a parent whose son is at present taking out a course in the College of Science in connection with Trinity College, Dublin.  Naturally, he is asking what is to happen.  Is the year his son spent there to be lost, and is he to start somewhere else?  Details of this kind require consideration.  We have instituted new degrees within the past year in order to meet this new development. Within the last six months we have given three of those degrees. Apparently, if this plan is to be carried out on certain lines those degrees would come automatically to an end.  I do not know whether that is the proposal or whether that will necessarily follow from the proposal or not.  But it might.  That is why I say it is only reasonable to ask for some discussion on this proposal before we regard these details as finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only dealt with this proposal in so far as it is concerned with university work carried out by the College of Science.  There are other aspects. There is the aspect of how that work is concerned with students of what may be called non-university rank.  That aspect has been dealt with by other Deputies to a very considerable extent, and I do not propose to go into it in detail.  But I do wish to say that I think it is a very important aspect of this question.  Neither do I think it follows from what I said about the university work of the College of Science that it has not got a work and a function to perform for non-university students which cannot be performed by any university.  There is a third aspect, and I think it is a very important one in this connection.  That is, that this State will have, sooner or <Col N="1730" /> later&mdash;and probably sooner&mdash;to set up for itself a State institution in which mechanical testing, meteorological work, special work which can only be performed in a State laboratory, the testing of physical instruments and so on, can be carried out.</P>
    <P>There is such across the water, for example, and I think we shall very soon require some institution of that kind.  I do not think we shall be content as we have been up to the present to send instruments across the water to be standardised.  That sort of work is not university work.  It is work that can only be carried out under direct State control.  It could not, I think, be performed adequately by a university. It could not be carried out in a way which would not cramp proper university work which should be either distinctly educational or work of a distinctively research character.  This State will require an institution of that sort for itself, and it will take a good deal of money to provide it.  Either we ourselves or other Deputies will, sooner or later, find ourselves in this position that we shall say: this State had a certain amount of valuable equipment of which it might make use, and could have arranged for that equipment to be still available for Government Departments, if it had wished to do so.</P>
    <P>I think the details of this proposal ought to be carefully examined in that connection so that we may save the State in future, as far as possible, any expense which otherwise might fall upon the State directly and to an amount which it is difficult to estimate at present.  I do not think that is contradictory at all to the proposal of the Minister.  I think that the two things can be secured, but I suggest that they can only be properly secured by a full discussion of details&mdash;such a discussion as I have asked for, leaving, as I said before, the final decision with the Government alone as to how they will carry out their proposal.</P>
    <P>In the very same connection there will arise a question as to whether it might not be possible to secure the co-operation which I previously suggested. In a similar connection also arises the point that I believe the State at present does make use in a definite and distinct way of the College of Science <Col N="1731" /> as an accessory to its own work.  I believe that the Department of Agriculture and the Post Office, for instance, are both in the position of making use of the College of Science staff for solving problems connected with these separate Departments, and for carrying out investigations in them.  How that is to be maintained under the proposal of the Minister I have not heard suggested.  I can easily see that it would be possible, perhaps, to secure it, but that difficulties would be very likely to arise in securing it unless the preliminary details were very fully discussed and thought out beforehand. When a Department is a State Department it is perfectly easy for the Minister for Agriculture, for instance, to send any problem which might at any time arise to it, and that the Department should be set to solve that problem with as little delay as possible.  If it becomes a purely University Department there is not that power to control it.  The university staff might very properly say they were engaged on other problems, and it would have to wait over for a little and take its turn. I can easily see there might be difficulties in carrying out such work unless it was very carefully provided for beforehand.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has been partially dealt with already, and that is the question of how definite civil servants are to be regarded as part of the staff of the University.  My main contention is&mdash;not that I quarrel with the proposal of the Minister at all&mdash;that there is room for discussion with the different interests involved before he finally decides upon these details, and that that discussion may lead to the carrying out of this proposal in a way which would satisfy everyone.  As long as that possibility remains, I urge on him not to leave it untried.  What I suggest would not require any unnecessary or great delay, but it might lead to very important results for the whole country, as well as for any particular part.  I do not mean anything offensive by that. I do ask the Minister&mdash;and I do think it is a thing which we can fairly ask him&mdash;not to close this matter up; I do not think he has closed it up, but <Col N="1732" /> to allow such discussion as I have suggested to take place before the details are finally arranged.</P>
    <P>I do not want in any way to suggest that promises were made in this connection which were taken up in a different way from what was intended.  It is very difficult at this stage to say, or to prove, exactly what was said, and it might have been meant in one way instead of in another.  Therefore, I do not propose to do so, but I can, if anybody calls for it, refer to what was said.  There is no doubt in my mind, and I do not think that the Minister for Agriculture will question it either, that there was some sort of assurance given as to some such discussion of details of this matter.  I am not laying any great stress upon that, because things change in two years, and I know the Minister for Agriculture wants his Faculty of Agriculture, and quite rightly.  I daresay his point of view is pretty much that which we read of &mdash;&ldquo;a plague on both your houses.&rdquo; So long as he gets his Faculty of Agriculture in a university it will meet his point.  I am not going into that.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I should like to say by way of explanation as to some remarks I made last Friday. Thinking over them afterwards I thought it was possible that something I said might be misinterpreted.  It was in connection with the so-called £100,000 that was transferred to Trinity College, Dublin.  I am anxious to be perfectly fair in that matter, and not to say anything which should in the slightest way be one-sided.  I did think afterwards that perhaps one thing I said might be misinterpreted. Therefore, I will ask your permission, sir, to make a very short statement on it again.  I urged and argued that so far as Trinity College, Dublin, was concerned, that action of the Government would, we hope, leave us in a level state as regards our revenues, as compared with what they were before the 1903 and 1923 Land Acts were passed.  That, I think, is the most we have been hoping from it, from a general study as to our land revenues and the effects of the Land Acts on us.  I do not want to correct that in any way.  It is a forecast.  It is the forecast which we make on our side. <Col N="1733" /> I think the Government take a more favourable forecast and think that we shall be somewhat better off when the Land Acts have come fully into operation. I think I went on to say that the Government had been able to do that &mdash;I am not quite sure of the words I used&mdash;perhaps it was, without straining the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>Before I speak further about that, let us be quite clear about this £100,000.  It was not a grant of £100,000 from the Free State Government; I do not think the Minister meant in the least to suggest that it was.  Nevertheless it is taken up in that way in various quarters.  It was not.  It was simply that there was lying a sum to our credit on which we were able to call to the extent of £5,000 a year, if our losses from the Land Act of 1903 amounted to so much.</P>
    <P>It was lying to the credit of the Public Trustee to be used for our benefit in that way.  I think that is perfectly accurate, and I will ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to correct me if I misrepresent the case. It was lying with the Public Trustee to be drawn solely by Trinity College to the extent of £5,000 a year if the losses from the Land Act should amount to so much.  If they did not amount to so much it was to be drawn on to the amount to which the losses came.  The Free State Government said &ldquo;We will allow you to draw upon that at once to the full extent of the revenue provided by that fund.&rdquo;  The fund was transferred from the Public Trustee to the credit of Trinity College, Dublin, and the Government.  The benefit to us was that we were able to draw this revenue immediately instead of waiting for the losses due to bad sales to amount to the revenue of this fund.  I think I said that in view of the fact that the fund had not attained the amount specified in the 1903 Act, namely, such an amount as would produce £5,000 yearly, the Government were bound under that Act to continue adding £5,000 yearly until it would reach the necessary sum.  We agreed that the setting aside of £5,000 yearly should stop&mdash;I do not know how long it would have continued, but it would have been <Col N="1734" /> for a short time comparatively, and that instead the Government should give us £5,000 down, and £3,000 yearly for the future.  I think I may have been taken to say that that was done without involving any drawing on the funds of the Free State.  If I did say so I was thinking of the next two or three years during which the fixed sum of £5,000 yearly would have to continue. There would be a definite contribution from the Free State of £3,000 yearly, so soon as the Free State would be free from the liability to set aside the £5,000 yearly specified by the Wyndham Act.  I have to apologise for taking up the time of the Dáil so long, but, in view of the difficulty and the complexity of the subject, I hope I will be excused.  I do not think I often transgress in that respect.</P>

      <P>While the attitude of our party is not the attitude that Deputy Thrift suggests would be that of the Minister for Agriculture, &ldquo;a plague on both your houses,&rdquo; we are very much concerned about having a Faculty of Agriculture set up.  Certain facilities and education were given in the College of Science hitherto to those who had neither the time nor the means to get university education.  I refer to county instructors of agriculture, creamery managers and technical instructors.  These people were provided with facilities by the College of Science that I hope will be continued, to the same, if not to a greater, extent elsewhere.  It is immaterial to us where, but we hope the universities will provide them.  We demand as a right that the services which were provided by the College of Science will be continued. We are very keen on this matter, as a considerable number of persons in the rural areas have been able to make a living by the short courses that were provided in the College of Science.  We hope these courses will be continued, or otherwise we will have a good deal to say about the matter.  From the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce we anticipate that these facilities will be continued in full.  If they are we shall have very little to complain about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce one question.  In the course of his speech or speeches he said something about handing over the buildings that were occupied by the College of Science, or which, shall I say, were built for the College of Science, to the University.  I take it that the University proposes to continue to demand the right of self-government, and to insist upon retaining complete control of all its own property.  I want to know whether it is the intention of the Government to hand over the buildings which constitute the College of Science as an absolute gift, henceforth to be controlled without regard to any wishes or desires of the Government, or any limitations except such limitations as they themselves as the Governing Body of the University might like to propose. I think we should have some assurance on that point.  I do not like the thought that Government buildings should be handed over absolutely to any body, private or quasi-private.  I want to remind the Minister and the Dáil of the implications of this proposal in regard to other kinds of public gifts, advances or contributions.  If it is proposed to hand over to University College absolutely, as a free gift, the buildings that constitute the College of Science, then, there are possibilities in regard to other institutions, to which State property might be handed over. I think we ought to guard against that kind of precedent.  I hope we shall have an assurance that it is not intended to hand over these buildings as an absolute gift.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enter into this discussion now in the way the representatives of Trinity College or the National University did.  I want a little information on points that perhaps the Minister may say are matters of detail, but which are of considerable importance to some of those whose future and present will be affected by a change in the College of Science.  Deputy Thrift and Deputy Gorey have alluded to the matter, and I want to emphasise its importance with regard to the present students of the College of Science.  What will be their position in the future in their effort to complete <Col N="1736" /> their studies?  What position will students outside stand in?  At present some students that I am acquainted with are doing a thesis for a fellowship of the College of Science which will no longer exist.  What will their position be?  What pass or degree will they be entitled to claim for the work they are at present engaged in?  Is the Minister making certain that the position of these students and their future will be in no way endangered?  I am given to understand that both in this country and elsewhere the College of Science degree has been of more material benefit to those who possess it than a pass from a university would be.  I want information on these points which will be satisfactory not only to me but to many students in the College of Science, and to others working outside for a degree or a fellowship of the College.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to answer Deputy Gorey.  Deputy Baxter had in his mind the students of the College of Science doing real university work, students who got associateships and afterwards, as he mentioned, a fellowship.  That is one question, but the question which Deputy Gorey asked is slightly different.  He wanted to know what will happen students who get certain facilities there for doing what I will call secondary agricultural education, short courses for creamery managers and so on.  There has been a good deal of confusion on this particular question by reason of the fact that Deputies do not seem to advert to the two functions of the College of Science.  It has the functions of a university, but it also has minor functions, inasmuch as it offers facilities, which gradually grew up, to students who were anxious to get what is really agricultural education, not university education but education of a secondary character.  It is not proposed to transfer to any university the functions of a secondary character which the College of Science possesses.  I say that without at all prejudicing a possible development later on of continuation classes, or that certain work which is not really university work should not be done in conjuction with that <Col N="1737" /> university.  That, of course, is a possible development.  It is possible that a university might do a two or three years course in connection with the agricultural faculty for students who have got their matriculation.  I am dealing now with the existing position and with the courses provided for creamery managers and people of that sort, the courses which they do in the College of Science but which are not of university standing.  These courses will be continued and should be increased. In agriculture you have primary, secondary and university education, and I ask Deputies not to mix up the three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They ought not to be mixed up.  I heard a lot of talk as to what is to be done with the agricultural station at Athenry, the station at Ballyhaise and so on.  It was suggested by some Deputies that because there was a model farm in Athenry that there would be no difficulty whatever in establishing a faculty in agriculture in Galway University, the farm at Athenry to be made available for that purpose.  In its way, equally important work should be done for secondary agricultural education at Athenry and at Ballyhaise.  That is the kind of work that should be done in these farm institutes, and I hope that the Ministry of Agriculture will be able to acquire more of them in the future for work of that kind.  Deputies can rest assured that there is no intention whatever of limiting the present resources for secondary education in agriculture, that is to say, the provision of short courses for creamery managers and other people who want to get technical agricultural education.  What we are really discussing here is what is the proper way to give education of a University standard to agricultural people who are anxious to get such education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but there are two or three small points which I would like to deal with before coming to the three or four grave matters raised by Deputy Thrift.  Certain Deputies have addressed the Dáil since I last spoke dealing mainly with the question of University College, Galway, and there seems to have been created down in Connaught the impression that the University institution which they have at present is about to be taken from them.  Deputy O'Connell, in speaking, thanked me in a sarcastic sort of way for the continuance of the present very limited funds which are being paid to Galway.  I do not object to his making that point if he simply means to stress the fact that the funds are small and that all that is now promised to Galway is the continuance of these limited funds.  I may say that when I used that phrase I was answering an objection, or an imaginary objection, that the funds were going to be stopped, and in order to reassure Deputies on that point I did say that this University Vote would be under consideration soon and that it would then be seen that the present funds were to be continued.  That is no answer to those who asked what development is going to take place in Galway University, nor did I intend it as an answer.</P>

    <P>I did not intend it as an answer to those who came here and interviewed me on this subject, and then retreated to Connaught and started a campaign, that the present funds of Galway University College were going to be taken from them.  There is no hint of that here or elsewhere about Galway University College.  There is one other point, but it is a small one.  Seeing that the Minister for Agriculture has been reminded of some promise he is alleged to have made some years ago, and as I do not wish to have the same thing happening with regard to myself some years hence, I wish to deal with a remark made by one Deputy who spoke in Irish.  He said I had promised a Commission of Inquiry.  He was speaking in Irish at the time, and I am not sure how much stress can be laid on the word &ldquo;coimisiún.&rdquo;  In using that word, if the Deputy meant what <Col N="1739" /> is ordinary meant by a commission, I may say that I meant no such thing. Further I desire to say that it is not in my power to make any promise about a commission for Galway University. That is a matter entirely for the Minister for Education.  What I did say was that a thorough examination would be made into the resources of Galway University College, and I expressed the opinion that the case should be taken up immediately.  I am not clear at all that I did use the word commission, but if I did use it I did not intend to do so, because I have no authority at all with regard to making a promise for the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift returned to some points he had dealt with in his first speech.  Right through Deputy Thrift's speech there runs this idea, that suddenly some weeks ago the Minister for Education made up his mind, without any examination of details, that this project of his should be put before the Dáil, and that that should be done without any consultation, without going into any details, and without any proper scheme or plan. That is the current running through the Deputy's speech as he made it. Whether he meant it to be there or not, I do not know, but if he did mean it he can rest assured that this whole matter has been the subject of inquiry for many months past; that details have very definitely been looked into, and that the whole scheme is in a very finished from.  It has not been finally completed, but enough has been done to show that there is no insurmountable obstacle in the way.  I cannot announce in answer to the question put, that such and such a detail has been worked out, but there is no detail not worked out for which we have not analogies in the past.  It must be remembered that the Minister for Education belongs to a University, and had much to do with the period which saw the working out and the transfer of the old Royal University to the three Colleges of the National University.  All the difficulties about that transition period, about examinations, about the taking over both of professors and of students, all these, I say, came up before <Col N="1740" /> and were surmounted.  A long view and a decent prospect of the whole situation has shown that there is nothing to prevent that plan working out here.  A scheme is brought before the Dáil now for approval, in the sense that the details cannot be laid on the Table, nor can every little point be settled as to what is going to happen Professor this or Lecturer that, but this I can say, that there has been sufficient thought given to the matter by the Minister to ensure that there is no obstacle which cannot be surmounted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that what is now put before us is a decision which is not subject to any further examination by the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no; the Minister for Education is putting before the Dáil the particular project of his Department and the Executive Council.  That there may be details to be modified here and there or advice to be given by the Dáil and taken by the Executive Council is not at all precluded.  I only mean that the thing has advanced.  It is not an inchoate scheme.  It is not merely a nucleus of something.  It has advanced to a certain point though there may be modifications to be made in it later on.  The particular point the Deputy raised in regard to buildings the Minister for Education will answer himself.  That item has not been forgotten.</P>
      <P>The question of the £100,000 has been repeated so often that I do not care to go into it again.  Deputy Thrift said in regard to that, that the Trustees of Trinity College at a particular period came to the conclusion that the University resources would be very seriously lessened by the operation of certain Land Acts.  He proceeded from that to say that the present view was that they could no longer exist upon their present finances.  I would like to point out in answer to him that there was to be set aside a sum of £5,000 per annum, and that there could be withdrawals up to a certain limited amount per annum from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund was then to accumulate until it had reached the position that the fund itself, without any further addition, would bear withdrawals <Col N="1741" /> allowed under the agreement.  If the view of the trustees that the finances would be very seriously lessened had been borne out by the facts, there would have been considerable withdrawals from that accumulated fund. In fact, there were not very many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the reason why the withdrawal from the fund is much less than anticipated at the time is because of the dilatory way in which the operations of the Land Act were carried out. It turned out to be more limited than was expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to get at was the uncertainty of prophesying anything.  There was something that intervened; it may be what the Deputy states, or there might have been other causes.  But the fact is that the funds were, in fact, not very seriously lessened.  The Deputy goes on to say that what has been given to Trinity College is this: that as regards the funds now being handed over to them, they were allowed to draw on them year by year, and that in certain other ways they have been lessened by the operations of land purchase.  They got in no other income from that fund, and to that extent the £100,000 was a gift. There is no limitation put upon the withdrawals.  They get whatever is the full income the fund brings in per annum, and there is no statutory limitation. These are the two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must always be remembered in regard to this £100,000 that it is not right to represent it as a fund belonging to Trinity College, Dublin, and that the Irish nation, or the Free State, have no call upon it.  I hold it was an asset of the State, not immediately realizable, but a clear and distinct asset, and might have been dealt with in many other ways.  Deputy Thrift has returned to the points I made against him in my first speech about the readjustment of the internal resources of Trinity College, and he threatened some day to explode completely my illusions upon those points.  They may be illusions, but they are shared by other people, and have formed the basis of the letter intimating to Trinity College <Col N="1742" /> the gift of this £100,000.  I have previously given a certain portion of this letter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister reading from the letter of withdrawal, or the final letter that went to the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a letter which was withdrawn in certain particulars.  Certain demands were made on Trinity which the College refused, and for the reason the second letter pointed out.  But the basis of both letters is the same, and the way both letters proceed is this&mdash;I am not quoting them word for word:&mdash;Number one expressed the Government opinion that all Universities had to be looked at together when funds were being applied for; and the other very definite statement to Trinity College was this: that with less students they had more income, they had no burden of debt, and had buildings on a scale above and beyond that which University College or the National University of Ireland could ever hope to possess, and having said that it continued that they were not yet satisfied that all that could be done had been done by way of internal readjustment of the finances to meet the present difficulties under which Trinity College was labouring, and hoped that before long Trinity College would so readjust its internal finances as to put it in a position to meet these obligations and to carry on the work which it had been so successfully doing up to that point. A three-year period was set down, not distinctly, inside which the finances were to be readjusted.  There was to be a three-year period inside which it was understood no further application was to be made by Trinity College for funds.  I take it that one reading of the letter is that inside that three-year period Trinity was to examine and find out how far an internal readjustment of its finances would meet the situation, and I do not know that anything has been done along the lines of that examination which was pointed out. There is this, further: Deputy Thrift quoted from that letter certain points, one point being that the accounts were <Col N="1743" /> to be presented, and his remark on that was illuminating.  He said the accounts are not now hidden.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Time after time the accounts were submitted to various commissions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into this point of the accounts in detail, or to insinuate that moneys have not been revealed or that the receipts have not been revealed, but as this matter of accounts is opened up there is one small point that I would like to call attention to.  The question of accounts has been opened up by the Deputy.  Certain items are set forth as showing loss in the internal economy of Trinity College.  Two items may be bulked together.  There is the Observatory belonging to Trinity College and the special Botanical Gardens for Trinity College, apart from the other Botanical Gardens in the city.  One of these shows a loss of £1,600 and another a loss of £1,300 in a particular year.  It might be asked, why carry these losses; why carry a Botanical Gardens?  If you ask the people in the vicinity of Lansdowne Road whether the Botanical Gardens are being used they will inform you that it is a kind of a locked preserve for the greater part of the year.  I do not know that any useful work is done there.  There is one serious item&mdash;there is an item raised by the Board of Trinity College showing a loss in three grouped items&mdash;that is Commons, Kitchen and Trinity Hall.  Trinity Hall is a residence for women students of Trinity College.  Kitchen and Commons I group as meaning meals provided for the students, and there is a loss in that.  I have heard of Bills providing meals for necessitous school children, but I do not think that the Dáil ever thought it was proper to provide money to buy food for Trinity College students, and that is really <Col N="1744" /> what is comes to.  This is one item upon which a definite investigation is challenged.  It is put forward seriously in a statement showing loss that the money they charge their students for Commons does not meet the bill for Commons.  I think it is a very serious thing for any university.  I do not know where its revenue comes from originally, but when it is asking for State aid it is strange that it should say: &ldquo;We are not charging sufficient to our residential students for the food we are giving them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not really make this point if he had talked over the accounts with somebody who knew them beforehand.  He would not have made the suggestions he has made.  He is quite unaware of the fact that part of our Charter makes certain exhibitions payable in the form of Commons.  Sizars, for example, instead of getting money payments, get free Commons.  Part of the emoluments of scholarships is free Commons, and so on.  If he had talked the accounts over with some one who knew them, he would never have made these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the information, and am surprised that those who sent in the claims and the letters did not explain what Commons, Kitchen and Trinity Hall did represent.  That was the time for the explanation.  The claim was sent in that there was a loss on these things, and that loss was to be met apparently by whatever additional grant the State could give.  Why that £100,000 was given to Trinity College the letters bear out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, we believe that you can meet whatever deficit there is by a better adjustment of your internal finances.  That is the situation as it still is.  There has been, so far as can be learned publicly, no better adjustment of the internal finances, but University College, Dublin, and the National University are still in an impoverished condition.  This is then an actual way of meeting the impoverished condition of the University Colleges in Dublin and Cork.  The question of these co-ordinating students has been raised. I thought fit to make inquiries and <Col N="1745" /> make out, since we had such difficulty about it, the number of agricultural students who attended from Trinity College and elsewhere.  I have found out the number of co-ordinating students who attend from Trinity College and the National University.  Over a five years' period the number of students who attended for agriculture, mechanical engineering, and applied chemistry from Trinity College averaged two students per year, or ten in all during five years.  Those are students, all, or nearly all, of whom were on the agricultural side of the College of Science.  From the National University 32 agricultural students attended in five years and 101 students attended for mechanical and electrical engineering.  Taking all the figures, there would be 133 from the National University and 10 from Trinity College, so that that is the full value now of those co-ordinating students.  We are told, however, that we are seriously hindering the whole future of Trinity College because the number of their students, averaging two yearly over a period of five years, cannot be finished.</P>
    <P>I do not see why they cannot get finished.  Of course they can.  They will finish in the same building that used to be called the College of Science but which will be known under another name.  Several points were raised by other Deputies which really refer to the working out of the schemes.  They are mere details, and the scheme should not be held up because every detail, cut and dried, cannot be placed before the Dáil at present.  Now with regard to the staff being Civil Servants, it has been asked how can they be incorporated into universities if they are Civil Servants.  They can, of course. As Civil Servants they have defined rights for salaries and pensions and these cannot be interfered with.  Their rights are there and they will have the right to opt between continuing and resigning, but it is not, as Deputy Sir James Craig said, that if they resign their moneys will be borne out of a central fund and would ultimately fall into the coffers of the National University. The obvious thing would be, that payment by way of pension should be <Col N="1746" /> met out of the Vote, so that there would be no further call on the Exchequer. This is to prevent further call on the Exchequer.  The other point is with regard to university autonomy and Government rights over its own property.  Government rights over its own property are definitely protected by the Constitution, consequently it is not incompatible with the autonomy which a university has that there should be a certain control over buildings or the relaxation of control subject to review for certain periods. All that can be looked after and I presume that the Minister will see that it is looked after.  The whole details have not been worked out, but I think there should be such definite approval given now of the project that the heads of the Colleges concerned can proceed to go into details in conjunction with the Minister and with the Department of Agriculture which dealt with this matter until recently, so that the whole thing may be cut and dried and put into operation before the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill) Eoin MacNeill">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor MacNeill)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be better for me to ignore as much as possible any criticism that has been directed against myself personally, and pay attention to the criticism that has been directed against my proposals. First of all, I think it will clear the ground of some of the small and rapid undergrowth, the brambles and thistles which have sprung up during the last few days, over the question of University College, Galway.  It is quite a common experience with us here to find Deputies complaining of things that that they have recently said being misrepresented. I have a long experience of misrepresentation.  I do not know whether anything in that experience has amounted to the various things that have been said with regard to what I did say, what I am supposed to have said, and what has been read into what I said on the question of Galway University College.  I said one thing very distinctly, and I put it in a familiar phrase which everyone understands, and that was, that it was no part of my intention that the Galway College should be let down.  It is one of the privileges of free citizenship to <Col N="1747" /> make mistakes about these things and the public has a right to have itself set right on matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, as my colleague suggested, there is no intention to diminish the provision of University education as regards Galway.  One of the Deputies for County Galway said, in a rather sarcastic way, that he thought they ought to be rather thankful for that.  I hope I shall be in a position to announce that the provision for University education as regards Galway will not be diminished, but will be suitably increased.  I cannot do it at present, and I do not intend to do it.  As I said, Galway University College and University education connected with it were, to my mind, something of a problem.  Away back in the 'fifties when Ireland, according to a well-known saying, was on the dissecting table, a little bit of dissection was done with regard to University education and the country was dissected in the provinces, and provincial University institutions set up in those provinces.  On the basis of that we are prepared to-day to get into contentions and controversies.  What are those provinces to us, this geographical division of Ireland into counties and provinces?  Of what value is it to the people inside the provinces or counties or to the people outside them? It is a mere matter of administrative convenience.  They have not even historical tradition at their back.  They are merely administrative units so far as they have been administrative units, and at present that does not apply to the provinces.  It is only because we love a bit of contention that we are provincial at all.  We are not provincial at all in our minds, but when some bone of contention arises then we become desperately provincial.  I hold that University institutions in any part of Ireland should exist for the nation as a whole.  That does not mean there would not be a special benefit to the people who live near them.  You have great and renowned Universities in different parts of the Continent and Great Britain, all of them of special benefit to the people who live near them, but not one of them a provincial University.  I refuse to approach this <Col N="1748" /> problem of University education in Ireland on the footing of provincialism.</P>
    <P>Another point has been mentioned with regard to Galway.  I am supposed to have overlooked it.  We will see who is overlooking it.  That was from the point of view of the Irish language and all that is implied in it, Galway was especially favourably situated, and that forty per cent. of the inhabitants of the city of Galway itself were Irish speakers, and that in the country surrounding the city a much larger proportion, one might say eighty per cent., were Irish speakers, and that consequently Galway had special claims on the nation for national consideration. I agree, but I ask are those special claims going to be met&mdash;I am putting the question very plainly&mdash;by stereotyping the kind of university institution which is at present established in Galway?  I am glad that even though no &ldquo;voice, in thunder, spake,&rdquo; the consequence followed.  I am glad that the West has wakened up to the question which was a problem to me and that is: what is the best thing to be done with regard to University College, Galway?  I am prepared to meet those at present interested in the college, the people of the counties which are contributory to that college, and in common with them, others representing the wide national view, and to consider with them what is the best thing to be done with regard to University College, Galway, but I am quite satisfied the best thing to do is not to build on the foundations of Sir Robert Peel&mdash;I think he was the original architect&mdash;as more or less altered under the regime of Mr. Augustine Birrell.  I should like the whole question to be looked into as freely and as openly as possible, and I hope to be able to provide an opportunity for doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the time I would look forward to.  What I put before the Dáil was a certain scheme, definite, so far as it went, but not definite in detail.  I think I would be able to satisfy members of the Dáil that it was impossible for me at this stage to bring forward a scheme worked out in detail, and even if I had it in black and white, that still it would be altogether premature, and not by any means from any point of view advisable that I should present a scheme in absolute detail.  The problem I had to face was twofold.  First of all, there was this plan of University education being carried on on a limited scale and under what would be often described as bureaucratic management.  I proposed to the Dáil&mdash;and I think there has been universal agreement on the point and also general public agreement on it&mdash; that that was not a sound plan of higher education.  That is number one. Number two was that I had also before me, and had before me for a long time, the question of the needs of the National University, and more particularly the needs of University College, Dublin.  At that time&mdash;and I am not going to enter into any comparisons whatsoever&mdash;when I was approached by the representatives of the University of Dublin, and when it was possible to make a certain provision about which I shall not say now whether it was a larger or a smaller, a better or a worse provision, there was the admitted case of the National University, and particularly of University College, Dublin, which was one of the greatest hardship, the greatest difficulty.  At that time it was not possible for me to make or to propose any way or plan for relieving the necessities of the National University and its Dublin College.  The only thing we were able to do was to say: &ldquo;Carry on.  We will continue to provide for you on a certain limited scale.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> Now the two problems come up together, and I admit, from my point of view, that it is fortunate that they come up together.  In transforming the scheme of education carried on in the College of Science into a part of the university education of the country, a certain amount of resources are set free from their previous destination, and placed at the disposal of the public authorities. And my proposal is not to diminish those resources in any way, but to make them available for relieving the needs of the National University, and doing something more&mdash; bringing that University into line with the economic needs and the economic life of the country.  The reason why a scheme of that kind cannot be placed before you in detail is plainly this: We are dealing with an autonomous body in the case of the National University, and with bodies exercising a large degree of autonomy in the case of its colleges. When I speak of an autonomous body in the country I hope no one will suppose that I am setting up some sort of internal sovereignty as against the national sovereignty of the people.  I have no idea of doing anything of the kind.  The national sovereignty over all these institutions remains.  But you cannot be always exercising national sovereignty in regard to these legal rights which have already been created. We must regard these institutions as having autonomy, and we must deal with them as autonomous institutions. Any scheme for the absorption of the work, the staff, and even the equipment of the College of Science by the National University must be dealt with by that body.  It must make provision according to its own law, according to its own statutes, according to its charter, according to the law by which it is bound to carry out that scheme; and I must leave it a certain amount of freedom in shaping in that direction. It would be altogether a violation of the character of these institutions if we were to go to them and say: &ldquo;You shall do so and so, and you shall do so and so.&rdquo;  I think that the policy of the Government is that the approach should be rather in a contrary direction, and that the university should be required to produce its own plan, not necessarily <Col N="1751" /> final, not necessarily imperative, for carrying out the proposals.</P>
    <P>And now let me say that up to this moment, and largely for the reasons that I have stated, I have carried on no negotiations with the National University or University College, Dublin, or with University College, Cork.  I have given no undertaking to them, actual or implied, beyond what has been spoken here.  So that in every way the preparation that I expect to be made by the university to meet my proposals has to begin from the time when those proposals are understood to have the sanction of this Assembly.</P>
    <P>Again the question of buildings was raised by Deputy Johnson.  I refrained, and I do now refrain, from announcing anything that would be, to the National University, an undertaking with regard to the provision of buildings.  And why?  Because the National University is already in possession of buildings provided out of the funds granted by the State.  I presume that those assets will have to come into calculation before an agreement on this matter is reached.  At the same time, I wish it to be clearly understood that the proposals which I have made are the policy that I stand over, the policy that I propose, and that if matters of detail are to be arranged afterwards, so far as I am concerned, they can only be matters of detail.  I take responsibility for this proposal as a whole, and I can put it in a nut-shell, and it is, that the entire resources of the College of Science shall be made available for university education in connection with the University Colleges of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>As the matter has been raised by Deputy Thrift, I see no reason why two Universities working side by side should not be able to arrive on common ground and a good deal of common ground with regard to matters of research; and I am glad to hear that idea mooted now for the first time.  I trust it will bear fruit in the future.  If it is to bear fruit &mdash;and I myself will foster and facilitate it in every way I can&mdash;it will bear fruit by those who can speak and act for those two autonomous institutions <Col N="1752" /> coming together and making arrangements for research on common ground. Dublin University has already in certain directions immense resources for research and I myself in a small way have made a little use of them in the past.  I am quite certain, I am at all events entirely hopeful, that with regard to that matter of meeting on common ground on matters of research the two Universities will be able to arrive at a friendly understanding and a friendly working arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>In every way I can.  Questions have been raised with regard to present students, and so on. Those are questions of importance, but they are of very small importance in comparison with a scheme of policy which is to be permanent.  The number of those students, suppose they all be affected by this, is only a few hundreds, whereas we are now proposing to make a provision which will have permanent effect.  At the same time I do not think that even one student, if it can be avoided, should be placed at a disadvantage by any change we make, and I trust every possible care will be taken to avoid the placing of even one student at a disadvantage, no matter what the classification of that particular student might be.  That includes, of course, and I think the Minister for Agriculture has very satisfactorily dealt with that, the students who are attending short courses, or special courses, with regard to certain technical pursuits.  Deputy Professor Thrift also said, and said truly, that we should have to consider the setting up of a State institution, a State laboratory, which will carry on certain special work for the benefit of the State.  There are certain operations of that kind already being carried on for the benefit of the State; they are necessary with regard to customs, and so on.  For the most part, that sort of institution will grow up, and, as far as one can foresee at present, will grow up gradually.  At all events, I am not in a position to place before the Dáil <Col N="1753" />&mdash;I do not think it would be my province&mdash;any proposals for the establishment of a fully equipped laboratory which would go into the question of assaying weights and measures, and meteorology&mdash;if that is a subject for the State, I should have thought it would also be a subject for the universities. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think, has been sufficiently explanatory with regard to the status of the present teaching staff of the College of Science.  They are at present in the position of Civil Servants. That, I think, creates no difficulty whatsoever. I myself was a Civil Servant up to the moment when I became a university professor, and I think I mentioned before that the only difficulty I encountered, and which I hope is one these gentlemen will not encounter, was that I left behind me, in the hands of the British Treasury, all the pension rights I had accumulated for 22 years.  They are now beyond recovery, except perhaps when the final financial adjustment comes along. I do not know if there is any other point which it is necessary for me to make clear, or any question that I could answer with regard to the proposals I am making.  The proposals, I think, are perfectly definite.  As I say, they comprise the absorption by the National University of the existing resources as a whole of the College of Science.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister make one thing more clear to me, that is, whether he would be prepared, in so far as the work in connection with Trinity College, Dublin, is carried on in conjunction with the College of Science, that the authorities of Trinity College should be consulted to see how these proposals would affect that work?</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am prepared to have a consultation, but I think Deputy O'Connell got at my weak point a few days ago when he said that I had a dislike for Committees and Commissions.  I have been in-touch with committees and commissions for the last 20 or 30 years.  Some of them were very good, and some very bad.  It is very much of a lottery, whether they are going to be good or bad, and in any case committees and commissions <Col N="1754" /> very often have this aspect, that they are but a means by which those who are in responsibility get rid of their responsibility and shoulder it off to somebody else.  In this particular case I am prepared to take full responsibility for everything I have proposed, but in regard to consultation on any matter of detail of that kind I do not see why it should not be possible.</P>

      <P>May I make a similar request on behalf of the commercial students?  I tried to get particulars during the course of the discussion on this subject as to the number of University students at the College of Science, and also the number of what I might call ordinary commercial students. I did not succeed in getting what one might look on as satisfactory figures either from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Education, who seem to be in a sort of co-partnership in this matter.  What I was anxious about is that, seeing that such a large number of these students of the College of Science are commercial students, those interested in commerce, like those interested in University work in Trinity College, might be consulted from the commercial point of view in connection with these future arrangements.  Though I have listened attentively to that portion of the Minister's speech for which I was present, I am scarcely satisfied that he recognises the important work that was done for commercial interests in the University by the College of Science, and we should be satisfied in the future that these interests would not be in any way imperilled.  I would ask that the Minister would consult those who are more or less responsible for industry in the Free State, and that they should be considered when these interests are being revised.</P>

      <P>It is a pity if Deputy Good, after asking a specific question, would not get a specific answer.  There are no commercial students of any kind in the College of Science, and there never were to my knowledge.  There are students that the Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned, that is to say, students who are going for their associateships, and there are other <Col N="1755" /> students who do courses in agriculture, short courses of a year, and that sort of thing, and a certain number of students who are studying for creamery managers' certificates.  I should say that the number of students who come in casually and do short courses, and the number of students who are looking for creamery managers' certificates, would be about 30 or 35 out of a total roll of 160, but there are no commercial students whatever.  It is a common delusion that the College of Science is a commercial college.  It is not; there are no commercial faculties.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interfere unduly, but as I happened to be a student in the College of Science in bygone years, I do not know what category exactly the Minister would put me in.

But to say that there are any commercial subjects taught, or any subjects outside chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and, in addition, subjects which creamery managers do for certificates, and subjects which agricultural students do in their short course, is not correct.  The Minister for Education reminds me that there are certain students who do certain short courses in English and modern languages.</P>

I tried to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce the actual number of University students attending the College of Science, because we, in commerce, practically train the balance of them, and we claim to represent that balance.  The work of the College of Science is in future to be carried on by the universities, and we want to know if they will regulate the matter to have the same educational advantages that are given at present.  On that point we would like to be satisfied.</P>

      <P>I have raised the point of the Botanical Gardens.  I have only to ask the Minister if he is aware that at present there is a regulation that perambulators, baby carriages and so on, cannot go into the Botanical Gardens.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is using his offices with the Port and Docks Board to admit them to the Bull Wall, and I think he might consider this point.  These gardens are used very largely as a public park.  It may be wrong that that should be done, but unquestionably it is so, and it is a great hardship to mothers of small children to have to leave their perambulators at the gate. It means that they cannot take their <Col N="1757" /> children in at all.  I do not think that the Minister would wish to be guided by British precedents, but baby-carriages are allowed into Kew Gardens, and the reason is that probably small children do less harm to flowers and plants when they are in a perambulator than when they are allowed to run around and pull things about.  If the Minister would take that into consideration he would be doing a kindness to those people who live in the neighbourhood and use this place as a park.</P>

      <P>A question about the hours of opening of the Botanic Gardens was asked some time ago, and I replied by promising to consider the changing of the hours to suit the public convenience.  That question must be considered immediately.  As to whether the result of that consideration will be that the Botanical Gardens will be opened at, say, 10 o'clock on Sunday or not is a question which depends to a great extent on whether we come to the conclusion that the opening of the Gardens, say, on Saturday afternoon for a longer period will be better than opening them earlier on Sunday morning. The whole question will get consideration. It is agreed and generally understood that the Botanical Gardens should be open for as long as possible, and that the public should get somewhat better facilities to enter the Gardens than they are getting at present.  The whole question will be considered, and in connection with that the question that Deputy Cooper has raised will also be taken into account.</P>

Accordingly we have brought up alternative Votes and in the sum total there is a difference of only £270.  There is a slight alternation in connection with the Appropriation in Aid, which amounts to something like £56,000.  I explained that at some length on the last day, and I do not know that it would be <Col N="1759" /> anything more than occupying the time of the Committee if I were to go into it now.  The Endowment Fund is in process of being apportioned and the portion applicable to technical instruction services is shown as a receipt from the Church Temporalities Fund. The balance to credit on the 1st June, 1924, applicable to technical education is also shown as an Appropriation in Aid.  Apart from that and the explanation I gave the last day there is no main alteration in the Vote.  A slight adjustment has been made in connection with one service, and that I explained on the last day.

      <P>In the past the provision for technical instruction has been included partly in Votes; that is, certain sub-heads of the Estimate for the Ministry of Agriculture and certain sub-heads of the Estimate for Science and Art, and partly the Endowment Fund of the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministers and Secretaries Act has allocated to the Department of Agriculture the administration of technical instruction, and accordingly the opportunity has been taken to place all charges in connection with this service in the one Vote for the 10 months of the financial year, during which the Act will have been in operation.  Furthermore, the Government has come to the conclusion that it is undesirable generally that public services should continue to be financed through special funds rather than through moneys provided by the Oireachtas, and its policy is, as time and opportunity offers, to bring such funds to an end and place all charges connected with public services on Votes.  In this Estimate a beginning of this policy has been made, and accordingly expenses formerly borne on the Endowment Fund of the Ministry of Agriculture are now being charged directly on the Vote.</P>

Any discussion now must be a discussion as to where there is any administrative change.  I take it the Minister means there is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this subject of technical education hangs very much on primary education, and the effect of one is reflected, to a certain extent, on the other.  In view of all the defects that have been pointed out in regard to primary education, we want to know exactly, seeing it is rather affecting technical education, how far the Minister was desirous of going, or intended going, in order to remove these defects and make technical education more effective than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One does not complain of the amount of money that is spent on technical education.  At least I do not.  But I do complain of the value we get for that money and I think the result is <Col N="1762" /> deplorable.  On all sides those who have to do with technical education are unanimous in complaining of what it is doing in this country of ours.  The Minister says that he is new to this work, that he is anxious to get information about it that will guide him in, possibly, making better use of the money devoted to this particular purpose in the future than has been done in the past.  We have in many places, particularly in the City of Dublin, exceedingly fine schools, excellently equipped, but unfortunately they are very badly attended.  When we come to the question of attendance, the extraordinary fact is that the attendance at our technicals schools in Ireland, particularly in the Free State, is one of the lowest amongst the more educated communities to-day.  I suppose in the Free State in proportion to our population we have probably the lowest attendance of any country so far as technical schools go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to get the figures on the subject.  That bad attendance is particularly unfortunate and the first point I would lay stress on is that the Minister should inquire why it is so.  We have pointed out that in our opinion the cause of that bad attendance is the low standard of the pupils leaving the primary schools. When I was speaking on this subject a little while ago I mentioned that the report of a conference that was held to inquire into the question of the training of apprentices, stated that a very large percentage of the pupils coming from the primary schools were unable to take advantage of the education given in the technical schools, by reason of the low standard of their education. For the information of the Minister and for the information of the Deputies who are interested in this subject I will just read one paragraph from that report.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No doubt was left in the minds of many members attending the conference that the great question to be solved before Technical Education could accomplish its work was to secure that students must receive a <Col N="1763" /> more thorough primary education Employers and Primary Education Authorities were unanimous in stating that 75 per cent. of the lads entering industrial life were unable to pass a simple qualifying examination necessary to enter a Technical School. Employers testified that skilled tradesmen were often unfitted to be sent to work in the country because of their inability to keep the simplest accounts or to write legible letters clearly expressing their business; not to mention their shortcomings in other directions essential to their efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the report proceeds:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The root of the evil is to be found in the wretchedly bad attendance of the pupils at the Primary schools.&rdquo;  In connection with the question of attendance we had hoped to see a Bill brought in during this session, because there is no matter more urgent.  We have not got the Bill.  I suppose we will have to keep stressing the matter until we get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have something from the Minister's Department, because, really, we have little from the Ministry of Education since the Dáil has come into existence.  We have had few proposals from it, and I do not know that there is any subject more urgent than the question of primary education in Ireland.  The question of bad attendance is a crying evil.  In the Free State, it is only necessary for a boy or girl to attend 150 days out of the school year.  A great many of them unfortunately do not attend that number of days, and owing to the deficiency in the present Education Act it is impossible to compel them to give better attendance.  The conditions on the other side are quite different.  In England and Scotland, under the Education Act, the pupils are compelled to attend every day on which the schools are open, or to show good cause for non-attendance.  The result is that they get a higher average attendance there than we do.  As has been pointed out before, the low attendance of those pupils in Ireland is one of the principal causes of the low standard of Primary <Col N="1764" /> Education in Ireland.  While I state that we do not complain so much of the amount of the Estimate for Technical Education, we do certainly complain of what we get for it.  I am satisfied that until the system of Primary Education is very materially improved, we will not get the improvement that we hope for in Technical Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point that has always occurred to me as a grievance on the part of young students in Dublin, and it appears the same thing is true of the Free State generally.  The student who is attending a National School is thereby debarred from attending a technical school, and it is only after leaving the National School that we get them in the technical school.  I could never understand why we should debar the pupil attending the National School from attending the technical school. I have asked many times for an explanation of it.  The barrier exists but we can get no explanation of it.  Possibly the Minister could give us some reason.  Take a boy of 12 years of age.  Some boys I am glad to say are fairly well advanced at that age.  Such a boy may be anxious to go to a technical school and get some information that will be useful to him in his subsequent career.  Yet he is debarred, unfortunately, as long as he is attending the primary school.  That is one point to which the Minister might devote some time, and see if that barrier could not be removed.  Another point is that in order to raise the standard, which is so essential from the industrial point of view, and from the point of view of the boys of the future and the point of view of the country, the Minister should consider the question of the leaving age in the primary schools.  The question, as you can see from what I have stated, affects the technical school.  There is no use in raising&mdash;if the Minister be disposed to do so&mdash;the leaving age in the primary school to 15 years or 16 years as long as that barrier stands&mdash;that is, as long as the boy attending the primary school is debarred from attending the technical school.  If that barrier is to be extended from 14 to 16 in future, it is obvious that the standard of technical education will be lower even than it has been, because the boy or girl cannot <Col N="1765" /> attend the technical school until after 16.  What I would suggest to the Minister, if he is disposed to raise the leaving age of the primary schools to 16, is that he should remove that barrier certainly after 14 and make the two last years attendance at the technical school compulsory.  It has been long my view that this voluntary system, as we have here, of technical education will not prove effective.  If we want to get these students to do some work in the technical schools as in the primary schools, attendance will have to be compulsory in both.  But if we could get the Minister, as we have been urging, to raise the standard of age to 16 and to make the last two years compulsory, I think that would produce a much better type of boy and girl than we find at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's explanation, in one of his statements, why the boys attending the technical schools show such a low standard of education was that after leaving the primary school a certain time elapses before they come into the technical school.  The Minister was right in one way and wrong in another.  He was wrong with regard to the average student.  The average parent tries to get his boy or girl to attend the classes in the technical school immediately after that boy or girl leaves a primary school, so that if immediately after leaving the primary school the boy or girl is unable to pass a simple, qualifying examination in the technical school it shows how seriously deficient our primary system is.  As soon as a boy or girl reaches the age of 16 he or she qualifies for the unemployment grant.  Attached to that unemployment grant there is the educational qualification whereby the recipient must attend so many hours at certain schools during the week.  It has been found that the standard amongst those boys and girls is exceedingly low.  As I stated before, it came within my own knowledge that the percentage of girls unable to read or write, and who were applying for the unemployment benefit was as high as 10.  That is a very unfortunate state of affairs at the present time, but I actually found that percentage to exist in the city of Dublin.  It is obvious that industry in the future will be recruited <Col N="1766" /> very largely from our technical schools.  At the moment there are signs in that direction.  One of the explanations for the lack of apprentices to be found in industry, which is such a serious item, was that apprentices could not get into industry&mdash;that they could not get apprenticeship in the different trades.  The only means that the conference could devise for getting over that difficulty was to recommend industrial scholarships out of the technical school&mdash;that is, that the technical schools should offer so many scholarships each year and that these scholarships should go to maintain certain boys during the unproductive years in the technical schools.  That recommendation was dropped for a couple of years because there were no funds wherewith to finance these scholarships. The matter was taken up by the City of Dublin Technical Education Committee and, to their credit it must be said, they devoted a considerable sum of money to these apprentice scholarships with very considerable success. That is the system, to my mind, that ought to be adopted and enlarged, because it is one of the few successful means that one has of getting intelligent boys and girls into the different trades.  To show you the necessity for some such system, I will quote some figures in connection with our trades from which it will be obvious that something further is necessary in order to recruit those trades.</P>
    <P>The trades I happen to know most about are those in connection with the building industry.  I find that there has been a reduction in the number of carpenters&mdash;I am taking the census of 1901 and the census of 1911, since unfortunately there was no census in 1921 &mdash;in the city and county of Dublin of 15 per cent.  In the number of bricklayers in the same period there has been a reduction of 30 per cent.  Plasterers have decreased by approximately 15 per cent., and masons and stonecutters by 20 per cent.  I think if you were to take the trades connected with other industries, you would find that, like the building trade, there had been a similar reduction in the number of tradesmen. That is due, primarily, to a falling off in the number of apprentices, and something must be done in the near future <Col N="1767" /> to recruit those trades.  To show you the effect of the falling off of recruits to the trades, we find that in the same years the number of general labourers in the city and county of Dublin has grown by 20 per cent.  You have an average falling off in the trades of 20 per cent., and you have an increase in the number of unskilled labourers of 20 per cent.  That is particularly unfortunate from the national point of view, because while the demand for skilled tradesmen is increasing owing to the shortening of the number of hours and other causes, the demand for unskilled labour is decreasing, through the introduction of machinery and other causes, so that under our system, as it exists at the moment, we are encouraging unskilled labour and discouraging the trades.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to labour this point, but as the Minister said that he was unskilled in these matters, I am anxious to put before him lines upon which he might usefully occupy the vacation and the succeeding months. This is a matter of very great national importance.  We have on the one side a material falling off of the number of tradesmen.  On the other side we have the immense increase of 20 per cent. in the amount of unskilled labour.  There is no occupation for that unskilled labour.  The result is that large numbers of unskilled labourers are being added year by year to those who make the demand for the dole.  So that this is a serious national problem.  We are adding, year by year, to the numbers claiming unemployment allowance and we are not recruiting the trades, as we might usefully do, through the technical schools.  One might speak at considerable length on the urgent need for the development of the work of technical schools, particularly in the direction I have mentioned, of looking upon the technical schools as a recruiting field for industry.  I should like the Minister to examine very fully into this question of apprentice scholarships, and see if that scheme could not be usefully enlarged to a very considerable extent.  That would mean additional funds, but if he came before the Dáil with a scheme dealing with a national problem of that character <Col N="1768" /> there would, I feel sure, be no difficulty in getting the funds that would be necessary.  It is obvious that if we devote money to that purpose we will absorb numbers of young boys and girls through this system into the different trades, who at present have no opportunities, drift into the unemployed market and eventually come on the dole.  We would be doing useful work by making useful citizens out of these and reducing the numbers looking for the dole in future.</P>

      <P>It seems almost futile to be discussing the development of technical instruction until we are assured that every boy and girl will get a proper primary education, as has been mentioned by Deputy Good.  At the present time we know that that is not the case.  It cannot be too often impressed on those responsible, and brought to the notice of the country generally, that so far as primary education is concerned there is a deplorable want in the matter of seeing that all children receive a suitable primary education, and are compelled to attend school in order to receive that education.  We cannot talk usefully of technical education while children may leave school at the age of ten, eleven or twelve years, and while the school-leaving age, as it is at present, is under 12 years.  What happens in most of our technical schools&mdash; it may not be the case in the city of Dublin, which Deputy Good knows more about than I do&mdash;is that boys and girls go there after having been away from the national schools for three or four years.  The result is that in most of these schools special courses, called introductory courses, have to be instituted in order to give these boys and girls some chance of availing of the advantages of the technical education.  These courses are almost entirely doing the work that should be done in the national schools and quite a large proportion of the pupils who were in attendance at national schools will be found to be enrolled in these introductory classes.  That shows that there is no proper co-ordination as between the primary and the technical schools.  It shows the necessity for seeing that boys and girls should remain at school until a suitable standard <Col N="1769" /> of education has been reached and that they should receive, on leaving a national school, a certificate which would show that they had reached that standard.  There is no such leaving certificate in this country. That is one phase of the question. Everything that has been said by Deputy Good is, I think, within the knowledge of most Deputies who have given the matter any attention.  We have, I think, reason to complain that, in spite of the fact that this matter has been repeatedly brought to the notice of the Ministry, the Bill which has been so long promised to secure compulsory attendance at school has yet to make its appearance.</P>
      <P>There is one matter in that connection that the Minister might give his attention to and that is the encouragement of day classes in technical schools, especially for the younger pupils, as against the evening or night classes.  I do not think it is fair to expect a boy or a girl who may go into industry, say at the age of 15 or 16, to attend an evening class after a full day's work.  Arrangements ought to be made, and I am sure could be made, by cooperation between employers and technical committees, to allow a certain time to these boys and girls to attend a technical school during the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this technical education question that ought to be inquired into.  Technical education is, I think, rightly intended for young people who have left the national school between the ages, say, of 15 and 18 years.  But it is well known to most Deputies that the so-called technical schools in the country are not attended by these young people, but rather by adults.  This is especially the case so far as manual instruction is concerned. Many of these classes are simply devoted to showing those who attend them how to make things.  I have known many such classes where those attending made various articles of furniture, with varying success, as Deputy Gorey reminds me.  The point I wish to emphasise is that making articles of furniture, and other articles which would be useful on farms, at these classes should not be the object of technical education.  I am afraid that is <Col N="1770" /> too often looked upon as the real object, and classes are established in a district in order to show people how to make gates and doors and various articles of furniture for the home.  There are some matters of detail which, unfortunately, owing to the way the Estimate has been prepared, we are not in a position to criticise very fully.  In the other two Votes I noticed that a comparison is given with the amount expended in 1923-24.  In this one we are confined to one column.  Perhaps, however, it would be better to discuss the general question first, and leave the details over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always struck me that the people of this country do not place technical education in the position of importance that it should occupy in the national life.  I think it would be better if the point Deputy O'Connell raised was emphasised.  He spoke of the co-ordination that should exist between the primary and the technical schools.  I referred briefly on a previous occasion to the reason why the pupils who attend technical schools do not get the full advantage of the teaching given there.  That is owing to their lack of primary education. The Minister, when replying, said that it would be hard to expect the pupils' earlier studies&mdash;if you give them the name of studies&mdash;to be of any value to them in the technical schools. What I meant was, that it was not a question of the pupils having forgotten what they had learned, but the fact that they had not attended the primary schools regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not a question of pupils going over work that they had done previously, but was due to the fact that they had never gone through the primary course.  As Deputy O'Connell states, the sooner a Bill providing for compulsory attendance at school is introduced the better.  Every section of the community is keen on seeing such a Bill carried into effect, in the most drastic manner, if necessary.  The technical schools have not been a success because the pupils who go to them have to do work that they should have done in the primary schools.  It would be well, as Deputy O'Connell suggested, if the Minister could make <Col N="1771" /> arrangements so that children on leaving the primary school would at once proceed to the technical school.  In the country districts children attending the national schools can attend the technical schools.  I do not know what the position is in Dublin.  I am not aware that there is any rule to prevent children who attend primary schools also attending technical schools.  If the rule is different in the city I am not aware of the fact.</P>
    <P>To my mind, one of the causes of the failure of the technical schools in Ireland has been that the children who go to them do not look forward to any definite calling.  There has been no industrial development in the country for the last few years.  Many things were against such a development.  If there was an impetus for the development of industry the pupils would prepare to take up definite work.  There is now a possibility of industries being started in Ireland, and when firms require a certain type of apprentice I think the advantages of technical education will be considered.  The Ministry of Education will be able to help in that respect by giving youths a definite training for the particular work that will be required in an industry. That has been done to a large extent in America, and also in England and Scotland.  Boys trained in that way will be ready to fill places in certain industries.  Deputy Good referred to the lack of skilled tradesmen in Ireland and to the falling off in the numbers who go to such trades.  That may be due to the fact that better wages are offered skilled tradesmen in other countries.  For many of those who stay at home there is not steady work.  In some cases, possibly owing to trade troubles, and to other causes, tradesmen have gone to America, England and Scotland.  Their departure is a loss.  If the country was developed I do not think that would continue.  If industrial development was apparent young men would be very ready to apprentice themselves to trades at which they could get steady work and good wages.  Owing to the conditions that prevailed for the past few years, tradesmen, such as masons, carpenters and plasterers, have, unfortunately, <Col N="1772" /> had a good deal of idleness.  That state of affairs does not encourage those men to put their sons to such trades.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a very great advantage if a scholarship scheme was introduced for pupils attending the technical schools, in order to make them keener in their work.  A diploma from the technical schools would be an <i>imprimatur</i> for employers when selecting apprentices for industries.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Connell when he complains that the technical schools turn out what he intended to call &ldquo;handy men.&rdquo;  In the rural areas it is a very great advantage if boys are taught to mend gates and doors. There is plenty of other work for the tradesman.  In Denmark boys are taught how to do such work.  I do not suggest that pupils should do skilled labour but in the rural areas it is right they should get an opportunity of learning to do the every-day work of the farm or home.</P>
    <P>We should have something quite the same for boys as we have in the Domestic Economy Classes for women and girls.  In these classes they are taught not only the every-day work of the house, but also lace-making and crochet.  They are taught in these classes everything they ought to know in connection with the home, and the knowledge is of the greatest use to them when they get a home of their own, whether it be in a small farmer's home or in any other home.  They are taught all necessary and useful work such as mending and repairing, as well as how to cook, a subject which many of them need to be taught.  It is necessary, too, that boys should be taught to do useful work at home, such as mending and repairing gates.  I hold that to teach them to do these things would not interfere with the employment of skilled labour at all.  The suggestion that Deputy O'Connell made to the effect that children should attend day classes in technical schools is not, I think, a feasible one.  Great difficulty, I imagine, would be experienced in getting children from the National Schools to attend day classes in the technical schools.  In the towns at any rate facilities are provided for young people to attend technical classes <Col N="1773" /> at night, and it is a pity that these classes are not availed of to a greater extent than they are at present.  I think that the Minister for Education should see that in districts where you have industries in existence that facilities are provided for young people to prepare themselves to take employment in these particular industries.  You have small industries scattered through the country, and it is desirable, I think, that the young people should be specially trained to take up employment in them.  The specialised training afforded to children in cases of that kind would react favourably not only on the young people themselves but on the particular industry in which they happen to be employed, because the special training they had received in their youth would, I am sure, be reflected in the nature and character of the work done in that industrial concern. These are just a few points that I desire to impress on the attention of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words on the general question of technical education.  I agree with a great deal that has been said by Deputy Good and Deputy O'Connell as regards the class of students that go from the primary schools to the technical school. I have the authority of principals of technical schools for the statment that a good many of the students who enter the technical schools are not fitted to receive the education given there.  As Deputy Good and Deputy O'Connell stated, these students, when they enter the technical schools, have to be taught there the subjects which they should have learned in the ordinary course at the primary school.  Deputy Good laboured the question of apprentices to a great extent.  The only solution that I see for this question is that apprentices should be allowed by employers to attend technical classes during their ordinary working hours.  That is the only way, I think, that you will ever get good tradesmen, and this is a question I suggest that should be taken up by employers as well as by the Government and the Minister for Education. My suggestion is that boys serving their time to a particular trade should be allowed so many hours off in the <Col N="1774" /> week for the purpose of getting special instruction in their own trade at the local technical schools.  In a technical school that I have an intimate knowledge of, there is a class for boys who are engineering apprentices.  There is a special class for them, but as they are not allowed off during the day it is impossible almost to get them to attend their own class at night.  I would impress on the Minister and on Deputy Good and others who are vitally interested in this question that it should be made compulsory on employers to allow their apprentices off, say, four or six hours in the week to attend day classes at the technical schools.  In the technical school that I have acquaintance with, I may say that while the ordinary classes are fairly well attended at night the apprentices' class is the worst attended that we have in the school.  I hope that the suggestion I have made with regard to employers allowing apprentices to attend classes in the technical schools during their ordinary working hours will be favourably considered, not only by the Minister, but also by the employers.  The adoption of my suggestion would, I think, in the long run, be to the benefit alike of employers and the young fellows now serving their time to some particular trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few words I would like to say on this question. I have made a fairly rough rule to guide me when I ask any questions about the education of the children of the workers.  I generally ask myself what are the methods adopted by wealthy parents in regard to their children, and I generally find myself answering the question by saying that is just the thing we want for the children of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask myself what is done by a wealthy parent who has a boy who is designed for the law or the medical profession; I ask myself how do they proceed about education for that profession, and I think something similar might well be done, because that is always fairly successful, in regard to the education of the workman's child who is destined to go into some trade.  And, consequently, I consider that the solution of the problem&mdash;that is the problem <Col N="1775" /> in regard to technical education &mdash;is that it should be linked up, as it is designed to be linked up in this scheme with primary education, and what is now called secondary education. It seems to me inevitable, if there is going to be any reasonable solution, that the school age for the average boy and girl should be continued until 16, or 17 or 18 years of age.  It should be compulsory certainly up to 16, and the technical school should be utilised for laying the foundation for any industry, you might say the theoretical foundation of the science which would be applicable in any industry that might be taken up by any boy or girl.  Technical education which is spoken of as a sort of part apprenticeship is, I think, quite different.  It may be run almost imperceptibly into the continuation of primary school life.  The primary school tuition should be run on and then a certain portion of the school time should be devoted to science, to the physical sciences and such other training as would fit the boy or girl for the life that he or she is likely follow for his or her livelihood. It seems to me that only after that the specialised technical education, such as apprenticeship is associated with, comes into operation, and then you have again the same technical school simply in the higher regions for these specialised classes.  I imagine that a technical system such as is talked about should be specialised only for the older pupils, and those who have left school life for a trade that they are likely to follow. With that idea it seems to me there will be no break between primary and technical, or primary and secondary, education.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that even secondary would be a kind of branch of the technical, but I think it would not be well to visualise a technical scheme as something broken off from and distinct from the primary school system.  Then there is the complaint about those boys who leave the primary school and, having had a broken time for three or four years, pass through a blank, learning nothing, and forgetting everything except what they pick up in the streets, and then go back to a technical school where, as Deputy <Col N="1776" /> Good said, they have to begin to learn the basis of education all over again. I hope that the Minister, in looking on this problem, will realise how closely it is associated with a good foundation of primary education, and that primary education will have to run on and work into a technical instruction scheme.  I think that when you come to an apprenticeship period, what Deputy Hughes spoke of will be best answered, that is to say, that the period of technical instruction will have to be during the working day.  At the ages of seventeen and eighteen, I take it it is almost universal that a youth does not want to bind himself, after serving seven or eight hours at a particular kind of work, to go back to school, which is another kind of work like that which he has been at, and not to change from it.  He wants the evening for recreation, for sport, athletics and the rest.  I understand that in the North of Ireland&mdash;in Belfast, at any rate, where you have the trades preparatory schools&mdash;the technical schools have been availed of pretty widely for apprentices, and that that scheme has been successful; that the employers have allowed part-time in the working day to be spent in the schools, and it is generally availed of and has been successful. The only thing I have to say on the matter is what I have said in regard to the necessity for continuing what is called the primary period and running it into the beginning of the technical instruction; and that it is useless to allow a boy to break off school, at eleven, twelve, or thirteen years of age, and not to think of technical education until the boy has gone to an apprenticeship and served a couple of years boiling pans of water and running messages perhaps to bookmakers for the workmen&mdash;for I am sorry that that is the sort of thing that does prevail.</P>

I hope the Minister will be able to give us at an early date some general outline of a bold scheme dealing with the period beyond twelve years of age for children under his care.</P>

      <P>. A good deal of the ground covered in the discussion of this Vote was covered in the discussion of primary education, and of that I do not complain.  I think it is very valuable that we should have this matter brought forward or emphasised before us and, if possible, I hope one of the results will be brought before the public.  The discreditable feature of the matter we have to deal with is that apparently some thirty-five per cent. of the parents in this country neglect the elementary duty not merely of citizenship, but the duty of nature in looking after their own children.  That is a very large proportion of bad citizens, as they must be described.  In the previous discussion I was one of those who emphasised the significance of a break of a year or two between two stages of education, and when Deputy Johnson was describing how young people are prepared for such professions as those of the lawyer, physician or clergyman, that consideration came very forcibly to my mind.  There is no parent who looks forward to preparing his children for any of these professions who would not regard a break of a year, not to speak of two or three years, as something intolerable, something not to be dreamt of, and, I am afraid, that when we get older and get detached from our earlier experience, we sometimes forget the earlier effects of it. Everyone engaged in teaching knows that failure to follow a continuation course of teaching, whatever it may be for, one, two or three months, is a very serious matter.  For a young lad or girl who is attending a secondary school or university, through illness, or anything of that kind to be taken off work for a period of one, two or three months is a most serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still more serious in the case of the stage which pupils should reach in primary education.  If they break off at that stage from the subjects in which they have been instructed and there is <Col N="1778" /> no continuation&mdash;in a limited number of cases it will depend very much on the circumstances of the community, and on the occupation of the individual&mdash;in the great majority of cases there is a complete break and often an effacement of all that is required.  That is why it is necessary to have introductory instruction for students entering technical schools.  I assure you, sir, for the benefit of Deputy Good, that I am trying to learn something and I will try to follow his advice and meditate on many things that I have heard when the recess comes round.  I am a little inexperienced in these things.  If I had the experience in the ways of legislation that I have now, I believe that I might have contrived to have an Attendance Bill before you by this time, and I beg of you to put it down to my inexperience.  I hope, however, that one of the first measures with which we will have to deal after the recess will be a Bill with regard to the age of attendance at the schools.  There is no rule prohibiting attendance at any age but there is an age fixed.  I suppose the wise people who shaped all these things before my time came to the conclusion that they must draw the line in advance of perambulators and go-cars, and they fixed the age of fourteen as the age under which grants would not be paid, that is to say, that pupils under fourteen, under the existing rule, are not entitled to be registered, so that grants would not be paid in respect of them.  They can, however, attend, and to some extent do attend. I think we cannot regard that as ideal. They should not be there; they should be completing their education elsewhere, and I do not think that I could accept, as a general principle, the desirability of students attending in the morning at a primary school, and attending in the evening at a technical school.  It seems to me that four and a half or five hours a day is quite enough teaching for any youngster under fourteen years of age.</P>

      <P>Those are rather exceptional cases.  It occurred to me also in listening to the discussion &mdash;but others will probably be better informed on this subject than I&mdash;whether any combination could be attempted of allowances for unemployment and technical education.  The statistics which Deputy Good gave with regard to the reduction of skilled workers remind me that it is many years since I found that out.  Any person who follows our statistics will find that for a generation and longer, while the population of the country is decreasing, a far larger ratio of decrease has been taking place in the number of skilled workers than in the population generally.  I do not think that technical education, while itself a good thing, will be found a remedy for that.  The reason is, we have been drifting from manufacture into distribution. Our commerce is mainly a distributive commerce, and the economic conditions, rather than the educational conditions, have been responsible for the fact that the largest diminution in any element in our population, which is itself a world phenomenon, has been the reduction in skilled workers.  That is a fact that, if it is to be ascribed to education, is not to be ascribed to the education of the working classes, but to the education of the other classes in this country.  I have here the last public returns for 1922 with regard to the attendance in technical schools. Some figures in it are instructive.  Out of 14,589 young men who attended, only 546 were entered as boys who had just left schools or college, and 791 were boys who were still at school or college.  It is noteworthy that the proportion of those who attended and were not attached to any occupation, or not engaged in any stated occupation, numbered 1,832.  That is a very high proportion.  In the case of girls the total number was 21,000.  Those who had just left school numbered 1,043. Those still at school or college were 734, and those not in stated occupations, 6,171&mdash;a very large number, between <Col N="1780" /> one-third and a quarter of the total.  The total number of young men was 14,589, and the total number of girls, 21,464&mdash;that is to say, about fifty per cent. more girls than young men. With regard to apprentices, I have gathered that that is true which Deputy Johnson stated, namely, that it has been found very satisfactory in other places, including Belfast, to allow apprentices to attend technical and trade preparatory classes, and to count their attendance as part of their apprenticeship.</P>
      <P>I hope it will be gathered from what I said that I regard any break in the education of any young person, from the time that education begins until his life's occupation is taken up, as a very serious matter and, if it is imposed by conditions which we can control, a great injustice and a great failure.  I think it would be the duty of the Department of Education to draw up a general outline of education which will leave none of those gaps.  I do not say it would be possible in the conditions under which we now stand to carry a scheme without some gaps in it into immediate operation, and I need not remind Deputies that it will appear to the taxpayer, at the moment he is paying taxes, as something more costly.  The increase of school attendance even under the present conditions will raise the expenditure. The filling up of those gaps will raise the expenditure very much more. So at the moment the taxpayer who is paying his taxes will feel it is costing him a great deal more, but we hope that there will be other moments when he will feel that he is being amply repaid for what he spends in that way. I admit I am merely a novice in all those matters of technical education, but I will try to be as meditative as I can whether on holidays or not.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for having given us a promise that the long looked for Bill in connection with school attendance will be one of the first to be dealt with next year.  I hope it will embody one of the features, at all events, we have been urging in connection with technical education.  The Minister has told us with regard to the barrier I complained of, about a boy who had not <Col N="1781" /> reached the age of 14 being unable to attend a technical school.  The Minister told us that that was part of an old Act that was in existence when he came into office.  I hope this new Act will do away with the bad system, and I need only remind the Minister that under his own primary system a boy who attains the sixth standard can leave school.  A number of boys attain the sixth standard at the age of twelve or thirteen.  What is the result?  In many cases they have the privilege of leaving school.  Parents take them away to make some use of them.  Some leave at twelve and others at fourteen. Now, we have a rule in force that debars even that child from technical education.  It is obvious that there must have been some justification for this rule, so that a boy having attended so many hours in a primary school should not be called upon to attend a technical school.  In my young days that was not considered much of a hardship, but in those days it appears to be a very serious grievance to call upon a boy to work in the evening if he has done work in the daytime.  There seems to me to be boys who are anxious to take advantage of further education in the evening.  Why should those boys be debarred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From every point of view that barrier of refusing technical education to any boy until he has reached the age of fourteen is exceedingly unwise.  With regard to the question of apprentices&mdash; I need not remind the Dáil it is quite a big question&mdash;it is not one that one would attempt to discuss here.  The barrier that has been pointed out is that employers have not given permission to those boys to attend a technical school during their term of apprenticeship in the daytime.  That is not a serious barrier at all.  That is got over in the ordinary way by the recommendation of the conference.  Deputy Johnson has rightly pointed out that in the early days of apprenticeship a boy learns very little of his trade, and is called upon to do things that are not identified with the trade he is learning. That difficulty is being got over in our technical schools here in Dublin by educating a boy in a technical school for the first two years of his apprenticeship. Those are the two useless years. <Col N="1782" /> He is paid under a scholarship maintenance grant for those two years in the technical school.  He learns there the theoretical side and a considerable portion of the practical side of the work he intends to follow and goes into the employer's workshop as a very useful apprentice.  As one who has had experience of boys who come in with and without that experience, I say there is no comparison whatever between the two of them.  The one is a useful, intelligent, well-conducted boy who is immediately able to take advantage of the opportunities afforded to him in the workshop; the other is, more or less, indifferent to his trade, not having the same educational advantages and not knowing the same about the trade. There is no comparison between them, and therefore I urge the Minister to take up strongly this question of apprentice scholarships.  He stated he was unable to see the connection between apprenticeship and unemployment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I have taken him up wrongly.  There was a Minister on the front benches the other day who could not see the connection between the development of commerce and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already given figures which show a serious falling off on the one hand in the number of skilled trades and a serious increase in the unskilled trades.  As I say, employment in the unskilled trades is decreasing.  Consequently if we are adding to the number of unskilled year by year, we are adding to the number of those for whom no employment can be found, and who will be perpetual drawers of the dole.  That is not good for them, for our country, or for anybody.  Instead of giving that number year by year to the ranks of unskilled labour an endeavour should be made to get the larger number into the ranks of skilled labour.  Skilled labour at the present moment, instead of being recruited from the boys of the cities, is recruited from the provinces and those boys are going into blind alley employment, eventually drifting into the large army of unskilled for whom there is no employment.  If the Minister devotes his great ability to this problem <Col N="1783" /> he will soon see an important connection between apprenticeship and unemployment, and unemployment can be largely reduced by the development of apprenticeship.</P>

      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £1,816,960, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1925, to defray the salaries and expenses of the Post Office, including Telegraphs and Telephones.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I thought it advisable to make a preliminary statement on these estimates. I propose to follow that rule on this occasion.  When discussing these estimates twelve months ago I predicted that a scheme of retrenchment which was then in contemplation would result in the ensuing twelve months, in a very radical cutting down of the then existing heavy loss on the Post Office.  In the interval, as the Dáil is well aware, because of the many questions that have been put here on the subject, this retrenchment has been followed up very vigorously.  I predicted that the loss for the current year would be reduced to something in the neighbourhood of £750,000.  At the moment, of course, in a department of this kind, a commercial department with very far-reaching accounts, accounts extending into other countries, it is not possible to give the exact figure.  But roughly, the figure may be taken as £768,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the loss, as far as we know, up to date on the working of the service for the past year.  During these twelve months Revenue increased by £219,000.  This is up to anticipations. During the same time retrenchments and greater output resulted in a saving <Col N="1784" /> of roughly £200,000.  In addition to this £419,000 the sum of £150,000 was needed to meet gratuitities on retirements under Article X. of the Treaty; and a further sum of £50,000 was needed to meet gratuities on retire-during the campaign of 1922 and 1923. In other words we have worked a service to the tune of a nett improvement during these 12 months of £600,000. I must confess that this sum exceeds our own anticipations.  We believed at the best that it would be possible to reach the half-million figure, but as events have turned out we have exceeded that sum by £100,000.  I think it will be agreed here and elsewhere that so far-reaching an improvement as the sum of £600,000 in one twelve months is a fairly satisfactory achievement.</P>
    <P>The loss on the Irish Post Office for the year 1921-22&mdash;and at this time we had not to take Partition into consideration&mdash;has been estimated at £1,400,000; in 1922-23 the loss was reduced to £1,132,000; for 1923-24 the loss was worked out at £768,000; and estimated deficiency for 1924-25 is £696,000.  In view of rather substantial improvement in Revenue during the last few months and also in view of the fact that we have been able to expedite certain retrenchments I believe I can confidently say here that the loss for the coming twelve months will not reach the £600,000 figure.</P>
    <P>During the year one would imagine that we had dismissed some thousands of men and that we had closed some hundreds of offices.  As a matter of fact retrenchment took many other lines and lines far more beneficial from the standpoint of Revenue&mdash;retrenchment in railway cost, carriage of mails, and matters of that kind.  Only 65 sub-offices have been closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the anticipated number will not reach a score, I should say.  The number of part-timers was 550; and the number of posts reduced in frequency has been 1,350.  We have followed in this retrenchment a very carefully thought out plan provided by our predecessors. In estimating the value of rural posts or post offices certain figures had to be <Col N="1785" /> produced, and if these figures did not materialise retrenchment followed.  We have not departed from that plan in this retrenchment, and as a matter of fact we find that the same thing is in operation in England at present.  Even there in that wealthy State with its big Post Office service, this retrenchment is in full operation.  The allowance made here in estimating the value of rural post is 2d. per letter and 4d. per parcel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure followed by England in pre-war days was a halfpenny per letter and one penny per parcel.  If the former rates of 2d. and 4d. did not in themselves suffice to pay the wages of a rural post, the postman in that walk is curtailed to four, three or two days per week, according to the output.  In this reduction we have avoided any curtailment as far as factories, creameries, and industries of that kind are concerned, even though these result in a loss.  In many of the provincial towns we have found it advisable to reduce the number of deliveries from three to two, or from two to one per day.  We consider that one delivery per day is ample&mdash;more than ample in most cases, for our experience is that our staff are engaged in distributing English advertisement matter or bills.  We cannot afford to pay a staff for a repetition of this work, at least unnecessary repetition, and we have reduced these posts in the provincial towns, but in order to enable shopkeepers and business people generally to get their post with reasonable frequency, we have introduced that system which operates very fully in Australia, known as private boxes.  We have tried to get every merchant or shopkeeper, one might reasonably say, to secure one of these boxes, and to add to the convenience, also a private bag.  The former cost of a private box was £3 10s. a year, and in order to encourage him to avail of that new departure we have reduced that charge to £2 2s. In the case of private bags we have reduced the fee from £1 10s. to £1 1s. These charges are lower than operate in England at the moment.  It has been frequently suggested to us that we should bring about a reduction in the postal rates.  That reduction would mean, if it were to fall to the English <Col N="1786" /> level, a loss to the revenue of £300,000.</P>
    <P>This is a matter, I think, for the Minister for Finance, I should say, more than for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If the Minister for Finance at any time thinks the finances of the State can afford to drop £300,000, that is his affair.  I should say, however, that whilst comparisons are made between the postage rates operating in this country and those in England, that the position here is quite as favourable as in most other countries&mdash;in fact, I do not know of any country in which the position is favourable, except England. For instance, in Australia, Belgium, Holland, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland, the current rate is 2d.; in Denmark, France, Norway, and Spain, 2½d., and in Italy 5d.  Twopence for a letter pretty well corresponds to the increase in cost of living, as against 1d. in pre-war days.  I do not know whether the State would be justified in giving a definite grant, because that is what it means, to one section of the community, I mean the commercial section.  However, that is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Dáil.  In another direction, that of parcels post, we have felt that the time has come to give a definite lift to trade, as far as the Post Office is able to do that.  For some years past it is clear to everybody that this country is being flooded by English parcel post. That increase, I think, has resulted very largely from the increased circulation of English newspapers here, and, with the increased circulation of newspapers, an increase in the circulation of circulars. As a matter of fact, at present we receive from England almost twice the amount of mail which we send to that country.  We consider the time has come when definite encouragement should be given to warehouses, and to the smaller people in this country who may be inclined to use the parcel post to do so.  We have decided, subject to the final approval of the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I think we may take it his approval will be forthcoming&mdash;to reduce the parcel post rate to the English level.  On the other hand, it is proposed to impose a charge of 6d. for examination and delivery.  This charge will apply equally to all external countries. <Col N="1787" /> We have found recently that it is possible, and quite feasible, to extend the night mail train service, and bring it back to pre-war days, and also to restore later on the parcel post on Good Fridays, and on certain Bank Holidays. These services are not as general in the neighbouring countries as they are here.  It is a concession which is not enjoyed to that extent in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Also we have availed of the opportunity of the increased number of Sunday trains to send letters not only to important parts of the country but outside the country.  In other words, whenever a Sunday train runs we avail of it for the carrying of communications. One could not expect that we should go to the expense of running mail trains on Sundays.  I do not believe that that will ever be reverted to.  It was a very expensive medium, and the volume of correspondence was necessarily small, nor is it under consideration or in contemplation at the moment to extend the Sunday postal arrangements beyond their present limits.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to me during the year to facilitate people attending fairs.  Formerly there was no differentiation, as far as the Post Office was concerned, between a fair day and an ordinary day.  We have come to the conclusion that a fair day is a very exceptional occasion, and that everything possible ought to be done to enable cattle dealers, pig dealers, and others to get through their work, and we have as a consequence agreed to an earlier opening of the Post Offices on these occasions.  During the year direct mail services were inaugurated between this country and France, Germany, the United States, Canada, and Newfoundland, and we are considering the making up of these services to Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and the Federated Malay States.  It may not be understood that the system prevailing in the service at the time of our predecessors necessitated the transhipping, so to speak, or the re-sorting of Irish mails in London.  This meant a certain amount of delay, and it was open to risk from other standpoints.  At any rate, I think it will be agreed that we have had some justification for <Col N="1788" /> making up direct mails with a great many countries.  This policy is being followed.  The same applies, of course, to parcels.  The question of aerial mails came up at frequent intervals during the last twelve months, and we felt after going into the matter very fully that we would not be justified in recommending any aerial scheme involving money.  It has been tried on certain short routes, and it is not voted a success; as a matter of fact it has been dropped in a few cases.  We have, however, brought to the notice of some Continental countries, and England, the advantages which may be derived from an aerial service between Cobh and their respective capitals, and this matter was taken into consideration by more than one country.  I do not think that it can be regarded as finally disposed of yet.  We stand to gain no advantage from a service of this kind, except the fact that it would result in more mail steamers calling to our southern port.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that we have gone in for a system of motor vehicles.  We find these economical.  We find that we have been, by the extended use of these light motor vehicles, able to extend the time of posting in Dublin and elsewhere, and we intend to extend that system.  Likewise we have, I think, stood alone in introducing motor cycles for the delivery of telegrams.  The former system here had been to transmit these telegrams from the central office to the sub-offices, resulting in loss of time and loss of money.  The system of motor cycles has proved itself to be far more advantageous, and more economic, not only in time, but also in money, and this system is being extended until such time as the sub-offices, which in Dublin formerly handled something like four or five thousand telegrams a day, will be discontinued for that purpose.  During the year we restored communication to 518 telegraph offices and 300 railway signal cabins.  These were the residue of destroyed offices not dealt with in the last report.  At present we are arranging to re-fit coastal life-saving services to the number of 100 circuits. These will also be utilised for coastguard purposes, I expect, later on.  The <Col N="1789" /> subject was discussed on another Vote the other day.</P>
    <P>We have devoted a certain amount of attention to the extension of our wireless service, and in the Estimates there is a sum dealing with direction-finding stations at Malin Head, Valentia, and Carnsore.  We are also about to instal a wireless station at Cobh with a view to tapping incoming ships.  The necessity for this has been brought home to us on more than one occasion by the shipping companies in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal very fully with telephones, as the matter has already been covered in a recent debate. I merely want to say that during the year we opened 3,255 new stations.  We closed 1,470, which were mainly military stations, but these 3,255 will be considered as a definite expansion, and a very big expansion, considering that prior to our time only 20,000 telephones existed in the State.  During the coming year I should not be surprised if we instal anything up to 5,000.  This is largely a matter of technical equipment&mdash;the shortage of technical training. We have also opened during the year 35 private branch extensions with an average switchboard capacity of 11 lines.  Fifteen new extensions and 79 call offices were also opened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain cases we have found that the Minister for Finance has been prepared to make a reduction in the cost of installing these small provincial exchanges.  For instance, approval has been got for this reduction in the cases of Rathdrum, Dingle, Moate, and Dunlavin.  We anticipate that this will apply to a great many others&mdash;in fact, we hope that it may apply to all future similar exchanges. The proposed reduction would place these small exchanges on the same basis of charge as that applying to cities and larger towns.  One of the barriers to the extension of the 'phone in provincial towns has been this heavy charge.  We have decided to chance a very substantial reduction, practically a 50 per cent. reduction, in the case of these new installations in the hope that the public may more <Col N="1790" /> fully accept the telephone system.  I should also explain that quite recently we announced a reduction in charges for call offices.  They are at present, I think, on a practically equivalent basis to the English charges for a similar service.</P>
      <P>Our Savings Bank during the year collected for the State a sum of £2,085,000.  It refunded £505,000, leaving a net surplus for national purposes of one and a half million.  Likewise, through the medium of Savings Certificates, we collected a million pounds.  Therefore, the total sum of money collected by the Post Office for these two purposes amounted to £3,000,000, and it has cost the State comparatively little to collect this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any estimate of what that cost is; I mean, roughly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Not without notice. In determining the cost of any particular item from a multiplicity in a service of this kind it is necessary to get returns.  Possibly I could have if I had got notice.  These figures are at our disposal, though I have not them here.  We are continuing to use the old over-printed postal order, but in the very near future an Irish postal order will be available.  I notice that no sum of money is set aside in the Estimates for the rebuilding of the General Post Office.  We had hoped that this would be the case, but I expect that it has not been found possible. I may say, however, that we are still suffering rather severely through the absence of space.  It is impossible to conduct a very big department of this kind in pockets&mdash;to do it with thorough satisfaction and with the maximum of efficiency.  You can do it, but not without added cost, and I must say that the feeling of the Department is that the sooner the Head Office is set up the better it will be for all practical purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examinations are now in vogue for practically all entrants to the service; many of them have been held.  As a matter of fact, this system of open competitive examination is wider than that which pertained at any time under <Col N="1791" /> British rule.  During the year the Contracts Department of our factory and stores dealt with stores amounting to £373,000 and tested practically the entire woollen and cotton goods of the Forces of the State.  So far we have not heard any grievance under either of these headings, so we assume they are giving satisfaction.  We come now to a further reduction in our charges. Six months ago we introduced a Cash on Delivery service.  At the time it was thought advisable for one reason or another to make the initial charge somewhat high&mdash;mainly, I would say, to give the department an opportunity of getting into its stride in tackling a service of his kind.  The initial charge was and is still as a matter of fact up to the end of this month, for parcels not exceeding £1 in value, 1/-. This shilling is in excess of the postal charges and it will therefore be seen that both charges were rather on the heavy side.  In the interval, however, we have again gone into the matter, and it has now been decided to reduce these charges in the case of parcels up to £1 to the level of 6d., from £1 to £2, 9d., and for sums exceeding £2 but not exceeding £5, 1/-.  Considering that nearly 50 per cent. of the parcels which will normally find their way through this system of cash on delivery, and that the new postage rates and the new cash on delivery rates make 1/- in all, one may reasonably hope to see a very big extension of that service.</P>
    <P>The duty of collecting rates is an experiment that has been switched on to this department, and during the last four or five months we have been trying that experiment in the Counties of Sligo and Kerry.  We have collected up to the 30th April the sum of £121,000.  All the reports that I received to date, both from the county councils and from my own department, are satisfactory and are in favour of not only a continuance of this system of collecting rates, but its extension. I might explain here that though we are not doing the whole work in connection with the collection&mdash;there are some things we do not do, some smaller points&mdash;I would like to emphasise that while it formerly cost the <Col N="1792" /> citizen 8d. in the £ for the collection of his rates it is now costing him 4d., and I do hope, and I believe, that this work will be done far more efficiently and with far less trouble to the country than in the past.  The experiments in two counties, the most backward and difficult from the standpoint or rate collections, has proved a success and has proved that we are able to handle this problem satisfactorily. Likewise, we have had recently to take on the work of unemployment insurance; it also is in the experimental stage, but I think I am right in assuming that the whole of the unemployment insurance work will be devolved on this department in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have only to say further that one hears in the Dáil constantly the grumble and the grievance that workers are not giving a satisfactory output. One would imagine that a State department should not be the department to give a lead in increasing output.  From the returns we have taken quite recently we find that the very high level of efficiency which obtained in the British service in pre-war days has not been reached but it is very near it; we are entirely satisfied that we are approaching that high-water mark and we are also satisfied that we are getting a very fine and very satisfactory return from our staff.  It would be unreasonable not to pay a tribute to their work.  When men and women give an honest output and a fair decent return for the moneys paid to them I think it should be stated and I wish to say so here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcGarry" hpid="Mr. McGARRY Mr. McGARRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGARRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended when I came into the Dáil this evening to move a reduction of £500 in this Estimate, but I do not propose to do it now. I do not think it is quite necessary.  I have some notes about the statement made by the Minister, but I think other Deputies are going to refer to what I intended to refer to.  I will only refer to three points.  The first is that the Board of Works accepted responsibility for the maintenance of the several Post Offices throughout the country. The amount spent on the maintenance of these Post Offices is charged on the Appropriation Accounts against the Board of Works.  The Post Office being <Col N="1793" /> a revenue-producing department, it really ought to put in a true and accurate balance-sheet.  I refer to this because last year, for instance, there were certain sums of money spent by the Board of Works on Post Office affairs which were not debited to the Post Office, but which were charged to the Board of Works account.  I think if we are going to know what any particular department is losing or gaining that the expenditure in respect of any item in the administration of that particular department should not be hidden away under another Appropriation Account. I am very glad that the Minister has stated that he is going to reduce the parcel post rates.  He mentioned that the post here from England resulted in an avalanche of English advertising literature.  I wonder would he consider for a few minutes the point whether if he reduced the rates he might not have an avalanche of Irish advertising literature?  One can send a letter across from England to Ireland for 1½d.  If I want to send a letter across the city I have to pay 2d.  I think it would be well for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to consider whether the £300,000 that would be lost to the revenue by the reduction in the postal rate is not a myth.  He put forward as a satisfactory achievement that he spent £600,000 on improvements last year.  Well, now, I wonder what value the public got for that £600,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to say I did not say that.  I said that the financial improvement in the work of the service last year amounted to £600,000.  Deputy McGarry has got the thing the wrong way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcGarry" hpid="Mr. McGARRY Mr. McGARRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGARRY</NameTxt>
      <P>That was due to the fact that the Minister had his back to me and I could not hear him.  Now, there is another point I am coming to and I understand that the Minister may contradict it.  That point is that it has been the practice of the Post Office to purchase stores from the British Government when the contract prices at which they are offered here are not as low as the British Government contract prices at the other side.  I do not know who pays the carriage.  Perhaps the Minister would contradict me if I <Col N="1794" /> am wrong.  None of the goods, I am told, purchased from the British Government have been manufactured here. In nearly every case there are agents here who are paying rates and maintaining premises and a staff on the little bit of profit they get off the stores we purchase from them.  I think if the Minister is going to make the Post Office pay at the cost of putting these people out of business here&mdash;as it would mean that in some cases&mdash;that is not economics. He talks about reducing losses. Apparently if we live long enough we may be able to see all the losses cut away, but we will have to live a long time.  Retrenchment has taken place to the public disadvantage, as I am sure some Deputies will tell you later on. You can very easily have retrenchment if you are going to dismiss 550 employees per annum.  But you will, very probably, have these same people getting the dole.  I do not know whether that is retrenchment or not.</P>
      <P>Now, one particular thing I want to say is this and it may be regarded as more or less personal.  During the debate on the Broadcasting Scheme the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs admitted that he sent an agent down&mdash;I do not know what his particular title would be&mdash;Intelligence Officer or Investigation Officer&mdash;to the lobby to listen to the conversation of members of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I was in hospital at the time.  It concerns me personally, and if you will allow me to make a personal explanation I would be obliged. At the time, being in hospital, I did not have an opportunity.  The same officer came to my office without any business reason but as an <i>agent provocateur</i> to put into my mouth words that he thought I should have been saying or was saying.  I think it was most improper on the part of the Minister, apart altogether from the <Col N="1795" /> fact that he was using a public official for his own private affairs.  He sent an <i>agent-provocateur</i> to put words into my mouth which he thought or which somebody told him that I was saying. I think I will leave it at that, because if I were to say any more I might say something that I would be sorry for.  I will stop at that by saying that it was a most improper thing and I do hope there will be no repetition of it.</P>

      <P>I cannot help regetting that in dealing with this Estimate we are dealing with it very largely in the dark.  It is a very long Estimate.  It covers twenty pages and if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could have seen his way to letting us have a White Paper containing some of the facts and figures which he has given us in the statement he has just made we should have been much better qualified to deal with it.  That has been done by the Minister for Defence, and I cannot help thinking that where very intricate figures are involved our criticism would be more useful and more helpful to the Minister if he informed us on these points.</P>
      <P>I have taken a note of the figures the Minister gave us just now but I must deal with the figures as I find them in the Estimate.  He stated just now that there was a saving on the Post Office service of, roughly speaking, £200,000. In the Estimate the saving is £36,000 short of that, and I am afraid that a great many of the savings are of a more or less illusory character.  In some cases there seems to have been a determination to bring down the Estimate so as to make a good show on paper.  Law charges are reduced by half.  They were £600 last year, and this year they are £300.  I do not know how the Minister can guarantee that there is going to be a reduction in those charges unless he intends to refrain from proceeding against people who offend against the Post Office, which is hardly a moral course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a still larger reduction under the heading of Losses by Default, Accidents, etc.  That item was £25,000 last year, and it is only £10,000 this year.  I do not see how the Minister can possibly be sure of making that reduction. <Col N="1796" /> How can he be sure that losses will not occur in the post?  If he really intends to reduce that charge by more than 50 per cent., his law charges will go up, because he will have to fight a great many claims which may be made.  That policy of cutting down seems to run through the whole Estimate, so that all the reductions are more or less illusory.  I wish to refer to another point, and in connection with this I think also if we had a White Paper it would instruct us.  We have here absolutely no statement of the receipts of the Post Office.  We have the expenditure of the Post Office, but we have no idea what the receipts are.  The only item we have is the loss on the current year, which is £750,000, and the increase in revenue, which has been £219,000.  Those figures the Minister gave us in his opening statement.  I suppose if I had time&mdash;though, like the Minister for Justice, arithmetic is not one of my strong points&mdash;I could work out the receipts of the Post Office having this figure of £750,000 as a basis. But I think we should have a clear statement of what the Post Office costs, and what it brings in when we are judging it.  It is common knowledge that the reduction in this Estimate has been obtained by a serious curtailment of services in the rural districts.  I am sorry the Minister for Fisheries has gone away.  I thought he would be here to support me when I protest against Sligo and Kerry being described as the most backward parts of the country. Of Kerry, I know little.  All I know about it is that it is very near Cork. Of Sligo I have some knowledge, and, certainly, Sligo, in many respects, is not one of the most backward parts of the country.  Apparently the Minister thinks so from the manner in which he treats its postal services.  I am very well acquainted with a small town seven miles from Sligo.  In the old days you could post a letter in the morning to Sligo and get your answer that evening. Now, if you post your letter on Monday morning, you will get your answer on Wednesday morning.  That is not entirely satisfactory to the people of the district.  They think it places a handicap on commerce.  If they write to shops in Sligo ordering <Col N="1797" /> goods they do not get a reply&mdash;saying, perhaps, the goods are not in stock&mdash; until Wednesday, and they are thus placed at very considerable inconvenience. Even though the Minister for posts and Telegraphs thinks Sligo is a backward place, it is a place which nine trains run into and nine trains run out of every day.  But in order to obtain economy the postal service there has become extraordinarily ingenious and intricate.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the economies he has made, but I am not sure that they are really worth while.  The economy is not commensurate with the amount of inconvenience that has been caused, for the reason that while sixty-five sub-offices have been closed down and 550 men dismissed, the overhead charges continue on practically the same scale as before.  You have to pay the same railway charges, the same amount for conveyance of mails, the same rent for sub-offices, whether you have one mail every three days or three mails every day.  The same rent has to be paid, and the same salary has to be paid to those attending, so that a really greater inconvenience in proportion to the expenditure required is caused by this effort to cut down.  Take an instance of this.  I spoke of the rent of post offices.  Sixty-five sub-offices have been shut down.  I suppose no rent is paid for them.  Nevertheless, the estimate for rent, fittings and so on, is increased from £25,500 to £27,300. Though you have shut down sixty-five sub-offices you still pay more rent for those you retain.  The sub-head I have referred to deals, of course, with rent, office fittings, light, and so on.</P>
    <P>In the whole proceedings of the Post Office there is, I think, a lack of system and a lack of thorough supervision.  I will give an instance of that from the suburbs where I live&mdash;Dalkey and Dun Laoghaire.  About eight months ago all the plates on which the hours of collection were inscribed were removed from the pillar boxes.  They went away and they stayed away.  I asked the Minister a question about them here and about a month after I asked the question the plates came back beautifully inscribed in Irish and English, and giving <Col N="1798" /> all that one required in the way of information.  That was about a month ago.  About a week ago they vanished again&mdash;for correction, I suppose. Why could not they have been done as they were intended to be done in the first instance?  That is the sort of thing that shakes confidence in the Post Office.  It makes one feel that there is no settled policy, and that money is being spent needlessly.  I presume it cost something to inscribe those plates, in the first instance, and if they all have to be called in, it seems money is being thrown away.  Again, it is within the knowledge of Deputies that about eighteen months ago all the pillar boxes in Dublin were painted. They are now being painted again.  I do not know if that is to be kept up. If it is, it is going to involve a certain amount of cost, though the Minister may console himself by getting the money out of the Board of Works.  I am not so sure about that or about who does the painting, but the ratio of re-painting is rather high, and the average citizen would rather have an extra delivery every day than bright, green pillar boxes every year.</P>
    <P>The absence of an evening delivery in Dublin is felt very seriously by some people.  I am afraid the Minister will not sympathise with me on this point, because he holds, I think, that one delivery per day is ample for anybody. At the same time, people in the country do feel at a disadvantage when their letters arrive here at 7 o'clock or 7.30 in the evening and are not delivered until the following morning.  Their letters are also delivered on the following morning in London.  The Minister was very impressive and very eloquent in emphasing that our business people should not be placed at a disadvantage by reason of the post with those in England. But here he is practically encouraging the man in the country, who, perhaps, reads an English newspaper, to send his orders to London rather than to Dublin, because they will reach the merchant as soon in London as they do in Dublin.  It is true that the Minister for Finance will prevent the articles being delivered as quickly from London as from Dublin.  Dublin has an advantage as far as that is concerned, but so far as the Minister's <Col N="1799" /> policy is concerned it favours the English merchant rather than the Dublin merchant.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to one matter on which I would like to have a little more light.  He said that the Ministry had gone in for motor vehicles.  I do not see that he has gone in for that.  I cannot find a word about motor vehicles in the Estimate.  The only thing I can see is that the conveyance of mails by road has been reduced by about £7,500.  I do not know whether that means that the Minister has gone in for motor vehicles.  I was very glad to hear him say that he has done so, because it was exactly what I was going to urge him to do.  In a country where the mail service is such that you cannot, as the Minister says, run trains specially, the conveyance of mails by motor, within a radius of fifty miles from Dublin, at any rate, would be more useful and more efficient.  Twenty years ago the English Post Office were using motors for the night mail to any place within fifty miles of London.  I think such an arrangement would be satisfactory here.  Certainly it would be the most satisfactory arrangement for the conveyance of mails from Dublin to Dun Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The present state of affairs is a ludicrous, and even a farcical, one.  Do Deputies know what time you have to post a letter in Ballsbridge in order to catch the night mail to England which leaves at 8.45 p.m.?  In order to catch that mail you have to post your letter at 3.30.  Ballsbridge is about five miles from Dun Laoghaire, and the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs takes five hours to send a letter five miles.  Of course, I know it comes to Dublin, is sorted, put into the Dublin bag, and left in a van at Westland Row for an hour.  It is not a very efficient or satisfactory achievement.  I cannot help thinking that if consideration were given to the matter there would be some improvement.  We are in the anomalous position that you can post at Skerries&mdash;twenty miles from Dublin &mdash;later than you can post in Ballsbridge and catch the English mail.  In fact, I believe, unless they have altered the arrangement recently, you can post <Col N="1800" /> at Mullingar, fifty miles from Dublin, later than you can post at Ballsbridge and catch the English mail.  I think the introduction of a motor delivery service to Dun Laoghaire would obviate this difficulty.  You could have the letters sorted at Ballsbridge.  A van could call for them, and you could post possibly up to 5 o'clock, as we do on the other side of Dun Laoghaire, where we have a much better service. I do not know if the Minister has ever been to Westland Row at 6.30 in the evening.  If so, he would see a most depressing sight.  He would see a train shunted into a siding and bag after bag of mails being carried in two hours before the train is due to start.  It really is unnecessary.  A little real thought and reorganisation would obviate that.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point that I wish to refer to, and that is the statement of the Minister that a charge of 6d. on parcels from England had been introduced.  He did not know whether it was in operation or not.  I believe it is.  The introduction of that charge without consulting the Dáil is a breach of faith on the part of the Government. When the Finance Resolutions were being discussed, I pressed the Minister for Finance on that point.  He said it was not a matter that would require legislation, but that between himself and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the charge would be introduced. I said: &ldquo;Will you give a pledge that the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing and deciding the matter before it is introduced?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I think I am safe in giving that pledge.&rdquo; It is a breach of faith to introduce it after that pledge being given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that this charge, as far as the Post Office Parcels Department is concerned, has been introduced.  I said it is in contemplation&mdash;that the matter is being referred to the Ministry of Finance, and that in all probability our proposals in this respect will materialise. But I did say that I believed a similar charge operated at the moment in respect of parcels brought in by other means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was a deliberate breach of faith.  The <Col N="1801" /> Minister for Finance is ill and I do not think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was here when the pledge was given, and it might easily have been accidental.  As a matter of fact, the charge has been collected, and I can give the Minister one instance in which that charge of 6d. has been collected on a parcel from England, if he wishes to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I apologise to the Minister.  If that charge of 6d. on English parcels is brought in without being brought before the Dáil, and the Dáil having an opportunity of pronouncing upon it, the Minister for Finance's pledge will not have been fulfilled. I am not sure that it is a sound policy to check any natural channel of commerce.  I believe, in the long run, you will do the Irish shopkeeper a good deal of harm, because he has not big enough trade to enable him to stock all that is required, and there are not at present, and there do not seem likely to be big wholesale houses which would stock goods in all branches. Therefore I do not think this policy of checking English parcels posts&mdash; while I am delighted the Minister has seen his way to reduce our internal parcels rates&mdash;will work well, at any rate for the first two or three years. It will impose a sudden check upon a natural flow of trade and, when sudden checks are imposed on natural flows, the consequence is generally that something bursts somewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Under heading &ldquo;A2&mdash; Metropolitan Offices,&rdquo; I notice a decrease of £17,220 is shown.  I should like to know to what extent this decrease is due to the reduction of Sunday work at the Head Office, and what further reductions will result from the total abolition of Sunday duty at that Office.  I should also like to know if night mail despatches are made up for England on Sunday nights in Dublin; what is the cost of that service, and if similar facilities on Sunday nights could not be afforded in Irish provincial <Col N="1802" /> offices.  Under heading &ldquo;A3&mdash; Provincial Offices,&rdquo; I note a decrease of £89,350.  I take it that a considerable proportion of this reduction is due to the restriction of the rural deliveries, with the consequent disemployment of auxiliary postmen.  Generally speaking, the rural posts have been reduced by half, and for business purposes this restricted service is practically useless. It is quite natural to expect&mdash;in view of the present financial stringency&mdash;that economies must be practised, but I think that some more equitable arrangement than the present arrangement could have been adopted.  Under this arrangement the rural population seem to be the principal sufferers.  Not alone have they to suffer as regards the postal service, but also as regards the telegraph delivery service.  Special extra delivery fees are being charged in rural districts, which make the telegraph service a luxury.  It is a service now that is not within the reach of the ordinary poor people in country districts. I think that is not as it should be.  In order to get over the difficulty, I suggest that a common delivery fee should be charged, say twopence on each telegram, and that it should be collected at the office of origin.  Such a scheme would not present many difficulties, I take it, from the administrative point of view, and it would tend to remove some of the grievances that the people in the rural districts are labouring under at the present time. It would certainly be more equitable. I would be glad if the Minister would consider the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to let the Minister off as easily as my colleague did.  In considering this question, I would ask the Minister, or those responsible for Government policy&mdash;I am quite sure the policy of the Post Office can scarcely be the policy of one particular man&mdash;to pay some attention to the suggestion that Deputy Wall made, and that is, that all receivers of telegrams within the Free State, if there is going to be a charge, should be charged at a uniform rate.  I do not know that any reasonable man can defend the practice that, while telegrams within one mile from a Post Office are delivered free, beyond that distance a <Col N="1803" /> charge of one shilling begins.  In some cases the charge amounts to 3/6, according to the distance from the Post Office.  For what reason is a man outside the charmed circle asked to pay the extra charge as compared with a man who lives within the mile?  Is he penalised because of the situation of the Telegraph Office or for some other cause over which he has no control?  Is that the form of citizenship and justice that the rural population are to receive at the hands of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?  When the Minister is replying, I hope he will be able to tell us is it the policy of the Government to discriminate between citizens? I will come to the figures that were given by the Minister later on.  The Minister omitted to deal with these questions in detail, as the Vote, while it covers a good many pages, is not explanatory.</P>
      <P>He has not told us why offices and sub-offices throughout the country were closed.  When asked, the Minister told us how many sub-offices had been closed, but he did not tell us why collections have practically ceased in rural areas, and why we have only biweekly or tri-weekly deliveries.  If the Minister knew the country he would know that delivery does not mean collection. If a postman is in the habit of going to a particular house and has no delivery, no collection is made there. As a result, the people must find other means for posting their letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From many districts in my constituency I have been inundated with complaints about the changes in the postal service.  All over the constituency sub-offices have been closed and services curtailed.  In almost two-thirds of the constituency people have to post their letters themselves, and have to walk four and five Irish miles to do it.  Otherwise they must wait on the chance of getting some passer-by to do so.  Still we are told that the citizens are being treated fairly and impartially !  At the present time telegraph services are being carried on at the expense of citizens outside the one-mile radius.  I will explain that later on.  Citizens who live outside the arbitrary limit fixed by the postal authorities <Col N="1804" /> are denied the rights of citizenship. I say that deliberately.  The rural population in this country get very little benefit from the services. The one service they have the benefit of is the postal service.  Is it the policy of the Government to deny them a satisfactory postal service?  We know the facilities and the services that are provided for the towns.  They have good postal, telegraph and telephone services.  It is true that in proportion to area they contribute more in the way of fees.  That does not give them any right whatever to get these facilities at the expense of the rural population.  Citizens in the rural areas bore their share last year, and in previous years, of the £1,400,000, or almost one and a half millions, that the postal service cost the country.  They are doing that for years.  The Minister told us that the loss last year on the Post Office services was £700,000, and he assured us that it would be £600,000 for the next year.  As taxpayers the rural citizens have to bear their share of that loss.  I would like to know, what is the method by which one citizen is put on a different level from another?  It would be as sound a proposal for the citizen to refuse to contribute his share to the National Exchequer as for the Minister or the Government to refuse any citizen his share of the national services.  You cannot discriminate.  If citizens in the rural districts say, &ldquo;We will not pay for the services of this State,&rdquo; that would be as logical and reasonable as if the Minister said, &ldquo;We will not give you your share of the services except at a price which is more than the ordinary citizen pays.&rdquo;  We will come to the price later on.</P>
    <P>All of us do not live in villages, towns or cities.  A good deal of the population of this country lives in rural and scattered areas.  Is it the policy of the Government that in order to be entitled to the rights of citizens we must live in towns or communities where the population reaches a certain figure?  Is that the suggestion?  I would like to know is that the policy of the Government, or is it the policy of the Minister?  Not alone have we in the rural areas to pay for our own <Col N="1805" /> postal service in the ordinary way, but we have to pay a share of the annual loss on the service.  In addition, we are charged up to 3s. 6d. in some cases for the delivery of telegrams.  I know citizens who, at a small calculation, pay £5 yearly for the delivery of telegrams alone.  I know others who pay from £10 to £15 for the same service. The Minister has spoken about the telephone service and what it will do in the future.  If the postal and the telegraph services are any criterion of what the telephone service is going to be, it would be very little advantage to the rural population.</P>
    <P>This Estimate looks as if it were Governmental policy on this question.  It would appear from it as if the people in this country who have the most in wealth, comfort and luxury are the people who are going to get the most, and that the people who have nothing in the way of wealth, comfort or luxury are going to get nothing, as far as the services provided by the Post Office are concerned.  That is the policy of the Post Office summed up in plain English. I am sorry I cannot use plain Irish, but if I could my words would be the same.  I understand there are very small savings on this question of rural postmen; that instead of being paid full time they are only paid half time.  I would like to know how much is the saving as regards the employment of half-time as against whole-time postmen.  I do not think this Estimate will be complete until we have figures to show that.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the delivery of letters, or rather the lack of delivery of them, is not the only important thing that we complain of.  The collection of the letters is of equal, if not of greater, importance.  It is no uncommon thing for people to have to send some member of their family on a bicycle four Irish miles into Kilkenny or some other town in order to post a letter.  Up to a month ago that system did not obtain. We had a system then, and though it was not very satisfactory, still it was fairly satisfactory, and we were content with it, but the Minister and his Department have changed all that. Only yesterday evening I was told that another sub-Post Office in my district <Col N="1806" /> was about to be closed.  This closing sub-Post Offices in rural districts is a matter of constant complaint.  I want a clear statement of policy from the Government on this question, and I challenge any Deputy in the Dáil representing a rural area, it does not matter whether he comes from the Labour, Farmer, Independent, or any other bench in this House, to support a policy such as that which is now put forward by the Minister.  It is up to every Deputy in the House to speak out on this question and to say whether or not he backs the Government policy on that.  We can, and ought to have, retrenchments, but unfair and unjust retrenchment, such as this is, and discriminations of this description are something that ought not to be practised or supported by any self-respecting body of citizens.  We in the rural areas do not grudge citizens in towns or cities the deliveries they are getting now.  They have free delivery of telegrams and all the other facilities that I have referred to, but what we do say is, that they deserve no more than we do.  Their wealth enables them to live in Dalkey, Killiney, Seapoint or Monkstown, but that is no reason why they should have better and cheaper facilities than any other citizen in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in the course of his speech, gave us some figures.  He told us that a sum of £200,000 was effected in retrenchments this year, and that revenue had been increased by £219,000.  Out of that sum of £200,000 I think he said that they had made new arrangements with the railway people, and that portion of that sum effected in retrenchments could be attributed to these arrangements. I would like to know if that is right.  There have been other forms of retrenchment, and I am very anxious to know how much money has been saved by the curtailment of the rural postal services.  I want the Minister to take a note of that question and to give me an answer to it.  I am particularly anxious for an answer to that, because I maintain that the telegraph staff has not been largely reduced. I want to know also how much <Col N="1807" /> retrenchment there has been in extras in the telegraph service.  I maintain that the extra charges for delivery outside the mile radius has not reduced the staff on that account.  I also want to know if the increased revenue referred to will be laid up for the relief of those who are charged for the delivery of telegrams.</P>
    <P>I want to prove to the Minister and to the public that almost all this change in last year's balance sheet is due to penalties inflicted on the rural population.  As I said earlier, one man &mdash;it happened to be myself, so that I can speak from experience, and I am only an ordinary citizen of the country&mdash;would be getting off very easily at £10 a year as the delivery of telegrams to him only costs 1/- a telegram. At the present time we know that postmen do not walk all the way with their deliveries.  There was a time when they used to, but at present they have different modes of conveyance. They have bicycles, and as regards the cities, we have been told that motor bicycles have been provided.  I wonder what has the rural population got out of the introduction of motor bicycles, or even what benefit have they got from the introduction of the ordinary bicycles.  How do we compare now with 10 or 12 years ago?  The Minister talks about the restoration of a night mail service.  What is that service for? Is it for the rural areas, where you get a bi-weekly or a tri-weekly delivery and no collection?  Is it for that that this night mail service is to be restored? I want to know what is the difference in wages between a part-time and a whole-time postman in rural areas.  The Minister referred to extending the hours as to posting time for cities, and he attributes that to the introduction of a motor service.</P>
    <P>I desire to say quite plainly that all the catering in this service is done for the cities and big towns.  There is nothing at all done for the rural population. In fact, the only attempt made is to curtail the services in the rural areas, to sack their postmen, curtail their deliveries, and make their collections nil.  I, with Deputy Cooper, desire to ask for detailed information with regard to this Vote.  I suppose that <Col N="1808" /> when the Minister comes to answer my question I will be given the economic reason, that it does not pay to deliver letters or telegrams in rural areas, and that it does not pay to keep sub-post offices in rural areas.  We will be told that the Budget must be balanced. If the Budget is to be balanced at the expense of the rural population the Minister and the Government ought to be quite honest and say so plainly. They ought to be quite honest and say: &ldquo;We do not want to give you the rights of citizenship.  All our time is devoted to finding facilities for the cities and towns and providing them with motor services and suitable times for the collection of their letters.&rdquo; Let them talk out and say plainly that the rural population is outside the pale of citizenship in this country.  I want them to defend their position clearly, and if there is any Deputy in the House who is prepared to support a policy of that sort, I will be glad to hear him give his reasons for so doing.  I repeat what I said earlier, that I challenge any Deputy in any side of the House who represents a rural constituency, to support such a policy.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say at the conclusion of his statement that he was satisfied with the manner in which the staff had been carrying out their duties, and to hear him pay a tribute to the staff for what they had done.  I think if the Government or his department took steps so as to diminish, or to remove the discontent which is undoubtedly in the Post Office, not, I admit, to the same extent that it existed some five years ago, he would find greater reason for expressing satisfaction with the work of his staff, for undoubtedly there is a considerable amount of discontent amongst the staff. It is due to various causes.  I think he will see it is reflected in the statement he makes himself as to the extent to which Post Office servants have retired under the terms of Article X. of the Treaty.  I believe that a large proportion of these retirements is due to the fact that there was this element of discontent among the staff, and an element of uncertainty as to their future prospects and treatment.  The action of <Col N="1809" /> the Government in refusing to accept, and to put into operation, the Douglas Report, is responsible, to a very considerable extent, for this dissatisfaction and discontent amongst the staff. I need not, I think, dwell upon that any further.  It was discussed at very great length, and debated at great length in this Dáil on previous occasions.</P>

      <P>In that Douglas Report there was a unanimous recommendation urging the Department to set up special machinery within the Post Office for the discussion of points of difference between the staff and the administration, for the devising of machinery for the adjustment of those differences.  As far as I can learn, that recommendation has not been acted upon.  I would be glad if the Minister would say what is his intention with regard to the recommendations of the Douglas Report. Then statements are being made that there has been a certain amount of victimisation of Post Office servants who took part in the strike of 1922.  It is not easy to get definite cases of that, but there is one aspect of the case that has been brought to my notice that I think is deserving of the attention of the Minister.  It is the case of those who have had their increments stopped on account of that period, and that is a matter I think that should be examined by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the complaints made by Deputy Gorey and Deputy Cooper I am largely in sympathy.  I think that the economies which have been effected by the dismissal of rural postmen, and the curtailment of rural services are not worth the inconveniences which have been caused by those so-called economies, but I think the fault is due to the fact that the Department have tried to approach this business of the Post Office from the commercial point of view solely.  They look upon the Post Office as a commercial concern, and a concern which they hope to make pay for itself at least.  That, as one can judge from the Minister's statement, seems to be their ambition.  If that were to be <Col N="1810" /> logically carried out they would deliver no letters to the scattered rural areas at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean they would not deliver even once a week there because it would not be a paying proposition.  I believe the cost of the Post Office in the rural areas would be greater than the income even if there was only a weekly delivery and that is why I say it is because they are trying to approach this matter from the purely commercial point of view that these inconveniences are caused to the public in the rural areas.  I agree with the general principle enunciated by Deputy Gorey that the citizen who contributes equally to the national Exchequer is entitled to equal services from the State.  There is, undoubtedly, very great complaint from the rural population regarding this curtailment of service and the dismissal of rural postmen.  There is one aspect of this question of the auxiliary postman, as he is called, that deserves consideration. It is unsatisfactory, I think, to have those men employed for half time, or quarter time, and I think that with proper organisation and the introduction of the motor bicycle to the rural areas it could be so arranged that you would have whole-time men employed, and do away with the position of auxiliary postmen or rather with the auxiliary character of their position, and that whole time employment could be found for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the inconvenience to the staff caused by the want of space in Dublin.  Undoubtedly, there is very great complaint from the staff on account of the inconvenience which they are put to because of the restriction in space but, I think, that is not a matter for the Minister.  I only referred to it to emphasise the point he made as to the necessity for making early provision for proper facilities in the Dublin sorting offices.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Cooper, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the extraordinary delay there is in the delivery of letters.  I would suggest to him that the postmark of the office of delivery should be stamped on each letter clearly <Col N="1811" /> and legibly in the same way as in the office of dispatch, so that we could trace the cause of the delay; otherwise there is no use in going to the Minister and saying, &ldquo;I received a letter on such a date with the postmark of the office of dispatch,&rdquo; say, on the 10th of the month.  He will not believe you; whereas if you had the office of delivery postmark on the letter you could find out where the delay was caused. I received a letter on the 16th July, with the Athy postmark of the 14th, and it took two days to get to Newbridge. Do you call that an up-to-date postal service?  I say it is disgraceful and a scandal, and the sooner you put a stop to it the better.  Another matter is the cheeseparing policy in regard to rural postmen.  Does the Minister expect men to work half-time and go pulling blackberries for the remainder of their time?  You will not get good, loyal servants to carry out that policy.  I would like to call the Minister's attention also to a habit which some rural postmen have.  If there is a prominent resident at the end of his walk, he will deliver his letter to him, but will not think of going to a poor lone woman with the letter which perhaps will find another billet.  Several complaints have reached me about this practice, and I think a little vigilance should be exercised with regard to this habit of, to put it mildly, misplacing letters.  The only way to put a stop to the unreasonable delay in delivery is, as I have said, to have the postmark of the office of delivery on each letter.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a question with regard to the telephone subscribers, whose grievance is that the Post Office furnish their accounts to them only every three months.  This necessitates a large amount of money belonging to the subscribers lying on deposit, because the Post Office are in the happy position of demanding from subscribers an amount of at least 33 per cent. of the probable amount due to remain to their credit at all times. If the Post Office would furnish accounts every month instead of every quarter a large amount of the money on deposit would be released.  I have no doubt that it would help very considerably <Col N="1812" /> in improving the telephone service.  I would suggest to the Minister to have the accounts sent out monthly, and subscribers would not then be asked for large sums of money, sometimes up to £50 or £60.</P>

      <P>I will give a concrete example to the Minister.  A Deputy said that because we live in country districts we are denied the rights of citizenship, but I will give an example where people living in towns are denied such rights.  A train leaves Dublin at 7.30 in the morning, carrying mails to the south.  It arrives in Ennis at 12.45, and there catches the train leaving for West Clare at one o'clock.  There is a town in North-West Clare with one thousand inhabitants, and the mails get there at 2.15.  They are then taken from the station to the Post Office, where they arrive at 2.30. It seems strange that these letters should lie there from 2.30 on Monday until 10.30 on Tuesday morning.  There is a return train to catch the mail train, and if you get a letter arriving there at 2.30 on a Monday you cannot reply to that until the following day.  Five o'clock is the hour of the return mail train.  That is a serious state of affairs in a town with one thousand inhabitants. References have been made to the curtailment of the services, and I am in entire agreement with them.  I think that the towns are also sufferers by this parsimonious policy.  I hope the Minister will try to remedy the present unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>

      <P>There is one matter to which I would again like to draw the Minister's attention.  He stated that he thought that one delivery per day was sufficient for rural districts.  Some time ago I drew his attention to a case in which letters when delivered are a day old.  They leave a particular town before the mail train arrives.  Conse quently the letters delivered by the postman are those of a previous day. This entails a serious inconvenience to a large number of people.  The Minister was kind enough to say that he would look into the matter and communicate with me later, but I am afraid he has forgotten all about it.  I also desire to say that in my opinion it is a <Col N="1813" /> serious thing to do away with so many offices, and great inconvenience is being felt in the county which I have the honour to represent by having so many post offices closed.  There are some offices which the Minister is willing to open, but he has not yet done so, and I think it is very doubtful economy to have these offices closed.  When they were open they gave a large amount of employment, and they should again be opened, especially when unemployment is rampant all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell rebuked the Minister for approaching the question of the Post Office service solely from a commercial point of view.  There is one matter in respect to which the Minister has not approached the question of his department in the Estimates he laid before the House from a commercial point of view.  In regard to a great many of these Votes it is almost impossible to know exactly what the nature of the Vote laid before the Dáil is until there is such a statement of incomings and outgoings as will enable each of the separate items of the Vote to be tested in regard to their proportion to the whole.  Particularly is that true of the Post Office.  I think it would be truer of the Post Office because of the greater element of a commercial nature which it has over any other department.  To expect the Dáil to be able to examine the working of the department simply because of estimates based on the forthcoming year as compared with the past year without knowing what proportion this Vote and the items in this Vote bear to the total expenditure of the department, is to ask the Dáil to do a thing that is impossible. Strictly, I would like to see that principle extended.  I agree entirely that the citizen is entitled to a certain service, and from that point of view, the purely commercial consideration cannot weigh.  I agree with that, but there is one point of the commercial procedure, one point of business expectation, that ought to be observed, and that is that departments of this kind, coming before the Dáil and asking its approval of its expenditure for the forthcoming year ought to lay before this Dáil what would be equivalent <Col N="1814" /> to a company's balance sheet.  We have no such sheets at all.  We get items in respect of salaries, wages, and allowances coming to more than one and a half millions.  In order that we might be able to discover whether those wages, salaries and allowances are a proper proportion, it is necessary that we should know what the turnover of this concern was for the twelve months.  Then any business man might be able to sit down and work out for himself a fair percentage proportion of the cost of working a department in relation to the turnover of that department, looking at it purely from the point of view of a business concern. That we have not got.  I only take that particular item now as an example. I do not choose it as the most unfavourable example, though perhaps it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told, in regard to salaries, wages and allowances, that there is a decrease of £113,674.  That means nothing. Strictly, it means nothing whatever, because the proportion of the turnover of the Department might be so very much less that that decrease might not mean what it appears to mean as set out in this exact fashion. There is one particular reason why the form of estimate for which I am asking, and which I hope will be given in the case of the Post Office in the future, and of certain other spending Departments, appears desirable when one considers the big question of policy the Post Office has to deal with. I refer to the rates to be charged for letters and parcels.  I stated a year ago, when the Post Office estimates were before the Dáil, that I believed a reduction in the letter rate from twopence to 1½d. would mean no falling off in actual revenue.  That may or may not be the case.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might say that is not true, we would not get the revenue. I might say the contrary.  We each would be guessing, and there would be no sure test.  But, if we had the kind of estimate I am asking for, and if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in regard to one particular item did as he forecasted to-day he would do with regard to the item of parcels, and we had next year the income of that Department <Col N="1815" /> as compared with the previous year, we would know exactly whether the reduction in the rate of carrying parcels meant more parcels were being carried.  Similarly with regard to circulars, we would know that exactly, if we had the income of each Department set out in different heads with the outgoings in separate heads. Until the items in the Department are set out in that way we will not have a complete return.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that he desires to regard the Department as primarily a commercial concern.  There are other matters that follow from that.  I desire to touch upon one or two of those quite briefly.  One is in regard to the alleged saving that is made in country districts because of a curtailment of the service.  We do not know exactly what the result is.  We know what the result is from the point of view of finance.  Every Deputy who has in his constituency any part of a country district must be constantly receiving letters, complaining under this head, and this head alone.  If we can get the turnover of the Department stated fully before us, we would be then able to see what I venture we might even guess at fairly accurately now, that is, that the saving itself is little and the percentage of saving with regard to turnover is negligible, and certainly negligible in regard to the considerable amount of inconvenience and irritation it is creating.  One also gets, in County Dublin particularly, many strong and bitter complaints with regard to both collections and delivery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper referred to delivery of the mails in the suburbs of Dublin. He might equally have referred to the delivery of mails elsewhere.  There are many business men whose business letters are often sent to their homes, and who do not get them for the purpose of dealing with them until after he has left for the city.  It is becoming more and more the case that letters sent over from England and up from the country are delivered later in the morning than used to be the case.  That is creating great inconvenience.  The Minister may reply with a great show of reason, that it is impossible in the present state of the national finances to have all those <Col N="1816" /> niceties of efficiency that are required. I say that although those economies may be desirable, apart altogether from the inconvenience they are causing, we would be able to see the true nature of them, if we got a kind of a balance-sheet here, together with the Estimates, such as many Departments should lay before the Dáil, and which I urge this Department should lay before the Dáil. To a certain extent, we had this last year when the Minister put a White Paper before the Dáil dealing with the details of his Department.  This year we have not had that, and we should have a fuller and more complete statement instead of a less full and less complete statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister thinks about the proposition to submit a business balance-sheet in regard to the Post Office service.  No doubt he will in due course&mdash;perhaps has done already in regard to the previous year&mdash;provide somewhere, hidden away, perhaps laid on the table, and forgotten, statements showing the revenue from the postal service proper, and the telegraph service proper, and from the telephone service, but if he accedes to the request to endeavour to present a balance-sheet, I hope it will not be expected of the Deputies to assume that this balance-sheet does represent, actually and precisely, the position of the various departments. I do not think we will be able to learn exactly how the particular Department stands.  These are phrases that were used by the Deputy when claiming that a balance-sheet should be presented.  I defy anybody to regulate exactly and precisely how much of the time of country post offices is devoted to the postal service as distinct from the telephone and telegraph service.  Where you have the great majority of the country post offices with the same persons doing all the various classes of work, it is not possible to keep a record of the time occupied by the people in this particular service in supplying twopenny stamps, or in answering telephone messages or in receiving telegrams. I suggest that the costing method is impossible.</P>

      <P>It is not done every day in business.  You cannot go into a grocer's shop and say how much time was occupied in handling out a pound of fruit and how much time in handing out bacon.  It is not done in mixed departments of that kind, and I say that if you try to estimate the time spent and the cost of allocating to the postal side as against allocating to the telegraph side, you may have a cost, but it will be a cost that will not be precise and accurate, and will, therefore, be useless for any purpose of comparison. I want to draw attention to the principle which has been advocated by Deputy Gorey, and which in general I subscribe to, that is to say that this is a social service, a service of communications and, speaking generally, all the citizens should have equal access to that service of communications.  But I wonder whether Deputy Gorey or any other Deputy is prepared to apply that principle to its logical conclusion. It is a principle that, I think, should, as far as possible, be applied, but I suggest that we have to consider whether the fullest application of that principle would not involve too great a cost upon the whole community.  We supply main roads for main traffic, but we do not supply an equally good road up every mountain side to every house. Why?  Because there is not the traffic, and because it would be an impossible, unprofitable, and uneconomic proposition from the social standpoint.  But they are all equally entitled to it, if it is due to any, on the principle of equality of service.  I think that it is a question as to what line we are going to draw.  Undoubtedly, on the standpoint of social equality of the service we should have a telephone line up every mountain side where there is a house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I know you did not suggest it, I know you have more common sense than to suggest it.  But if you are going to maintain that principle fully it has to be done.  Therefore, it is a question as to where we should draw the line as to the amount that is to be given, and, therefore, I say there is the difficulty the Postmaster-General will find himself in in arguing with the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1818" /> Inasmuch as we have habituated the country to this social service in regard to postal delivery, and to a very great extent in regard to the telegraph service. I say that we should not retrogress, and deprive the citizens of the service they have had in the past, and that that is a line that should be drawn. The line that should be drawn is a line that was already fixed as a social advance, and we should not go back on the line of advance we have already reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should think that the Minister would press and insist upon that position, and that he should come to the Dáil for its backing against the Minister for Finance, if necessary, to maintain the line we have reached in regard to such social service as letter deliveries and telegraph services.  Do not let us recede from the position that we had already achieved.  There is surely going to be further advances in respect of communications.  Let us consider the question as to the rapidity or extension of these new developments, but let us at least maintain the advance which we have reached.  The Minister has been challenged to say what the saving has been.  I do not know whether he will be able to give it, but roughly judging by the figures he has given as to the amounts saved, at least the reduction of loss as between 1922-23, 1923-24, 1924-25, and the amounts of saving in other respects, I suggest that his saving on curtailed deliveries is not more than £100,000.  Is it as much as that?  I further say that a saving of £300,000 is dearly bought at the expense of the community in these social services.  You cannot run the Post Office, you cannot run this business of communications and distribution of messages, as a commercial proposition throughout the country, so that you have to face a loss, and charge that loss against the communal interest. And I say that in a scattered community, though it is no doubt a fact that we are losing the advantages of the crowded community which we have cut ourselves off from deliberately, and knowing what was to be the cost in these matters, we should not retreat in this matter of social advancement.  We ought to bear the cost of these rural <Col N="1819" /> services, and I think that the mind of the Ministry should not be directed towards cutting down the benefits of services of this kind, but rather how to supply these services by new methods equally efficient.  The motor method of service should be applied, and I think could be applied, to save a lot of the drudgery of the postal service in rural districts, and will give very nearly, if not absolutely, as good convenience to the public as was hitherto given.  I think that the complaint that is made with regard to the charge for telegraph delivery outside a mile is a well-grounded complaint, and the new charge is utterly indefensible.  The old charge beyond the three-mile limit was bad enough, but this new proposition that you are going to charge beyond the mile practically says that you must warn all your correspondents never to telegraph.  I would strongly urge upon the Minister that he should alter that regulation.  I think it is a scandalous imposition, and could not be justified by any commercial, certainly not by any social, test whatever.</P>

      <P>The criticism of this Estimate has fallen under two main heads, and the chief criticism is that directed against retrenchment.  Now, it is no pleasant duty for a man at the head of a Department to be compelled to face all kinds of criticisms because of what he has done in pursuit of what he considers a duty.  It would, undoubtedly, be more popular and be an easier course simply to leave matters stand as they are, to swim with the tide.  I should like to remind the Dáil, however, that this is the only commercial undertaking within the State, run by the State.  And the public have not been slow to make comparisons.  A few years ago, when this service was losing heavily, the public and the Press, and even members of the Dáil, took frequent occasion to remind us that the loss was due to the fact that this service was run by the State, that, in fact, were it not run by the State the loss would not have existed.</P>

You cannot have a big, burly postman trotting up a mountainside, morning after morning, paid 30s. or £2 a week, with perhaps a few halfpenny circulars in his pouch, and show anything like a reasonable balance.

      <P>One would imagine that when we are making certain reductions in rural deliveries that we are bringing about a state of affairs that never existed before.  We all know very well that, until very recent times there were few or no rural deliveries. This rural delivery is a very recent development; and when we are seeking to curtail these deliveries in certain quarters, we are not striking out on any new policy.  The British, after they had spread their wings very far, proceeded to curtail, and were actually <Col N="1821" /> cutting down rural services before this State took over.  If we have expedited matters in the interval, it is because we felt that, in common with every other department of the service, we were bound to retrench there.  We cut down second deliveries in the towns; in some cases we cut down two out of three deliveries.  So that the townspeople have also suffered.  We have also penalised the townspeople in common with the rural population; and I do not think we have unduly discriminated against the latter.  The saving in the rural post through this retrenchment has amounted in the past year to £46,000.  That is a consideration, a very important consideration, in the total saving.  In addition, we have saved the sum of £69,000 by the reintroduction of the charges for the delivery of telegrams.  Up to eight or nine years ago, this same charge, or, at least, a charge per mile, was imposed for the delivery of telegrams.  At that time it was abolished for some reason or other, but when we introduce it again it is nothing new to the public.</P>

It is because we were able to show a very effective saving that the Minister for Finance agreed to experiment with pretty large sums in the way of this extension. That is only one point.  All the other innovations referred to have been made possible by the fact that we have shown a far-reaching saving in the service.  This justified us in asking to be permitted to strike out in a new channel.  We have no intention of finally depriving the rural people of postal services.  As a matter of fact, we hope that in the very near future it will be possible to give a better service than ever they got before.  It may be possible to introduce the system obtaining in a few other countries, whereby a single motor cyclist could cover the work of, say, half-a-dozen men and give a daily service.  That is a thing of the future.  It is a scheme we have given careful thought to, but we cannot introduce it at the moment without disemploying men.  It is the obvious way of tackling this rural problem; having pillar boxes every mile or two of the road for the letters of that district, and having these letters delivered every morning and the letters collected every evening by a mounted postman.  There is nothing new in that idea, but we have to take our time, and we do not wish, as I say, to disemploy more people.  That is all I have got to say as far as retrenchment is concerned.  It has been suggested or urged by more than one speaker that in a case of this kind a balance sheet should be produced.  We have not had to wait until now to see that this is necessary, that it is the obvious thing to do in a commercial undertaking, but it has never been done before.  It was never done in the British time.  At the same time, I feel such a balance sheet should be produced and circulated.  I do not say that you can do it at the production of the Estimates, that it might be done at this particular time, but that it should be done at some time in the year, and the same principle as applied to an ordinary commercial undertaking <Col N="1823" /> is reasonable to expect, as far as we are concerned; I do not see any difficulty in having it done.</P>
      <P>I believe that we can, for instance, circulate to the Dáil in the course of three or four months, a balance-sheet showing the working of the services during the year ending 31st March last.  It takes a long time to make up the accounts of a service of this kind, for the reason that you have got foreign accounts, but I do not see any reason why the Dáil should not be placed in possession of such a balance-sheet, and except there are difficulties which I do not foresee at the moment, that will be done.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the skeleton balance-sheet which has hitherto been produced in England, only a skeleton balance-sheet for the information of the service itself, contained these particulars, and, in fact, I think it would be impossible to give all these details.  I think the balance-sheet must confine itself to profit and loss, revenue and expenditure.  I am sure the Dáil would accept that as being a fair effort at the information. Some Deputies criticised, or attempted to criticise, our deliveries and collections, and set them forth in the light of a disimprovement.  I refer to the collection and deliveries here in Dublin. As a matter of fact, it is the other way around.  Our collections here for outgoing mails are very much better from the point of view of time than they have been since pre-war days, and in certain parts of the city they are even better than they were in pre-war days.  Collections here in the centre of the town, for instance, for outgoing mails, are much better than ever they have been hitherto.  As far as deliveries go, these deliveries have been fixed in consultation with the Chamber of Commerce and with the people mainly concerned, and they are perfectly satisfied.  We have had no complaint from them.  Deputy Cooper wants to know why the sum set aside <Col N="1824" /> to meet losses through destruction and pilferage are less this year than they were in the previous year.  That is because the condition of the country has improved and there is more safety Deputy O'Connell has urged that the increments stopped because of the period of the strike should be readjusted. That is a matter for Finance rather than for my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That this £69,000 is the amount that has been collected by reason of this charge for delivery? We want to be very clear on that, because I am not prepared to accept it, except I see the accounts in black and white.  The Minister's speech, to my mind, was the most disappointing speech I have heard for a long time, and from the method of its delivery he gave me at least to understand that the policy in connection with this Vote is his policy, and not the policy of the Government.  I want to be quite clear on that.  I want to know whether this is the Minister's policy, or the policy of the Executive Council, or does the Executive Council support the Minister's policy.  I think I never heard a more retrograde, a weaker, and a more unsubstantiated statement in my life.  Economy is running through the whole of it, regardless of how the Minister gets results from that economy.  Method and justice did not seem to enter into his calculations from one end of his speech to the other.  He referred to the services in the rural areas as &ldquo;these luxurious and unnecessary services.&rdquo;  I wonder is the Minister in his right mind and responsible for some of his statements when he speaks of luxurious and unnecessary services&mdash;that a bi-weekly or a tri-weekly service to a considerable number of the population is luxurious and unnecessary.  Perhaps the delivery of telegrams also is luxurious and unnecessary, and the payment of this £69,000 that the Minister admits receiving is not luxurious and unnecessary. It tells us that it is only recently we got a service in rural areas; that only recently was there a telegraph service up to the three miles limit.  I fancy I remember as long as the Minister, and I do not know what his interpretation of the word &ldquo;recent&rdquo; is.  I <Col N="1826" /> know that the three miles limit was in existence 30 years ago.  I wonder what the Minister will call &ldquo;recent.&rdquo;  I wonder if he is referring to the time of the last Tailteann Games.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we could understand him if we took a period like that.  I could understand him saying that we have advanced a little since then.  He also said that if we have suffered in the rural areas people in the towns and cities have also suffered.  He has curtailed them also.  He has cut them down from three to two, and he calls that suffering also!  The citizens of Foxrock and around that charming aristocratic neighbourhood are not a bit better citizens than the citizens of the mountains and rural areas, and they do not deserve a better service, either in justice or from any other standpoint. They are not better citizens than the rest of the country, and whether they are or not we all deserve the same service.  I would like the Minister to say we do not, and to justify his assertion. I do not accept the £69,000 as being the amount only that has been recovered from the delivery of telegrams. It may be true or it may not, but I want to see the figures, and I want to see them audited.  The Minister tells us that this motor service could do the work of half a dozen men.  I am satisfied to have the Post Office experiment in this motor service in the hope that it will bring us some kind of delivery in the rural areas.  Perhaps the work of the half dozen men who have been sacked could be restored to the community, and a good many of the speeches in connection with this Vote seem to be because of the people who have been disemployed, or the people who have been put on half-time.  I think that is a very small attitude on which to approach this matter.  I approach it from a different aspect.  I approach it from the point of view of the people who have been deprived of State services, services they are entitiled to. The Minister's whole speech was based on discrimination, based on his right of discriminating between the rural and the urban population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the Minister a plain proposition.  According to him the citizens outside of the mile radius have <Col N="1827" /> not the right to be put on the same level as the citizens inside it. But if you look at the geography of the country you will see the number of people who live outside the mile radius of the post offices, and if you try to make a calculation of the amount that these citizens contribute to the national Exchequer, contribute to the million deficit on the service last year, what would the proportion of that be of the whole?  Perhaps the Minister would give us that with the big staff at his disposal, and I think that it will be found that the amount we in the outside areas are contributing to the upkeep of this service would provide a service of our own, without the assistance of the Minister and his staff.  I offer it here as my convinced opinion, that this £69,000 is money robbed from the citizens.  I am not prepared to accept this Vote except the Minister agrees to suggest that a Commission be set up to inquire into the manner in which this service should be run. Except he is prepared to do it now, I will move that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I have anything fresh to add, except that the whole losses on the Post Office services are incurred through rural deliveries, and in addition, we have spent on these deliveries the cumulative profits of the cities and towns. For instance, last year the Post Office in Dublin netted a sum of £75,000.  All the cities, except Limerick, and a great many of the larger towns, produced a nett profit, and all that profit, in addition to the deficit to which I have referred, has been spent on maintaining a rural service.  I think that is a sufficient answer.  As for the sum of £69,000, there is no doubt whatever about it.  That figure was given here some time ago.  That is the saving effected through the introduction of this collection on the delivery of telegrams.</P>

      <P>As far as retrenchment is concerned we have practically come to the end of the cutting down of rural posts and the closing of suboffices. Very few more of these will materialise, and when one considers that we have almost two thousand suboffices and that 65 are closed I think there is not a great deal of room for grumbling.  Undoubtedly, many of these offices were being paid for doing practically nothing.  They were superfluous and should have been abolished long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>To draw attention to the amount of money spent on the Metropolitan Offices as compared with the Provincial Offices.  I see here just a half million of money.  That represents the cost of the Metropolitan Offices, and I see that there is not quite a million for the rest of the offices in the Saorstát. I wish to know does that mean the Metropolitan area that is covered by the Corporation, or does it embrace the townships or do the townships go with the provincial offices?  That is a matter that is vitally important in dealing with this Vote.  On this question of the Metropolitan Offices, I can see in some streets in the city here that I am acquainted with two offices within 100 to 150 yards of each other.  The Minister has justified his methods of economy in the rural districts because of the unnecessary and luxurious tastes of the people.  But here in the city we have offices within a few hundred yards of each other.  I want to know if the Minister considers this state of things unnecessary and luxurious, and if not why he does not?  Is there a necessity for two offices in Baggot Street?  Is that what the Minister means by economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone looking at the figures here has material for thought.  They amount to just a half a million.  I think there is here a fruitful field for economy that the Minister might devote his attention to.  He need not be <Col N="1831" /> chasing after a few odd thousands in the rural areas and depriving the rural population of the postal and telegraph facilities they had.  He could, here in the city, without doing an injustice to anyone, accomplish a great economy.  Surely, the Minister will not consider it a hardship and an inconvenience that people living at Baggot Street Bridge to come down here and post their letters.  They would suffer no extra charge for delivery. Surely, the Minister does not consider 200 yards too great a distance for those citizens to come and post their letters, and transact any business they may have to do at the Post Office. The Minister says he wants economy. Why does he not begin here?  There are other streets in the city where there are two Post Offices also.  The Minister should explain why it is necessary to have these two offices within a few hundred yards of each other, and what injustice it would be to the population here if they had to walk two or three hundred yards for their postal facilities. I will not delay the Dáil further as I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
