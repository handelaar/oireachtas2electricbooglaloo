      <P>asked the Vice-President whether he is aware that the London, Midland and Scottish Railway has served notice of its intention to promote a Private Bill in the Parliament of Northern Ireland for the acquisition and working of the Ballycastle Railway, and if he will state what action the Government has taken, or proposes to take, in view of the fact that the Northern Parliament has no jurisdiction over railways.</P>

      <P>My attention has been directed to a notice in <i>The Railway Gazette</i> that application is intended to be made in the Northern Parliament in the forthcoming Session by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company for an Act of Parliament in connection with the Ballycastle Railway.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Northern Parliament, when the application comes before it, will refuse to entertain it on the ground that it has no powers of legislation with reference to railways. Should the application be entertained by the Northern Parliament, appropriate action will be taken.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that on December 9th, 1924, Army Lorry A.C. 1118 took delivery from Messrs Anderson, Stanford and Ridge-way, Grafton Street, Dublin, of a number of Jacobean Oak Bedroom Suites intended for the use of Army Officers at the Curragh, and that these suites were made by Messrs Lebus, of London, and <Col N="2700" /> whether there is any reason why, in view of the severe unemployment in the furnishing trade in Ireland, furniture for the Army should not be required to be of Irish manufacture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated, an Army lorry on 9th instant took delivery from Messrs Anderson, Stanford and Ridge-way of two Jacobean oak bedroom suites for Married Officers' Quarters, made by Messrs Lebus of London.</P>
      <P>As regards the furnishing of Single Officers' Quarters, the requirements of the Army were sufficiently definite to allow the Board of Works to call for tenders for bulk quantities of Irish-made furniture, and this was done.</P>
      <P>In the case of Married Officers' Quarters, however, the Board of Works were not able to obtain from the Military any definite estimate of the minimum total quantity of furniture required, so that tenders for bulk quantities could not be invited in the case of these quarters. Requisitions for the furnishing of Married Quarters have come in intermittently, and generally in circumstances which necessitated the work being done at very short notice.  Tenders had therefore to be invited from local merchants for small lots, which were generally supplied from stocks on hand.</P>
      <P>In anticipation, however, of the full requirements of the Army in this direction being known shortly, the Board of Works are making inquiries with a view to having such articles as the bedroom suites now in question manufactured in Ireland.</P>

Cork, on March 13th, 1921, have been offered £24 a year till they attain the age of sixteen years; and whether he is aware that the amount is considered entirely inadequate by the guardian of the children, and if he will have the case reconsidered with a view to granting adequate compensation.</P>

As the deceased at the time of his death was employed as a farm steward at a wage of £1 per week, with board and lodging, I consider that generous provision has been made for the three children, and I see no reason, therefore, why the case should be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the premises of Fry and Company, poplin manufacturers, Dublin, have been seized by bailiffs on account of debt due for Income Tax; if he is aware that as a consequence fifty or sixty workers are likely to be disemployed and become claimants upon the Unemployment Insurance Fund; whether the firm in question made a proposal several months ago to pay the amount due, in large instalments, and whether in view of the assurances given by the President and the Minister that no <Col N="2705" /> harsh measures would be adopted for the enforcement of payment of arrears of Income Tax where debtors showed signs of making reasonable efforts to pay, he will take whatever steps are necessary to release Messrs.  Fry and Company from the stranglehold of the bailiffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have been misinformed as to the facts of this case.  The premises of Fry and Co. were not seized by bailiffs on account of debt due for Income Tax, although a large amount of Income Tax is due to the State.  The seizure was made by an order of the High Court as the result of an action against Fry and Co. for sums due in respect of Excess Profits Duty.  Prior to the institution of proceedings in the High Court no proposals for payment were put forward, although every opportunity was given to liquidate the debt. The proposals put forward after proceedings had been taken involved the spreading of the payment over a period of fourteen years.  As some of the debt is already seven years overdue, and the latest portion of it is four years overdue, the proposals could not be allowed to interfere with the proceedings.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, it is not desirable that individual cases of this nature should be referred to in detail in the Dáil, because it is not possible to disclose all the facts.  But in this case a certain amount of propaganda has been carried on, and I feel it necessary to refer to certain aspects of the case.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, Fry and Co. rendered fraudulent accounts which showed a large under-statement of profits.  In December, 1921, it was proposed by the British authorities to institute criminal proceedings against Mr. Reade for fraud, and, in addition, to impose penalties amounting to over £5,000.  Owing to the change of Government the criminal proceedings for fraud and the action for penalties were waived by the Saorstát Finance Minister, and the demand was limited to the actual loss of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has reached its present stage mainly because of Mr. Reade's extravagance.  It is common knowledge <Col N="2706" /> that in a lawsuit which came before the High Court in 1921 it was disclosed that Mr. Reade lost £460 at gambling in one night at the Galway race meeting, and it may be inferred from the history of the case that this was not an isolated affair.  Mr. Reade holds or has spent a large sum of money belonging to the State, and there is no good reason why the revenue of the State should be used to subsidise him at the expense of other ratepayers who meet their liabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the Customs Entry Duty imposed under Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1924.  Under the provisions of this Section every Customs entry form (not being a duplicate of any such form) required by law to be furnished by an importer, or the agent of an importer of goods into Saorstát Eireann, must bear an adhesive stamp of a value equal to the amount of sixpence in respect of each separate description of goods required to be stated on such entry in accordance with the Official Import List.  I understand that the carrying companies are collecting from consignees an extra levy of one penny, for each sixpence of Customs Entry Duty paid, for their services as <Col N="2710" /> agents in affixing the necessary stamps to the Customs entry forms.  This extra levy of one penny is, however, not a revenue charge, and is quite distinct from the Customs Entry Duty, which is payable under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1924.  It will be understood that Customs Entry Duty is a stamp duty payable on Customs entry forms, and is in addition to any Customs duties which may be charged on the imported goods described on such entries.</P>

      <P>I may mention that, in connection with recent exportations to Belgium, several horses were refused shipment by the Department's Portal Inspectors on the ground of unfitness for the journey. That will be continued where necessary.  Further action in the matter does not at present seem called for.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that twenty-nine plot-holders are being required by the landlords, Messrs Counihan, to relinquish land held for allotments at Johnstown, Finglas Road, Dublin, on the plea that it is more important to provide accommodation land for cattle for export than to enable the plot-holders to grow food; that land formerly held for allotments at Bull Field and Fairfield, Glasnevin, has had to be given up for building, and that there is no other land available in the neighbourhood for allotments, and whether he can take any steps to ensure the retention of these allotments by the holders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responsible for failing to introduce that Bill, if the word &ldquo;failing&rdquo; satisfies the Deputy. The Bill was promised at the beginning of the Session, but the experience since has been that various local authorities are unable to get applicants for existing plots.  The Dublin Corporation, for instance, had to surrender plots to the owners because they could not get applicants for them.  It is because of <Col N="2717" /> our experience since the promise that we have delayed introducing the Bill. It does seem to us that it would be extraordinary to introduce a Bill to acquire land compulsorily for a specific purpose when, as a matter of fact, land held at present by local authorities for the same purpose, had to be surrendered, or has to be surrendered, because there are not sufficient applicants for the land.</P>

      <P>Four or five miles away?  Does the Minister not realise that there are cases where men may have surrendered allotments, but that there are other cases where plots have been assiduously and profitably worked, saving the State a considerable sum of money in fact, and that these are now being surrendered because the Minister failed to bring in such a Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, by reason of the fact that there is no compulsory legislation now in existence, plots have been acquired from people who are willing to work them.  On the other hand, I am aware that there are areas where plots have had to be surrendered because it was impossible to find people who would work them.  We have to look at the proposition as a whole.  I agree that it would be well to try and reconcile these two points of view, and to bring in a Bill which would deal with the particular areas, so far as they can be dealt with, where people do require plots and are willing to work them, and, at the same time, which would not do an injustice by giving compulsory powers in districts where there is no necessity for them.  It is an extremely difficult problem in view of what is happening, and we are considering the problem from the point of view which Deputy Johnson has just outlined.  I make no apologies for the delay, however.  The delay was deliberate, and due to the experience that we were having in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Unemployment Insurance Acts, the position of seamen domiciled in the Free State is that, whilst employed on ships registered in Great Britain or Northern Ireland or on vessels (not being vessels registered in the Free State), owned or managed in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, they are excluded from the provisions of those Acts and are not liable to pay contributions under them, though the employer pays the part of the contributions which he would pay in respect of each of these men if they came within the Acts.  Whilst employed on ships registered in the Free State or on ships (not being ships registered in Great Britain or Northern Ireland) owned or managed in the Free State, merchant seamen domiciled in the Free State come within the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts in force <Col N="2720" /> in this country and are required to pay contributions in the ordinary way into the Unemployment Fund, out of which they are entitled to receive benefit when unemployed in the Free State.</P>
      <P>As regards the future working of the Acts, with reference to these men, no question will arise with regard to the men who are insurable in, and pay contributions into the Unemployment Fund of, the Free State, as these men, when unemployed in the Free State, will be entitled to receive Benefit in proportion to the number of contributions so paid for them.  In regard, however, to those who are excluded from the Act, it would be possible by reciprocal arrangements between the different Governments concerned to bring them within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I have, however, been unable to obain consideration for any such reciprocal arrangements as would be fair to the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to this question is somewhat lengthy.  I have, therefore, handed a written reply to the Deputy, which will appear in the Official Report.</P>
      <P Just="Center">[WRITTEN REPLY.]</P>
      <P>The following is a summary of the history of reciprocal arrangements in respect of Unemployment Insurance with the Governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  When the Government of Saorstát Eireann took over from the British Government in April, 1922, the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Acts a separate Unemployment Fund under the Unemployment Insurance Acts was automatically established in Saorstát Eireann into which were paid all the contributions payable under those Acts in respect of employment in Saorstát Eireann, and out of which was payable the unemployment benefit to which the insured contributors thereafter became entitled under the provisions of those Acts.  In the interests of insured contributors and to minimise the inconvenience of the transition, arrangements known as &ldquo;reciprocal arrangements&rdquo; were made between the Provisional Government and the Governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by which contributions paid in either country were recognised in the other for the purpose of determining the amount of benefit to which an insured contributor was entitled.  Further, each country regarded employment in an insurable occupation in the other as satisfying the condition for the receipt of &ldquo;uncovenanted&rdquo; benefit which was then in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2726" /> (2)  After this reciprocal arrangement had been made, a careful inquiry was made into the financial liability in which it involved the Saorstát, and it was found to be disproportionately costly to this country. Considerable numbers of our population were accustomed to cross every year to Great Britain, where they worked in insurable occupations and had contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Acts paid for them.  These people, when their employment terminated, returned to their homes in this country, and claimed unemployment benefit against the contributions paid, not into the Unemployment Fund of this country, but into that of Great Britain.  The result was that the whole burden of paying benefit fell on this country in respect of contributions all of which had been paid into the Fund of Great Britain.  The numbers of persons in respect of whom this liability fell on the Saorstát was, so far as could be estimated, about 14,000.  There was practically no compensation by way of similar migration of British workers to this country.  The attention of the Minister of Labour in Great Britain was called to the inequality of the burdens which the arrangement involved and they were asked to consider a financial adjustment.  Our concrete proposal was that there should be transferred to the Unemployment Fund of the country which paid benefit the proportionate value of the contributions received by the other country.  Methods for ascertaining without undue trouble the liability under such an arrangement as this were suggested to the Ministry of Labour in London, but that Department was disinclined to adopt any method involving it in any trouble at all.  Correspondence proceeded over a great part of 1922, and early in 1923 a conference to consider the matter was held in London.  At that conference, the British side did agree in principle to a reciprocal arrangement involving a financial adjustment; admitted that the adjustment would always necessitate a payment to the Irish Free State; made the reservation <Col N="2727" /> that any arrangements made should operate only for a limited period in which the basis could be tested by actual experience; and contemplated that the best arrangement would be the payment to the Saorstát of an annual lump sum representing the excess of unexhausted contributions in the British Fund paid by Saorstát workers over the unexhausted contributions of British workers in the Unemployment fund of this country.  The Ministry of Labour, however, required further information as to the approximate numbers of persons, periods of employment, etc., involved, and after examination of all available data, we duly forwarded an estimate showing that the contributions paid in Great Britain for these migratory workers would amount to about £17,700 per annum.  It was suggested that a reciprocal arrangement should be concluded based on this sum.  Eventually the Ministry of Labour refused to make any arrangement involving financial adjustment and has not since indicated any change in its attitude.</P>
    <P>3.  Special circumstances affect the relation of merchant seamen to this question.  Merchant seamen resident in the Saorstát but employed on British ships are excluded from insurance and do not pay contributions, though their employers do. The same applies to British seamen employed on ships owned in the Saorstát.  By reciprocal arrangements these seamen could be brought under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Their position, then, would be that while employed on ships registered in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or ships (not registered in the Saorstát) owned in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, their contributions would be paid not into the Unemployment Fund of the Saorstát but into that of Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and they would be entitled to benefit in the Saorstát only to the extent provided for by the reciprocal arrangements.  It is roughly estimated that the number of persons domiciled in the Saorstát normally employed on British ships <Col N="2728" /> is about 12,000, while those domiciled in Great Britain and employed on Saorstát ships are only about 1,000.  Assuming that these men are employed for nine months out of twelve, it would require a contribution of about £34,000 per annum from the British to the Saorstát Fund to give them the full right to benefit in the Saorstát proportionate to their periods of employment.  As Great Britain has already refused to make any such arrangement involving financial adjustment, there seems little prospect that the merchant seamen of this country who work on British ships can be brought within the Unemployment Insurance Acts on any reasonable fair basis.</P>
    <P>4.  While the reciprocal arrangements to which reference is made in the first paragraph were being maintained by this country and Great Britain, we became aware, towards the end of last year, that the Northern Government had, about July, 1923, terminated those arrangements without notice to us.  While we were still paying benefit on contributions paid to the Northern Government the Ministry of Labour in Belfast were refusing to pay benefit on contributions paid in the Saorstát. Soldiers of the National Army who, after demobilisation, returned to their homes in the Six Counties, were refused covenanted benefit in respect of contributions paid in the Free State, and had their service in the Army treated, in effect, as a disqualification for uncovenanted benefit. In order to obtain some benefit for these ex-members of the National Army we had to pay their contributions to the Northern Ministry.  The attitude of the Northern Government towards the question of reciprocal arrangements with the Saorstát seems to be to make it a condition that unemployment insurance legislation by the Oireachtas must follow that of Northern Ireland before any such arrangement will be considered.</P>
    <P>5.  At a meeting which I had with the Northern Minister for Labour early last summer he brought up the position of insured contributors resident <Col N="2729" /> along the border who, when unemployed, could not obtain unemployment benefit because their residence was outside the jurisdiction in which they had worked and paid their contributions.  He suggested that officials of both Governments should consult as to whether these difficulties could not be removed, to which I readily agreed.  But the only reply my Department can get to its communications on the matter is &ldquo;the matter is under consideration but no satisfactory proposals have been evolved.&rdquo;  No proposal of any description has since been made.</P>
    <P>6.  The action of the Northern Government in terminating the reciprocal arrangement which was in operation in 1923, and the refusal of the British Government to vary so as to avoid the Saorstát being liable for the whole of the burden of unemployment benefit in respect of contributions it did not receive, left us no alternative but to bring those arrangements to an end.  This was done from the 29th June last, on the basis that no country could take any account of contributions paid after the 1st July, 1923, into any fund but its own.  Consequently we are not now paying benefit in this country in respect of any contributions paid since the 1st July, 1923, outside the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>7.  We are willing to enter into arrangements which will be truly reciprocal, but we cannot regard any proposal as satisfactory which does not provide that we shall have the contributions or their equivalent in any case in which we are expected to pay benefit.  Since the stamps used for the payment of contributions in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are identical in design, and it would not be possible by examination of unemployment books to say which of the two Governments received the contributions represented by the stamps on the book, it would scarcely be possible to have an arrangement with one of those Governments alone.</P>
    <P>I have communicated the above summary to the Northern Minister of Labour, telling him that I proposed to give it publicity.  He has replied to the <Col N="2730" /> effect that in the absence of a formal reciprocity agreement he did not feel justified in continuing any previous reciprocal arrangement, and that in his view the divergence between the unemployment insurance systems of Saorstát Eireann and Northern Ireland renders impossible a formal reciprocity agreement that would be equitable.</P>
    <P>I think it will now be perfectly clear that I can go no further than I have gone in endeavouring to secure reciprocal arrangements within the limits imposed by the Unemployment Insurance Acts and that, while I am ready to enter into reciprocal arrangements and consider that a fair arrangement can be made on the basis indicated in paragraph 7 of the summary above, it is the other parties who say that reciprocity is impossible.</P>

      <P>I was unable to consent to the superannuation allowances proposed because of excess calculation of war bonus in both instances, and an excess addition of years in one.  The Council was notified of the arrangements which, under recognised practice, I would be prepared to accept, but subsequently they claimed that they were justified in their method of computing war bonus by a judicial decision in another case.  They were informed on the 15th instant that if the principles of that judgment were held to apply to the cases of local officers, the bonus would have to be treated as a proportionate addition determined by, and varying with, the standard cost of living scale, and the result would be less favourable than the method of calculation suggested by me.</P>

      <P>In reviewing and adjusting the pension under the Act of 1924 in this case the pension officer estimated means at £36 8s. 0d a year., and fixed the pension at 2/- per week. The pensioner appealed and the Coole pension sub-committee allowed 9/- a week.  The case then came to me for determination on an appeal from the pension officer and it was decided that the claimant was entitled to a pension of 3/- a week as from the 5th September last.  That decision was based on means exceeding £31 7s. 6d. but not exceeding £34 a year.</P>
      <P>It appears that the pensioner was maintained by his employer both when the pension was first granted and also at the time of the review.  If at any time that arrangement should cease, or the pensioner's means diminish, it would be open to him to raise a question with the pension officer and to apply for a suitable increase in his weekly rate of pension.</P>

I understand that the officers concerned have received no remuneration since December, 1921, but I do not know whether the School Attendance Committee, who have control over the employment of such officers, removed them from office consequent on the County Council's action.  School attendance officers do not hold pensionable posts and consequently the superannuation of the Limerick technical officers has no bearing.  In view of the terms of Section 3 (4) of the Education Act, 1892, the question of reviving the functions of the Committee would appear to be one for the Minister for Education.</P>

The Committee were informed that I was satisfied that the interests of the two institutions controlled by the Grange-gorman Joint Committee required that the forthcoming vacancy on the staff should be filled by a man, and that I could not agree to the appointment of a female medical officer.  It was not a general order; it was an order dealing with a particular situation.  At the present time in Portrane Mental Hospital there are two lady medical officers, and there has been considerable indiscipline amongst the male patients of the asylum and it is considered desirable that a male doctor should be appointed to the next vacancy in order to get over that difficulty.</P>

There are various cases in my Department where a female medical officer is considered more suitable than a male.  In such cases I stressed that fact when making appointments.  In this particular case I think it is quite obvious that where male patients have got out of hand it is more desirable that a male medical officer should be appointed to deal with them.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to end formally this session to-day.  I am aware of the point that is in the Deputy's mind.  The session of last year, for instance, lapped over into this year, and we think, as a matter of convenience, it is advisable simply to allow the present session to run on into next year.  We do not take the view that the particular Article of the Constitution&mdash; I have not got the reference by me at the moment&mdash;obliges us to begin and end a session of the Dáil within a particular year.  We rather take the construction that the spirit and intention of it is merely to ensure that the Dáil shall sit at least once within every twelve months.</P>

      <P>Yes, I agree with the Deputy that it would be the proper thing.  When we resume after the Recess a statement may be made indicating the legislation that will be brought forward and the order in which it will be taken and so on.  No amount of statements at the beginning of a session <Col N="2747" /> or at the beginning of a sitting of that kind will be able to ensure that coming towards the end there will not be a certain pressure of work and necessity for extra sittings.  I think that is the universal experience in every Parliament. I do not agree with the Deputy that there has been, during this present session, any abnormal pressure and I rather object to the suggestion that legislation has been rushed through in a hasty and ill-considered way.  Probably the rush and the pressure here is very much less than is the case in other Parliaments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is desirable that a Conference be held between members representing the Dáil and the Seanad upon Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 9 made by the Seanad to the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Bill, 1924, to which the Dáil have disagreed and upon which the Seanad in their Message of the 12th December have insisted; that five Deputies represent the Dáil at the said Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2749" /> I hope that this will not be much less formal than the last.  It will be recognised that the position of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is difficult and the position of the Department of Justice is difficult in consequence.  I am very much concerned because of the fact that by the failure of the two Houses to agree on this Bill we shall, for at least nine months, possibly for considerably longer, be in the position that the powers that have been sought to deal with illicit distillation and with the traffic in methylated spirits will not be granted.  The present condition of the law with regard to those two items will continue in force and the greater powers sought for by the Ministry which I think the House unanimously approved of will not be given.  I say it is mainly with a view to ensuring that the powers in respect of those two evils shall be strengthened that I would urge that some effort should be made before the close of this part of the session to reach an agreement in respect of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  There is a provision for a Conference made in the Standing Orders as revised, for the purpose of meeting such difficulties between the two Houses, and therefore I have put down this motion.  I understand that the Seanad has inconvenienced itself to meet to-day for the purpose of hearing whether the Dáil has agreed to such a conference.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil agrees to a conference, a similar motion, I understand, will be moved in the Seanad, and I have good reason to believe that a conference will eventuate.  The conference might be held during the dinner hour and if agreement be arrived at the references or recommendations of the conference will be conveyed to both Houses.  If there be agreement, the Bill will become law with any amendments that may be decided upon.  I move the motion.</P>

      <P>I beg to support Deputy Johnson's motion.  I think it would be rather a lamentable thing if the Intoxicating Liquor Bill were held up for nine months, owing to disagreement over a few amendments which may be settled at a conference.  From one point of view alone, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill will be of very considerable <Col N="2750" /> benefit to the country.  I refer particularly to the clauses dealing with illicit distillation and to the clauses which deal with the penalties imposed on people discovered with materials out of which illicit whiskey can be made or plant which can be used for making such spirits.  Consequently, I support Deputy Johnson's suggestion that a conference of the two Houses be held to see whether any agreement can be arrived at.</P>

      <P>I would like to know, before agreeing to support this motion, by what method the five Deputies to be appointed by the Dáil will be selected. Will the five Deputies selected be five Deputies who voted in favour of closing on St. Patrick's Day, and who voted also in favour of the structural alterations clause?  I think the Dáil ought not to submit even at the last moment to the Seanad.  I think the Dáil should adhere to its decision on the Bill.  The Seanad may agree to compromise but I, for one, will not agree to the structural alterations clause being forced into the Bill.  I would like to know whether any decision arrived at by this Joint Conference will be binding on us or whether it will be decided by vote of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly. The Joint Conference can arrive at no decision except to make certain recommendations to the two Houses.  This House must then take action with regard to the amendments. We must pass a resolution, either that we insist on our disagreement, or that we do not insist on our disagreement. The resolution, which will be operative, must be passed here.  The Joint Conference can only make recommendations.</P>
      <P>With regard to the five Deputies to be selected, I take it that the idea would be to proceed in accordance with Standing Order 115 (b), which is an additional Standing Order.  That Standing Order was formulated by a Joint Committee of the two Houses, appointed to consider the particular kind of question which has now arisen.  The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Lord Glenavy, was a member of that Joint Committee, and I was also a member, and the Committee arrived at this method of procedure, which we are now endeavouring to test.  The spirit of the Standing Order would be completely broken if the five Deputies selected were on one side or if the five Senators selected were on one side.  That would not be a conference that could arrive at any decision.  Has Deputy Lyons any other questions?</P>

I would not agree to the appointment of five members, even selected by the Committee on Standing Orders, to consider these amendments, but I am satisfied as long as their recommendations will have to be ratified by the Dáil.  I, therefore, raise no objection to the motion on the Paper.</P>

      <P>My object in rising is to impress on the Conference to be appointed that they have only power to express the view of the Dáil.  On one particular clause the view of the Dáil was very clearly expressed&mdash;the structural alterations clause.  I do not think that this Committee would have power to compromise on that particular clause, having regard to the view of the Dáil.  The question of the other clause is different, because on that the Dáil was, practically, equally divided. It was merely a question of attendance whether the clause was passed or not. On that, I think the Conference would be entitled to exercise a discretion.  But on the other question, I think they are not entitled to exercise any discretion. There was no doubt about the view of the Dáil on that question.</P>

      <P>I hope the Dáil will agree to this proposal of Deputy Johnson unanimously, because it is the common sense method of dealing with the matter.  It seems to be a fair solution of a very difficult situation.  There are many of us who feel strongly that it would be a great pity if the provisions of the Bill were inoperative for nine months, As you, A Chinn Comhairle, and as Deputy Gorey has pointed out, the composition of the Conference really does not matter, because the Dáil and the Seanad will have to pronounce on its recommendations when they come before them.  As Deputy Gorey says, there cannot be much question about mixed trading, because this House has given a very strong vote on the clause. When it comes to the question of St. Patrick's Day closing, this House was so evenly divided that the Conference could very well compromise.  I strongly support Deputy Johnson's motion, and I ask the House to agree to it unanimously. <Col N="2753" /> For my part, I do not care whether the representatives would be those who voted against St. Patrick's Day closing or in favour of it, because the whole matter must come before us later for decision.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that it is rather unfortunate from the point of view of principle that we should send a number of Deputies to take part in a conference with members of the Seanad, and give them an order that they must not in any circumstances touch this, but that they may touch that.  I think that is entirely against the spirit of the conference, and I think that a little reflection will show everybody that that is so.  The proposal, as I understand it, is that a number of Deputies here should meet a number of members of the Seanad in conference, and that on the points under discussion they may bring back any recommendations at all within reason, no matter what they were, but those recommendations would have to run the gauntlet of discussion and approval here when they came back.  I think we ought to set out clearly and without offence the fact that we are sending them to discuss every possible aspect of certain things down for discussion, but that any recommendations arrived at during that discussion are to run the gauntlet of discussion here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the principle of the motion proposed by Deputy Johnson, because, on consideration of this matter, I find that it is making a precedent for future controversy between the Seanad and the Dáil.  I do not agree at all that a matter finally disposed of, in accordance with the procedure of this House, should be reopened by conference and, after a conference, <Col N="2754" /> again be discussed in both Houses.  If this precedent is established now, we will find the same thing occurring time and time again with other legislative measures.  Deputies in this House who disagree with certain clauses in certain measures put through this House will be free to get up and move motions to have them referred to a conference of both Houses in order to have their view point put into operation. I think when this House decided the issues that are now, in accordance with this motion, to be discussed in conference that they were decided in very good faith and I do not consider that this business of conference on matters of this kind is good business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it a very poor way of carrying out national legislation.  If the time of this assembly is to be wasted by discussing one measure for months I think we are going back very far.  The importance of the Bill, as emphasised by some Deputies, is in my view exaggerated and I am prepared to style the Bill as unimportant.  There is nothing in it that makes it important and, therefore, I disagree with the proposition of Deputy Johnson.  I do not see the necessity for this conference, and I do not see why a majority vote of this House should be ignored by the passing of this motion.  Surely we have had this Bill before us for twelve months&mdash; we have had copies of it for nearly twelve months&mdash;and we have studied it, and if we were not able during that length of time to come to a decision upon it, I am perfectly convinced that it would be a good day for this country when Deputies who are prepared to change their minds, after such a length of time considering this measure, should walk out and allow men who are capable of making up their minds in a reasonable time to take their places in this House.  This method of carrying out legislation is not good, and we are going to have a repetition of it for all time if this motion is carried.  Any Deputy who disagrees with the decision of the Dáil will bring in a motion that a conference be held and, if the Dáil agrees, such conference will be held and everything will be discussed again and the time of the Dáil will be lost in discussing <Col N="2755" /> the whole question.  I do not agree with the motion because, as I have said, it is establishing a principle which the Dáil should endeavour to avoid establishing and I ask the Dáil not to pass it.</P>

      <P>I fear that I am not in support of Deputy Johnson's motion. I believe that the whole of this Intoxicating Liquor Bill has not been handled in a satisfactory manner with the result that this question of division, as regards the views of the Dáil and Seanad, has been accentuated.  Time has been wasted and, I fear, further time will be wasted without arriving at definite results. These could have been secured if there had been a proper interchange of opinions with those who represent the licensed trade in the country.  I do not consider those who represent that trade in the city because they agree that the Bill is a useful one and many of them are in favour of it.  I pointed out, more than once, the extent of the injury done to the licensed trade in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to the structural alteration clause.  We were informed by the Minister that he had consulted with the members of the licensed trade in Dublin and that they were in agreement with the Bill.  Some of these traders informed me that they are in favour of it.  I think it is very unhappy that what could have been done in consultation with the trade and brought before the Dáil with points agreed upon, with a view to seeing that the greatest good was done in the matter of temperance with the least harm to individuals concerned, was not done. If that conference had been held this debate need not have arisen.  I believe that the Dáil as a whole is in absolute agreement with almost nine-tenths of the Bill, as it saw the necessity for it. There were a few points on which it did <Col N="2756" /> not agree.  I suggested an agreement could have been reached on two of these points.  That was not after consultation with the licensed trade, but my common sense told me that there was a way out, without doing injury to anybody and at the same time helping the cause of temperance.  I do not approve of Deputy Johnson's motion, but I believe the licensed trade are agreeable to it.  I think it a bad form of legislation, if one section of the Dáil finds itself outvoted on any line they have taken, that they should call a conference as a sort of referendum.  I agree with Deputy Hall on that.  If those of us who objected to certain clauses in that Bill had been outvoted then it would be for us to move a motion, that because the other House had not agreed a conference should be held, I think those on the other side would naturally object to that.  With reference to a committee of the Dáil meeting a committee of the Seanad, the result of that conference will be placed before the Dáil, and it will be then for the Dáil to consider the result of that conference.  The representatives that we send to the conference should have very clear minds after listening to the numerous debates that have taken place on these matters, and they should represent the views expressed by members of the Dáil according to the votes given on the particular issues.  I believe that there is a good opportunity for a conference, and by that means we could make even the question of closing on St. Patrick's Day acceptable.  For these reasons, I support Deputy Johnson's motion, while wishing it should not have been necessary.</P>

They find that they would be losing half an hour every night if the Bill were hung up for nine months.  There is nothing like telling the truth.  I agree with Deputy Gorey that the majority in favour of the opening of public-houses on St. Patrick's Day was small, and we might have to compromise on that, but the majority <Col N="2757" /> on the other question was big, and that should give us courage.</P>

      <P>I am glad to note that Deputies from all sides but one have supported this motion and this plan.  As to Deputy D'Alton, I am not quite sure where I am in respect of him. He agreed with Deputy Hall in his opposition to the motion; he argued in favour of the motion, and he decided finally he would vote for the motion, so I take the last as being better than the first.  With regard to Deputy Hall, we are in the unfortunate position as far as he is concerned, that we are working under a Constitution which has established the Seanad, and before any Bill can become law the Seanad has to agree to it, or to allow it to remain inactive for at least nine months.  I hope, quite contrary to his view, that this method will be found to establish a precedent, and a successful precedent, for many occasions when there may be differences between the two Houses, which differences are perhaps of a minor kind, and may be resolved by a conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, the Dail will have the final say.  The conference may get over little difficulties, and may perhaps find a compromise which would save the Bill.  As Deputy D'Alton said, the country as a whole appears to be in favour of three-fourths, or nine-tenths, of the Bill.  Deputy Hall would say it is better that the nine-tenths should be held up for nine months rather than compromise on the tenth.  Die-hardism is of course justifiable sometimes.  I <Col N="2758" /> do not believe it is on this particular question.  I have supported proposals of the Bill which have given rise to much controversy, proposals originally brought forward by the Minister, and I would still like them to be passed in their original form, but I would like to compromise for the sake of saving nine-tenths of the Bill.  While the Seanad exists, it has power to hold up legislation, the existence of a means of conference is a valuable one, and I hope it will frequently be availed of.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want generally to lay my protest against the passing of this Bill before the Dáil.  We have done our best to amend the Bill; so as to reflect in some degree the ideas of local government of the people interested in the conduct of affairs in their localities.  We have failed to make much of an impression&mdash; we did a little, I am glad to acknowledge&mdash;on the Bill, as it was originally introduced.  Now, we are asked to pass finally a Bill which goes clearly against the conception of local government that has been growing up, in this country and in other countries, for very many years, concurrently with the development of the idea of self-government. This Bill really turns its back upon that tendency.  We have now come to the final stage of a Bill which will detract from local responsibility for the administration of local affairs, and which clearly tends to the centralisation within the country of all minor local matters.  The tendency is to a devolution of authority to non-elected bodies, whilst leaving an increased <Col N="2761" /> amount of central control and direction, and that is a thing one would have hoped we should see ourselves getting away from.</P>
      <P>We opposed the abolition of rural district councils, not because we believe the rural councils were a perfect form and a perfect expression of the idea of local government, but because the abolition of those councils was decided upon without making provision for the substitution of any other authority to do the kind of work which local responsibility for local affairs would reqiure.  If this Bill becomes law, we are to have local affairs, affairs affecting the intimate lives of people in the small matters of citizenship, conducted without responsibility to the people concerned.  The tendency of the Bill, in my view, will be to deprive citizens of that sense of responsibility. It will go against the direction of local government, which would throw responsibility for purely local matters upon localities.  A case can undoubtedly be made for the larger area dealing with matters affecting that larger area; but nothing in this Bill has been done to throw the responsibility upon the smaller area for the government and administration of affairs affecting only that smaller area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is retrogressive; it is a reactionary policy.  It has been embodied in the Bill with the consent of the majority of the Dáil, and I believe that will result in exciting a great deal of opposition in the country as soon as its effects become known and realised. There are provisions in the Bill which are, of course, quite admirable and desirable.  Along with those, however, there are too many provision which will not have the effects one would wish.  There are provisions which go against what I believe to be a forward tendency, a tendency which would help to educate the people by giving them responsibility over their affairs.  To deprive them of that responsibility is not wise.  Under this Bill we are throwing the power into the hands of officials and we are tending towards placing in substitution for democratic government in the higher and better sense, the system of bureaucracy which has frequently been condemned inside and outside <Col N="2762" /> of the Dáil.  I think the Dáil is doing an injustice to the ideas which have been embodied in our Constitution in respect to national affairs.  It is going against that tendency towards local liberty and responsibility for government and administration, and therefore, I think the Bill is bad and ought not to be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to register my protest against this Bill. Without exaggeration, I think it can be described as a most inhuman piece of legislation.  I do not wish to convey that the Minister is conscious&mdash;I do not think he is&mdash;of what the effects of this Bill will be.  I do not believe the majority of Deputies who voted for the Bill are really conscious of what are to be its effects.  This Bill reminds me in some respects of the Old Age Pensions Bill.  When the Old Age Pensions Bill was going through, some Deputies thought they were voting merely for a cut of 1/- a week.  When they voted for this Bill, I believe they thought there was nothing in it only what appeared on the surface and what immediately caught the eye.</P>
      <P>From my knowledge, and from what I have been able to learn from people who have given most of their lives to the service of the administration of local government, I do not think this Bill can be otherwise described than as an inhuman measure.  That is no exaggeration. Two or three years ago some of the Deputies prominent on the opposite benches used to boast that the people of this country were well able to look after their own affairs and to govern themselves.  The Minister now tells us that is all bosh, that there was no truth whatever in it, that the people of this country are not able to look after their own affairs, and that paid officials must be substituted for popular representation on the local councils. I believe, with Deputy Johnson, that this is a retrograde step.  I believe the responsibility of citizenship should be placed upon the people, and if the Minister persists in carrying out to the full the powers which he obtains under this Bill, the way is opened up for bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2763" /> We are going to have, every time a council, whether it be a county council or a county board of health, expresses an opinion which is contrary to the opinion held by the Minister, that council suppressed by the Minister and a Commissioner put in the place of its members.  That is the general tendency, and I believe that will be the general tendency.  Therefore, I think that this Bill should not be allowed to pass in the Dail without a very strong protest being made against its provisions. I want to refer also to the attitude which is adopted by the Minister with regard to the granting to the employees of public bodies the facilities which he was prepared to grant to what we will call, for the moment, the higher class of officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister absolutely refused to give any consideration whatsoever or to entertain for one moment the idea that the employee of a public body, no matter how long or how faithful his services may be, should be allowed to get a grant or a gratuity or pension when he retires even after a minimum of 20 years' service.  That is not what the workers of this country were led to believe would be the policy of this government.  That is not what they were led to expect would be the treatment that would be meted out to them when they got a native Government. Even recently we had it mentioned in the Dáil, by a member of the Government, that that party represented every interest in the country.  I suppose we must make allowances for statements made three, four and five years ago, but this statement was made recently.  We were told by them that they were there to do their duty by every interest in the country, that they were there to give fair play to every interest in the country, and that they had committees set up within their party to deal with problems affecting every interest in the country.</P>
    <P>When it comes down to dealing fairly, when it comes down to meting out justice, we find the old story repeated, and the under dog is to be the under dog all the time.  Just because a man who is employed by the county council or corporation or urban council, happens to use a shovel or brush for <Col N="2764" /> 20 or 30 years instead of using, perhaps, a pen he is to be victimised for that.  His services for all these years are to count for nothing.  Once that service is finished, once he has reached the period when he is no longer able to do any work, then he is only fit for the scrap heap or the county home. The man who has spent 20 or 30 years, or less, working, let us say, with a pen, is to be provided for, and his family is to be provided for, for the remainder of his life. There is no justice in that.  I do not think the Minister can get up here and say there is.  The Minister not only refused to put the manual workers on a level with the higher salaried officials, but he insists on taking from them, and he has really taken from them, certain privileges which they did hold under the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we got our own Government they have closed the door, absolutely, and they said &ldquo;You were only a scavenger or a carter, and, so long as you are not a salaried official, you are not entitled to receive any compensation, any gratuity, any reward or any pension, no matter how long and how faithful your services have been.&rdquo; I think that is most unfair and most unjust, and to my mind, the Government that stands for that policy are not representing every interest.  I do not <Col N="2765" /> see how they can get up here and say, or how they can go round the country and say, that they are representing every party or that they are prepared to represent every party, and prepared to give fair play to every party, irrespective of what section of the community that party belongs to, whether workers or higher salaried officials. They are not doing that.</P>
      <P>We even asked the Minister whether he would be prepared to bring in a measure which would enable those employees to contribute towards their pension.  We asked him if he would be prepared to bring in a special Bill to give superannuation to those employees on a contributory basis.  The Minister refused.  I think the workers are being treated scandalously in this matter.  To my mind, the poor will feel the effects of this measure to a far greater extent than&mdash;and I am prepared to admit that&mdash;the Minister realises, and I am sure the poor will feel the effects of this Bill, when it is being enforced, far more than the Government can realise now.  The tendency at the moment; the cry at the moment, is in the direction of economy. Economy always comes at the expense of the poor.  That was the cry upon which we had the Amalgamation scheme.</P>
      <P>The success or failure of the Amalgamation scheme is determined by the amount of money it will save, irrespective of, at whose expense the saving is to be made.  The official appointed by the county board of health to superintend home help or whether you call him a relieving officer or home help superintendent, will have his efficiency judged, and his value to the county board of health will be determined by the low figure at which he can keep the amount of outdoor relief or home help which is to be given to the poor.  That is the position, and I honestly believe that this part of the Bill is the most inhuman part of any measure that was passed in the Dáil since we came here.</P>

      <P>Since the adjournment a Message has been received from the Seanad and also the report of the Joint Conference.  The Message from the Seanad is:</P>
      <P>Seanad Eireann has this day passed the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad agree with the Dail in the resolution communicated to the Seanad on this day, that it is desirable that a conference be held on amendments Nos. 1, 2, and 9, made by the Seanad to the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Bill, 1924. on which the Seanad insisted, and that Senators Guinness, Desart, Farren, and Bennett represent the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I have here the report of the Conference of Members representing the Dáil and the Seanad on certain amendments, made by the Seanad to the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Bill, 1924. and disagreed to by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I wish to get some information on that point.  As one of the members appointed on the Committee, I agree with the findings, but I think it is specified that the Dáil should agree to Amendments 1 and 2 without the other proviso.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Lyons does not quite understand the position.  The Dáil has disagreed with the Seanad amendment regarding structural alterations before it came under consideration at the Committee. <Col N="2768" /> We are not interfering with that disagreement. That disagreement remains, and therefore the Dáil has nothing more to say to that matter.  We are asking the Dáil to agree to the Seanad amendments Nos. 1 and 2 respecting St. Patrick's Day closing, with which we had previously disagreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be impossible.  As a matter of procedure, the Bill could not become law on that kind of a resolution.  We must actually record our decision on the given amendments in order that the Bill may become law.  The Bill could not become law on a motion of the Dáil agreeing to the report of the conference. We must make provision now by actually withdrawing our disagreement to Amendments 1 and 2.  The Seanad must pass a resolution with regard to Amendment 9, that they are not insisting on it, otherwise the Bill could not become law.</P>

    <Title>INTOXICATING LIQUOR (GENERAL) BILL, 1924. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL, 1924 (FIFTH STAGE RESUMED).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the opinion voiced by Deputies Johnson <Col N="2769" /> and Morrissey as to the great hardship that this Bill is going to inflict on a very large number of people.  I would not go so far as to say that the Minister did not know the exact position that will be brought about by the Bill when in operation.  If the Minister had accepted some amendments which were moved with regard to the position of workmen under the different councils, he would have received congratulation. But he has not accepted any of these amendments.  No matter how many years a workman may have been in the service of a council he is denied the right of being provided for in his old age.  If he has not the educational qualifications to enable him to become an official&mdash;it does not matter what his skill is in his own trade&mdash;he is not entitled to any superannuation.  It is really unjust to have treated people in that way.  I quite agree with Deputy Morrissey when he said that the workers were looking forward to something better at the hands of their own Government, which they have looked forward to for many years.  The first Local Government Bill passed by their own Government places them in a worse position than any legislation passed by a foreign Government.  The Minister has defended the Bill exceedingly well from his own point of view, and I am sure he got valuable assistance from his officials.  There is no doubt that it took a long time to draft such a Bill as this, particularly, as the Minister, you might say, was only an infant in his position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Still, he was so &ldquo;crabbed&rdquo; that he was able to defeat every amendment put forward, of course on the advice of the officials who, themselves, are entitled to superannuation under the Bill.  I want to tell the Minister that I think, instead of being congratulated, a very small number of the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies who voted against all the amendments, and in favour of the Bill, will be returned after the next election.  It was not a question at all of the poor man; it was a question of catering for a particular class.  The Government should have <Col N="2770" /> acted in a real democratic manner when introducing legislation that affects so many people.  By the middle of January or February, we will have hundreds of people thrown out of employment and without any prospects. Urban councils will be without representation on county boards of health, as amendments providing for their representation were not accepted.  The Minister may say that urban districts have representation and that the Bill provides for the representation of each electoral area on the boards of health. If the county council happens to be controlled by a particular party, some districts will not get representation on such boards and poor people living in urban districts will have no one to look after their interests.  The Minister would not accept an amendment by which, at least, one member would be appointed to represent urban councils on boards of health.  Even at the eleventh hour I would be inclined to ask the Dáil to show what they think of the Bill by rejecting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I regret that such a Bill as this should have reached the final stage without any serious amendment.  Under this Bill the Minister takes to himself powers which he and his colleagues would have condemned in all moods and tenses under the British regime. The Dáil has almost passed a Bill now that, if the Irish Party had acquiesced in five years ago, in the British House of Commons, we would have been using the councils that the Minister has scrapped to condemn.  To my mind, it silences the voice of the people.  It gives the Minister power to become an autocrat so far as the public boards are concerned.  Various amendments were put forward from this side of the Dáil, from the human point of view, because we are in touch, week after week and day after day, with the common people who are at the moment starving. Amendments were put forward here with a view to getting urban representation upon county boards of health, but the Minister scoffed at the idea. He did not appear to give the question the serious consideration it required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We gave special instances of what, <Col N="2771" /> in our opinion, would happen when the new boards of health were set up, and if I am not greatly mistaken the Minister will have these results brought home to him during the next twelve months.  I have in mind at present the town of Wexford, where 600 people are receiving home help.  I would ask the Minister how he could expect one man, no matter what his ability may be, to cope with the demands for home help made in that or a similar sized town.</P>
    <P>An amendment was also sent forward from those benches asking for pensions for workers.  We also suggested that workers were prepared to pay a certain contribution week after week while they were working in order to become entitled to pensions, after long service, or when they were incapacitated. The Minister also scoffed at that and said that these people were in a privileged position.  I would like to know what more privileged position have these unfortunate people over the privileged position that the officials have?  There were fifteen section in the Bill devoted to the provision of pensions for officers, and I want to know what answer can the Minister give as to why he discriminates between the officer and the ordinary working man.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out&mdash;I think it was in the first Dail&mdash;when the President was asked to give an indication of his policy&mdash;as anyone who takes the trouble to read the debates will see&mdash; the workers were promised everything on God's earth.  Now at the first opportunity that the Irish Government gets, it completely ignores the cry of the worker to be treated the same as officials or other classes in this country. I am still waiting for an answer from the Minister as to why he should discriminate between the ordinary worker who has to wield a brush and the man who has to push a pen.  I do not think it is unreasonable at this stage that we should demand what the General Council of Municipal Councils &mdash;which is by no means a labour body &mdash;and the General Council of County Council&mdash;which by no stretch of the imagination could be called a labour body&mdash;have unanimously demanded <Col N="2772" /> that the Government should include ordinary manual workers within the scope of the Bill, so that they may be given pensions.</P>
    <P>The Minister ignored that, and as I said he did not make any effort to answer the arguments either put forward by these bodies or by Deputies on this side of the House.  As I said, I am sorry this Bill has arrived at this stage without any serious amendment, and I believe that the Minister is going to have great trouble during the next twelve months in so far as the clauses which affect the provision of outdoor relief are concerned.  Of course I know the Minister will say that this Bill does not deal with the provision of outdoor relief, but it certainly deals with the machinery to administer that, and in that case I believe I am perfectly entitled to deal with it.  I only want to say further, that the abolition of district councils is a retrograde step, and I believe that the Government party, when they face the country at the next election, will feel it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Morrissey has said in regard to this Bill.  At the same time there is one redeeming feature about the Bill and that is the appointment of a whole-time Medical Officer for each county to look after the housing of the poor, but I fail to see or I do not understand what institution he will have to report to, in order to deal with the repairing, the abolition, or the building of houses instead of these old houses.  It is a disgrace to the country, bad as the country is, bad as hunger is, bad as want of fuel is, to see people living in houses covered with what?  With stuff that is only for manuring crops.  This is put on the tops of houses, and conveys water in on top of poor children. What can you expect in regard to the health of the families in these houses? I do not agree with the Bill.  I do not agree with the abolition of the rural councils, but at the same time I am forced to agree with the appointment of a whole-time Medical Officer, and the sooner he comes the better and the sooner he abolishes these incubators of consumption throughout the country country the better it will be for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Deputies, I wish to register my condemnation of this Bill before it passes its final stage.  It is, undoubtedly, the Bill of the dictator.  It is not a democratic measure, for the very first thing it attempts to do in its first clause is to tear from the people their lawful right, their right to have local representation in accordance with their own will and wish.  It is, too, true that if the abolition of rural district councils were attempted during the British regime we would have heard it used as a weapon on every political platform throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, not alone here but in Northern Ireland.  When we get rid of that regime or believed that we were rid of it, we discover a far worse administration before us.  We find an extinction of the peoples' rights forced upon the people without their consent, and I certainly must say that it was the duty of the Minister or the party of which he is a member, to have put this particular matter before the electorate when they sought election.  We cannot view with any great pride administration of this kind, particularly when we look back into what has been known in this country as the darker history of foreign rule, when that foreign authority thought it well to give to the people of Ireland complete control over local administration, and when to-day we find ourselves confronted with the fact that a native Government that has declared itself, time and time again to be a patriotic Irish national adherent of democracy, tearing from the people that right that was given to them by a foreign authority.  There is no doubt about it some serious consideration will be given to this matter by the people throughout the Saorstát when the time for the next General Election comes, and I certainly believe, to a large extent, the prophecy of Deputy Lyons will come about.  I do not like to prophesy myself, but I believe it will have an effect in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the clauses dealing with pensions, I cannot see that anything in the nature of honest democratic administration or legislation is to be found owing to the fact that the manual worker who has been a slave of <Col N="2774" /> the public authorities in all weathers, on all days and at all times of the year, is to be left out in the cold while the happy and comfortable, high-salaried official is to receive a pension.  I asked during the discussion on the amendment proposed by Deputy Morrissey, that pensions should be paid to road workers, some guarantee from the Minister that the manual worker under the Local Authority should get a gratuity, that legislation would be brought in whereby that manual worker should get a gratuity or pension when his years of toil had come to an end.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was replying, he nicely and gently evaded that point. He did not say whether he would bring in legislation that would give gratuities or pensions to these unfortunate workers.  No, because, they were, as was stated during that debate, made of different clay to the high salaried official who was the son of some well-off farmer or business man, who had plenty of means behind him and who was not at all dependant upon superannuation or pension.  The Minister never during the discussion on all the stages of the Bill, declared that he was willing to assist in any degree to lighten the lot of the unfortunate manual worker under the Local Authorities, or gave the slightest hint that anything at all was in his mind in relation to the lightening of that burden.  I cannot agree with him either in relation to the administration of home help in so far as he has refused to form Local Committees to advise in the administration of home help to the destitute poor.  He has found it convenient to evade that point also, simply because we here on these Benches or I, for one at all events, take it that in his mind the destitute poor are an incumbrance on the nation, that they should be allowed to starve, and the sooner that they are got rid of the better for national prosperity.  I take it that is the Minister's idea.  This centralisation of administration has been leading us, and will lead us into muddles and difficulties of all kinds.</P>
    <P>To-day we find ourselves confronted with greater and more rigid amalgamation, accompanied by the extermination of the people's right to honest and <Col N="2775" /> democratic representation.  We were told, time and time again, we have heard it on every political platform, that the Government of the present day stood for all the people of the country, not for any particular class or section, but we have discovered that the Minister has found it convenient to administer in the interests of the privileged few, in the interests of a class, to the detriment of the masses, and it is only fair that some protest should be registered on the passing of the Bill.  It is also desirable that the Minister would make some announcement as to his intentions in the future in regard to bringing in a measure to make manual workers under local authorities pensionable. Deputies on the Farmers' Benches, who claim to represent the ratepayers, will undoubtedly protest against this.  But when their own brothers or sons, who are the officials of local authorities, receiving high salaries, are looking forward to their time of resignation from these important positions to draw superannuation, these Deputies sit mute and say naught.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that with the exception of the Labour Deputies there is no one to stand up in defence of the unfortunate manual worker, and the Minister's pledges, I might say the pledges of the Government as a whole, that they were to do great things for the workers, to better their lot, so that they could find an easier and better means of living opened up, and a better standard of education, were all camouflage, and a means to lead them further into misery, privation and hardship. Ministers may laugh; they may smile at these things; privation and hardship do not enter into their homes nor do they affect any of their friends. They certainly affect the people whom I refer to, and they are in the hearts of their homes.  It is all very fine to jeer with sneers and cant words at the destitution and suffering of a very large proportion of our people, but I say that it is not gentlemanly nor human, and certainly it is not fitting on the part of any man who declares himself to be a humanitarian.  The Minister may sneer at all these things, but let him remember that the people he is <Col N="2776" /> now sneering at are not the Deputies on these benches; they are the people outside, and when he gets up again on a platform in the open, I hope that he will say: &ldquo;Your sufferings, your privations, and your hardships are all the result of my administration, and I laugh, and laugh heartily, at all the sufferings and hardship that you endure,&rdquo; and that he will not try to mislead the people by making false promises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has repeated one of the arguments used against the Bill, that it is centralising all the services under one authority. It is really more a decentralising Bill than a centralising Bill, because it gives more power to the county councils than they had before, and ample provision is made for all local services and needs by the setting up of committees, which will give local people a great deal more control over these services than they had under existing Acts.  The one weakness in the Bill, from my point of view, is that it has been too conciliatory in its character; I have tried to please everybody.  I have been met very fairly in my attempts to do so by every party in the Dáil except the party on the opposite benches.  The representatives of the Farmers, the Independents, and others represented here, have been very fair, and have shown a very reasonable attitude in regard to this Bill, which is really in the nature of a non-contentious measure.  A great many things could have been put into it to satisfy the Farming and the <Col N="2777" /> Independent interests; I might have insisted upon a limitation of the franchise, or something of that kind, which would be very reasonable.</P>

      <P>They are quite capable of forming a judgment on that matter. At all events I have tried to be reasonable. I have conceded more to Labour Deputies than to any others, and I have received very little thanks for doing so. One matter is commented upon more than any other, and that is with regard to not pensioning ordinary workers under local authorities.  I explained, at the outset, that this Bill was an attempt to codify the law with regard to superannuation. There was no attempt in the Bill to bring in new classes of officers, or to make people pensionable who were not pensionable at the time of the passing of the Act.  The reason it was absolutely necessary to insist on that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Owing to the position of the ratepayers, I could not agree to increase the pension list. Deputy Morrissey has attacked me rather bitterly for not bringing forward some scheme of superannuation for the ordinary workers.  If Deputy Morrissey can formulate such a scheme himself on a contributory system&mdash;it will take a great deal of time and quite a lot of ability on the part of himself and his colleagues to do so&mdash;and if he will bring in that Bill under circumstances that will not increase the present unemployment in the country and will not put such a burden on the ratepayers as will make it impossible for them to carry on, I would be prepared to receive his proposals very favourably.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not prepared to do that himself, but he is anxious to throw on me all the odium for not doing a thing which he knows in his heart is absolutely impossible. Those people were not pensionable in the past, for the good reason that it was not possible to make them pensionable. It is not fair to hold me responsible for the state of affairs which existed and to accuse me of making invidious distinction between those who labour with the pen and those who labour with the shovel.</P>

The law, as administered in those particular cases, was submitted to the highest judicial authority and it was found to be unsound.  It is outside my <Col N="2779" /> scope altogether to deal with that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the motion.  I suppose there is not much use in reiterating the argument that the Deputy has not proved to the satisfaction of anybody that this Bill is necessary.  I will continue to oppose it, especially in view of his declining to make a promise of any kind that the evils connected with the franchise on which the Port and Docks Board is elected, will be remedied.  The Deputy has, no doubt, been privileged to meet his colleagues upon that Board and possibly he has had an opportunity to consult with them as to their attitude in regard to the amendment of the law relating to the constitution of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has not given the House any information as to their views on this matter, and I hope that the House will refuse to proceed further with this Bill until the views of the Board on the question of its constitution and the franchise affecting it have been conveyed to the House.  Then we shall know better where we are.  I submit that we ought not to do anything here which will appear to be an acquiescence <Col N="2781" /> in the method of selection, or election, of the Dublin Port and Docks Board in its present form.  If we give the Bill a Fourth Reading to-day the House will be assenting to the continuation of the Board for another year without any promise of amendment or change in the law to the present constitution of the Board, to the present franchise, and to all the evils connected with it.  I therefore hope that the House will not give a Fourth Reading to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made it clear to Deputy Johnson and to other members of the House that this question of the franchise could not be amended on this Bill without a clear examination of our Act of 1898.  I tried to stress to the House that this Bill was put forward with the object of putting right <Col N="2782" /> what had been made wrong, not intentionally, but without any consideration to the Port and Docks Board Bill at all. I could not go into a discussion with Deputy Johnson as to the rights and wrongs of the Board at this stage.  I am sorry I could not.  It is far too big a subject.  I have said to the Deputy on various occasions during the discussion on the Bill that opportunities will arise at no distant future to discuss the matter fully, if it was desired to do so. I have no wish to resist any strong opinion that the whole question of the Board should be subject to consideration at some future stage.  I regret that this Bill does not afford a suitable opportunity for such discussion.</P>

      <P>I submit to the House the following motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the provisions of Standing Order 88 as to the giving of notice for the taking of the Fifth Stage of a Bill be suspended to permit of the Fifth Stage of the Dublin Port and Docks Bill, 1924, being taken to-day.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to ask for a ruling on this matter and to refute the protestation that it is urgent.  There is no urgency, and it is in your power to decide whether it is urgent and to take the view of the House finally as to whether such suspension of the Standing Order can be permitted.  I <Col N="2783" /> submit that the case for urgency has not been made.  This is a Bill dealing with a private organisation, and the Standing Order referring to the suspension of Standing Orders is obviously intended for matters of public importance. I raised this matter before, and permission to take the Fourth Stage was not granted on that occasion.  I take the same attitude to-day and ask the Dáil not to take the Fifth Stage now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that matter has already been decided by the Ceann Comhairle on the same motion.  It was moved to suspend Standing Orders, and there has been no change in the situation since then.  It was not successful, because on that occasion notice had not been given, and a certain number of Deputies was required to be present to vote.  On the present occasion notice has been given, and the position is the same as that on which a ruling was previously given by the Chair.</P>

Before the present motion can be taken four days' notice must be given, or the leave of the majority of the Dáil will have to be given.  Neither of these two things has been done.  I submit that the first question to be decided is whether this matter is of such urgency as would justify you in agreeing to the suspension of a Standing Order having to do with the passing of legislation.</P>

I submit that the object of this Standing Order is to give Deputies an opportunity of being present on the <Col N="2784" /> date that the suspension of a particular Standing Order dealing with legislation is to be considered.  Otherwise it is always possible to suspend the Standing Order on a day that the Deputies have not been apprised of the proposal.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, according to the Deputy in charge of it, is designed to allow an election by an electorate based upon a fancy franchise giving to some of the electors as many as ten votes, and allowing other electors to carry as many as fifteen hundred votes, for candidates who are only eligible if they have certain fancy qualifications, one of which is the possession of personal property to the extent of £3,000.  The argument in favour of the Bill lies thus, that unless the Bill becomes law there will be a certain delay in carrying on these elections, and that the Board will be deprived of six representatives of trade and shipping. The retiring shipping representatives who likely will go up for re-election will probably be the nominees of two big combines, the L.M. and S. Railway and the British and Irish Steam Ship Co., part of the coastwise combine. Six representatives of these elements in the electorate will be appointed if this Bill is passed.  But there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that any representatives of the City of Dublin will be brought into the Board in subsitution for those who have been disfranchised by the dissolution of the Dublin Corporation.  The Deputy moving for this Bill argued the necessity, because he said there are big schemes of financial consolidation to be considered and decided upon.  There are big schemes of extension to be considered and decided upon, and it is proposed by this Bill to decide these very momentous matters affecting the citizens of Dublin, without any representation from the civic side of the community life.  That is to say, the only people who are to decide upon these very big questions&mdash;and just bear in mind that it is only on that account that the Deputy argued for the necessity of this Bill&mdash;are the representatives of trade or shipping.  The decision is to lie in the hands of the representatives of the trading community and the shipping community, which representatives have been appointed in the past and will be appointed in the future by the influences exercisable, owing to the extraordinary power wielded under this fancy franchise by these two big combines. I say the Dáil is going to make a mistake if it facilitates the continuance of that system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dail is going to make a mistake, and if we are to have no consideration for the citizens of Dublin, apart from the trading interests and the big combine interests, we ought to prevent the power to have a quorum of fifteen to do the big <Col N="2787" /> things that Deputy Hewat spoke about, until some way is found to ensure that the civic life outside trading and shipping interests is represented on this Board.  The case for this Bill lies in the fact that there are big schemes to be considered and decided upon.</P>
      <P>The people who are to consider those schemes and who are to decide upon them are representatives of trade and shipping dominated by two big combines. The counter-balancing influences which would represent the citizens of Dublin, apart from trade and shipping interests, do not and cannot appear on the Board.  They will not appear under those circumstances. We are to have this very big and important factor in the public life of the city and county decided by purely shipping and trading interests.  There is the further consideration that I dealt with the other day in regard to influences bearing against competitive lines, influences that have militated against the chance of fair opportunities of berthage and the like being considered.</P>
      <P>We have had no promise from representatives on this Board of any change in their franchise or any change in the qualifications of members of that Board.  We are now asked to agree to the passing of a Bill which would give extraordinary powers to a small Board representative of very narrow interests.  I am sorry, but I am going to ask the Dail to divide again on this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, like Deputy Johnson, must voice my opposition to this Bill.  The citizens of Dublin and of the country in general owe a debt of gratitude to Deputy Johnson for exposing <Col N="2788" /> the condition of affairs that exists in regard to the constitution of the Port and Docks Board.  For a number of years there has been a practically unanimous cry from large sections of the people for a different system of election on this Port and Docks Board, as distinct from the manner in which it is at present constituted.  We all expected that when a National Parliament was set up, this and institutions of a similar kind would have their antiquated type of election altered so that a more democratic type of institution would replace them.</P>
      <P>I have had a long experience of Dublin port&mdash;twenty-five years, in fact.  I have visited the port more often than any other Deputy, perhaps.  I have observed things down there that could not possibly happen if we had a Port and Docks Board catering properly for the interests of the country and the citizens of Dublin.  Certain things that I have seen happening down there should not be allowed at any port.  I have seen the gates locked against live-stock, and I have seen traffic diverted from Dublin to other ports.  Deputy Byrne, who is now supporting the Bill, was for a long time on the Board, and he was a member who, many times, had to complain of traffic being diverted from Dublin.  That traffic was diverted because, if a complaint was made by a member to the Port and Docks Board about certain shipping, another member, who would be manager of that particular shipping company, would intervene and there would be no redress.  In calling attention to the action of the Government in supporting the Bill and of the Port and Docks Board in trying to rush it through, Deputies are doing a national duty.  The Government, some time ago, appointed a Greater Dublin Reconstruction Commission, which has not yet made its report.  It will be time enough to introduce legislation on these lines when that report is brought in.  When that report does come in, we shall probably be told that it is not necessary to interfere with the Port and Docks Board as everything is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the live-stock trade.  Look at the great flow of traffic that comes through the great port of Dublin, which is the premier port.  How many members <Col N="2789" /> are on this Board representing that trade?  There is only one nominated by the Chamber of Commerce, who does not ship very many cattle. You have not a single representative from rural Ireland on that Board.  As Deputy Johnson has put it, the Board is controlled by a ring of shippers, and the sooner the Government make up their minds to have a more extended form of franchise the better it will be in the interests of the Board and of the citizens.</P>

      <P>It is necessary for me to reply to some comments made by Deputy Johnson and Deputy McKenna. I had hoped that these objections to the Bill had been adequately dealt with on the previous stages.  The urgency for getting this Bill through is that with only fourteen members, various operations, including the variation of rates, could not be carried out, as fifteen members are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When do you want to raise them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter whether we raise or lower them.  At present possibly the indications are more in the direction of lowering than raising.  At all events, if we wished to lower them we could not do it.  The various operations, including the larger one of the reconstruction of our finances, would require the attendance of a larger number of members.  The Port and Docks Board is not supported in any way from the rates.  There should be representatives under the Act of 1898 of the civic authority on the Board.  I made it clear at an earlier stage that as far as I was concerned I was prepared to discuss&mdash;not to condemn&mdash;the question of the franchise as embodied in the Act of 1898.  That is a franchise that has been established through the operation of Acts of Parliament after opposition was forthcoming to the system on which it is based.  Deputy Johnson and Deputy McKenna spoke about the shipping companies.  References were made to the London, Midland and Scottish and the British and Irish having representatives on the Board.  These companies have not by right any representation on <Col N="2790" /> the Board.  The members have to go up for election by one of the widest electorates for any Board I know of.</P>

There is no man on that Board as a nominee, and if Deputy McKenna wants a nominee of the cattle trade to be there he will have to get a special Act of Parliament. There is on the Board one of the most respected men connected with the cattle trade, Mr William Field. Does the Deputy say that Mr. William Field does not represent that trade?</P>

      <P>Mr Field is there, and he is Chairman of the Cattle Trade Association for many years.  Mr. Leonard who is also prominently connected with the cattle trade is also on the Board, and I can assure Deputies that Mr. William Field and Mr. Leonard are constantly pressing and putting forward claims dealing with the handling of cattle.  Any person who knows anything about the Port Board knows that it has nothing to do with the shipment of cattle; in other words, that that is not part of its duty.  The Port and Docks Board is there to provide facilities for trade at the port.  It does so, and the shipping companies and the <Col N="2791" /> railway companies carry on their business. The Board has no control over their operations.  It is assumed that they carry on their business to the best of their ability.  Every facility is given to every shipping company.  The representatives of the L.M. and S. and the B. and I. Company are only two men out of twenty-seven.</P>

I fail to see how they could do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>If the business came up in the ordinary way and concerned these companies.  Deputy Johnson has to remember that on the other side are the men who ship goods, and the traders' representatives, who, by themselves could outvote the whole shipping section of the Board, as they have a larger representation.  To say that the shipping members are usually in harmony with the trading members or <i>vice versa</i> is to say something that does not happen.  Any conflict that arises gets free, open and independent discussion in the presence of the Press.  I have tried to deal with the objections raised to the Bill, and also to impress on Deputy Johnson that the point he mentioned regarding Corporation representation on the Board is one that we would get over if we could.  Under this Bill it is impossible for me to go through the ramifications of the 1898 Act.</P>

    <Title>THE SHANNON POWER SCHEME. - STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that at the outset I should make a preliminary apology to you, sir, and to the Dáil for certain matters to which I shall have afterwards to refer in more detail&mdash; first of all for the fact that the scheme, the Siemens-Schuckert scheme for the development of the Shannon is presented in such detail that it would be <Col N="2793" /> impossible for me to give any real account of the development of that scheme to-night, and while I have an embarrassment of material in that respect I have further to excuse myself to the Dáil for not having a sufficiency of material in the other respects.  The experts' report has been concluded, but at this moment I have not in my hands the complete report actually as signed by them, and being their last word on the scheme.  That want arises from this fact that the report was first of all drawn up in German and was signed by them in that language, that the translation of it had to be undertaken, and the English again referred to for their concurrence, that the report had in no way changed in the translation, and all that I intend to give here to-night is a certain statement as to some of the larger details in connection with this scheme as presented by Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert and certain chapters of the experts' report, which chapters are, however, sufficient to enable a decision to be taken on the further development of the scheme.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of history is necessary to get this whole matter into proper perspective.  I do not suppose that I need refer in detail to the White Paper presented to this House on the 7th March last, which White Paper formed the basis of the contract entered into between the Government and certain agents acting on behalf of the firm of Siemens-Schuckert.  I would like to call attention to-day to one or two points.  The paper is the basis of a very definite and very comprehensive contract, and as far as I am in the position in which I am in to-night in giving to the House even a portion of the experts' report, it means further that I am in this position: That the contract has been fulfilled by the parties to it up to a certain point, and that the further steps have to be considered immediately by the Government and their view on the further steps to be put before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper set out in some detail certain considerations present to the mind of the Government on entering into this matter and it led simply to this, to put it in general terms, that the firm had to work out a detailed <Col N="2794" /> scheme for the development of electrical power from the Shannon and for its distribution over the Irish Free State to sub-distribution points in various cities and towns, that there was, with that, to be a binding estimate as to cost and to report on all economic details of the proposal, including the price at which power could be delivered to the towns and cities where it is to be utilised.  Further there was to be an examination not merely of the existing market for power, but a report on the future possibilities industrially and otherwise that cheap power would promote. That scheme when presented in its very full details was then to be treated in this way.  After various investigations had been carried out by the various branches of the Siemens-Schuckert concern, engineers were to be sent to the Shannon to carry out further investigations on the spot. Certain services of Government engineers in this country were to be lent for that purpose and finally the report, when prepared, was to be submitted to whatever expert the Government might select and to be judged from the techical and economic points of view.  There was a further proviso that if the scheme in its first presentation was not acceptable to the experts, it was allowed that modifications should be suggested by the firm and these modifications would then become portion of the first scheme or would replace portions of the original scheme and that the scheme as modified would be submitted for final examination to the experts.  That is the point that we have now reached. Certain modifications have been proposed, not in the scheme in any of its fundamental aspects, as at first suggested, but in certain rather minor points of detail.  These modifications have been accepted and the scheme, as modified, has been submitted to the experts with the result that I shall presently come to.  This paper, therefore, formed the basis of the contract and my statement to the Dáil to-night is that the contract has reached a certain stage and that certain other steps must necessarily follow from it.</P>
    <P>Again I must go back on the history of this White Paper.  It was presented to this House on the 7th March of this <Col N="2795" /> year.  At that time it was known that certain Private Bills were in contemplation dealing with the development of the River Liffey.  This Paper which formed the basis of the Government contract was issued deliberately to the Dáil so that the terms of the contract with the German firm might be known to those who were engaged in promoting Bills for the development of the Liffey.  It is to be noted here that the deposits required under Private Bill procedure were not lodged in the case of the two companies who had to make deposits in connection with their Private Bills until a date after the presentation of the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister excuse me if I ask him what he means by the contract in this matter?  Is it the contract to pay £10,000 or is it a contract to carry anything forward to a certain stage?  It is not contracting the State.  It is only contracting the Government to pay £10,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <P>If it pleases the Deputy, certainly.  I allude to the point about Private Bill procedure and to the date of these deposits, because there appears to have been a certain conflict, a conflict which, I am told, critics say could have been avoided if proper steps had been taken, and I want to point out that there was a further stage at which this White Paper and the Private Bill promoters came somewhat into contact.  Before the promoters of Bills before the Private Bill Committee had proceeded to that Committee I asked all these promoters to meet me, and when they did consent to meet me I put before them a proposition much on these lines; that they should refrain from procedure before the Private Bills Committee until such time as the experts appointed for the Shannon had made their report &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;They have decided in the meantime that they cannot enter into any arrangement which would interfere with or delay the Committee appointed by the Oireachtas in deciding the duties allotted to it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that statement is made in a letter I wonder what is the reference of mine, to which it is an answer.  I suggest that it was a suggestion made by me to the promoters of these Bills that they should delay&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>That I flatly and absolutely deny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that will be a matter for proof in another way. I may therefore make the point this way with the contradiction of the Deputy, that I believe I made a suggestion to the promoters of these Bills that there should be a delay, and I believe that on my return to the room an hour after I had made the suggestion the <Col N="2799" /> promoters of two of the Bills decided that they would go on, but that they would supply certain information, and that I informed them that in the event of their proceeding I would feel it my duty to use whatever power I could get from this House to stop the further progress of these Bills until such time as the report on the Shannon scheme could be laid before the House, and the Bills considered together.  So that as far as I believe I acted I did act in a way to preclude what I was then in a state to judge was useless and wasteful expenditure.</P>
      <P>The stage at which we have now arrived in these considerations is, therefore, that Private Bills are proceeding before the Private Bills Committee, that a report which I could have made this day last week was delayed in order to enable the Committee dealing with the Private Bills to come to a decision on these Private Bills before I made my statement in this House, and that I am only now proceeding with the statement because that Committee had adjourned over Christmas, and because this matter is so urgent in the interests of the State that a decision of some kind must be taken on it, not to-night, but in the near future, and that certain statements must be made showing what, in anticipation of approval in this House, is to be gone on with. This scheme which, in contra-distinction to two of the Liffey schemes is a national scheme, is, as I said, so full of detail that I doubt if it is possible to give any fair account of it to-night. But there are certain details in it which I would like to put before this House.  It will be seen from the dimensions of this volume which I have before me&mdash;and which is only portion of the Shannon report&mdash;that it is a huge and comprehensive scheme, and as such it has been gone into in and examined in the most minute details by the experts, portion of whose report is to come before you to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is but portion of the scheme. The diagrams and maps accompanying it are, of course, much bulkier.  This is a volume of almost 400 pages, and it contains numerous details, some of a highly technical nature, which would not be interesting to this House, and <Col N="2800" /> other parts dealing with economics and the general distribution of the scheme would undoubtedly be of interest to the House, if I had the time and the energy to put them before the House, and if the House had the patience to listen to them.</P>
    <P>The scheme as presented, opens with a statement taken from the great Power Conference, held this year at Wembley, in which allusion is made to the dependence of future economic development on the utilisation of the available power resources in any country.  Opening with a quotation from an address made there, the report continues, &ldquo;It must be a matter for wonder that the economic life of this country has up to the present been so dependent on imported coal in spite of the fact that this country is in the enviable position of possessing several large sources of water-power which can be utilised to furnish the land with electrical energy.  Other countries such as Switzerland, Spain and Norway, have already developed a large part of their water-power, but at present the Shannon pours its unused energy to the ocean.&rdquo;  There is then a statement as to the steps by which the examination proceeded, an examination which was destined to reveal the possibilities of the Shannon as a power-producing agent.  It refers to the fact that, having got control of governmental power in the country, it is clear that there should be an effort made &ldquo;to retrieve what has been so far neglected,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to raise this country to the same degree of culture, and industrial development that the other nations of Europe enjoy.&rdquo;  Many reports had, of course, previously been presented, the result of commissions dealing with the supposed available power in the Shannon, but most of them had been rather of an adverse type.  These reports are taken in some detail and criticised.  Anticipation is made here in the early part of the report of a final figure showing the cost of power in this State with the Shannon river developed.</P>
    <P>That figure is compared with two main stations in Germany and with eight stations in Switzerland.  The rate at which current can be sold in bulk to supply associations in this country, after the development of the river, compares <Col N="2801" /> favourably with those ten stations chosen for comparison.  Only two can be said really to be below the figure at which power can be sold here.  Of the two stations in Germany and eight in Switzerland, if taken in the order of cheapness, this country under the Shannon development would rank third.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the place of production of the power?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are given in various ways&mdash;price as generated, price as delivered in bulk, say, to Dublin itself.  Various other estimates are made and a certain equal line is taken with regard to the percentage of return on capital and the comparison is then made.  The figure actually as given here is not the same as the figure with which I shall afterwards have to deal, the figure of 5, which is the price at which, it is understood, power can be delivered in bulk to Dublin under the partial development of the river recommended by the experts.  The figure here is somewhat different from that, because costings have to be stepped out on an equal basis, and for the sake of comparison, costings, not actually in the scheme, have to be made appear. In addition to dealing with water power and water power development, those who drew up the scheme had their attention directed to another problem, the problem of drainage in this country. Although those two problems are stated to be partly opposing, it will be found when I come to deal with the details of the report as presented in the scheme that, in fact, the development recommended by the experts for the Shannon does not, as previous reports stated would be the result, flood any further area of the country but does in fact drain areas already flooded.  A recommendation is made by the experts that a full drainage scheme, apart from the drainage actually necessary for the purposes of development, should be taken in hands by the Government and carried out without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of drainage, in so far as those who drew up this scheme were concerned, entered into their considerations because it had been put forward <Col N="2802" /> as an objection against any possible big development of the river Shannon that it would involve further flooding of the already much flooded areas along the river.  The scheme so put up, adverting to that fear pointed out how further flooding could be avoided and how the flooding already there could be lessened.  Their plans and ideas, after criticism, have been passed and approved by the experts.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which is somewhat incidental to the scheme, but is of great importance to the country. It may be mentioned here.  Not definitely attached to the scheme immediately but attached to it in an incidental way there was a question of canal rectification.  When the details of the scheme itself and the report on the scheme come to be considered it will be found that the particular project set out in the report of the Canal Commission and estimated by that Commission to cost about £250,000 has in fact been accomplished under the development of the Shannon.  That is accidental to the scheme.  It is not bound up with it, but the capital expenditure, on which the final figure of .5 of 1d. for electricity delivered in bulk in Dublin depends, includes a sum, estimated at a quarter of a million by the Canal Commission, for certain canal rectifications in the neighbourhood of Limerick and along the whole Shannon, so that incidental to the scheme, and apart altogether from the development of power, there is bound to be both a drainage question and a question about canals.  It is satisfactory to find that the report of the Canal Commission in certain portions is actually being followed, that what they suggest is being done as portion of this scheme, and that notwithstanding the addition of this amount of money, estimated by the Commission at a quarter of a million, it is possible to deliver from the Shannon to Dublin electricity in bulk at ½d. a unit.</P>
    <P>There is one paragraph in the report I might quote here.  But before speaking on it I want to make one clear distinction. The Siemens-Schuckert plan looked to either a partial or a full development of the river.  They recognised that, in the state of the country, a partial development was the one <Col N="2803" /> most likely to be approved, but the final development had to be considered, because they had the point of view&mdash;a point of view also shared by the experts&mdash;that this country is, in comparison with other countries, unfavourably situated with regard to available water-power, and that, having limited resources in that respect, it was necessary to proceed with a partial development, which would be of such a nature as not to block or render very expensive the completest development of the water-power available in this river.  Hence it is that the plan, as put forward by Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert, includes a partial development and a full development scheme.  In most of my remarks to-night, I am alluding only to the partial development scheme, as referred to by Messrs.  Siemens-Schuckert.  There is a full development behind that.  It is in the background, but it is always in the consciousness of those who speak about the scheme, because it has to be taken into account in relation to the partial scheme, as one has to bear in mind that nothing can be done now which would prevent the fullest possible development of the limited available water-power of the country afterwards.</P>
    <P>When I speak to-night I am alluding to the partial development of the river as projected by Siemens-Schuckert&mdash;a partial development, which, I may remark here, has not been in its fullest details approved by the experts, who have themselves recommended a somewhat less partial development than the Siemens-Schuckert people have proposed. Even for that partial development, bearing in mind the full development later on, it is stated here that</P>
    <P>The project contemplates utilising the total fall of about 100 feet between Lough Derg and Limerick in a single large step, by leading the water out of the river bed into an inlet canal.  As the surface level of Lough Derg and that of the turbine race are to be the same, it will be possible to make a very economical use of the stored water, as the turbines themselves will automatically regulate the amount of water in the lake.  By gradually enlarging the <Col N="2804" /> power station and by artificially increasing the area of the storage basin, it will be possible to attain the fullest possible development.</P>
    <P>That simply hints at the method upon which the German firm proceed. They reject entirely the report of a water-power committee set up under the auspices of the Board of Trade, which advocated the utilisation of the power of the river in a series of steps or a series of power houses in the river itself.  They have proceeded on the basis that the only economic use of the power available, allowing for the fullest development afterwards, was by means of a canal which diverted the water from the present bed of the river and made use of the total fall of 100 feet between Lough Derg and Limerick in one single large step.  That is really the basis and foundation of this scheme, and it is the point at which it diverges completely from previous reports as to how the power of the Shannon should be utilised, and it is the point upon which it is in conflict with certain propositions put forward for the utilisation of both the Liffey and the Shannon at the same time.  There is one general remark which I may also read.</P>
    <P>The project has the advantage of developing the greatest output, so that it can supply the whole country with current over a long period of development.  It has, furthermore, the great advantage of accommodating the contesting claims of agriculture (drainage questions), navigation, and power development.  It completely overcomes the difficulties met with in former attempts to solve these problems.  By artificially increasing the storage capacity of the lakes by means of embankments built along the banks, which are not high enough, it will become possible to drain the neighbouring land quite independently of the level of the water in the lakes.  Both navigation and power development require as high a water-level as possible, while agriculture, in the interests of good drainage, demands as low a level as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2805" /> There is at this point of the scheme a paragraph to which I want to make special reference.  It says that</P>
    <P>the Shannon Scheme described in the following is based on a tentative scheme submitted to the Irish Free State Government in January, 1924, which itself was based on the very valuable work of Mr. J. Chaloner Smith and the extremely accurate ordnance survey maps.  Mr. Smith has devoted several years of private work to co-ordinating, classifying and investigating, from a hydrological point of view, the official records and observations relating to the Shannon flow extending over a period of thirty years.  In the interests of the community he has most kindly placed the result of his labours at our disposal.  His investigations have besides shown that rainfall conditions in Ireland are very favourable to water-power development, much more so, for instance, than in Spain or Italy, where dry periods occur every year, such as occur scarcely every five or ten years on the Shannon, and also more favourable than in Norway, Sweden or Switzerland, where it happens that in winter, just when the largest amount of current is needed, water is scarce, while on the contrary, the Shannon has its largest discharge in winter.</P>
    <P>I refer to that paragraph for this reason.  It is exceedingly comforting to find that when a scheme of this kind had been long spoken of, and when it finally reached the stage where it had been put forward as a detailed project, and certain accurate details were discovered to be necessary for the furthering of the project, these details were there ready for use, and were very willingly made available to those people.  They were ready for use owing to the very expert work done by Mr. Chaloner Smith outside his official tours, and quite apart from his official duties over a period of years.  His period of work extended over a number of years, and was in connection with data for the Shannon collected over at least thirty years, and his results were found to be so accurate and had been <Col N="2806" /> attained in such a scientific way, that the building up of this report was strengthened and the pace of it was increased, and that finally a scheme based upon his studies met with the approval of the experts appointed.  I have spoken of the canal and described it as the foundation of the scheme.  The position of it is a matter that is being most eagerly canvassed.  Before I go on to describe where exactly this canal lies I would like to make this statement, that if and when this general scheme is approved and it comes to a matter of the compulsory acquisition of land, that land, when about to be acquired will, if persuasion can make this House see the point, be valued at the ordinary rate for land and not because the land has been rendered more valuable on account of this canal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated &ldquo;that to attain the most economic de velopment the scheme utilises as far as possible the water carried by the River Shannon itself.  Just above O'Briens-bridge a weir is provided which dams the water level of the river up to the level of the Lough Derg.  From there the service water is to be conducted by means of a head race at the right embankment, the average level varying from 95 to 100 feet.&rdquo;  Embankments are required to prevent the flooding of the surrounding territory.  I will deal later with the actual extent of these embankments.  I have mentioned the power-house, which is to lie in the district of Ardnacrusha, about three miles north of Limerick.  In the power-house there will be installed the turbines necessary for generating the electricity expected from the development of the river recommended, but in addition, bearing on the question of navigation, on which I touched earlier, on the left of the weir there is to be provided a ship-lock and a fish-ladder.  That brings up the question of two rather important items, the question of the protection of the fisheries and the question of the navigation of the Shannon. In the river as it is, during the greater part of the year, there would be a considerable volume of water sinking to a <Col N="2807" /> low quantity only in the summer, but under the arrangement projected in this plan there will be a certain amount of water drawn off from the old river bed and sent through the canal, but at the time of the migration of the fish the quantity of water remaining in the old river bed will be considerable, and, in case the fish so desire, they can proceed by the tail race through the canal to the power-station, and by a fish-ladder then get into the new canal above the weir at O'Brien's Bridge, and so later back into the Shannon.  I believe that the experience of other countries has shown that where you have a power-house at a canal and a considerable volume of water just below that, the fish will not use the old bed but will go where the water is deepest, and must find themselves eventually at the foot of the fall.  It is in order to provide for the work of the Minister for Fisheries and gain his support that a certain allowance has been made for this problem, and that there is a pass which will be sufficient to keep the fish in the river and to keep up the ordinary value of the fishing interests along the river itself.  The question of navigation is a more important item.  Here also a difference must be made between the partial development scheme, even between the small partial development scheme recommended and the fullest development scheme that may come later.  The report of the Canal Commission was, I think, to this effect, that there should be provision made for such rectification of the canal-ways that barges from 130 to 140 tons could proceed up as far as Killaloe.  With the existing system, barges of only 80 tons can proceed from the canal harbour at Limerick to Killaloc.  Above Killaloe there is navigation for barges of about 150 tons. That being the set of circumstances in regard to barges plying on the canal, there is this further fact that for all practical purposes there is no connection between the canal harbour at Limerick and what may be called the ocean harbour there.  Canal boats can only go down the Shannon at one hour of the day owing to tidal influences, but it is so dangerous the owners of the <Col N="2808" /> barges prefer not to risk the journey. As I said previously, the new situation arising under the scheme is in the main merely incidental to the scheme; the aim was primarily water-power and not to carry out the Canal Commission's recommendation.  But the findings of the Canal Commission were there, what they recommended was in itself suitable, and certain things necessary for the development of water-power led to the carrying out of the Canal Commissioners' recommendations, such as the deepening of the river at a certain point.  The result will be that even in the small partial development recommended by the experts barges of 150 tons can proceed over a 12-hours' period in the day from Limerick, from the ocean harbour, to the lock of the weir at the power house.  There is there provided a ship's hoist which raises these into the head water canal, and from that the journey to Athlone, presumably, is before them.  That is in the smaller partial development recommended by the experts.  In the fullest development provision was made for a ship's hoist capable of raising boats of 1,000 tons into the canal, and the canal allows for the passage of boats of 1,000 tons, so from the point of view of navigation the whole condition is improved.  The canal itself, if I may give one or two details just to show the magnitude of the work, is to be about 6½ miles long, running from a point in the district of Ardnacrusha, some three miles north of Limerick, and is about 100 yards wide.  The depth at the moment I have not got accurately, but, as I have said, it is sufficient to carry a volume of water necessary for the fullest development of the river, and sufficient to carry boats of 1,000 tons.  In the power station there are to be installed three machine sets, each of 30,000 h.p. in the partial development recommended. In the fullest development there will be three additional sets each generating 30,000 h.p. added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before leaving that question of the canal, I may speak here of the embankments about and even beyond the canal.  I have got the figures clearly as to any embanking required under <Col N="2809" /> the small partial development recommended, but under the fullest development there would be embankments of nearly 150 miles required along the side of the river.  On the drainage question, if I may put it in terms of acreage at the moment, the area liable to flooding is about 11,000 acres, and the amount necessarily drained as part of the full scheme would be all that portion, and in addition whatever portion of the catchment area of the Shannon is subject to flooding at the moment.  Under the small development the drainage actually accomplished is of course much less, but the report of the experts recommends that, apart from the development of power, and in addition to any drainage necessitated by the particular power development there should be undertaken a complete drainage of that area.  The distribution of the power generated at the power house is set out in a rather long paragraph, from which I might quote as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proposed to construct the distribution network in the following manner.  A so-called overland busbar carrying 100,000 v. traverses the entire district.  This busbar connects the power station on the one hand with Dublin, where the most important current consumption is situated, and on the other hand with the city of Cork....  This line leads from the power station towards N.E. on the north side of the Shannon River, crosses the river at Killaloe, and the railway line Limerick-Killaloe.  The line then passes along the southern slope of the Arra Mountains, then to the north of Nenagh, where the railway line Limerick-Roscrea is crossed,&rdquo; running from there to Maryborough, where under the full development, another 100,000 volt station is provided.  It proceeds&mdash;&ldquo;From Maryborough the double line passes further north-east, and crosses south of Monasterevan, the Grand Canal, and the River Barrow, as well as the railway line Kildare-Athy and to the south of Newbridge, the River Liffey.  The line then turns N.N.E., crosses to the south of Naas the railway line Naas-Dunlavin, and passes then to the north of the Saggart Hill to the transformer station at Dublin.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What does the Minister mean by a power station at Maryboro'?  Does he mean a generating or transforming station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have made a mistake, I should have said a 100 k.v. station, a transforming station.  That 100 k.v. line would be the main line connecting, roughly, the power house, Maryboro', and Dublin, and on the other hand, running south direct to Cork.  In addition to that there are various subsidiary but still main lines of 35,000 voltage, and from these again there radiate out other lines of 10,000 voltage, the result being that when the distribution network is complete, it will be possible to supply, and there will be a supply, to the outskirts of the majority of towns, and to villages with at least 500 of a population.  When I say that they will be supplied, I do not of course mean that immediately after the completion of the scheme there would be transforming pole stations on the outskirts of every town, and of every village with a population of 500, but there is allowance made in the capital expenditure for the erection of these transforming pole stations and the transmission of electricity to towns, and villages with a population of 500.  Of course, electricity will not be brought to the outskirts of a town or village, unless within the three year period during which the scheme would develop; it is made clear that the inhabitants of a town, or the area about it, desired electricity to be brought to the outskirts of the town.  The capital sum of five million pounds, roughly set out as the capital cost of this scheme, allows for the provision of electricity by means of these various types of lines to all towns and to villages with a population of 500, in the Free State.  There are numerous details with regard to proposed railway construction, with regard to the details of the weir, and the sluices, and other technical matters, with which I do not intend to trouble the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other figures upon which I would like to make a statement.  The capital cost of the scheme of development recommended is put down as £5,200,000, and the figures as to certain <Col N="2811" /> items with regard to cost will appear much better and more clearly from portion of the Experts' report which is before Deputies.  I would like to give here an indication of what that total expenditure is supposed to cover. It covers the deepening of the bed of the Shannon above Killaloe, and the removal of the weir there; the protection of the banks on both sides of the Shannon above O'Brien's Bridge; the weir plant with the inlet construction at O'Brien's Bridge; certain road bridges across the head race, and the completion of the power station, the tail water canal, and the deepening of the Shannon below that point where the tail water canal again joins the Shannon; the railway sidings from Limerick docks to the railway station, and from the station at Long Pavement to the power house.</P>
    <P>That is one section of the works to be done under this estimate of the costs, and that is simply constructional costs to a certain point.  In addition to that there is also provision of the necessary machinery in the power house, of turbines of pressure pipe lines, surge-tank equipment, and all crane-equipment, weir plant, wherever necessary, certain pumps and ventilators.  Further, there is the transmission cost and the cost of the electrical portion.  At the power station there is the provision of generators, transformers, switch plant, all the electrical equipment and auxiliary machinery, and the huge, far-flung distribution network which itself would cost a very large sum and would entail immediate very heavy expenditure. There are some details of the actual mileage covered by the network.  I take one point, only the smallest.  The hundred-thousand volt-line from the power station, via Maryborough to Dublin, and from the power house to Cork covers an extent which necessitates wiring of about 170 miles, and, of course, for the small 35 kilo-volt line, and the ten kilo-volt line, the mileage would be much greater as they radiate out to all the surrounding towns, and do not go along the rather direct route that the main line runs.  The other portion of this scheme deals with the basis of economic calculation.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister goes away from that, though I am anxious not to interrupt too often, I think it would help if the Minister would state at this stage, what proportion of that £5,200,000 is involved in the initial development of which he spoke, and, secondly, what proportion of it is involved in transmission, as distinct from the general generating cost involving the civil engineering cost for generation?&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that it is almost impossible to segregate out certain of the costs the Deputy asks for.  The £5,200,000 is meant as the cost of carrying out the particular type of partial development recommended by the experts, but with the fullest development partly provided for.  Take one item&mdash;the provision of a canal of such a size that it will not have to be widened and deepened or lengthened in order to provide for the fullest possible utilisation of the powers of the Shannon.  So that when I say £5,200,000 as the cost of the particular type of development now recommended, it must be borne in mind that that includes a considerable amount of cost that could be avoided if we were merely to set out to develop here and now the particular type of partial development immediately required and not to care for the future. It is impossible for me now, but it can be done later, to disengage and say what portion of the £5,200,000 is really due to the particular type recommended and what is due to the fact that the experts look for a fuller development later.  I cannot at this moment disengage the other items the Deputy asks for, but I may say that the cost of generation as opposed to the cost of generation and distribution is a matter that can be got out quite easily later on.  The further details of the scheme that I have before me go into the general costings and that, as far as it is necessary for this House at the moment, is dealt with in the portion of the Experts' report that I am coming on to.  The scheme deals also with how far the provision of power may be utilised for the promotion of industry in the country, and many suggestions are made and considered by the Experts&mdash;&ldquo;suggestions <Col N="2813" /> made with regard to the promotion of new industry and how industries already existing may be helped by the provision of cheap power.&rdquo;  The scheme, as I said at the beginning, is so comprehensive that it can only be dealt with by submitting a portion to the House, and by giving sufficient time for the portion submitted to be considered.</P>
      <P>I set out merely to give some of the more general aspects of the whole scheme before going on to deal with what the experts have said with regard to the scheme.  I have circulated to the Dáil what is described as the conclusion of the experts' Report, and in that conclusion they set out how, in separate chapters, they deal with the main points of the scheme as presented to them.  I would like to proceed by way of limited commentary upon certain portions of the Report before me. On page I of this Report it is stated that the &ldquo;experts reckon, as a result of the examination, that the requirements in electrical energy in the Free State at the end of, roughly, two to three years from the coming into working of a national electrification supply may be estimated as about 150 million units (k.w.), measured at the outgoing terminals in a centralised power station.  These requirements, calculated per head of the population, lie below the world average.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That last sentence has to be emphasised. It means not below the average of that section of the world which uses electrical power but below the average all over, including Eskimos and others, who have not any electrical development. So it is a very conservative estimate of what ought to be the development within the period of two or three years after the coming into being of the national supply.  Later on on that page the question of how electrical energy is to be supplied in Ireland is dealt with, and the details of certain rival methods are set out &ldquo;either through one or more concentrated large plants, which, with a widespread transmission, distribute electricity over the whole country or either numerous small local stations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As that was a point that I felt certain was to be raised, I did ask the experts <Col N="2814" /> to go into that matter in some detail. But I quite failed to convince them that anybody in this country would plead for a series of numerous small local stations in opposition to one or more concentrated large plants. The very idea that people could be found in the country to plead for certain small stations in opposition to and in preference to large concentrated power stations&mdash;they could not conceive as possible.  It was impossible to make them realise that that point would be seriously argued.  If it is seriously argued later there is one argument I think which will be conclusive on the point, one which the experts regarded as conclusive.  It is only necessary to look at the prices at which small local stations in this country deliver to the consumer and the question is closed.  Although I directed the attention of the experts to this point what they have said in that paragraph is the best I could get by way of response to it.  The matter seemed to them beyond argument; a matter which required statement and not demonstration. On that point, therefore, they advised simply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In favour of the immediate erection of one centralised station capable of extension when necessary, to the full extent of the available power, and which is eventually to be combined with one or more additional large power stations.</P>
    <P>On page 3 of the Report before Deputies three proposals are put forward in contrast.  These are:&mdash;The Siemens-Schuckert Shannon scheme, the Liffey scheme and the Liffey-Shannon combination.  The paragraph immediately below that gives the starting off point for their observations on this matter.  They said they</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are aware that the Free State has not a very large quantity of water-power which can be developed.  Accordingly in setting out a plant for energy supply a pre-eminently suitable line of power development must be followed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a point on which they were more insistent than on any other.  It proceeds that &ldquo;No partial exploitation of a water power ought to be carried out which makes a full development later impossible from an economic view <Col N="2815" /> point.&rdquo;  Then again they say&mdash;&ldquo;That no plant should be built which cannot be adapted to growing demand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They say in the next paragraph&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These two fundamental viewpoints and consideration of the existing requirements have led the experts to declare that a partial development of the Shannon is the most suitable first step which the Free State can take in the way of electrification.  The first development stage which the experts suggest and which corresponds to a requirement of about 150 million units measured at the busbars of the power house is far from the full exploitation of the Siemens-Schuckert Partial Development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That again is a point which I would like to emphasise.  The Siemens-Schuckert scheme projected a full development or alternatively a partial development; the experts' recommendation is a partial development which &ldquo;is far from the full exploitation of the Siemens-Schuckert partial development.&rdquo; They speak of one which will meet with the requirements of about one hundred and fifty million units.</P>
    <P>On that it is necessary to give certain figures.  The exploitation which they suggest will be one to meet the requirements of about one hundred and fifty million units, but it has to be noted that when they speak of one hundred and fifty million units they speak of one hundred and fifty million units in a dry year&mdash;not in the average year in this country, but in a dry year.  The exploitation they now propose will, in fact, in an average year supply the requirements of about 195 million units, so there again it may be seen that the report proceeds on the most conservative lines possible.</P>
    <P>On Page 4 they go further into this first development stage of the Shannon, and in accordance with their general principles they look to certain principles and decide that this &ldquo;proposed first development stage of the Shannon River in no way prevents its full development.&rdquo;  There then follows this sentence:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2816" />&ldquo;All further development can be carried out roughly within the limits of what it would cost if it were carried out co-incident with the partial development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That of course means this: That the stage of the first partial development is such that it allows for later additions, and that the cost of these later additions when made, combined to the original cost will not be any more than what would have been the original cost of that whole portion if done at one time; that is to say it not merely allows for it technically, but it prepares the way for it technically, and financially the early lay out is so arranged that there will be no proportionately extravagant addition to the original cost in carrying out the later and fuller development. Further points of detail are referred to in the later portion of that paragraph.  Mention is made in the next page of the question of the Liffey development as opposed to the development of the Shannon.  The second paragraph on page 5 states that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in the opinion of the experts, the Liffey River will also be developed later on, either during the further development of the Shannon or more probably after this, depending on how the consumption of electricity develops.  The Liffey storage would in all probability make possible a valuable compensating system for the full development of the Shannon; nevertheless it will be necessary to examine if it would not be more advantageous to use the existing steam station or eventually a new steam station for energy supply at low water periods or for covering peak loads.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, put in another way, means this, that it is possible that when the Shannon is fully developed and when the needs of the country go beyond the development of the Shannon, the Liffey then can be added on.  But while admitting that the Liffey may later become a valuable compensating plant, the experts pass no judgment on whether it would be advisable to add on the Liffey afterwards to the Shannon or to proceed by way of the <Col N="2817" /> Shannon, plus either the existing steam development or a new steam plant.  In the fourth paragraph on that page, their definite judgment on the Liffey is given.  It is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To develop the Liffey at the present time is not advisable because it is too small, because it can supply only the needs of Dublin, and because its output capacity would be very quickly swallowed up, while four-fifths of the State would have no share in the advantages of electricity supply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further, they are of the opinion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the current could be delivered cheaper from the Shannon to the larger consumer, that is Dublin, than it would from the Liffey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the point of view of the Liffey alone, in contrast to the Shannon as the power agent over the whole country, the position is clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if emphasis is to be laid on the word &ldquo;would&rdquo; in that paragraph? There is a contrast drawn between the two words &ldquo;could&rdquo; and &ldquo;would.&rdquo; The experts are of opinion &ldquo;that the current &lsquo;could&rsquo; be delivered cheaper from the Shannon,&rdquo; and then say &ldquo;than it &lsquo;would&rsquo; from the Liffey.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think that at the present moment it would be advisable to state the wages basis.  Full allowance has been made in the detailed costings.  On the question of wages, there need be no fear that the experts were building on the rate of wages in their own countries.  They were very definitely put in possession of information with regard to wages here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of wages is based on information supplied by my own Department.  On page 6 there occurs a definite recommendation of the experts in the matter of drainage.  They advised me that in their mind it was probably somewhat outside the limits of the examination they had been set to do; but the necessity for it was so impressed on them that they ventured to put it in at this point.  Having drawn attention to an important economic point indirectly connected with the Shannon scheme, they go on to speak of certain regulations connected with the flow conditions in the lakes and the river even under partial development.  The experts then recommend the Government to have the drainage of this area carried out in conjunction with the work which is required for the power scheme.  This would mean, they say, if desired, the carrying out earlier than otherwise of a portion of the embankments necessary for the further development of the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I explained that point clearly when I spoke before.  It means that in the fullest development of the Shannon there would have been such a series of embankments and such other provisions that the eleven or twelve thousand acres that are subject to flooding would be relieved.  They are not now recommending the full development of the water power; they are recommending a development which <Col N="2819" /> will not require the same process of embankment and therefore incidental to the scheme, it will not drain such an area of the Shannon as would be drained by the fullest development.  But the experts have been so convinced by their journeyings in the country that the drainage of the area is necessary, that they recommend the Government to proceed at once with the whole Shannon drainage scheme, portion of which will be incidental to the development of the power, and some of which would not ordinarily be attempted as an adjunct of power development until the fullest possible stage of development was reached.  On page 6 there occurs a paragraph which brought certain joy to my heart.  It runs:&mdash;&ldquo;During the period of construction of the first partial development about 2,500 workers would be employed on the power development work proper for three years.  About three hundred further workers would be necessary for the building of the distribution transmission lines.  Lastly, the drainage plan proposed in conjunction with it would employ in addition numerous workers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They touch again on the question of navigation conditions and on fisheries. Again I would emphasise that on the point dealt with in the navigation conditions there has been close attention paid to the recommendations of the Canal Commission.  The scheme would in this matter achieve the results approved by the Commission and estimated by that Commission to cost about a quarter of a million.  On page 7 there is given a statement of the costs.  The constructional cost of the first partial development, including the distribution of the transmission system, works out at about £5,200,000.  &ldquo;The cost includes the complete distributing transmission system bringing electricity to the vast majority of towns and villages of over 500 population and also the preparatory work incidental to the full development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would here say that &ldquo;the vast majority of towns&rdquo; is simply put in because it may happen that when the very valuable map which I have is produced, I may get a submission from <Col N="2820" /> some town that has not been included. It is just possible that some town may have been overlooked, and I do not want to have it said afterwards that I seemed to be very confident that every town was supplied.  Therefore, the guarding words, &ldquo;vast majority,&rdquo; are included.  Further on in page 7 you find the average cost of electrical energy at the power station worked out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that the price of .42 of a penny, which he mentioned a little while ago, is somewhat misleading, in view of the fact that this is for 150 million units and that Ireland only consumes at present 46 million units; and does not the Minister think that the equivalent price should therefore be not .42 of a penny, but 1.5 of a penny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be misleading to anyone who reads this statement. It clearly speaks of, and is based upon, a consumption of 150 million units.  It is only if one sets out deliberately to mislead oneself that any mistake can be made.  At the end of page 7 it sets out: &ldquo;The experts' investigations have shown that electricity can be delivered in bulk to towns, villages, etc., at a price which is appreciably lower than that at which it could be developed in modern individual town plants.&rdquo;  It is to be remembered that the .52 of a penny of which I spoke, and not .42 of a penny, refers to the power delivered to the greatest consumer, and that is Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is .53 of a penny.  The price to places other than Dublin will, of course, be greater, but no matter what it gets to under this scheme, and it may get to anything under bad management and bad conditions, the price it is estimated to get to, even for towns and villages, should amount to a price less than the price at which electricity could be developed in any individual town plant.  The point I refer to is dealt with at page 8. You will find there that: &ldquo;Owing to the relatively high costs of distribution, <Col N="2821" /> due to the smaller degree to which the distribution system is exploited, the price of current for the medium and smaller towns will be appreciably higher.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I might add one word of explanation there.  It is owing to the relatively high cost of distribution, due to the smaller degree to which the distribution system is exploited for medium and smaller towns, that the price of current will be appreciably higher. Then the report goes on to say: &ldquo;The experts are, however, of the opinion that the scheme will allow of energy being supplied for those consumers at an economically justifiable price which is appreciably below the cost at which energy may be developed in a town plant.&rdquo;  There follows here a point which may need some explanation. You will find this: &ldquo;The experts expect that payment, out of revenue, of interest on capital to the full extent of 5½ per cent., after payment of all working expenses and sinking fund, will not be practicable until about the fifth year after the coming into operation of the system.  In comparison with similar important undertakings abroad which provide for the community at large, these are thoroughly normal conditions. At the end of about five years a profit would be obtainable after full interest had been paid on the capital. Fifteen per cent. addition to the cost is included in the above-mentioned capital of £5,200,000 and £7,870,000, respectively, to cover the interest during the period of construction, as also the insufficiency in interest in the first four working years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to say, they enlarged the capital so as to leave £400,000 for the payment of interest at a time when they did not think it wise to look for that interest being properly payable out of the revenue to be derived from the sale of power during the first four or five years, and that addition of £400,000 was provided to allow for interest on capital for the period stated. One further point which is not made clear in this report, and to which I alluded incidentally, may be stated quite clearly now.  It will take about three years for this scheme to develop. In other words, from the day the first <Col N="2822" /> work on the canal or power-house is started until the electricity arrives in Dublin, there will be a period of three years.  That comes in incidentally in the question of workers and that is the estimate of the time over which the construction will run.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I intimated before the adjournment that I wished to read one other portion of the experts' Report, a chapter which I had asked them to pay special attention to, and which I asked them to be more expeditious in the production of than the complete Report.  That is, Chapter VIII. of the Report, which they describe as the chapter dealing with the alternative possibilities of developing electrical energy from the water power in the Free State.  I propose to read this to the House.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The sources of water power in the Free State have been enumerated in the Board of Trade &lsquo;Report on the Water Power Resources of Ireland,&rsquo; 1921, and in the &lsquo;Report on Water Power,&rsquo; of January, 1922. Amongst the possible sources there is at the moment question only of the Shannon scheme, the Liffey projects, and the combined Liffey-Shannon solution.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The experts have already emphasised the fact that the Irish Free State does not contain any considerable quantity of water power, as the fall conditions in the country are comparatively unfavourable.  Accordingly, it is necessary to work out the plan for the supply of energy in the most conscientious manner, so that it will be possible to exploit to the full the economic water power available in proportion as the demand for it develops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In about twenty years' time the Shannon works and also the Liffey plant will, no doubt, be completely <Col N="2824" /> constructed and will be connected with one another, as also possibly with other individual steam plants; a uniform sound supply of electricity for the Irish Free State being insured by this means.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, there is in reality only one question: How should the successive stages of this development take place, which river should be developed first?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before continuing the quotation from the Report I may say that a distinction has been made between the three Liffey projects at present before the Private Bill Committee and that this Report adverts to one of them. That is, so far, the reason that it had been put to me in letters received that the promoters of a particular Liffey project were not concerned so much with the Liffey alone as with the Liffey viewed as the beginning of a national power development; the Liffey first, with some stage of the Shannon, and advancing by steps on the Shannon. There falls for consideration here, therefore, mainly a national scheme which has as its origin the Liffey development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that conception common to all the Liffey projects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It has only been put to me as common to one, but the Report will reply to any other.  To return to the Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The &lsquo;National Electricity Supply Scheme&rsquo; drawn up by Messrs. J.F. Crowley and Partners, is not essentially different from the Liffey projects: Both groups are directed towards the same end, the utilisation of the power of the Liffey.  They are based on the idea that this plant alone can be of interest to financiers, because it will supply the city of Dublin and environs, that is, the principal consumer in the Free State, and through this one customer the plant will have a full load&mdash;that is to say, will be fully exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The experts admit unquestionably that if the Shannon works were not to be built the construction of the Liffey plant would be very desirable and suitable for Dublin.  The experts, <Col N="2825" /> however, are obliged to contemplate the question of the supply of electricity to the Free State from a higher standpoint, and to consider the electrification of the whole country while in no way injuring the justifiable interests of Dublin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At this point it can be stated that the Shannon Scheme supplies the whole Free State as well as its capital while the Liffey scheme can supply the capital and environs only.  The construction of the Liffey plant and the supply of electricity to Dublin will in no way prepare for the electrification of the remainder of the Free State.  But as the Government cannot delay the supply of electricity to the remaining Irish towns and to the country, the experts are of the opinion that it would be necessary to undertake immediately the erection of a further centralised power station on a large scale, for which very considerable sums of money would have to be invested.  For these reasons the experts recommend that in the first place the construction of the Shannon works should be proceeded with, because, even in the partial development, it will make three to five times as much energy available as the Liffey works; because it will at the same time give the whole country a share in the advantages of electricity supply and because it can supply current on more favourable terms to the capital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The experts are quite conscious of the fact that there are financial disadvantages in the way of this development although these disadvantages will hold only for a few years.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One who is compelled to give his principal consideration to an immediate financial return will construct the Liffey works.  But one who has before his eyes a national scheme to be carried out in the interests of the whole people and who to that end decides to wait for some years for the development of a sufficient demand will develop the Shannon.  The capital costs estimated by the experts in Chapter VII. accordingly contain an item of 15 per cent. for building interests <Col N="2826" /> and loss of interest during the first four or five working years.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Liffey works were built to-day and Dublin alone were supplied the whole problem remains unsolved for the State; its basis is, however worsened, because the Shannon works would still have to be built in their partial development stage without the security of having the largest consumer as a customer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The solution suggested by Messrs. J.F. Crowley and Partners, i.e., that in addition to the Liffey plant a modest partial development of the River Shannon should be carried out a few years later, or even now, must be rejected on the one hand, because a development of the River Shannon in a number of successive steps is in itself uneconomic, all the more so when the first steps are carried out without any regard to the succeeding ones; on the other hand, because a development of the Shannon now together with the Liffey would render the output of the latter (approx. 50 or 65 mill. units) superfluous when the partial development of the Shannon is carried out in the manner in which the experts think it ought to be (with 150 mil. units&mdash;the calculated needs of the Free State).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The suggestions of Messrs. J.F. Crowley and Partners have been examined in detail by the experts. They have also had a conversation with Dr. J.F. Crowley in order to be clear about his aims.  In the communication of the 4th November, 1924, the authors of this plan mention that only one power plant on the River Shannon is under consideration. They suggest a partial development of the river below Killaloe with a step of 18 feet.  In the later letter of the 12th November, 1924, there was talk of a fall of 60 feet, which presumably (analogous to the Siemens-Schuckert plan) is to be attained, at least in part, by means of a power canal.  Accordingly, the point of view underwent a considerable change during a period of a week, presumably as a result of further studies.  In any event the fixed <Col N="2827" /> Shannon proposition of Messrs. Crowley and Partners is not yet ripe enough in its fundamental principles. The experts are accordingly convinced that if Dr. J.F. Crowley continues his studies he will arrive at the same conclusion as the experts and Messrs. Siemens Schuckert, namely, that the development of the entire fall stage&mdash;Lough Derg, Limerick&mdash; with about 90 to 100 feet of a fall in one step and in its entirety, is the only correct economical means of utilising the Shannon, and the only non-destructive plan for further development.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that Messrs. Crowley and Partners&mdash;in as far as their plan is concerned&mdash;have an interest in not estimating at too high a level the capacity of the River Shannon or the storage power of its lakes, because, the more the storage space of the Shannon is improved, the less will be the advantages of the suggested Liffey-Shannon combination.  This does not mean to suggest that the two rivers should not be later used in combination, but the possibility of this ought not to be used to limit the complete development of the Shannon. The diagrams of Dr. J.F. Crowley show that the proportion between the increase of constant yearly energy and increase in storage grows less and less as the storage is enlarged, obviously in order to argue that there are no economic advantages in developing the Shannon plant beyond a certain point.  But it must be observed that in every plant using storage the relatively largest increase of its constant energy is invariably produced by the first units of the storage content.  This is, therefore, not a peculiarity of the Liffey-Shannon combination alone. If one includes, instead of the storage content of the Liffey, an equivalent volume of the Shannon, then the energy obtained from the latter by this means will work out cheaper than that obtained in the Liffey-Shannon combination.  There are, accordingly, no reasons for not availing of the widest possible storage in <Col N="2828" /> the Shannon plant.  Moreover, in contrast to the statement of Messrs. J.F. Crowley and Partners, it is a fact that the equivalent storage-space-unit in the Liffey is not cheaper than in the Shannon, that the increase of the storage space in the Shannon will produce regulated conditions with regard to the floods which occur to-day, and will establish the basis for a systematic drainage of the Shannon basin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From a purely financial point of view one might also argue that it would be advantageous to develop the step between the World's End weir and Donass, as is mentioned in the report on water power.  This, however, ignores the fact that hereby a loss of about 13m. of the whole fall would be involved, because it could not be utilised later on in an economic manner.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposition of Messrs. J.F. Crowley and Partners is represented only by a dossier&mdash;a veritable scheme is not before us.  It is true that such a scheme would be worked out if the experts wish it.  However, the experts are of opinion that for general national and national economic reasons the combination Shan-non-Liffey has advantages over the combination Liffey-Shannon, and that accordingly the further study of the Liffey scheme in its connection with the Shannon plant can be deferred at least until such date as the partial development of the Shannon is utilised to the full.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last sentence would mean in about twenty-five years' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one set of advisers in this matter, the experts to whom all the schemes were submitted, and whose Report in part has been laid before the House, and whose Report in full, when received, will be circulated to Deputies, or laid before the House.  The point I think we have arrived at, as a result of what I have said to-night, is that we have <Col N="2829" /> advanced, in accordance with the White Paper, to the point where the Shannon scheme has been modified and has been in a particular stage approved in the most enthusiastic way by the experts selected for the purpose of investigating the whole Report.  It will be for the Dáil later to decide whether the experts' recommendations as to a partial development stage in a small way, in comparison with the partial development stage in the fullest way, as outlined by Messrs. Siemens and Schuckert, or the fuller stage still, is to be proceeded with, and to determine any other question connected with the carrying out of the terms of the White Paper.  It is my statement to the Dáil, without in any way committing the Dáil, but realising the importance of this scheme, and the importance of the speediest work possible on the scheme.  I should proceed in certain ways, as if the terms of the White Paper were further to be complied with.  That is to say, that I should, at least, think out and prepare for the organisation of the development of the stage as recommended by the experts, on the assumption that the experts' Report will meet with the approval of the House, and that further steps along the lines of the White Paper will be approved by the House.</P>
      <P>The House will not be committed in any way.  It will be a matter of Departmental organisation, a matter of striving to have certain things brought fully up to date so that when this House next gets a chance of voicing its opinion on this matter, if its opinion prove favourable, there would be no delay in proceeding with the carrying out of the scheme as recommended by the experts, or any other stage that would be further approved by the House.</P>

      <P>It will only commit myself to a further expenditure of energy and certain officials of mine to an expenditure of time and energy.  I have spoken of the experts in connection with this scheme, and I think it <Col N="2830" /> only right that I should say that, being entirely inexpert in the matter and being very much in the dark as to what particular type of expert judgment should be brought to bear on this report, I consider myself extremely lucky in the four who were finally selected and whose judgment is in part before this House.  The choice was governed by a variety of conditions; the countries from which experts were to be chosen had first to be decided, and some investigation made as to where experts were likely to be found.  With regard to the four gentlemen who actually did pass their judgment on this scheme I doubt if so much talent of a technical type has been brought to bear upon any proposal in this country for years as was brought to bear upon the proposition put forward by Messrs.  Siemens Schuckert.  Yet, to a certain extent the experts selected themselves. When you had before you the chance of securing the main director of the whole Norwegian State Electricity system, and the second in command of the whole Swedish State Electricity system, and when a comparison was made between these two countries and Ireland, and when the state of development in either of these two countries, at a not very late period in their history was contrasted with what exists here to-day, it was almost essential and automatic that the choice of Director Borgquist and Director Norberg-Schulz should be made.  When referring to Director Borgquist of the Swedish system I desire to express my own appreciation, an appreciation in which, I am sure, the House will join, of the courtesy of the Swedish Government, through their Legation in London, in allowing Director Borgquist to be absent from his own State work in order to carry out expert judgment of this scheme.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned the two Directors of the State systems first, because, as I say, they almost automatically selected themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not mean that I am in any way disappointed or less appreciative of the work done by Professor Rohn and Professor Meyer-Peter, the two Swiss experts who joined in presenting the report on this scheme.  When the <Col N="2831" /> technical experts of Switzerland fell for consideration, the names of these two professors also came to the forefront at once.  So that having decided that Switzerland was a country the electrical development of which was such as to make almost necessary the selection of a Swiss expert for technical details such as this, it was again almost automatic that the names of Professor Rohn and Professor Meyer-Peter should be brought prominently before those who were to make the selection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the actual work done by those four in combination, I, being inexpert in these matters, do not believe that I can fully appreciate the tremendous task that it must have been to examine, in a very intensive way and over a relatively short period, a scheme of such magnitude and set out in such comprehensive detail as the Siemens-Schuckert scheme was set out.  I had contact with the four experts while they were in Dublin, and with one of them in Zurich, and I had a certain opportunity of observing their work.  It is, of course, obvious that I am not in a position properly to evaluate what they have done, but there were things which were made clear to even an amateur's view, the application, the diligence, and the enthusiasm which they showed about their work, the care which they took over it, the details into which they went, the fact that they were able to, and that they actually did draw themselves away from their own work and spend a certain time in Ireland on the scheme, added to the amount of time which they gave to it while they were in their own homes, all this makes it quite clear that there could not possibly be a more conscientious and diligent piece of work than was performed by these four experts.  I need say nothing of the firm of Messrs. Siemens Schuckert; their report, when published in detail and submitted to the criticisms of this House, acting upon various criticisms passed by the experts, will firmly establish a reputation here which has been very definitely established elsewhere, in every country outside of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have briefly referred to Irish contact with the scheme in the person of <Col N="2832" /> Mr. Chaloner Smith, and I would like to refer to that again, because while I have found myself subjected to criticism for not appointing Irish experts to supervise a scheme of this magnitude, and while that criticism may still be pressed, I may here state, without any hypocrisy, that it gave me the greatest pleasure to hear the comments of those of the Siemens Schuckert firm who were engaged on the preparation of the Report on the Shannon upon the careful and conscientious work which Mr. Chaloner Smith had done, outside of office hours and of his official duties, over a period of years, done with such technical accuracy and in such a scientific method that the basis of the scheme was ready for the Siemens Schuckert people when first they arrived to prepare their scheme.</P>
    <P>That was one Irish point of contact with it.  There was another.  It gives me considerable pride in the University in which I graduated to find that it was a young Irish graduate of that University who, being in the employment of Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert, first thought of and followed with enthusiasm this project of the development of the River Shannon.  It is possibly a year since this project of the utilisation of the power of the River Shannon for the country's needs first came clearly before the mind of Dr. McLoughlin, and over that period, while the scheme was part forming and while his attention was directed to other events, he showed so much energy and enthusiasm in getting this particular project brought to a head that he did finally succeed in impressing his point of view upon the directors of Siemens Schuckert firm and upon the Cabinet of the Irish Government. It does seem to me to be a matter worthy of comment that in a country in which electrical engineers have so little chance of being properly developed, there was discovered, at the proper time, a young graduate of the National University who, in a distant country, could conceive the idea of this, could interest the great firm of Siemens Schuckert in it, and could, by attention to details that were within his own province, help to get prepared a scheme which has secured the approval of these experts, the approval <Col N="2833" /> which has been in part put before you this evening.  I consider that although Irishmen might have been to a certain extent removed from advising on the details of this project, there is, at any rate, a certain amount of pride to be taken from the fact that in the persons of Mr. Chaloner Smith and Dr. McLoughlin there was to some degree Irish contact with this great scheme.</P>
    <P>I have circulated a document containing particulars of the scheme.  The document is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The fundamentals of the problem of electrification for Ireland are discussed in the Introduction and Chapters I, and II. of this Report.  Chapter I contains the results of the examination by the experts of the energy requirements; Chapter V. contains detailed particulars on this point.  Chapter II. deals with the Hydraulic and Geological conditions of the Shannon river.  In Chapter III., entitled &ldquo;Water Economy Plan,&rdquo; the time relation of water quantity to energy demand is examined in accordance with the actual and latent requirements in energy.  Hereby the size of storage is settled.  Chapters IV. and VI. deal with the projected constructional works, the machine and electrical plant, the judgment of the experts thereon, and lay down the charges and extensions which they recommend.  The modifications proposed by the experts, in accordance with the White Paper of the 24th and 29th February, 1924, have necessitated further investigation in the Shannon area as also further researches and estimates by Messrs Siemens Schuckert. The results of these modifications are approved by the experts and will be handed by the firm through the experts to the Government in the shortest possible time.  Chapter VII. deals with calculations relating to the economics of the scheme, the costings, and with the works organisation, as also with the production costs of electricity and the probable returns on capital invested. In Chapter VIII, using as a basis the material to hand, there is an examination of the further possibilities of developing energy in the Free State. Hereunder the results of the above-mentioned studies are put together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2834" /> The experts reckon as a result of the examination that the requirements in electrical energy in the Free State at the end of roughly two to three years from the coming into working of a national electrification supply may be estimated at about 150 million units (k. Wh.), measured at the outgoing terminals in a centralised power station. These requirements calculated per head of the population lie below the world average.  As soon as electrical energy is available at cheap rates based on a sound economy the consumption will in a few years reach the above-mentioned level.  A far-seeing commercial management of the whole electrification plant has to aim, therefore, at ensuring that the advantages and numerous uses of electrical energy in household, industrial and agricultural spheres shall become known to everybody.</P>
    <P>Electrical energy can in the main be won in two ways in Ireland, either through numerous small local stations, each striving independently to deal with local conditions as well as possible, or through one or more concentrated large plants which, with a wide-spread transmission system, distribute electricity over the whole country.  Such concentrated plants are to be preferred, as they permit of a much better compensating system in the requirements of electrical energy and allow current to be supplied at lower prices.  The experts advise in favour of the immediate erection of one centralised station, capable of extension when necessary to the full extent of the available power, and which is eventually to be combined with one or more additional large power stations.</P>
    <P>The experts have established as a result of their investigations that in the first development stage a centralised water power station is to be preferred to a fuel-burning station, as the existing available water power in Ireland permits of such cheap development as to allow of successful competition with fuel-burning stations.  There is a further consideration in favour of water power of importance to the State&mdash; which presumably will take over electricity supply&mdash;namely, that of independence in its electricity supply, even if coal eventually becomes cheaper.  It <Col N="2835" /> may be here remarked that even though Ireland has in the matter of water power only small heads, yet there seldom exists in other lands so good coincidence in point of time between water quantities and energy demand.</P>
    <P>At present three proposals for the development of water power are in the foreground.  There is that which the experts have, in the first place, to examine, Messrs. Siemens Schuckert Shannon scheme, further, the Liffey schemes, and, finally, the Liffey-Shannon combination.</P>
    <P>The experts are aware that the Free State has not a very large quantity of water power which can be developed. Accordingly in setting out a plan for energy a pre-eminently suitable line of power development must be followed. Above all no partial exploitation of a water power ought to be carried out which makes a full development later impossible from an economic view point.  On the other hand, for the start no plant should be built which cannot be adapted to growing demand.</P>
    <P>These two fundamental view-points and consideration of the existing requirements have led the experts to declare that a partial development of the Shannon is the most suitable first step which the Free State can take in the way of electrification.  The first development stage which the experts suggest, and which corresponds to a requirement of about 150 million units measured at the busbars of the power house is far from the full exploitation of the Siemens Schuckert partial development. Combined with existing steam stations which would be called on to supply an average of ten million units per year additional energy, the partial development is capable of delivering about 225 million units per year.</P>
    <P>The proposed first development stage of the Shannon River in no way prevents its full development.  All further development can be carried out roughly within the limits of what it would cost if it were carried out coincident with the partial development.  Some work necessary for further development of the river must be carried out coincident <Col N="2836" /> with the partial development, as it would later be more costly or would disturb the running of the station.  The tail race, the machine house, and the storage in the lakes would be further developed by the simple process of being somewhat enlarged.  The head race would remain unchanged.  The storage development can be carried out in a succession of stages.  First of all Lough Derg would be regulated without increasing its level, then the level of Lough Ree would be increased, after this Lough Allen and lastly Lough Derg.  During a dry year and without using any additional sources of energy there could accordingly be delivered the year's requirements for general supply as outlined in the full development, about 275 million units.  By a moderate addition of steam energy the afore-mentioned units could be considerably increased by an average of about 30 to 40 per cent a year.</P>
    <P>The experts declare themselves distinctly in favour of this one step system of partial development as against the more expensive and in general less suitable system of development in a number of steps which necessitates various separate weir plants and various separate machine houses.  The Siemens Schuckert partial development, in the reduced form suggested by the experts, will, as already mentioned, deliver about 150 million units, and this is the smallest plant with which the electrification of the Free State should be begun to-day, if a supply of energy for the use of the whole country is the consideration.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the experts the Liffey River will also be developed later on, either during the further development of the Shannon or more probably after this, depending on how the consumption of electricity develops. The Liffey storage would in all probability make possible a valuable compensating system for the full development of the Shannon; nevertheless it will be necessary to examine if it would not be more advantageous to use the existing steam station, or eventually a new steam station for energy supply at low water periods or for covering peak loads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2837" /> In about twenty years the fully developed Shannon, together with the Liffey plant, and the steam stations would probably build an advantageous source of electricity supply for the Free State.</P>
    <P>To develop the Liffey at the present time is not advisable, because it is too small, because it can supply only the needs of Dublin, and because its output capacity would be very quickly swallowed up, while four-fifths of the State would have no share in the advantages of electricity supply.  The experts are of the opinion that the current could be delivered cheaper from the Shannon, to the largest consumer, that is Dublin, than it would from the Liffey.</P>
    <P>The experts wish to draw special attention to an important economic point which indirectly is connected with the carrying out of the Shannon scheme.</P>
    <P>Flow conditions in the lakes and in the river will be regulated in providing for storage&mdash;in the first partial development at Lough Derg, and on the Shannon from Lough Derg to Meelick; later by the full development at Lough Ree, Lough Allen, and from Meeling to Lough Ree.  This regulation of the river forms the fundamental basis for a drainage of the Shannon area.  The experts recommend the Government to have the drainage of this area carried out in conjunction with work which is required for the power scheme.  This would mean, if desired, the carrying out, earlier than otherwise, of a portion of the embankments necessary for the further development of the river.</P>
    <P>The surplus energy available in winter would make possible in the most suitable fashion the running of seasonal industries, whereby a limited number of workers engaged in summer in agriculture would find employment in winter.</P>
    <P>During the period of the construction of the first partial development, about 2,500 workers would be employed on the power development work proper for three years.  About 300 further workers would be necessary for the building of the distribution transmission lines.  Lastly, the drainage plan <Col N="2838" /> proposed in conjunction with it would employ in addition numerous workers.</P>
    <P>Navigation conditions between Lough Derg and the Harbour of Limerick would be very much improved.  In particular the ten locks on this stretch would be replaced by one single ships hoist.</P>
    <P>For protecting the fisheries all possible precautions are provided, in particular, fish passes by the weir at O'Brien's Bridge, as also at the Turbine House.</P>
    <P>The constructional cost of the first partial development (including the distributing transmission system, works out according to the estimates of Messrs. Siemens Schuckert, and taking into consideration the modifications of the experts at about £5,200,000&mdash;providing for 63,000 installed kw.  The cost includes the complete distributing transmission system bringing electricity to the vast majority of towns and villages of over 500 population, and also the preparatory work incidental to the full development.  The cost for the eventual final development works out at about £7,870,000, providing for 126,000 kw. installed.  The average cost of electrical energy at the power station will work out as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The experts' investigations have shown that electricity can be delivered in bulk to towns, villages, etc., at a <Col N="2839" /> price which is appreciably lower than that at which it could be developed in modern individual town plants.</P>
    <P>Because of the different costs of distribution the prices of electricity must be varied according to the amount of energy consumed.  For the greatest consumer (Dublin) the cost of current would not be more than 0.53d. per unit at the place of delivery.</P>
    <P>Owing to the relatively high costs of distribution due to the smaller degree to which the distribution system is exploited, the price of current for the medium and smaller towns will be appreciably higher.  The experts are, however, of the opinion that the scheme will allow of energy being supplied for these consumers at an economically justifiable price which is appreciably below the cost at which energy may be developed in a single town plant.  The experts expect that payment out of revenue of interest on capital to the full extent of 5½ per cent. after payment of all working expenses and sinking fund will not be practicable until about the fifth year after the coming into operation of the system.  In comparison with similar important undertakings abroad which provide for the community at large, these are thoroughly normal conditions.  At the end of about five years a profit would be obtainable after full interest had been paid on the capital.  15 per cent. addition to the cost is included in the above-mentioned capital of £5,200,000 and £7,870,000 respectively to cover the interest during the period of construction as also the insufficiency in interest in the first four working years.  This addition should prove approximately right.</P>
    <P>The experts hope that the State eventually, in conjunction with the towns, will succeed in carrying through the electrification of the Free State, beginning with the economically most favourable possibility, the partial development of the Shannon River as proposed by Messrs. Siemens Schuckert and as modified by the experts.</P>
    <P>The estimates of Messrs. Siemens Schuckert fulfil the conditions laid down in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2840" /> The price of the hydro-electric energy produced lies thoroughly within the limits of that paid in countries which are better developed in the matter of electricity supply.</P>
    <P>If the authorities who supply electricity to the consumer endeavour to carry out a sound supply price policy, the consumption will increase considerably and the price of electricity to the consumer will work out about as favourable, for example, as in Switzerland, a country which has experienced an enormous development in the spread of electricity.</P>
    <P>The disposition and the carrying through of the electrification plan will require from the State the closest attention.</P>

      <P>I think it was fairly well understood that this was not to be an occasion for discussing the statement of the Minister, but possibly one or two questions might be raised and answered to save unsatisfactory controversy during the recess.  I think it is not out of place while congratulating the country as the Minister has done on the work that he has outlined this evening in a way so different from many other projects that have been boosted in the newspapers, that I should agree with the view that there has been a real scientific examination of this scheme before it was formally placed before the country.  I think we are entitled also to congratulate ourselves and the Minister upon having heard so lucid and clear a statement of a very complicated subject.  I felt, while hearing the story, that I was having related by word of mouth one of H.G. Well's stories or, perhaps, De Rougement's fantasies.  However, we know as a matter of fact it is not a fantasy, and it is not a fable inasmuch as it is a scheme as outlined by scientists who have presumably at the back of their minds finance, as well as science, and that brings us down to earth, and adds very much to our appreciation of the statement made by the Minister. There are two or three questions which the Minister might possibly be able to answer, which I would like to put.  The first is whether in the course of the discussions <Col N="2841" /> and the enquiries, any thought has been given to the Erne and the falls of the Erne in the Ballyshannon district and the fitting in of that power with a national scheme of electrical development. There is one other question which has reference to the first page of the White Paper referring to the binding estimate, &ldquo;The actual proposals of the firm were as follows, to make a binding estimate as to costs, including the price at which power can be delivered to the cities, towns, and other places.&rdquo;  The Minister has referred to a price of .53 delivered in Dublin.  Then he went on to say that that was based on an estimated consumption of 150,000,000 units.  I would like to know whether that is a binding estimate.  Does it mean that if this scheme is fulfilled by the firm of Siemen Schuckert that they bind themselves to deliver to Dublin at this price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a great deal of controversy might be saved if that can be stated to be the position.  Then I would like to have the Minister's view as to how this question is to be brought before the Dáil&mdash;whether it is intended that a Private Bill or a Public Bill will be submitted to the Dáil and Seanad, whether there will be the same kind of critical and possibly expert examination as has taken place in regard to the other Liffey schemes, or whether there is to be simply a public, periodical&mdash;that is to say, a newspaper controversy.  In a general way I would like to know what is the Minister's view of the method of bringing this matter under criticism before the scheme is undertaken with the sanction of the Legislature.  Also, I would like to ask him whether it has yet been decided, even in his own mind or the minds of the Executive, that if this scheme is to be taken in hand, it is to be taken in hand as a private venture or as a national scheme, not merely as a national scheme for the supply of power but worked out under national auspices at the risk of the State as well as at the expense of the State, or whether it is to be handed over for private exploitation under certain limitations.  I think that is a question that has been probably already decided and I think the Dáil should be advised at the earliest <Col N="2842" /> possible date as to whether the Ministry has come to any conclusion on that point.  These are the two or three questions I would like to submit, and again I would like to say that I, for myself, and I am quite sure for the House in general, commend the Minister for his very lucid and clear statement.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to say much in regard to this matter, beyond asking a few questions.  Any sense of competition that one might possibly have had some time ago in regard to this matter was put out of sight some weeks ago and now I feel with regard to it&mdash;as I should like to have felt at any time&mdash;that whatever is best for the country is the right thing and must be done.  In order that we should be in a position to determine that, it is necessary that we should be in possession of somewhat fuller information than is available now.  I do not wish to say anything that may appear to be deprecatory of the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am just as much in admiration of the lucidity of that statement as Deputy Johnson, but there are one or two items of the information he imparted to us that are a little difficult to me to understand, according to the figures at present available.  He has said, for example, that if the Shannon scheme be prosecuted at 150 million units per annum, the price could be at the bus-bars .42.  Actually, the consumption of Ireland at the present moment is not 150 millions, but rather 48 millions, of which 36 millions are consumed in Dublin itself.  It is necessary that we should know what the starting price would be not at 150 million units&mdash;which is assumed to be what the country will attain after two or three years&mdash;but at the moment when the scheme is put in operation.  All those things, however, could be finally decided if the Minister would take the course I suggest&mdash;that is, that the report that has been put in with the full details of the scheme, including the entire costs and estimates, which he has there in a large printed book from which he has read us excerpts, should be made available to the Dáil.  I took that book to contain Messrs. <Col N="2843" /> Siemens Schuckert's scheme, and in addition to that scheme the experts' advice should be separately available, with all documents in regard to the matter.  I imagine that he may say in answer to me that a certain amount of expense will be incurred in connection with this proposal of mine for which the Dáil would have to be prepared.  I noticed as he read from Messrs. Siemens Schuckert's book&mdash;the large tome which he had&mdash;that it was printed. Therefore, it exists to-day either set up in type or in stereo.  If it were sent in by Messrs. Siemens Schuckert I imagine that it exists in stereotype in Germany and that, therefore, it would not have been set up here in Ireland. It would be a cheaper way if the type or stereos exist that advantage be taken of it to economise the cost of enabling Deputies and others interested in the matter to get copies of that scheme, with a view to examining it in detail and comparing it with the experts' report. That should be done as quickly as possible, so that before the Dáil is put to the necessity of coming to some decision either in the Shannon or Liffey scheme as to comparison between one and the other, the information would be before every Deputy and engineer in the country which is now available to the Minister and his advisers.  I hope the Minister will see the propriety of such a course.  He has informed us that the partial initial development of the Shannon scheme, if it is prosecuted, would cost about 5¼ million pounds. The ultimate development would amount to the better part of ten million pounds.  Before the country incurs a debt amounting to that sum, the service on which will be a very heavy charge on this country for several years, we ought at least to incur the expense of a few hundred pounds&mdash;if it would cost so much&mdash;to put ourselves in possession of the information contained in the document which the Minister has and which we have not.  Though we have had the advantage of his quotations and his glance over the field he has travelled for the last few weeks, it is advisable that, when the country or the Oireachtas is called to give any decision on the matter, they should do so with the <Col N="2844" /> information before them that the Minister himself now has.</P>

      <P>I rise really to associate myself with the remarks made by Deputy Johnson.  I may claim to be in a position to judge somewhat of the difficulties of the subject the Minister dealt with.  I have nothing but the highest admiration for the way in which he treated that subject, picked out the essential features of a vast scheme, and laid them before us so clearly and lucidly.  I think, with Deputy Johnson, that the Minister is to be congratulated on his presentation of that problem, and that the House is to be congratulated on the way in which it was put before it.</P>
      <P>I only add one remark: that is, that I venture to hope this marks a very big day in Irish history, that we may from this turn our attention&mdash;taking our position here as a fixed position&mdash; to the most important thing in this country, and that is the practical question of how the country is to be advanced and brought into a real state of prosperity.  It needs very little imagination to see in the scheme which the Minister has laid before us possibilities of progress and of a future for the country which may be indeed quite beyond the highest hopes of many of those who have very high hopes for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has called forth a chorus of congratulation on the way he has handled this subject, and I would like to be a party to that commendation, but that very ability with which the Minister has dealt with this subject, I think requires each of us to recognise that we have not really grasped the subject which the Minister has been explaining to us this evening. We could not possibly do it, and what we have been considering, in addition to the Minister's statement, are extracts, if I may call them so, from the information contained in Messrs. Siemens Schucker's report, as reported on by the experts.  We have the cost of them stated here, and I would like to ask the Minister if he agrees with me that the costs are really based on a Dublin supply.  Dublin, of course, is the big end of the stick at present, whatever it may be in the future. <Col N="2845" /> There is a danger of concentrating all supply in this way.</P>
      <P>Assume the Liffey scheme had gone on.  There are certain units of power used in mass production or by individuals and it might pay the Liffey scheme to give a special rate for those large consumers without their being able actually to produce the current at that rate&mdash;in other words, to spread the lower estimate of costs over the rest of the consuming area and to bring down that cost to what would be lower than the generating cost of the whole. I only mention that to indicate that although one is immediately struck with the immense possibilities of the scheme, as put forward, one would hesitate very much to accept it until one had opportunity of a close examination. I presume the Minister will not ask us to come to any decision on those matters without giving us a reasonable time for examination, and in the event of anything being proposed to be done to give us an opportunity of criticising the matter before any such contract as the original contract on which this is based is entered into.  I think the Minister said it was discussed in the Dáil. It was never discussed in the Dáil at all; it was issued only as a White Paper.</P>

      <P>I want merely to mark my appreciation, in common with the other Deputies, of the cold, logical, businesslike statement the Minister made on this very big subject this evening. I am sure that Deputies will agree that it is the biggest statement made by a Minister in this House since it first met.  It has probably the greatest possibilities, too, for the future development of the country.  The scheme is really too vast; its possibilities are too great for us to enter now into any discussion of it whatsoever.  I am not in agreement even with Deputy Hewat or Deputy Figgis, when they say that certain documents and papers will enable us to master the scheme.  I doubt that very much.  I am afraid that, even at the best, we have got to rely on what the experts say.  At all events, we have got to rely very largely on what they say.  The Minister has done very well, and I feel like urging him to continue <Col N="2846" /> to expend his energy and the energy of his staff in the work before him in connection with this scheme.  If, when he comes to us with another explanation, the results of his labours are as satisfactory as the results he put before us to-night, I am quite sure that we will welcome them as we welcomed his statement this evening.</P>

      <P>From these benches I wish to congratulate the Minister on the statement he has made this evening. The subject is one with which I have been associated for the past 20 years. I had taken a very large part in two schemes for the development of both electric power and light.  Unfortunately, the trouble in both cases was that the cost to the consumer was too great and both schemes had to be abandoned.  The present scheme offers great possibilities for the development of industry and for cheapening the cost of power and light to the farmer. Lighting will be available to the farmer at a cost which will be much less than he has been paying up to the present, while the power possibilities are also very great.  Two industries in which I was interested were very prejudicially affected owing to the cost of suction gas, or the ordinary gas produced in towns, while the cost per unit for electricity was also too high.  This scheme is on different lines.  If the people do not avail of it at the beginning, I believe that before three years they will avail fully of it.  I rise not merely to express appreciation of what has been done for the development of the country on a large scale, but I rise also to support the suggestion of Deputy Figgis that those facts and figures should be placed before us, so that the people of the country, and particularly those interested in industrial development and farmers requiring cheap power and cheap light, will appreciate the possibilities.  They will be interested when they find, as I presume they will, that this power is going to be made available to them at a price lower than any power that they have used up to the present, and at a price which will make their work profitable.  I join with the other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on the calm and lucid <Col N="2847" /> manner in which he has placed the scheme before us and I support the suggestion that the figures should be placed before the country, so that the people will understand that any steps the Government may take in the development of the scheme will be really in the highest interests of the country.</P>

      <P>As the solitary representative in the House of a constituency which will benefit very much from this scheme&mdash;inasmuch as the power station will be erected in Clare&mdash;I desire to join in the chorus of congratulation to the Minister on his very lucid and able statement.  But I think we should, for a while at least, suspend judgment on the scheme.  It has, indeed, very great potentialities, but I think it is a real danger to display at once the quality of facile optimism.  The success of this scheme will depend very much on its capacity for producing cheap power.  If any causes operate to raise the cost to a figure which would not make it economical or useful, then the scheme would be a failure, the money sunk in it would be lost, in so far as it would remain unproductive, and the whole thing would be a white elephant.  I repeat that if the energy produced is not produced commercially, the undertaking must be a failure.  It is on the supervision and on the clear grasp of realities in all those constructive works which must take place before the scheme comes into being, that its success or failure depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is premature for a layman to discuss the question, seeing it has occupied the attention of the experts for so long.  It is premature to say whether there should be a single station at Ardnacrusha or whether the other scheme for a station at Killaloe, which the Minister referred to, should be adopted. There is a good deal of point in Deputy Figgis' statement regarding the supply of energy, so as to compete with coal or other forms of power.  I would impress on the Minister that the many millions that would be sunk in the scheme and which, presumably, would be borrowed on the security of the State, would be lost, and would perhaps <Col N="2848" /> shake our credit to its foundations if the points mentioned were not appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to reply to one or two points of detail raised by various speakers.  Deputy Johnson spoke as to whether consideration had been given to the Erne and the falls around Ballyshannon.  I cannot at this moment say that that particular project has been examined in any detail, and that it has been reported on, but I know it was present to the minds of the experts, because I had a talk with Herr Schulz about it.  I cannot pretend to remember what he stated to me on that point, but the vague rememberance I have is that it was to be ruled out in consideration of the Shannon scheme, but if it were all Ireland we were considering, it would be the second river to be developed, and it would rank higher than the Liffey as an adjunct to the Shannon.  I do not state that with any show of authority, and I will bear contradiction on the point afterwards, but it is a vague memory I have of the statement made in regard to the Erne.  As to the point made regarding the binding nature of the estimate of .53 delivered in Dublin, I do not think that that can be accounted as binding.  That is the expert calculation arrived at on the Siemens scheme.  The Siemens people were asked to present binding estimates for the constructional works, development of the canal, erection of turbines, transmission system, and so forth.  There are in this book costs which are ready almost to be put out to tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the statement included prices at which power can be delivered to the cities, towns, and everywhere it is to be utilised.  I take it that this part of the report is in answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I read it in this way.  You will make binding estimates as to the costs.  Then you will report on the price at which delivery can be made to the towns and cities and other places.  The binding estimates are merely as to cost.  The report governs the rest of that sentence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state on what total output that price .53, to the city of Dublin, is based, because that would answer the question completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not answer the question completely.  The question I have been asked is as to whether .53 is binding.  My answer to Deputy Figgis might show that .53 is a reliable or unreliable estimate, but it would not take away from the validity of the answer I gave to Deputy Johnson. It is based on a consumption of 150 million units, but on the other side the huge costs of all the great constructional works I have spoken of include a complete network for the whole country. These 100 k.v., 35 k.v. and 10 k.v. lines bring power to every town and village with over 500 population.  If the consumption is not there, obviously the transmission will not be there.  It is not intended under this scheme to proceed with those transforming pole stations for these towns and villages which do not require power.  Consequently, if there is not going to be that consumption, so much of the cost will be cut out.  It will mean less consumption, so that the consumption will not approach anythink like 150 million units.  Then the cost to Dublin, the largest consumer, will be appreciably increased. The scheme is not based, nor do the experts consider it proper to base any scheme, on the present-day conditions, which they regard as very backward and technically very much lacking in proper management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate the point that so far as any comparison between the Liffey and the Shannon schemes as affecting Dublin is concerned, it is almost a critical point as to whether the Shannon scheme is to supply Dublin for the first ten or fifteen years at a lower price than the Liffey scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a point to be considered, but that it is a turning point I can not agree.  Apart from the fact that the experts say that given a certain consumption it is cheaper to supply Dublin from the <Col N="2850" /> Shannon than from the Liffey, and apart from that, take it that the current can be supplied cheaper to Dublin from the Liffey than from the Shannon, you have to embark on other sets of considerations, and you get to the other consideration, namely, are you going to develop a river which can supply Dublin only in part, and can supply nothing beyond Dublin, and leave the rest of the country to look after itself, knowing that by doing that you take away all chance of the Shannon development for possibly two generations until the demand for power in the rest of the country develops to the point that you can entirely neglect the present chief consumer, namely, Dublin.  So that though I do agree with Deputy Johnson and Deputy Figgis, that the particular estimate of .53 is entirely decisive as between the Shannon and the Liffey, I do not agree that, if it is not a fact, automatically the Liffey takes precedence of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that the report indicates any possibility that within four years of the period of the completion of this scheme it would be really a practical proposition to expect 150 million units to be generated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I had not merely the benefit of reading the experts' report, but of having a conversation with them.  Their warning was this.  If we decide to go ahead with the small partial development recommended, taking that it will take a period of three years to build it, we should proceed with such an item as the canal, which will be applicable not merely to a partial but a full development, and we should leave such things as power houses, of which a partial development would require three, and a full development, six turbines, to the end, because it is their opinion that during the three years in which the scheme is being built, there will be such demand that we would be forced to contemplate not a partial but a full development.  That is their judgment on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial thing <Col N="2851" /> in connection with the point Deputy Johnson was raising was not whether it would be cheaper immediately from Dublin or the Shannon, but whether the Shannon could supply cheaper than it could be got from other sources at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That, being a lesser matter than the Liffey, was included in the general comparison I made with the Liffey.  The experts' opinion is that while they say it is a question whether with the development of the Shannon we should add on to it for the Liffey a steam station.  I think they have very little doubt that if it were a question of supplying Dublin alone it would be better and cheaper to develop the Liffey than proceed with the existing plan.  Therefore, when arguing between the Shannon and the Liffey I included the lesser with the greater.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson raised two matters which I think are somewhat joined.  He asked would the progress be by Private Bill procedure, and would Siemen's scheme be subject to the same type of expert examination as the Liffey scheme.  Without any disrespect to the Private Bill Committee, I think the Shannon scheme as such has had more expert examination than any Liffey project has yet stood.  I think the experts specially selected for the purpose and not laymen, were men technically up in these matters, and conversant all their professional lives with the details of the working of State systems.  Two are technical experts in the matter of electrification, and I think that they as a tribunal are much more expert than any Private Bill Committee can possibly be.  He also asked would this, if approved, proceed on the basis of a private venture or a national venture, meaning national in the sense that it would be financed by the nation, and that the financial return would come to the nation instead of to private promoters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That remains for decision, and the answer to the previous question would depend on this decision.  If it is to be allowed to develop by way of private venture, then I think automatically <Col N="2852" /> any legislation in connection with it would have to proceed by way of Private Bill legislation, but if it be done as a national scheme, and taken up as a State service, or be financially controlled in some way by the Government, then legislation would be regarded as public, and might not have to go through the ordinary channel of Private Bill legislation.</P>
    <P>These are matters for determination, but one thing I would say is, though I cannot say that it is beyond all possibility of being decided in the other way, I have never heard it contemplated that if it were at all possible to have this scheme financed as a State concern, that there was any consideration of having it financed by private venture, and that certainly only in the last resort, and I do not think it at all probable, without there being allowances, that it would be financed as a German concern.  So that all the talk there has been since the appearance of the White Paper about a German economic stranglehold, presumably through German financial control, of this scheme has no foundation in fact, and it is something that has never been contemplated. The State may be reduced to the point where there will be no other way of doing it, but we are not at that point, and I do not think we are ever likely to come to that point.  Deputy Figgis raised the point, what would the price be if we contemplated a consumption of only 35 million units.  On that I can only answer that the experts did not contemplate the probability of there being a demand of only 35 million units.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision I think has been made.  The Deputy will understand that provision has been made by way of an addition to the capital, and the likelihood of there being no return in revenue out of capital during the building up period of four or five years&mdash;that cuts out one item.  The Deputy must realise that it was quite unfair to the scheme to ask <Col N="2853" /> to take your capital cost, and estimate it on the basis of the great constructional works I have spoken of, and also take it that you are only going to supply Dublin and a few places outside, and state a price.</P>
      <P>You have to look a little bit ahead during the three years in which the scheme will be constructed.  There will be plenty of opportunity of seeing what is likely to be the demand at the end of three years, and the scheme can be regulated accordingly.  This is not to be taken on the basis of the .53 figure arrived at for Dublin, which is based on a scheme to supply Dublin alone, and has no regard for the future.  It is a scheme which involves in that capital expenditure the amount of cost which should be put down to the full development of the Shannon.  This can be better discussed when the details of the report are made known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been put to me that this report should be made available.  I am informed the cost of production of this volume is estimated at about £500, but as the type is set it might be possible to get copies produced more cheaply. I was looking forward to the time when the fullest details of the scheme should be published.  I have here a portion of the scheme without the tremendous detail with regard to cost, and the minute details of the cost, which the larger volume contains.  It might be possible to make a volume such as this available for Deputies quite soon, but how far I could proceed with the production of such a book without the approval of the Dáil I cannot say.  It would be possible, however, in some way or other to make the details more widely known. There is one objection to it.  The scheme has been modified, but the modifications are not any essential points of the scheme, but there are modifications. This is the original scheme, and consequently I would have to get the worked out modifications.  They are not yet in my hands, but they are in the hands of the experts, and I will consider the publication of some portion, at any rate, of the details of the scheme.  I think there is a certain amount of very technical electrical details which would not be of much interest, certainly not <Col N="2854" /> to many of the Deputies, and we could start off with some smaller production than the complete volume.  That, however, can be attended to.</P>

He said that the White Paper was never discussed in this House.  I agree, but there was room given for discussion of it.  Certain advances on foot of the White Paper were held back definitely awaiting some discussion being initiated in the Dáil on the White Paper itself.

Deputy Hewat said it would, of course, be possible to scale down your price to the big consumer, and thereby overcharge other consumers.  I do not purport to quote the exact words the Deputy used, but, in effect, that is what his argument came to.  Remember what has been stated in the conclusions to the report, that while only charging .53d. to the largest consumer, Dublin, it will still be possible to provide all the towns and villages of over 500 of a population with power at a price which is appreciably lower than could be obtained in these towns from a town plant.</P>

      <P>It is not to the four experts, but it may be a vague description of price to people in this country who only know what electricity is costing them in Killarney, or in other places, where the cost is excessive. The four experts, who know exactly what a modern, up-to-date, well-equipped and properly run individual town plant should cost, make the statement that you can deliver at .53d. in Dublin, and at the same time deliver to consumers in towns and villages at a cost within that.</P>

      <P>That would be very conclusive if a certain town, representative of towns in the Saorstát, was taken, and it was shown that current <Col N="2856" /> could be supplied at a certain figure, and that you had already brought down prices.  In Dublin they put down a certain price, a lump sum, but travelling from that it does not give you a comparison of prices with some other towns within the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>I desire to keep away from any comparison with towns in the Saorstát, because tables that I may be in a position to produce, if there is any further discussion on this, will show how towns in the Saorstát have been treated.  To say the least of it, they have been very badly treated in the matter of electricity.  If I were to say that while charging .53d. for such delivery in bulk to Dublin, it would be possible to undercut the present suppliers of electricity to Free State towns, it would not be appreciating the scheme properly; it would be really a condemnation of the scheme if it was only able to do that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thrift and Deputy Baxter struck a note as to the further development that seems to be rendered possible by the statement made here to-night. While I tried to be as lacking almost in enthusiasm as it was possible to be after reading certain details of the scheme, and after reading the report, I was deliberately trying to choke down enthusiasm on the point because I thought it was better to state as objectively as possible what were the details of the scheme, and what was the opinion of the experts on it.  A point has been raised, and without wishing to get into any state of exultation over what the scheme means, I would say this, that I agree with Deputy Baxter completely that the project outlined here to-night is probably the most important thing that has happened for this State since its beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would put it one way, and one way only: that just as there was political freedom achieved a certain number of years ago, if this scheme be carried out we have got to a point where economic freedom, without which political freedom matters very little, may be brought appreciably nearer.  I do think that one's mind must naturally go back to a man like Arthur Griffith on a night like this.  Thinking of his writings, his <Col N="2857" /> enthusiasm and his energy as to the extent to which the natural resources of the country could be developed for the good of the country&mdash;thinking of him and reading this&mdash;I think you must arrive at the conclusion that there is a definite chance here at last of utilising one of the great natural resources of the country for the good of the people of the country.</P>

      <P>Upon that question I desire to raise a matter which I brought to the notice of the Minister for Finance on the 3rd instant.  I asked him then &ldquo;If he could state why the amount awarded to Thomas Daly, Eyrecourt, Co. Galway, by Judge Power at the Circuit Court held at Ballinasloe in September, 1924, has not been paid.&rdquo; The Minister replied that &ldquo;The decree stated to have been made in Mr. Daly's favour in September, 1924, has not yet been received in my Department.&rdquo;  I then asked: &ldquo;Can the Minister say who is responsible for the neglect,&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;I suppose it is the applicant's solicitor.&rdquo;  Now, I forwarded a copy of the reply to the applicant, and the next thing I heard was a letter from the solicitor who is accused of neglect denying that he is responsible for any such thing.  This is the letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Ballinasloe,</P>
      <P Just="Right">12th December, 1924.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;Mr. Thomas Daly, of Eyrecourt, has sent me a cutting from a newspaper with regard to a question you asked about a decree of his, and in the reply of Mr. Blythe he states that he presumes the applicant's solicitor is responsible for the neglect.  This is utterly untrue, and I think you should have something done about explaining the matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This decree was a re-hearing case, and after it was heard here in September, the decree was filled up <Col N="2858" /> in my office, along with other decrees, and sent to the Clerk of the Peace for signature by himself and the Judge. Once it leaves my hands, I never see it again, as the practice lately has been, under orders from the Government, that such decrees are sent by the Clerk of the Peace to the State Solicitor, and he sends them to the Ministry of Finance.  If there is neglect on my part, under these circumstances, it is rather curious.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 24th of October, 1924, I had a letter from the Ministry of Finance asking me to send the original decree of 26th September, 1922, up to them, in order to facilitate the payment of the re-hearing decree.  I sent it up, on receipt of such letter, and I naturally understood from it that they had received the re-hearing decree, when they asked for the old one.  They probably have had it, and it has gone astray in the office.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think such statements are very unfair to any solicitor.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;HUTCHINSON DAVIDSON,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Solicitor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it is evident from this letter that this painstaking and respectable solicitor has not been guilty of any neglect.  I suggest to the Minister that he should see who is responsible and that in future, when decrees are granted, they should be signed both by the Judge and the Clerk of the Peace and forwarded to the Minister's Department. Further, the Minister should have them available instead of having Deputies going, as penny-boys, round from one Department to another to try and get these payments made.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw attention to a matter raised in starred question No. 40 in to-day's Order Paper in the name of Deputy Egan complaining that so-and-so had <Col N="2859" /> received no reply to letters written to the Department of the Minister for Finance, October 6th, 27th, and November, 15th, 1924.  I am glad to say that that is not a general complaint, but I suggest to the Minister for Finance that in regard to letters addressed to his Department Deputies should not be placed in the position of getting communications from their constituents drawing attention that they wrote to the Finance Department a dozen times and failed to get an acknowledgment.  I think that every citizen who has a claim against the Government and every Deputy who writes letters should get attention from the Department, as they are entitled to. I have a few cases of people making claims and getting no reply or receipts of any sort to their letters.  I ask the Minister if he will see that when the House is adjourned, probably for six or eight weeks, there will be no neglect or holding back of replies simply because Deputies are not in a position to ask questions that might be answered after 24 hours' notice.  I personally have that grievance against one Department, and that is the Department of Finance. It is the only one there is any complaint about.  I hope the Minister will see that we get replies in a reasonable time during the period over which the House will be adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Minister for Justice notice that I would raise on the adjournment a question relating to the method of dispersing crowds by the Gárda Síochána in Wicklow.  This is a matter of very great importance and it is a matter that must be raised now, especially in view of the fact that we are adjourning for several weeks. Its importance arises from this: That if no notice is taken of the action of the police in that respect it will be taken as a headline for the police in other parts of the country as well as in that part of the country, doing, what I want to urge, is decidedly illegal and decidedly beyond the scope and authority of any police force in this country. I am not going to deal with the issue <Col N="2860" /> that has been raised in the town of Wicklow&mdash;a dispute between employers and employed, between union and union, or between persons who are arrested and the State.  But I want to raise a question of the instructions that have been given to the police and the method of carrying out those instructions.</P>
      <P>It is made quite clear to me after close examination of different people that what occurred on Monday morning last in the town of Wicklow was this: That on the quays had assembled 60 or 70 men who were seeking work at the docks and were members of a certain trade union.  A dispute between these men and other men, and between these men and the employers, had unquestionably, and without the slightest doubt whatever, taken place.  It had been a matter of consultation and a proposal to hold a conference was then under consideration.  The police superintendent took on himself the duty of judging whether there was a trade dispute or not and he decided that there was no trade dispute, and therefore he would not allow any pickets on the quays. Having declared that he would allow no pickets he took it upon himself, also, not as one would imagine, to arrest and charge in the courts the offenders against the law as he conceived it to be, but he took the law into his own hands and ordered a baton charge to disperse the crowd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The persons in charge of the men on the occasion referred to had informed the police superintendent that there was a trade dispute, and there was no one better able to say that than those men. They informed the police superintendent that they were proposing to appoint a picket.  They informed the police superintendent that if he said the pickets were disobeying the law it was his duty to arrest them, and if they were replaced by other pickets it would be his duty to arrest the other pickets. All that was stated clearly to the superintendent of the police, but he believed that he was not only an Executive officer but judge and jury as well, and he decided that there was no trade dispute and that no picket would be allowed and the way he prevented the <Col N="2861" /> pickets was to disperse the crowd by a baton charge.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the evidence which has been made known to me, that there was no warning given that a baton charge would take place, that there was no attempt to disperse the crowd except by a baton charge, and the effect of the baton charge was that a considerable number of men were severely mauled and some had to be treated in hospital.  There is further evidence that, as an appendix, shall I say, to the morning trouble certain members of the Civic Guard were looking for trouble in the town during the evening, and took it upon themselves to use their batons in respect of people standing at the corners of streets and at their own doors, but I want to confine my attention to the action of the police superintendent in deciding upon his own authority that there was no trade dispute, and deciding also that there being no trade dispute his business was to disperse the crowd by a baton charge. Now, the matter that is raised is one that has given a great deal of trouble to the authorities of this country and in Great Britain for a good many years. It is one that is very closely associated with the action of military in civil disturbances.</P>
    <P>I want to say that if the police are going to assume the right to use batons as the first method of action when they wish to disperse a crowd, then you are practically telling the military forces, in similar circumstances, to fire as their first method of using the weapon that is at their command.  I say that the police in this country will need to be warned if they have not already been warned that the baton is not to be used as a weapon of offence, and is not to be used as an offensive weapon for the purpose of dispersing a crowd.  There is no evidence so far as I can gather that there was any offence on the part of the crowd.  There is no evidence that the crowd had been warned to disperse. The evidence that I have had placed before me is to the effect that certain men were being picked out of the crowd for the purpose of putting them forwards as pickets, and it was at that moment that the charge of the police took place.  If that kind of <Col N="2862" /> action is to be overlooked, we are likely to see a great deal of ill-will generated as between the Civic Guards and the public.  We are all of us anxious that that force should become a very popular force.  We are all anxious that it shall become a peace protective force.  But if the Civic Guard are going to take upon themselves the function of protecting citizens by charging them with batons, simply to enforce the Superintendent's view of the duties of a crowd, and his view of what the law is, then we are going to be far away from the hope that the Gardá will become a popular, peace-protective force.</P>
    <P>I am avoiding the question that has been raised in the courts, and I have no doubt it will be thoroughly examined there.  But I think that I must say that the method adopted by the officer in charge of the police seemed to have been deliberately provocative, inasmuch as he was using language in respect of trade union officials in the town which clearly shows that he was taking upon himself certain duties as judge, not merely of the law, but of the personal character of persons concerned, and of their moral conduct.  I think it is quite clear that a distinct personal prejudice was the preliminary to the baton charge by ten or twelve Guards.  I think that the matter must be brought to the notice of the Minister, if for nothing else but to warn him that conduct of that kind is going to lead to unpopularity, and, shall I say, even to enmity as between the citizens and the Guards. I hope that something will be the outcome of this matter, and that raising it here to-night will prevent the possibility of any development of that kind in other parts of the country, where the Guards will take upon themselves the duties of judges and executioners all at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say in the opening of my statement that we have no disputes between any Unions in Wicklow.  We have only one Union in Wicklow.  We had a dispute with the employers.  We had an arrangement there during the past three years that the Union would supply the men.  Then the employers notified us that they would employ the men themselves.  We <Col N="2863" /> had a conference with the employers, and, after three of their members had arranged to meet, they got together again and they refused to meet the Union.  We hold there was a trade dispute, and I am going to make a statement here which the Superintendent made to me, but which, I am sure, has not the approval of the Minister for Justice or of General O'Duffy.  I can assure the Minister that the action of the Superintendent and the Guards in Wicklow has done more for another political Party than 100 meetings could do for them.  I warned the Superintendent that morning after he threatened me.  I will read out here the language he used to me, and it can be corroborated by 100 people who have no connection with Trade Unions whatsoever. I want to bring before the Minister the particulars of the murderous, uncalled for and brutal attack made by the Guards on defenceless people, including old women.  At 9 o'clock the Superintendent of the Guard arrived when there were about 60 members of the Union present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had already informed the employers we would have a certain number of our members present in view of certain action which had taken place the previous week when our members were threatened to be thrown into the river, and when Organiser Metcalfe was threatened by members belonging to another organisation.  The employers told me over their 'phone that they were threatened and intimidated by men coming in to their place sticking their hands in their pockets in a threatening attitude and demanding work.  I told the employers that on the next day we would have men down there that would prevent anything like that.  I told them that if these men put their hands in their pockets we would have our men there; that we would take these men, and if they had revolvers on them we would hand them over to the Guards, and that there need be no fear on the part of the employers of being intimidated by these men.  Now, I am going to prove that the Civic Guards in Wicklow have taken sides, actuated personally against myself because I have spoken my mind regardless of the <Col N="2864" /> consequences, and of what may happen to me personally.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Justice has received certain statements from the Guards, and I am going to prove that these statements are only one side of the story, and that the Guards have not given the right information.  The Superintendent threatened to shoot me and to throw me into the river before any dispute took place on the quay.  The Superintendent's language to me was that I should be shot and thrown into the river, and he used other language which I can prove.  I can prove too that I have a cleaner record than some of the men associated with him.  And, probably, if his record and mine were compared I would come out with a cleaner record than the Superintendent himself, as regards my moral life.  The Superintendent seemed by his attitude the whole morning to take up one particular side, and that was the side in opposition to me.  I warned the Superintendent that he was playing into the hands of a certain political party, and I warned him that in doing so he might turn the wishes and feelings of the people against himself and the Government. But he did not mind.  He was lord and master there, high judge and executioner and everything else.  He said that he was the man in charge of Wicklow and that he was the man to decide what was right.  Nobody else had a right to express an opinion that differed from his.</P>
    <P>I am going to read a statement that can be corroborated by a number of persons who were present that morning, and to tell you the language that the Superintendent used in the presence of these persons.  It was about nine o'clock when the Superintendent stated that I should be shot and thrown into the river, that I was a blackguard and a bowsie, and that I caused a lot of disturbance.  I replied, pointing out that if I wanted to cause disturbance I could cause a lot of trouble.  I told him that our men were employed at Fitzgerald's that they had been working on the boats.  He then sent for Mr. Fitzgerald and after some time Mr. Fitzgerald arrived.  Then Superintendent Meehan came over to where Metcalfe, <Col N="2865" /> Conroy, the Secretary and I were and said that Fitzgerald had arrived and asked me to come over there to the office.  I replied that I was not going into any employer's office until sent for.  He stated: &ldquo;Mr. Fitzgerald has told me to tell you he wanted you.&rdquo;  After this the Superintendent went into the office, and I refused to discuss matters in the presence of the police.  Then the Superintendent came out, and immediately we went into the office to discuss the matter. The next thing was that he came into the office along with two other men who were not Gárda.  We then went into Fitzgerald's office and the Superintendent followed.  Mr. Conroy asked Mr. Fitzgerald did he employ those men and he replied &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  I then said to the Superintendent: &ldquo;You see you have been entirely wrong in saying that Mr. Fitzgerald had employed these men and all that you have been saying this morning was not justified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Melcalfe said: &ldquo;Those other men could take possession of a boat and could go to work before they were sanctioned.  You hear now, Superintendent, what Mr. Fitzgerald said?&rdquo;  After some time Mr. Fitzgerald offered that three of our men should work with two of the other men, but this we refused. Mr. William Clarke then came up.  He is a partner with Mr. Fitzgerald.  He said he employed the men on Sunday night.  Metcalfe and myself appealed to Mr. Fitzgerald for a conference and he replied: &ldquo;If Mr. Darcy agrees, we will agree too&rdquo;; but he would not do so on his own.  The Superintendent said that an employer could employ any men he liked, and there were no trade disputes. Metcalfe replied that there was a trade dispute, as it was the custom of employers to send to the Union for any men they required within the past three years.  Now, no conference had been called to alter the arrangements, and there should have been a conference called to alter it one way or the other.</P>
    <P>We were out for peace, and it was suggested that a conference should be held so as to avoid trouble.  The Superintendent said that the employers had a right to employ whom they liked, and it was not a matter for the Union.  I appealed to Mr. Clarke to have a conference. <Col N="2866" /> Kinsella, who represented another Union, asked if his Union would be represented, and I replied that the employers had only an agreement with the Transport Union, and, therefore, the question of his Union did not arise.  The Superintendent said: &ldquo;Decide this question once and for all; decide it one way or another, as I am not going to keep my men here all day. Some of them have not even had breakfast.&rdquo; He said he had been speaking to two of our men, and that they were prepared to work.  I replied: &ldquo;They must not be members of the Transport Union, as over 120 men had decided not to work.&rdquo;  Mr. Fitzgerald offered the names of the men employed, and I refused to accept them, as our men had decided what their attitude should be, and that we would get ready and place a picket outside Mr. Fitzgerald's office.</P>
    <P>The Superintendent said he would arrest the picket, as he had decided there was no trade dispute.  I said we would put on a second picket, and he said he would arrest them, too.  In the presence of Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Clarke, and four other men, I said: &ldquo;The Judge will decide, not you, whether it is or not a trade dispute.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I have decided for myself.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;You are not the Judge; there are higher people than you&rdquo;; and he said: &ldquo;I will decide the question now that there is no trade dispute.&rdquo;  I then said: &ldquo;You can arrest the pickets.&rdquo; I held it was a legal question, and not a matter for him.  The Superintendent stated that if necessary he would shove the people into the river.  I replied, in the presence of the four parties, that I would not like to see my greatest enemy being shoved into the river, and if it was necessary I would try and see that no person would be thrown in. While we were in the office with the Superintendent, several Civic Guards came in, and they took off their coats and left them on the counter.  One left his stick there.  They had been lined outside Fitzgerald's office.  When we came out of the office I told the employers that I was going to put on the pickets, and leave it to the Superintendent to arrest them.</P>
    <P>Outside the office I ordered the secretary to call two members of the Union <Col N="2867" /> off the boat, and one came.  We decided to place those pickets outside, and then call the remainder of the men for a meeting.  Just at that time the baton charge took place.  I was struck several times, and I am certain it is not the wish of the Civic Guard Superintendent or the wish of two or three of the men that I am alive here to-night. They made several attempts to smash me on the head, but I have been in other disputes and other baton charges.  I closed in with them, and I did not run away.  I was the last man to be carried off.  The Civic Guards in Wicklow have acted worse than ever the Black and Tans did in any other portion of Ireland.  They got no justification for what they did.  There were no stones thrown.  I believe some stones were thrown while the baton charge was on, but previous to that there was no provocation, and there were no insulting remarks made to the Guards.</P>
    <P>As far as I can judge, it was purely a personal attack, and it was ordered by the Superintendent as a sort of reprisal on me for other things.  He ordered his men to carry out that baton charge.  There was an old man 73 years of age, and he was struck with an iron bar.  Organiser Metcalfe was left unconscious. He is still in hospital. Robt. Naughten was struck on the head; Conroy got a head wound, and Doyle a shoulder wound.  In the evening two prisoners were removed from the barracks, and an old woman of 70 years of age, who went to see her boy off, was assaulted by a Civic Guard.  The man was already hurt during the day.  John Darcy was struck in the face with a baton.  When the Civic Guard came back he asked him: &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;  He improved on the Black-and-Tan style, and he said: &ldquo;Two of our men got hurt to-day.&rdquo;  At night time, when men were standing some distance down in the street from their own houses, eight Guards came with batons drawn and attacked them.</P>
    <P>One old man was struck three times on the shoulder.  When they were about to strike him again, he said: &ldquo;I know you now,&rdquo; and at that the <Col N="2868" /> Guard did the same mischief as was done to other people.  The Superintendent may hold that there were a great many people there.  There were about fifty or sixty.  He says in his deposition that there were a great deal more.  The position was just as we told him.  We were going to place pickets there.  He asked me why we had the men there, and I said it was for protection.  He said: &ldquo;We are out to protect the people.&rdquo;  Conroy made the statement: &ldquo;You were not here to protect us last week when we were attacked, and we had to come out because other men bullied the employer and intimidated him in order to get work.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;We cannot be everywhere.&rdquo;  Conroy said: &ldquo;You are everywhere on the other side, but never, when you are wanted, with us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Through the action of the Civic Guard a serious situation has been caused.  I disagree with other members of the Labour Party, and I hold that this is a most serious question.  I ask for no favour or mercy on my own behalf.  I am well able to fight out this issue in another way.  I do hold that when unemployed men are fighting to maintain their rights, it is not fair that the Guard should come and take sides and, without the slightest warning, murder unarmed men.  I say the time has come for the workers of Ireland and all the men on strike to be ready to defend themselves and not to place themselves at the mercy of other men. I thought that once England had left the country, and once we had done away with the Black-and-Tans, that we would be safe in our homes and safe to walk the streets.  In any other part of Ireland the people may be safe, but we are not so now in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The workers will have to recollect all this, as I told them at the public meeting the other night.  The Guards have made a mistake.  They played into the hands of a certain political body.  I disagreed with that political body.  I accepted the Treaty, and came here believing that through the Treaty we would be able to secure some good for the workers.  I never believed in Labour taking part in politics without any return for their work or any redress for their grievances.  I did not <Col N="2869" /> strike him on the head.  If he believed that we were going to be batoned on the slightest excuse by men who are taking sides and supporting the capitalists in Wicklow, I am certain that that is not a policy that the Minister is in sympathy with.  The Minister may have only one side of the question.  He cannot be everywhere. It was not the wish of the Guards that I should be here to-night to tell the full truth.  We have made our statements; we defy contradiction; and in another place we will be able to explain a lot more of our defence, which I have not given away, so that the Civic Guards may not know about it when the trial comes on.</P>
    <P>I would say to the workers outside, when there are strikes on, to remember the way the workers of Wicklow were treated, and to remember the way other men were treated.  I say it will be up to the workers' representatives in the Dáil to shake off a little of their gentlemanliness and to take a different attitude in this House if they are going to win for the workers the rights that we believe they are entitled to.  They must also take up a different attitude outside because they are representing the workers; they are representing the people who are unemployed at present. There is no use in coming here if we are going to be treated with contempt; if the representatives of the workers are to be called murderers and blackguards, and attacked in this way.  The workers' representatives, no matter where they may be, should not be afraid to speak out their minds, regardless of whom it may give offence to.  That is the position.  The workers' representatives will have to take up an obstructive policy&mdash;a different policy to that which has been adopted.  The workers of Ireland in congress assembled will have to see that the opposition will be here.  There is no use in a small minority, a small vote, because the Government, as I know, are backed up by a secret organisation who are trying to work the Treaty for the benefit of England against Irish workers.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Johnson saw fit to raise this matter this evening.  It is an important <Col N="2870" /> matter.  I am at least as impressed with its importance as either Deputy Johnson or Deputy Everett.  This incident took place on Monday morning last between 8 and 11 a.m.  On that day, and for two days afterwards, I was absent in England.  But the officials of my Department took very prompt and very proper action on hearing of the occurrence in Wicklow.  The Superintendent who was in charge on the occasion was asked to come up to Dublin, and he was interviewed by the Secretary of my Department and by the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána with regard to the whole occurrence.  On that interview, and on the report of the Superintendent, and on the report of the Chief Superintendent of the area, I have come to the conclusion that the Gárda on that occasion acted in a commendable manner, acted most properly, acted with a great deal of restraint.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to finish?  I did not interrupt either himself or Deputy Johnson.  As I was saying, I have come to the conclusion, on the information which is available for me, that on the occasion under review the Gárda behaved in a most commendable manner: with restraint, with discretion, and, finally, with the necessary determination in vindication of the law, and in vindication of rights which Deputy Johnson and Deputy Everett should be as anxious to see vindicated as I am.  I propose to read to the Dáil the reports which I have on this incident.  I do not propose to deal in any brief or hurried way with it.  It is a matter of very considerable public importance.  It is not a mere isolated incident.  It raises issues which have arisen elsewhere, which are likely to arise elsewhere, and on which we had all better clear our minds once and for all.  Deputy Johnson said that he did not propose to deal at all with the issue that had arisen in Wicklow: that he proposed to confine himself strictly to the question of the method that had been adopted by the Gárda to deal with the situation&mdash;the method <Col N="2871" /> which they adopted to disperse the crowd.  I propose to deal with the issue, unlike Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <P>I want to put this to Deputies: that it does not lie within the right of any man, whether a trade unionist or a non-trade unionist to prevent any other man, who is willing to work, from working.  I lay that down as a proposition.  I would hope that it is one that would meet with general agreement.  Having laid down that proposition I propose to read the reports on this question&mdash;the report in the first instance from Chief Superintendent Leahy, and subsequently the report of the Superintendent who was in charge in Wicklow on last Monday morning.  The Chief Superintendent writes on the 15th December to the Commissioner:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In continuation of telephonic communication made to you this morning by Superintendent Meehan in connection with the above matter, I beg to report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On Saturday last, the 13th inst., Mr. Everett, T.D., and from 100 to 150 of his followers in the I.T. &amp; G.W.U. went round the town of Wicklow and called on all the coal merchants&mdash;who also happen to be shipowners&mdash;and told them that the Transport Workers would have to be employed exclusively in discharging their coal boats to the exclusion of the members of Larkin's union.  The coal merchants refused to agree to this and said that they would adhere to the agreement come to by the Employers' Federation to employ an equal number of men from both unions when boats had to be discharged. Mr. Everett thereupon threatened to picket the coal merchants and prevent any man from working for them.  Mr. Everett further stated that he would picket boats unloading on Monday (15th inst.).  Superintendent Meehan personally <Col N="2872" /> cautioned Mr. Everett but the latter took no notice.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On to-day (Monday) three coal boats, owned respectively by Mr. Darcy, Mr. Hyland and Mr. Fitzgerald (Wicklow Corn Co.) were to be unloaded.  Men belonging to Larkin's union were unloading the boats belonging to Mr. Darcy and Mr. Hyland because the Transport workers would not work on them with Larkin's men.  In the case of the boat belonging to Mr. Fitzgerald (Wicklow Corn Co.) it was arranged that half the gang working her should come from the Transport Workers and the other half from Larkin's union.  The whole gang required to unload the boat was only five men, and the rival unions tossed for the odd place, which was won by Larkin's Union.  There were, therefore, two Transport Workers and three of Larkin's men unloading the boat in question.  This gang had actually started work in compliance with the agreement come to by the Employers' Federation to employ half from each union.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At this stage Mr. Everett, T.D., arrived&mdash;about 8.5 a.m. this morning&mdash;and prevented the two Transport men from working.  He was accompanied by about 100 of his followers, the majority wearing the badge of their Union.  Mr. Everett at once assumed a truculent attitude, and was cautioned by the Sergeant in charge of the party of Gardaí who were present. This was the position when the Superintendent arrived on the scene at 9 a.m. to-day.  The Superintendent quickly ascertained that Mr. Fitzgerald had employed three of Larkin's men and two of the Transport Union men, and that the latter were willing to work but would not be allowed to do so by Mr. Everett. The latter announced that if unloading proceeded the Transport Union would picket and stop the unloading. After a careful survey the Superintendent satisfied himself that there was no trade dispute in question and that the presence of Mr. Everett and his followers was for the <Col N="2873" /> purpose of intimidation and nothing else.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The five men on the boat attempted to resume work, but Mr. Everett rallied his men and would not allow them.  Mr. Everett informed the Superintendent that the whole of his 100 or so followers were pickets, and that they intended picketing the five men who attempted to work.&rdquo;  (Mr. Everett: That is false.)  &ldquo;At this point the Superintendent told Mr. Everett's followers that there was no trade dispute and that they should not be congregated where they were.  He gave them every chance to go away peacefully, and warned them that the consequences might be serious if they persisted in remaining.  Only a few went away, as Mr. Everett called on them to stand firm and not to move.  The Gárdaí (ten men) were standing a few yards away.  The Superintendent formed them into a line and marched them nearer to the crowd, at the same time cautioning the crowd in a loud voice that he intended to move them off.  The Gárdaí had begun to move on the crowd when the latter commenced to throw lumps of coal, stones, etc.&rdquo; (Mr. Everett: Lies.) &ldquo;Seeing the position that the ten Gardaí were in, the Superintendent ordered a baton charge.  Mr. Everett and his followers were all this time offering resistance.  After a few minutes the crowd was cleared off, and the Superintendent blew his whistle and withdrew his men.  Two men, named John and Patrick Doyle, were actually caught throwing stones and were arrested, and are now waiting to be brought before a Justice.  One of these men struck Gárda Breheny, injuring his left jaw.  Several others of the Gárdaí had narrow escapes from flying stones and missiles.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After consultation to-day it has been decided to arrest the following, who are either leaders or were prominent in the stone throwing.  (Then six names are given.)</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I visited the scene of the whole incident at the docks with the Superintendent, and after a careful survey of all the facts I am satisfied that the Superintendent could not have <Col N="2874" /> acted otherwise than he did.  Everything now appears to be normal in the town, except that Mr. Everett and his followers are endeavouring to create propaganda against the action taken by the Gárdaí.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have here a report from the Superintendent in charge:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg to report that a coal boat belonging to the Wicklow Corn Company was being unloaded at the South Quays, Wicklow, by a gang of five men at 8 a.m. on the 15th inst., when James Everett, T.D., arrived on the scene with a crowd of about 100 men, almost all wearing the badge of the I.T. and G.W. Union. A gangway had been laid from the boat to the quays, and the men were wheeling a barrow of coal across the quays when the crowd got in front and stopped them.  Mr. Everett put his foot against the barrow, and told them they would not be allowed to work.  Sergeant McKenna and a few Gárdaí were on duty at the time, and cautioned Mr. Everett and the other men, but the caution was ignored. The crowd still held their ground, and used threats to the sergeant and his men, telling them it would take more than 200 Gárdaí to move them.  This was the state of affairs when I arrived on the quays at 9 a.m.  After ascertaining the facts from Sergeant McKenna, I went up to the crowd and cautioned them.  I told them that this action was illegal, and cautioned them to move off (as there was no trade dispute). The sergeant and other Gárdaí commenced to take the names of those present, and Mr. Everett got up on the coal barrow and told the men to refuse their names, but the men gave them.  I asked Mr. Everett to explain his action, and why he was there.  He then told me that a gang of men belonging to the I.T. and G.W.U. had been employed to unload this boat, and that the other men had taken their jobs; but I had previously ascertained that the gang was a mixed one, composed of three men from Larkin's Union and two from the I.T. and G.W. Union, but this he again denied.  I then sent a sergeant <Col N="2875" /> for Mr. Fitzgerald, General Secretary of the Corn Co., who had not yet arrived, and he informed me that the gang was composed of members of both unions.  Mr. Everett said none of the men belonged to his union now, but admitted after some time that they were members of the Transport Union on Saturday, the 13th inst.  I went to decide the matter, and the men informed me that they were still in the Irish Transport and G.W. Union.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After a lengthy conference Mr. Fitzgerald decided to retain the men employed.  Mr. Everett and his followers left the office and again addressed the men on the quays.  I went on to the quays then and went up to this crowd and again cautioned them, telling them I was there to see that any man who wanted to work was permitted to do so.  I told them to move on, as I was not going to tolerate mob law, but only about five left the crowd.  I then moved a number of women and children away who were in the vicinity of the crowd and ordered the Gardaí to &lsquo;fall in&rsquo; in single rank facing the crowd.  I again told the crowd that they were in a false position and that I would be compelled to move them, and that I would do so by force if necessary; but Mr. Everett called on them to remain firm, as they were required for picket duty.  I then approached him again and asked him who were the pickets and what was their number, and he replied, &lsquo;That is my business.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I next said: &lsquo;Am I to take it that all this crowd is picketing&rsquo;?  He said, &lsquo;Yes, they are.&rsquo;  I told him this was not a picket, but a mob, that they were not picketing peacefully, but had forcibly prevented five men from working, and that they had remained in massed formation from 8 a.m. and blocked the gangway, and that this was the last caution I would give them.  It was now 11 o'clock.  I ordered the Gardaí (ten in number) to advance and move on the crowd. On this being done the crowd became threatening, and Mr. Everett called <Col N="2876" /> on them to remain firm, and the crowd rushed towards us.  I ordered the Gardaí to draw their batons, and immediately a number of missiles, including coal, stones and pieces of brick, were thrown at us from front and rere, and the situation became very dangerous.  As I saw the possibility of the few Gardaí being hemmed in between the two stone-throwing crowds, I at once ordered the men to disperse the crowd in front, and gave the order &lsquo;charge.&rsquo; This was done, and the crowd still offered resistance and the stone-throwing continued, but in a few seconds the crowd was completely dispersed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I then blew my whistle and reassembled the Gardaí to deal with the crowd in our rear.  This was chiefly composed of excited women headed by a lady who had rallied the women &mdash;seeing that the men had failed. Some of these had large stones in their hands.  I again cautioned these women and told them that I did not like using force against women, but that I would do so if necessary, to save my men from further injury.  I may mention that Gárda Breheny was hit with a large stone in the jaw and injured slightly but he followed the man who threw it and arrested him.  His name is Joseph Doyle. Another man named Thomas Doyle was also arrested during the charge for stone throwing.  The women on the quays went off at once and work was resumed in a quiet manner.  The I.T. &amp; G.W.U. men employed on the quays left their work and their places were at once filled by Larkin's men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that about concludes his description of the incident.  The rest is mostly comment rather than a description. As I say, on these reports and on the interview which responsible officers of my Department had with the Superintendent and the Commissioner of the Civic Guard, I have come to the conclusion that the Guards in Wicklow on last Monday morning behaved most properly.</P>

      <P>We have got to get down to this thing.  Deputies should try to retain a little sense of humour and a little imagination, and it might be a help if the Deputy would reverse matters; if the Deputy would suppose for a moment, if he can so far strain his imagination, that certain members of his Union were in work and that certain members of a rival union came to them and said: &ldquo;You have no right to work.  Stop this work, you cannot work at this because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the issue.  The question was that the employers had broken their agreement. We went to picket the employers.  We had no dispute with the men, and, in defiance of an order issued by a large number of the dockers, the employers wanted to strike off our members.  One of them ceased work immediately and I had a perfect right to stop men claiming to be members of the Transport Union.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had no <Col N="2878" /> right to stop any man from working, whatever union he belongs to, and he had better get a good tight hold of that, because, unless we can agree on fundamentals of that kind, we are not going to get anywhere on this discussion. It would simply mean that the Deputy challenges the law, and that he is going to make a law for himself.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has no right by violence, by obstruction, to prevent any man working at any job, regardless of what union that man belongs to, and if he feels that because certain men had their names on the books of the Transport Union he had a right to go down and physically prevent these men from working, then he is laying down a very anarchical proposition, to prevent which, I consider that the Guards ought to use force to the utmost, to prevent which, if necessary, we would not merely be justified, but bound, to call in another force, with other weapons.  I was surprised at certain things that Deputy Johnson said.  He spoke of the desirability of the Guards being a popular force, and up to a point I agree.  But the Guards must not win popularity at the expense of the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Johnson started his statement on this matter by stating that he raised this because of its importance, and because he profoundly hoped that it would not be a headline to other Guards, officers and men throughout the country.  Now, in the most deliberate way, let me say that, from the information at my disposal, I hope that what happened at Wicklow on last Monday morning, the action of the Guards in Wicklow on Monday morning last, will be taken as a headline by the Guards, officers and men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is that not the whole matter that is in conflict?  There are two sets of evidence, and the Minister is advising the Guards throughout the country to act upon a statement that is utterly in dispute.  The whole question is involved in this, whether a Guard is capable and in duty bound to decide whether there is a trade dispute or not, and if he decides there is a trade dispute, that he will not allow picketing, independent of whether there is a big picket or a little picket, a violent or a peaceful one.  A peaceful picket would not be allowed by the Guard because the Superintendent said there was not a trade dispute.</P>

If there were ten trade disputes in Wicklow on Monday morning last it did not give any hundred men a right to prevent any five men in Wicklow from working.</P>

      <P>Nobody is asserting that.  The Minister has practically admitted that the Superintendent of the Civic Guard had decided that there was not a trade dispute, and that, therefore, he would not allow a picket.  It was not a question of peaceful picketing; it was not a question of one hundred men.  It was a case of a picket that the Guard would not allow because the Superintendent said there was no trade dispute.</P>

      <P>The question is this: There is a responsibility on the police to see that no man who wants to work for a wage, or who wants to work for any consideration, is prevented from working.  One hundred men tried on Monday morning last to prevent five men from working, and the Guard, in vindication of the right of these five men to continue working, found it necessary to disperse an unlawful assembly. They acted with restraint, certainly without haste, seeing that you had a static situation there from 8 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock, when the dispersal took place; they acted, as it appears from the information officially supplied to me, after repeated warnings, and finally they acted without any degree of violence other than was necessary to secure an eminently proper and desirable objective.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Johnson, what I want to secure is, that any statement the Minister may make here to-night will not be taken as a vindication, in its entirety, of the action the Guards took on Monday last.  The Minister for Justice states that he is basing his case on the official information supplied to him.  I submit that he will find that even the Superintendent himself admitted a trade dispute existed, because in the course of his statement he said that the Transport Union men had left their work.  He tried to make great play in his address with a term which he used various times by saying that Mr. Everett stopped certain men from work.  If he were familiar with the phrase in the trade union movement, he would know that that means the calling out of men, <Col N="2885" /> and I submit that Mr. Everett had a perfect right to approach two members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene? I might have used, perhaps, closer words.  What I meant was that Mr. Everett and the crowd he was leading that morning physically prevented five men who wanted to work from working, and made it impossible for them, for over three hours, to work.  It was only after three hours of that kind of obstruction that the Guards took the action that they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Everett approached two of his own out of those five men, and called them off in accordance with trade union rules and principles. There, immediately, a trade dispute started; and a superintendent of the Civic Guards has no right to determine for himself whether there is a trade dispute or not.  He has the right to arrest certain people for picketing if he likes and to prove it in another place.  The Minister has said that Mr. Everett had no right to take on himself to say as to whether there was a trade dispute or not and to remonstrate with the Guards.  The Minister said the Guards acted commendably, that he was deligted with their action, and that he hoped in similar circumstances in other parts of the country that the Guards would do a similar thing.</P>
      <P>That is an important and dangerous statement for a Minister to make in this House.  He has received a report from the superintendent of the Guards responsible for the action which is being debated here to-night.  He has not endeavoured, so far as we can find out from his statement, to get any independent views at all.  It is a very important and serious thing for a man occupying the positions of Minister for Justice and Vice-President of this State to make a statement which would lead the Guards in the country to go around wildly, beating the heads of the men, women and children in the State.  I do not think he should have made that statement until he was satisfied from some other source, besides the man concerned in it, and more especially as the matter is in the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to deal with the question except in the way that Deputy Johnson dealt with it.  I do not for a moment suggest that a crowd of 100 men are right when they approach certain men and tell them that they should not work.  They have a right to picket, and if the picket were too large I submit that the Civic Guard, if they wanted to preserve the peace of the district instead of remonstrating with Deputy Everett should have told him that they would agree to a picket of six or twelve men, and that he should withdraw the rest of the crowd.  I believe Mr. Everett would be reasonable in the matter and would be only too glad to do so.  But the Superintendent seemed to be looking for trouble all the morning.  I do not think that the general body of the Guards in the country want that kind of work.  It is only a highly-strung official that would be responsible for it.  Surely we had enought of this work for the last five or six years.  An officer in the position of Superintendent should be careful before he starts that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister dealt with the point put forward by Deputy Johnson. We do not advocate mob law in any particular part of Ireland, or that a body of men should go round to the docks in any city or town and prevent men from working.  As a matter of fact, the union for which Deputy Everett and I stand have acted the other way, to the knowledge of the Minister, and have taken certain action in order that certain people should be allowed to work when certain other people were using mob law against them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will agree that I did my utmost in Dublin to ensure that men who wanted to work would not be prevented by violence and intimidation from doing their work. Does the Deputy suggest that whereas I should take one line of action in Dublin that where the roles are reversed in another part I should take up another attitude?  Does the Deputy <Col N="2887" /> suggest that having used all the resources of the State to vindicate the right of men here in Dublin who wished to work and defeat terrorists tactics on the part of members of another union, that, because the roles are reversed in some place down the country, a different policy and a different attitude should be taken up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">

      <P>I do not suggest any such thing.  If the Minister listened to what I said he would find that I did not.  As far as I know, the Minister did not interfere in Dublin with picketing.  It was only when certain members of an organisation were practically kicked and beaten to death that he interfered, but even then the police did not use batons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote an instance not only of three hours, but of three months, where the Government did not interfere.  It was only when the Transport Union formed a bodyguard of its own that the members were allowed to work.  The minute this question is raised in Wicklow we have a baton charge.  I am as anxious for the peace of the country as anyone and I have helped the Guards in our own area.  So far as the Guards down there are concerned, I can say that they are a splendid body of men.  They have never raised any trouble and I hope they will not.  What I object to&mdash;and it is Deputy Johnson's reason for bringing this on&mdash;is allowing a Superintendent of police to determine whether there is a trade dispute or not.  If that is allowed, you may as well bring in a Bill to abolish peaceful picketing altogether. <Col N="2888" /> That is an important point, as far as we are concerned.  We do not come forward here and condone what any man does, or any body of men who are not acting within the law.  We are here to vindicate the law as well as the Minister, but we object to a Superintendent who is, perhaps, prejudiced against a certain individual deciding whether there is a trade dispute or not. He has other machinery for doing that and he should have availed of it before he batoned the men, women and children of Wicklow.</P>

The statements I made here to-night on this incident are based on official reports and on the examination of the Superintendent by the Secretary of my Department.  I have attempted to lay down certain things here as first principles and I doubt myself whether they have been accepted uneqivocably.

      <P>When I spoke of &ldquo;commendable restraint,&rdquo; what I meant was that great patience seemed to have been exercised, on the information <Col N="2892" /> available to me, by the officer in charge.  That is borne out by the fact that this situation existed for a long period, that the officer seems to have done his best to get the crowd to see reason, to get them to move off, that he seems to have warned them on several occasions, that he tried to explain their position to them and that it was only after he had failed and when there was continued and prolonged obstruction of the right of five men to go on with their work who wanted to go on with their work that he intervened.  As to the point of batoning a man into unconsciousness, and so on, I was not referring simply to the treatment of one particular individual when I spoke of &ldquo;commendable restraint.&rdquo;  I was referring to the manner in which the entire situation seems to have been handled.  When it becomes necessary to use a baton and when there is a baton charge, it will happen that a particular blow struck may be over-heavy and may light on a particular portion of a man's anatomy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mr. Brennan is not now serving with the Forces and his mother is not, therefore, in receipt of dependent's allowance.  As regards the other portion of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given here by my predecessor on the 16th May last, in which it was stated that the net financial loss to the home through Sergeant McKeown's enlistment amounted to about 15/- per week. In respect of this extent of dependence an allowance of 7/- per week, as specified by regulations, was issued to Mr. McKeown.  These regulations were based on a recognition of an obligation for a soldier to contribute at least 8/- a week towards the upkeep of his home whilst serving in the Army.  In accordance with the regulations the allowance was issued only from the 4th August, 1923, the date on which application was made.  I regret that the case cannot be further considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

      <P>Mrs. Coogan's claim was disallowed on the ground that the net amount normally contributed by her nephew, James Gleeson, to her support was less than the minimum required by the regulations, namely, 12/- per week, before an allowance might be issued.  It was ascertained that prior to enlistment James Gleeson was in receipt <Col N="2737" /> of £1 per week and was boarded by his employer.  After making a reasonable deduction in respect of clothing, pocket money and incidental expenses it cannot be accepted that the net contribution to Mrs. Coogan could have amounted to 12/- per week.  The regulations governing the matter were based on the recognition of an obligation on the part of an unmarried soldier to contribute a reasonable portion of his Army remuneration&mdash;in Gleeson's case 8/- per week&mdash;towards the support of his dependents.</P>
