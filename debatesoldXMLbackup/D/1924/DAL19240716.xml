      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether the officer concerned in the bill of £16 12s., due to Mrs. Argue, of Lifford, has yet been discovered; whether this officer signed and certified as correct the bill furnished to his department; whether Mrs. Argue, some months ago, received a cheque for £55 to pay this account, which she returned, and whether her original account of £16 12s. is still unpaid.</P>

Every effort is being made to have this amount and a further amount in respect of cartage discharged as early as possible.</P>

Kildare, was handed over by Lieutenant Seán Kenny, at present serving in Naas Barracks, to Captain Hamilton, O.C., Naas; whether the car was seen there by the owner about October, 1922, when Captains Tuite, Joyce, Keogh, and Lieutenant Kenny were serving there; whether the car was used by Lieutenant Hyland, O.C., Transport Corps, for military duty, and was afterwards transferred to Collins Barracks, Dublin; whether Mr. Toomey, Solicitor, Athy, forwarded claims for compensation on behalf of the owners to Claims Office, who did not reply; and whether he will have enquiries made amongst the officers mentioned with a view to compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg leave to introduce a Bill &ldquo;to authorise the General Council established by the Medical Acts to continue to exercise jurisdiction and authority under those Acts in respect of medical practitioners in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  As this Bill arises in peculiar circumstances, and as the passage of the Bill will necessarily have to be hastened, it may be advisable that I should make one or two remarks on it.  The General Medical Council had been set up under the Medical Acts, and had been in operation here, and it was believed that its operations had been continued by the accumulated effect of the Articles of the Constitution and the Adaptation of Enactments Act passed early in the life of the Dáil.  It has been found, however, that owing to certain action being taken on the other side the scope of the authority of the General Medical Council is believed to no longer extend to this country, and that fact, if it is now established, has this repercussion, that certain medical men registered or purported to be registered since 1922, may not in fact be legally registered; and in order to validate these people, and in order to continue the existence of the General Medical Council until <Col N="1391" /> such time as the medical profession here, in conjunction with the Government or under the supervision of the Government, have had time to establish a Council of their own, this Bill is necessary.</P>
      <P>The effect of this matter and the contention raised about it by the English medical authorities were not raised here until recently; and as quickly as possible attempts were made to have the problem solved.  It has been found, however, that the only reasonable approach in the circumstances is to continue the authority of the General Medical Council and the operation of the Medical Acts in the Saorstát for a temporary period.  That period is limited by the Bill to one year, during which time it is believed there will be a chance, and there will certainly be an opportunity of considering the matter &mdash;of considering whether it ought to be possible to have a proper authority established for the country, either separate from or having full reciprocity with the other side or something less than full reciprocity.  I should like to urge on the Dáil the urgency of this Bill.  The Bill, if leave be given to introduce it, will be in the hands of Deputies almost immediately, and if it could be treated as a matter of urgency &mdash;and I put that to you, sir&mdash;it would be advisable to have the stages taken as quickly as possible in order to ensure the passage of the Bill before the Dáil rises.  It will have to be presented to the Seanad in time to have their assent to it, if they wish to give it their assent, before they adjourn.</P>

I have no doubt, from what I have heard, that, in view of the circumstances and the fact that the Minister has limited the period during which the operations of the Bill will be effective to one year, and in view of the emergency that it is intended to meet&mdash;I have no doubt that there will be no difficulty.  But that depends upon the Bill when we see it. <Col N="1392" /> And I take it that it is the intention of the Minister, at any rate, to see that the Bill is passed substantially in the form in which he introduced it, and that it is not his intention to accept amendments extending the period and extending the operation of the Bill.</P>

I do not think that he intended that a certain impression should get abroad as the result of a certain phrase that he made use of.  I do not think that he meant to convey&mdash;and I should be glad if he makes it perfectly clear that I am right&mdash;that there was any necessity of a change being made in the present state of things.  I think that all that he meant to convey was that by arranging for the period of one year there would be within that time an opportunity for considering the best way of arranging matters in the future, but that that would not necessarily involve any change in the present system, which, as he said, is really a system of reciprocity.  I think it is very important before anything gets out, as this is merely a Bill for a limited period, that it should be made quite clear that the Bill does not necessarily involve any change in the existing circumstances. It is very important for those who propose to enter the medical profession that we should be quite clear upon that point.</P>

It may be continued by Act of the Oireachtas after that, and, even limited as it is, it ought not be taken to have the meaning that after a year there will necessarily be a change from the present situation.  There is no such compulsion. It only means that the period of twelve months is granted so that the matter should be enquired into to see if it is possible to continue the present arrangement.  If it is decided to continue the present arrangement, a Bill for that purpose can be passed <Col N="1393" /> through the Oireachtas, and the present arrangement can continue.  The Bill is a temporary Bill to meet an emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made a Second Reading speech in introducing this measure, and I do not think it is necessary for me to say much about it now.  It is one of those minor methods by which we are hoping to do something towards relieving unemployment, and this particular method of doing it is a really useful and practical method.  Some £3,000,000 have been already spent on drainage work, and the improvement of Irish lands by schemes of arterial drainage, and the benefits which in the ordinary way should have been derived from this expenditure have been lost through neglect on the part of the drainage authorities throughout the country to maintain the works where these particular schemes have been carried out. It is believed that this expenditure, with the expenditure proposed under this Bill, will give better results for the money which is supposed to be spent in restoring this neglected maintenance rather than devoting it towards new constructive works.  This Bill, accordingly, contemplates only the restoration of neglected maintenance, and it does not make any attempt to deal with the very large problem of new works, or any general reform of the provisions of the existing drainage law.  Under the existing law the responsibility for the maintenance of drainage districts rests either with the Drainage Boards, or with the County Council.  Where the County Councils have taken over the functions of the Drainage Board, under the Local Government Act of 1898, if maintenance is neglected, the Commissioners of Public Works may intervene, but they can only do so on receipt of a complaint, and a report is made in due course thereon by an inspector.  For many reasons there has been no such intervention since 1905.  It is proposed in this measure to give the Board of <Col N="1395" /> Works power to intervene directly, irrespective of the usual formalities, which were very cumbersome, where they are satisfied that maintenance has been neglected, and the present Bill is mainly concerned with giving them the necessary power to do this.  Under the law as it stands, Commissioners intervene to restore neglected maintenance, and they are empowered to charge expenditure to the proprietors of the land that is benefited.  The Bill proposes that the Minister for Finance should make a free grant of one-half the sum required by the Commissioners for the works they undertake, and the balance of the amount they require may also be provided out of public funds in the form of a loan, repayable through the County Council out of lands which benefit.  I move the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has introduced the Bill.  The position has been created in some parts of the country where drainage and reclamation of this description has been done, where a certain amount of money was set aside under the sale of the property under the Land Commission, and that money has been exhausted through bad management on the part, perhaps, of every body concerned, including even the Land Commission.  The position now in certain areas that I am aware of is that hundreds of acres of good land is continuously under water. This grant of 50 per cent. suggested by the Ministry will go a long way to meet and put right that unfortunate position. Provisions enabling them to raise the balance of the grant from the County Councils will also, I think, meet the situation.  I am very glad the Bill has been introduced.  It is a matter of absolute necessity, and I hope in any transactions under the new Land Bill that provisions will be made whereby the question of drainage and embankments will not become a charge on the public purse in the future.  I hope the Government will take particular note of that, and that that position will be guarded against.</P>

I am not an agriculturist, but I know of certain drainage of lands which has been allowed to get into an utterly useless condition.  I do not know whether all these sort of things are known, and will be taken cognisance of in the Bill, or whether it is expected members will take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the President could give the Dáil any indication, or if he has anything to place before us, to show the amount of money likely to be expended by the operations of this Bill, if and when it becomes an Act.  I am in agreement with Deputy Gorey that it is one of the few Bills that have come before the Dáil which, if put into operation in a proper way, will confer a very great advantage on the agricultural districts. We have been told in the Dáil from time to time that so many millions of money have been set aside for this, that and the other purpose, which directly or indirectly is behind our intention of relieving unemployment, as well as carrying out works which in time will give a return for money so expended.  The President, no doubt, is aware that failure to take advantage of the opportunities afforded in that direction is due to a great extent to the failure of the local authorities to adopt the scheme.  There is nothing, as far as I can see, in this Bill which would compel the local authority to carry out its share of responsibility for the work which might be necessary, and which, in the opinion of the engineers appointed by the Commissioners, may be necessary.  There is that flaw in the Bill, as far as I can see, from my reading of it.  I think something should be done to bring into line wherever it is found necessary to do so, and to compel, the local authorities who may be reluctant <Col N="1397" /> to adopt the scheme because of any charge which may be made on the people in the areas affected.  Has the President had any figures placed before him, or has he received reports from the Commissioners of Public Works to show how far it is necessary to carry out work in this direction, and if the money that is necessary for carrying out this work will be forthcoming under the terms of the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have given the impression that the Minister for Finance intended to contribute half in every case.  That is not the intention in the Bill.  It is proposed that this contribution will not exceed half.  I do not anticipate that a contribution will be necessary in every case.  I have not the figures as to the probable amount of money that is to be absorbed, but I will endeavour to see what would be the likely sum before the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that if the original cost were in the neighbourhood of £3,000,000, the amount the Government would make available for this Bill would bear some relation to the interest on that sum.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this which if dealt with now might save discussion on the Committee Stage.  I would like a little information on a point raised by Deputy Cooper.  In Section 5 we find sub-section (1) states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of so much of this Act as authorises a county council to make a contribution to the cost of works executed by the Commissioners under this Act, a county council may borrow money under Article 22 of the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, in like manner as if those purposes were mentioned in that article, and money borrowed for the purposes <Col N="1398" /> aforesaid shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of the county for the purposes of the said article.</P>
    <P>I am assuming there is some value in that Order, and I would like to ask the Minister to assist by telling us what is its purpose and whether the possible extension of the borrowing powers proposed in two or three recent Bills is going to destroy any value the Order has.  I want to save myself the trouble of looking up this Order, and perhaps the Minister would do it for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>A continuous evasion of this particular article would certainly be a very serious consideration. It would involve these local authorities in insolvency.  The framers of the Local Government Act had in mind the necessity for keeping local bodies in a solvent position.  There has been a certain absolution granted them in certain cases where one requires perhaps more jurisdiction and power than is usually the case with minor offences.  In the case of housing there is no limitation to the borrowing powers of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that is because there is a tangible asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know it is so much the fact that a tangible asset exists as the necessities of the case&mdash; whether you are risking solvency or risking the health and security of the population.  Now, to some extent certain other items not perhaps as important as housing, necessitate occasionally some elasticity in this particular order.  Any general direction which would damage the security that is involved in this particular article would be exceedingly dangerous.  The assets that are acquired, or at least, the goods that are delivered in certain cases where borrowing is allowed, are certainly a very vital consideration in the matter.  I think the main purpose was that whatever liability would attach to a very large capital expenditure should bear a fair relation to the ordinary rates of that particular place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one local authority with which I was associated for a number of years, the interest on capital cost at one <Col N="1399" /> period reached 50 per cent. of the entire amount raised in rates.  It can be seen at once that a tendency grows up amongst local authorities to pass on the liability to their successors.  In that case there must be some corrective of that tendency to try and relieve a current year from its own share of the liability, while the benefits derived from a big capital expenditure might reasonably be placed over a number of years.  It is a bad principle to go on if they could possibly meet such charges by including them in the rates of a particular year.  In addition to all that, there is a little looseness in capital expenditure which is not so observable when the money has to be raised in a particular year to meet a particular item.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President consider the desirability of introducing a Government amendment on the Committee Stage of the Local Government Bill setting up a new standard for Councils?  It is preposterous to have this clause in almost every Bill dealing with local government, that any money borrowed under it shall be considered outside the limit of debt. It would be better fix a standard up to which Councils could borrow, and not be perpetually legislating for hard cases.  I merely throw out the suggestion.</P>

      <P>I look upon this Bill as one that we might call a county drainage scheme.  I find nothing in the Bill to show that it is going to be in any way a national drainage scheme. I want to express regret that the Bill is not more extensive in its scope.  It really deals with drainage schemes already in existence which for one reason or another have become inoperative for some time.  It is the general experience that in every county there are small areas where there is no drainage scheme in existence, although badly needed.  In many of the smaller rivers we have obstructions of one kind or another, but there is no statutory body with authority, with power, to deal with the situation.  It is regrettable that in this Bill further powers are not given to the Commissioners of Public Works or the County Councils <Col N="1400" /> to establish drainage committees or boards.  Such committees are necessary in every county, and I know that they are necessary in my constituency.  I would like if the Minister would consider that, and state whether it is possible to widen the scope of the Bill in order to give power for the establishment of drainage boards in districts where they are needed.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Baxter more or less.  I listened to Deputy Lyons to-day asking if any facilities would be given to individual owners to deal with drainage.  I am not quite satisfied that the best way to proceed in this matter is to give powers to the County Councils or public bodies.  I think if more latitude were given individuals such as were heretofore given by the Board of Public Works in the issuing of loans on the security of the holding the money would be expended with better results. If power is put into the hands of collective bodies like County Councils that have a great deal of work to do, I do not think the work done will be so beneficial.  I think if the suggestion made by Deputy Lyons was considered, and if loans were issued where they would be reproductive and benefit a particular farm or district, it would be a better plan than that proposed in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance had under consideration a proposal of somewhat the same nature as Deputy Baxter has referred to, and I believe that when he returns his proposal will come before the Executive Council.  But in this matter I should say that the large amount of business that had to be transacted recently and that has occupied our attention for a considerable time did not afford any opportunity for the consideration of a large measure.  A larger measure was under consideration some considerable time ago.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On reconsideration of the many interruptions which occurred at the end of my speech last night, I have come to the conclusion that I was being objected to for stating that the policy of a certain group in the Dáil was a negative one, that it consisted of the phrase: &ldquo;Not to balance the Budget.&rdquo;  That drew a vehement protest from Deputy Esmonde, I think, amongst other Deputies of that group.  I would like to quote a little from my recollection of what Deputy Esmonde said in moving the amendment.  He directed our attention to certain small countries recently established, who have had many initial charges in the foundation of their State, and his remark was: &ldquo;Of course these countries have not balanced <Col N="1402" /> their Budgets.  If they had done so, they could never have established their State at all.&rdquo;  If it is not a legitimate deduction from that, that the policy of the Deputy is not to balance the Budget, I can give him further quotations.  He took three specific comparisons, Denmark, Holland and Switzerland.  He said that in the last 8 years Denmark, on its ordinary Budget, had a deficit of 15 million pounds; that Switzerland, in in the last three years on its ordinary Budget, had a deficit of 12 million pounds; that Holland, in the last year, had a deficit on its ordinary Budget of one million pounds.  I am proceeding on the basis that the Deputy will agree that his policy is properly summed up in the phrase: &ldquo;Not to balance the Budget.&rdquo;  If we are to proceed on that basis, might I join the argument I have in response to the Deputy with one in reply also to Deputy Johnson. Let us take some of these newly-established countries which have not attended to the balancing of their Budget. Poland is a case in point.</P>
      <P>I wonder would anybody consider that it would have been well for us to go through the recent years of trouble that they have had in Poland?  Would Deputy Johnson think that the children there in the last few years had a better chance of getting fed, and that the parents had a better chance of getting work to provide food for the children, as a result of the turmoil which Poland went through by not attempting to balance its Budget?  I hesitate to speak of Russia.  Russia has been so used for purposes of propaganda that it is very difficult to arrive at any proper estimate of what the truth is regarding circumstances there.  But there has been very little attempt to balance the Budget there.  I wonder, again, would Deputy Johnson or Deputy Esmonde believe that the State made progress or that the children were less hungry than the children in this country have been for the last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde has contradicted himself in detail in his speech.  He has also contradicted himself on the two main propositions.  His whole case rested on this, that the policy of the Government was cheese-paring and parsimonious, <Col N="1403" /> as far as finance was concerned, and that the credit of the State has been destroyed.  I will read again the figures I gave last night&mdash;&ldquo;£2,000,000 for roads, drainage and bridge rebuilding; £7,330,000 for property losses; over half a million for housing; £200,000 for public works and new buildings; almost a quarter of a million in the Army Vote towards new buildings; a quarter of a million for relief schemes; a quarter of a million, at least, in unemployment insurance benefits; one million pounds set forth under the provisions of the Trade Loans Guarantee Bill,&rdquo; and a promise which I gave definitely here that if that million was exhausted there was more to come.  That is the parsimonious and cheese-paring State.  And we have destroyed the credit of the country!&mdash;destroyed it to this point, that in the difficult circumstances in which we were placed we were able to raise a loan of ten millions, to say nothing of the three millions over-subscription which was returned, and have gathered together one million pounds in Savings Certificates. With that in the Deputy's mind, will he still persist in saying that the policy on the one hand is cheese-paring and parsimonious, and that the result is that the credit of the State has been destroyed?</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson joined in this vote of censure for reasons which were not at all those of Deputy Esmonde.  Deputy Johnson, if I may put it in summary, wishes to censure the Government because they have not nationalised the sources of production.  That is, I think, what it comes to.  The Deputy in his speech said that far better than the idea of balancing the Budget was to have before you the idea that no one should go hungry in this State.</P>
    <P>No one is in fuller agreement than I am with Deputy Johnson on certain matters arising out of unemployment. I think that to be able and willing to work and to find no work to do, is the modern wheel on which many fine citizens are broken, and as far as the credit of the Government can do so, it will be provided, and I have promised that it will be provided, to secure work, and we are doing our best to <Col N="1404" /> build up and stimulate trade and industry in the country.  I have been a schoolmaster for several years, and for the first time I got a lesson from Deputy Johnson that I am rather glad I did not learn before, and attempt to put in practice before a class of discerning children.  I never knew that it was any answer, say, to a problem in algebra, simply to wipe it off the blackboard. That is the Deputy's approach to the problem&mdash;the wiping of the problem off the board, and simply to see that no child goes hungry.  Do not bother about the balancing of the Budget; do not bother about where the money is to come from; simply see that no child goes hungry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy applauds that, and he has no idea as to providing means.  His policy is that no child should go hungry.  Was the last state worse than the first, and do more children get fed by reason of the fact that the Budget is not balanced? Is that an example set up for a new State to follow?  There is the well-known story of the fool who, in order to hasten the coming of the fruit, shook down the blossoms and destroyed the promise and the potentiality of fruit, as well as not succeeding in getting any.  I do not want that to be applied to Deputy Johnson, particularly the word &ldquo;fool,&rdquo; but I say his action is somewhat similar.  But Deputy Johnson at least has got a humane idea.  His objective can be clearly seen and his purpose easily perceived, and he puts his case moderately.  But Deputy Milroy urges something that is not balancing the Budget and is not a denial of the policy of balancing the Budget, according to himself.  It is something that is so deep-seated and of such a description that it is impossible to gather completely what the effect of it is.  I do not object to reasoned criticism or to points put up as to how progress can be better made.  But I will put it to Deputy Esmonde that while it is an easy enough task to appear as wise as a tree full of owls, when you come to getting schemes that the schemes have to have some relation to practice, and that they must not be merely rudimentary convictions and mere tentative <Col N="1405" /> aspirations, and I put it to him that all the schemes he has put forward bear about as much relation to practical politics as the old time novels of Jules Verne do to serious science.  This is a progressive Government, but we are not going to have the road to progress developed to a point that will be dangerous to the safety of the State simply for the joy of believing that we are travelling fast, that we are spending fast, and that we are living fast.</P>

      <P>I think the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the very last statement that would convince me that the point of view that he has taken up is the correct one.  He says that this Government, which is his Government and the Government for which he is responsible, or for which he shares in the responsibility, is a progressive Government. I think we will agree that there is progress backwards and forwards, and on the claim that this Government is a progressive one I am prepared to admit that it is progressive in a backward direction.  I assume that the mover of this amendment would have the right to reply, and, therefore, I would like to put him one or two questions.</P>

      <P>If the mover of this amendment fully realised the consequences of his action, especially if his amendment were carried, I think he should have made up a better case, at any rate to this side of the Dáil, for the amendment.  I assume that if this amendment were carried by a vote it would be the duty of the Governor-General to send for Deputy Esmonde.</P>

      <P>Oh, no. The Deputy must not interpret the Constitution like that.  Deputy Esmonde is not going to get into contact with the Governor-General in that manner.  If the Dáil decides that it has no confidence in the present Government, I take it that the President would resign and that any Deputy would be in the position of nominating another President.  That must be clearly understood.  It is not a question of the Governor-General sending for any Deputy.  If the Executive Council should be beaten on a vote on this matter and the President should resign, Deputy Davin would be in a position to put forward a motion that Deputy Esmonde should be nominated as President of the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will leave Deputy Esmonde to wait until next Wednesday for the Garden Party to discuss the matter.  However, in the case, especially of one who is not very closely associated with Deputy Esmonde, or with the policy, if there is a policy, of the party with which he is associated, one is inclined to ask, on coming to a decision of this kind, what is his alternative policy?  I have been asking members of that party, especially outside of the Dáil, when we might expect from them a declaration of their policy, and it has not been forthcoming. I was one, at least, of the Deputies to think when an amendment of this kind was being moved, that it would be the first time for them to take advantage of their position as a National Group to indicate to the Dáil and to the country the policy which they intended to pursue if they were charged with the responsibility of Government.  However, quite apart from that altogether, there are reasons, as far as I am concerned, for my voting for this amendment, but they are certainly not the principal reasons put forward by Deputy Esmonde.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Army, I am not going to say very much.  We do not know as much about the incidents which led up to the Army crisis as Deputy Esmonde does, as a result of his association with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  This much I will say, and <Col N="1407" /> I am bound to say it, especially as a result of the speech that was made by the Minister for Justice when the Army crisis was last discussed here: I agree with Deputy Esmonde when he said that all the members of the Executive Council were deeply involved in this matter, and everyone of them who remained in the Executive Council, and for so long as they did remain, must accept their share of the responsibility for anything that happened which led up to the Army crisis.  There is no use, for instance, in the Minister for Justice getting up here and saying, &ldquo;I was a member of the I.R.B. pre-Truce.  In February, 1923, I brought this matter before the Executive Council, and nothing was done, but in June, 1923, I met a deputation from a secret organisation that I did not then agree with.  I let the matter rest at that.&rdquo;  And he simply explained to the country that the reason he left it there was because he regarded it as a private conversation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Justice himself would be the last man to say outside that he, as Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, could detach himself from his responsibility, as Minister for Justice, and as a member of the Executive Council.  When he met the deputation did he attempt to meet them as an individual&mdash;he claims to have gone as an individual&mdash;or did he meet them in his capacity as a member of the Executive Council?  There is no use in coming here and asking us to accept the statement that it was not his duty to report that to a subsequent meeting of the Executive Council.  To that extent I do not think that there is the slightest possible difference between any member of the Executive Council who remained in the Executive Council up to the time of the Army crisis, and there is no use whatsoever in one member of the Executive Council trying to get up on the back of another member who already finds it very difficult to carry his own weight.  So far as the Army is concerned, I am an anti-militarist.  I have always been, and I always will be.  I have never heard anything here which would compel me to take the view that the ultimate and full political freedom <Col N="1408" /> of this country will be obtained through force of arms.  I cannot subscribe, and will never subscribe, to that idea.  I believe if what we have got through the Treaty is to be the means of carrying us further to ultimate freedom, what we must do is not to concentrate upon arms and armies, but to develop the resources of our country, so that when we are faced as an island, either by the English or any other nation that has a great navy, we will be able to stand out against any attacks of a greater force.  I believe that it is only when we can be, as far as we can be, a self-supporting nation that we will be able to take a further step on the march to our ultimate political freedom.  The thing that concerns me most in this matter is the policy, or the lack of policy, or the lack of co-ordination of policy, of the Executive Council as a body.</P>
    <P>I am not going to make any attempt at improvement of the description that was given by Deputy Milroy of the members of the Executive Council, because he knows them to a far greater extent than I do.  That is not the right way to tackle this question.  We, so far as we have any complaint to make, approach it from the point of view of the lack of policy of the members of the Executive Council, and their failure to make the best use of the machinery which they accepted through the Treaty for the development of the resources of this country. The question of finance is one of the principal matters which we are confronted with when we come to deal with that matter.  Both inside and outside the Dáil, more particularly outside, from the members who support the Government, we hear a great deal about the timidity on the part of the Minister for Finance, on the question of money.  We have heard here in the House either by insinuations or by direct statements from the Extern Ministers that their policy and the development of their Ministry was held up because they could not get money from the Finance Department.  We have that very definitely and candidly from the Minister for Fisheries in regard to that particular matter.  There are other extern members of the Ministry <Col N="1409" /> who are not prepared to go that far or to make all the admissions they would perhaps make outside because of their loyalty, more than anything else, to the Executive Council.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in a statement made last evening, said the Government's financial policy &ldquo;had been endorsed by experts in financial journals in England, the United States and on the Continent, and yet they were told that they should not balance their Budget.&rdquo;  Now, I am quite prepared to believe that the financial policy of the present Government is acceptable to England and the British Government, and why?  Because there is very little difference, if any, between the policy of the Executive Council and the policy of the British Government and Dublin Castle in the past, and to that extent I quite believe that the British Government is perfectly satisfied with the financial policy of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I dare say we will hear something from the Minister for External Affairs later on on that point. The whole policy of the Executive Council since it was elected, even in the Third Dáil&mdash;and there may have been a certain justification for it at that time&mdash;and in the Fourth Dáil, has been to remind the people of the country that any alternative to the Government of which they are in charge would mean a terrible and disastrous war <Col N="1410" /> with England.  Even Deputy Gorey said at a farmers' meeting in the country some time ago that every one of the members of the Dáil could be got rid of with the exception of the ten supermen who are in charge of the Government, and, I presume, himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known, so far as I am concerned, that I have never associated myself in the slightest degree or attempted to justify anything that was done by a minority of the people of the country, when they challenged the elected Government of the people.  Therefore, I see no reason whatever in the members of the Executive Council, when confronted with a vote of censure or vote of no confidence, or when criticised even in the slightest degree, to get up here in this Dáil to be continually reminding the members of the Dáil, and the people outside also, that fifty millions of property has been blown sky-high.  This is the usual answer we hear, particularly from one or two Ministers, when any criticism is offered from any side of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is just as well we should leave it at that.  That is deliberately done in my opinion by the Executive Council or by different members of the Executive Council as a justification to the people of this country for their existence in their present position.  One cannot fail to acknowledge one fact or notice the fact that although there were 109 members elected to this Dáil at the last general election the average attendance in this House as far as I can make out is about 65 and only when a Whip was issued by the licensed traders of the country, did the number come up to 83.  Are we to take it that the absence of the thirty or forty members who were elected by the different constituencies <Col N="1411" /> to do the nation's business in the Dáil, is an indication of their unqualified support of the Government, or is it to be taken as an indication of lack of confidence in the Executive Council? I would like to have that answered by some member of the Executive Council.  I am inclined to claim this as an acknowledgment of their lack of confidence in the Executive Council; it perhaps could be claimed in the other way as well.  The Minister for Justice, who, no doubt, everyone will admit, takes a long-sighted view of the position, asks Deputies of this Dáil to say whether the money that has to be found for the development of the resources of the country either for administration or for useful works is to be found by increased taxation or by borrowing either at home or abroad. The Minister, I am sure, can quite easily answer the first part of the question by saying there cannot be any additional taxation.  The thing comes to this&mdash;we ask the Government for information to make up our minds to see whether or not the money that has to be found is to be found at home or abroad.  The Minister for Justice, when asking Deputies to form a judgment upon that matter, is in a privileged position himself, because if the Executive Council has ever considered the matter they have certainly some propositions and some information at their disposal to show whether it would be more profitable to borrow at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>At any rate, without knowing anything as to what the rate of interest would be, or what the commitments would be by borrowing at home or abroad, I say that even with great disadvantages on our side by borrowing at home, it is better policy for any new government or for any government to borrow at home rather than abroad. If you have made up your minds that money is necessary, and that you are prepared to find the money that is necessary for the development of the resources of this country, then borrow the necessary money at home at once, and not abroad.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGarry rightly said yesterday&mdash;and the Minister for Justice would know it if he took a stroll around the slums of his constituency&mdash;that we cannot take these things into consideration when we hear the cries of starving children.  For that reason I should like to see Ministers as well as Deputies, whenever they have an opportunity of going to the towns or cities in their constituencies, take a stroll around the slums and back lanes.  If they do they will always be in touch with the human element outside; and if they did keep themselves in touch with the human element outside they would know exactly the extent to which starvation and unemployment exist; and when they come to the Dáil they would not treat the subject in the sneering way in which it has been treated up to the present time.</P>
      <P>There is another thing which I daresay cannot be remedied.  The Executive Council in their wisdom, backed up by a majority of the members of the Dáil, have seen fit to throw on the present generation responsibility for the payment for all the damage and destruction that has been done within the last few years.  I think it would be far better policy if the payment for that damage had been extended over a greater number of years.  If that had been done it would result in making some of the people who have taken part in this destructive work pay later on for some of the damage they have done; and to make them do that would give them a very valuable lesson in the duties of citizenship and in their responsibilities in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I try as far as I possibly can to keep in close touch with my constituents.  I have discussed this question of the policy or lack of policy of the Government with constituents of mine regardless of Party considerations, and I am prepared to say this: that if the Party outside this Dáil that has a negative policy, and the Party inside this Dáil whose policy is certainly not a progressive policy but who have charge of the Government of this country for the time being, would agree, for the time, to drop the question of the Treaty <i>versus</i> the Republic and if a candidate <Col N="1413" /> belonging to any Party in this House, no matter what Party, were put against a nominee of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party for any constituency except County Dublin, the Government Party would be beaten.  That is the reason, probably, why they are delaying issuing the writs for the elections that should have taken place before the adjournment.  They know perfectly well that their position is rather precarious, and that wherever and whenever a by-election has taken place the people who have gone and voted for the Government have not gone and voted for the Government because of its policy, but simply because they are not prepared to accept the alternative of the negative policy of the only Party outside the Dáil that oppose them in those elections.</P>
    <P>I want also to draw attention to the fact&mdash;an explanation may be given for it&mdash;that at the present time the President of the Executive Council occupies three positions.  In fairness to the President himself, and in fairness to the members of the Dáil and to the people of the country, that situation should not be allowed to continue. There is no man, even a superman, in this world to-day who could take upon himself such a heavy responsibility, and the people of Ireland to-day who look to this Parliament as the only means of solving all their problems are not asking that the President of the Executive Council should undertake such a heavy responsibility.  I say that the Executive Council should without further delay fill the vacancies and relieve the President of responsibilities which no human being can bear or carry.  There is no reason for it.  If the members of the Executive Council can claim the support of sixty-four members of the Dail surely they can find able men amongst that number to fill one of the positions that is vacant. I can quite understand the President carrying on for the time being the vacancy created by the unfortunate illness of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House any longer and I apologise for taking up so much of its time on this question. On this question I would put one pertinent question to the Minister who will be charged with the reply: <Col N="1414" /> Have the Executive Council ever sat down in session and considered the Estimates presented to us in this House?  Are they acquainted with every detail in the Estimates put forward for the Executive Council?  As far as I can trace the matter&mdash;and I have had dealings with the Ministry on two or three occasions, in matters of finance in connection with schemes I was interested in&mdash;as far as I can trace it the work of the Government of this country so far as finance and so far as matters of public policy are concerned is done by the officials responsible to the Government.  It is the officials who are really in charge of the Government of this country.  If you go to a member of the Executive Council, to a Minister, and ask him to give his consideration to any proposal which may be put forward by a member of the Dáil he does not bring that matter to the Executive Council and ask the Executive Council to consider it, although it may be a great national question; he refers it to the official who is responsible for the administration in his own department.  I say that when any great national question is put up to them the great men in the Executive Council, and certainly there are some great men in it, should set themselves free from the interference of officialism and consider the proposal on its merits rather than accept the recommendation of their officials and stand over it in this Dáil.</P>

      <P>The late Minister for Industry and Commerce left the Executive Council of his own sweet will. He was not chucked out, and to that extent there was a continuity of responsibility. At any rate, if I am entitled to be asked a question by the new Minister who should be acquainted with the facts, I should be entitled to give an explanation.  What I said was that I approached the Minister in connection with the Barrow drainage.  A deputation was received and recommendations were put up.  I approached him about two months after, and we were told that in a month we would <Col N="1416" /> have a reply, and that the deputation would be sent for again.  We were told that the matter had been referred to the Chairman of the Board of Works. Mind you it went to the Chairman of the Board of Works and not to the Minister for Finance.  I spoke to the Minister for Finance subsequently and he said that a report had been called for.  Nothing has been done in connection with that matter although it was on the 3rd March last that the deputation was received.  I make that statement in order to show how the thing is bandied about from one official to another, and that on a matter that has been recognised for years as a great national question.</P>

I also explained that the principal official of the Ministry of Finance&mdash;there is no need to mention names&mdash;was present, and he took particulars and passed them on, with the result of the discussion, to the Minister.  I would point out that if they were not passed on to the Minister for Finance there was someone at fault, but it was not the fault of the Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</P>

I spoke with other people, and it is a privilege on some occasions to get a conversation with members of the Executive Council, but no reply of any kind has been given since.  I say that is a fair justification of the statement I made that the Government of this country, even in a great many matters of this kind, is being carried on by officials, and not by the Executive themselves.</P>

      <P>In spite of the legal mind of the Minister for Agriculture, I contend that the example I have given is a good one as to what is going on, and at any rate I rely on it.  As we all know, in debates of this kind we will hear from the Minister for Agriculture some explanation of the attitude of the Executive Council, of which he is not a member.  I will support this vote of no confidence, or this vote of censure on the Executive Council, for I believe they have not taken a serious view of their position.  They may have been, and I believe they were, a capable and competent body to deal with the Army mutiny, or the Army scramble, or civil war if you like, but even people who might be competent to deal with military matters, and whose mentality is of a militaristic outlook, have not proved themselves competent to deal with these conditions.  It was suggested that £50,000,000 was blown sky-high. Take the case of France.  Anyone who has seen France since or during the European war would scarcely think that France could ever be built up again.  The Cabinet charged with the responsibility of winning that war for France at the same time that it dealt with war conditions also dealt with peace conditions.  You have evidence of that in the fact that there is very little unemployment in France to-day, and that is because these men were not thinking merely in military terms.</P>

It is for the same reason that I am supporting the vote of censure on the Executive Council, but certainly not for many of the reasons given by the mover.</P>

      <P>The President said that if he gave £5,000 more to Kerry than to Clare that I would rise in my wrath against the Executive <Col N="1418" /> Council.  I will not disappoint his expectations, although he has not given £5,000 to either Clare or to Kerry.  I must say that what struck me in listening to the debate was the amazing fact that one set of arguments can prove various conflicting things.  The set of arguments used by some members of the National Group in indicting the Government are practically the same arguments as were used by some members of that group in support of the Government which should have been indicted months ago. It would be interesting to collate the speeches of some of the members of the National Group, and read what they said some months ago, and what they said yesterday in the Dáil.  I agree with the censure on the Executive Council and I agree that they should be censured for practically nine-tenths of what they have done in the past 12 months, but when the Executive Council undertook to rob the old age pensioners, after being broken on the wheel of social order and thrown on the scrap heap, when they proposed to rob these unfortunate people and send them adrift, to be supported on the rates, and supported out of the pockets of people who cannot support them, why was not a vote of censure moved then?  Was it nothing to the members of the National Group then, as it was nothing to the members of the Executive Council?  Was it nothing to the National Group any more than to the Executive Council that in the past winter there were 100,000 people on the verge of starvation, and that starvation was rampant in every town and village in the country? Was that nothing to the members of the Executive Council, or the members of the National Group?  Was it nothing to the National Group that there were hundreds of children dying of malnutrition?  Was it nothing to members of the Executive Council or to the National Group&mdash;they were members of the Party who sat behind the Executive&mdash;that the grant of public moneys was being used to force down wages throughout the country? Mind you, those grants of public money meant the restoration of it to the people who gave the money in the first instance to us.  It is they who give it <Col N="1419" /> and make no mistake about it.  The unfortunate Minister for Finance is absent, and I regret to have to say these things in his absence.  The Minister for Finance goes with every working man who goes into a public house for a bottle of beer, and that working man has to pay over so much money to him. It is the same with regard to cigarettes. He sits down with him at breakfast and takes something for his tea and coffee, and he even follows him into the picture house and demands a payment of tax.  The restoration of this money is only returning portion of what these men have paid.  Was it nothing to members of the National Group any more than to members of the Executive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is both.  Was it anything to the members of the National Group that they supported the Government when there was tacked on to these grants given for the relief of unemployment a clause as to wages? When &ldquo;the base, brutal and bloody Saxon&rdquo; was here, when we were getting grants, there was nothing tacked on as to what wages were to be given, and yet members of the National Group sat placidly behind the Executive Council when these grants were given for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was it nothing to the members of the National Group, any more than the members of the Executive Council, that 20,000 or 30,000 men and women should be interned, with no charge made against them, for nine or ten months? The members of the National Group sat placidly behind the members of the Executive Council while the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Defence, and every other Minister accepted responsibility for that action and endeavoured to defend their position.  It was nothing, I admit, to the Executive Council, who thought it was justice and patriotism and all that.  Was it nothing to the members of the National Group that the Executive Council did not make any provision to educate the minds of the people; that the young intellect and brains of the country were <Col N="1420" /> starving for knowledge; that there was no system of education that might be called a system of education&mdash;no direct passage from primary to secondary and university education; that nothing was being done to remedy the state of affairs that existed when we had a foreign Government in this country? Was it nothing to the National Group or the Executive Council, and why did we not hear a protest then?  Was it nothing to the members of the National Group, any more than to the members of the Executive Council, that the Government were ignoring the national traditions and relegating the Irish language and what it stood for to a backward place in every part of the administration of Government?  At any rate, we heard no protest from the National Group.  Although the Minister for Education might object, I think that both the National Group and the Executive Council are in the dock, that both of them stand convicted of utilising the powers that came into their possession, not for the interests of the country, but for the interests of certain classes in the country, and that they have made no real or earnest attempt to solve the unemployment problem, the education problem, or any of the other problems which confronted the nation.  I will support the vote of censure on the Executive Council for this reason, that I voted against the measures as they came up, and in their cumulative, national degradation I will vote against them also, because that is exactly as it appears to me from the speeches that have been delivered by the National Group.  But in voting for this vote of censure, I will indict the National Group just as I will indict the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I feel sorry that I had not spoken before Deputy Hogan, if it were only to see what effect it might have on the metre of his little rhyme.  I have taken a fairly serious view of the attitude that I took up here in the Dáil since the Army crisis of four months ago.  I take a serious view of the attitude I am going to adopt on this particular amendment. I am going to vote for the amendment. I am going to support the vote of want of confidence in the Government, for <Col N="1421" /> the simple reason that I cannot allow myself to be put in the position, on a formal vote like this, of appearing in any way to show I have any confidence in them.  I have less confidence in the National Group than I have in the Executive Council; less confidence that the small work that falls to their lot in this Assembly will be done well by them, or will be done in any way nearly as well by them as the very responsible work that falls to the Executive Council. But I have no confidence in the Executive Council as a group to direct policy or to control administration.  I could give a good many reasons for that, but the main reason&mdash;and I think it is the over-riding reason&mdash;for that want of confidence on my part is that I consider the Executive Council, as a group, is composed of persons who have no confidence in themselves.  As a group of that kind I am perfectly convinced that there cannot crystallise from their efforts or from their work, either a policy that the Dáil or the country would be satisfied with or, given a policy, that there would crystallise out of their efforts a harmonious administration of that policy.  It is because I see the Executive Council in that particular light, that I propose to support the vote of want of confidence in them.</P>

      <P>Whatever this vote will do, or will not do, it has at least given everybody who wants to give expression to his opinions, an opportunity to speak, and as we all have to take some action on this amendment, we have to justify the action we are going to take by saying something.  Looking around and hearing the arguments that have come from all sides as to why this vote of censure ought to be passed, I do not find myself in agreement with any of the conflicting arguments put up by the different parties that are not in agreement with the Executive Council. Yet, I am not in agreement with the Executive Council, and I have to take them to task on one or two points.  On this question I would like to say to the members of the National Group, as well as to the members of other parties, that I think it ought not to be forgotten by the Deputies&mdash;and I have said this previously&mdash;that <Col N="1422" /> all the Deputies of the country are not here, and if it is a question of a transfer of authority from one body of representatives to another, the possibility is that it is to be changed, not to a body at present in the Dáil, but to a body of Deputies who are not in the Dáil.  It would be a very good thing for the Deputies who have spoken to keep that before their minds.</P>
      <P>The Executive Council, and those who have supported them since I came into the Dáil, have taken up an attitude with regard to the Republican prisoners to which I have consistently objected.  I want to protest against the continuation of that policy, and to say that I think the Executive Council's policy&mdash;which might be termed a &ldquo;ca-canny&rdquo; policy&mdash;with regard to the relief of prisoners, is not representative of the feeling of the country, and, I may say, is not what I accepted as an indication of the mind of the Dáil when a motion on this matter was under discussion some weeks ago.  The interests of the country, I think, would have been better served by the release of these prisoners long ago.  The stability and the credit of the State would have been better served by their release months ago, rather than by the action which the Executive Council has persisted in.  I protest very strongly, not only against the action of the Executive Council, but also against the action of Deputies who supported the Executive Council when they started out on that policy, and who have consistently supported them in it.  I want to hear what the Executive Council has to say on this.  Have they got anything to say?  Is the policy going to be altered?  When may we expect these prisoners to be released?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also that the decision of the Executive Council not to disclose the evidence that was advanced before the Army Committee of Inquiry is one with which I am not in agreement, and one for which I must take the Executive Council to task.  All that has been heard here about the Army crisis, all the dissatisfaction throughout the country, all the whisperings and stories, are due to the fact that many Deputies and many people throughout the country did not know <Col N="1423" /> the truth about the Army position. These rumours and the instability that they are bringing about will continue until the evidence is put before the public.</P>
    <P>When one comes to make up one's mind as to the attitude to be taken on this amendment, one has to consider the reasons advanced by the different parties as to why this vote of censure should be passed.  Coming from Deputy Esmonde and the other Deputies associated with him, I can only say that I am in agreement with Deputy Hogan that a vote of censure on the Executive Council is a vote of censure on Deputy Esmonde and his colleagues. As far as I see the policy of the Executive Council is the same for the last two or three months as it was six or eight months ago, when these Deputies supported the Government.  As far as I see the Government policy has not changed one jot or tittle.  It is the same as it was when the Deputies were defending every action of the Government.  The action of Deputies to-day in calling for censure on the Executive Council, actually, as far as I can see, is really calling for censure on their own actions.  I would certainly be very much inclined to censure them for their actions.  When we on these benches raised our voices in protest against the policy of the Executice Council as to their conduct in holding the prisoners in jails and camps, some of these Deputies were loudest in their defence of that policy. The policy is the same to-day as it was yesterday.  A few days ago we had a declaration from some of these Deputies that the prisoners ought to be released, but yesterday, we had from Deputy McGarry a statement that he did not mind whether they were or not. As far as I see this group has not shown us its policy and in the absence of any indication that it is different to the policy of the Government, I am not prepared to accept it that they are going to do anything different if they were in power.  A good deal has been said about the financial policy of the Government, and there has been a good deal of criticism of expenditure, and <Col N="1424" /> suggestions about balancing the Budget, and not balancing the Budget.  If there is one thing the tax-payers of this country know, it is that they have got to cut their coat according to their cloth.  They cannot spend money they have not got.  Deputies on these Benches came to the Dáil to do what they could to reduce expenditure, and to keep it at the lowest possible figure.  Whatever Government is here it is our duty to see that that will be done.  The Government have had fairly consistent support in keeping down expenditure.  If the National Group had been able by their arguments to show us what they were going to do, and what alteration there was to be in policy if they came into power, to that pursued by the Government, we would know where we were.  I cannot say what they are going to do, as they have not told us.  In asking us to censure the present administration it it seems to me, at least, that they are asking us to censure men for pursuing a policy that they themselves have pursued, and which they have not given any indication that they are going to alter.</P>

      <P>We have not taken part in this debate until now.  I have very little to say, but one thing I will say, on behalf of the Party with which I am connected, is that we stand here for a balanced Budget.  We stand for a policy by which normal recurrent expenditure must be met by normal recurrent revenue.  Non-recurrent expenditure can be met by revenue or loans.  There is no other way except by a gift from somebody.  If such expenditure is met by loans the money can be raised by borrowing either at home or abroad.  In either case the terms on which we can borrow, and the success of the loan will be decided by our attitude towards the Budget.  If we depart from the attitude of balancing the Budget and adopt any experiment in budgetting, or in passing on to others the expenditure of to-day, it will be a foolish policy.  It was suggested in a speech&mdash;I do not know if it was in the Dáil or in Wexford &mdash;that normal or abnormal expenditure should be passed on to a future generation.  That is childish, to use a <Col N="1425" /> very charitable description of the suggestion.</P>

If the Deputy says that he did not make that statement I am very glad.  I do not think any responsible individual with any semblance or pretence to a balanced mentality could make such a suggestion.  If it was made, I can anticipate a tragedy in 20 years time, when the new generation would come to deal with the matter. I can see one end of a rope being passed round a tree and the other end being passed round ex-Deputies' necks. Deputy Esmonde found fault with the Executive Council with regard to their Army and Defence policy.  He said something about the defence of Dal-key Island and the number of our guns.  I do not think that concerns us very much.</P>

    <P>When dealing with this vote of censure, Deputy McGrath expressed the view that the Army Inquiry was only a gag.  I do not know whether he was right or wrong in saying that.  I do not know if a gag was intended by those who set up the committee or by those supposed to go there.  We met a very serious gag because nobody wanted to come and give evidence. People who said they would come there did not come.  It was a gag to that extent. I can assure the Deputy and everyone concerned, that the committee got rid of all the gags, and got what evidence there was to be got.  The <Col N="1426" /> question was asked: where are the documents? We found some of the documents were not official documents. Some of them were personal documents. We got these documents from the source that held them, at a later stage. Witnesses have been referred to, but no man's name was ever suggested by anybody to us.  We had to find the information ourselves.  The members of the committee have to find out all the names.  Deputy McGrath did not suggest the names of witnesses.  Deputy Mulcahy did not suggest the names of witnesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath said that the ultimatum to the Executive Council should be followed by an inquiry. I am not here to defend the Executive Council, but I do not agree with Deputy McGrath that the ultimatum <Col N="1429" /> should be followed by an inquiry. It should have been followed by different action altogether.  Were I to blame the Executive Council at all, I should say that they did not act as an Executive Council.  The people who were in superior authority in this country should not have allowed themselves to be dictated to by any section or servants of the State, dictated to or influenced in any form.  If I blame them at all, I do so because they erred on the side of weakness and compromise. I have a very clear idea of what, I think, is the duty of any Executive Council to the State.  Now, to pass a vote of censure on the Executive Council of any State must be a matter of national importance to that State.  No party or no individual should propose such a motion lightly or without sufficient and very grave reasons.  I say that the reasons put up to sustain a vote of that description should be based on national importance.</P>
      <P>I have listened to this debate yesterday and to-day, and particularly on yesterday I heard very little reasons of national importance or national policy put up.  I heard, as other Deputies stated before me, no alternative policy at all touched upon.  I may be wrong, and I may have a prejudiced view, but I did think and I think now, that the debate reached a very petty and a very personal level, not at all worthy of the Parliament of the nation. I did think that the personal element entered too largely into this question. It has entered too largely into every question in Ireland I have been acquainted with since I was a boy.  It entered too largely, into Irish questions before the foreigner, the British, came to this country.  In every question the personal element is entering too largely and there is too little about the national question or the plain people of the country.  I may be blamed for not filling the bill as a member of the Army Committee, but I represent seven or eight thousand electors down the country who were fools enough to send me here.  For that reason we claim as much right to be represented on committees and as much right to express our view point here as any other Deputies from the universities or anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> Deputy Davin has referred to something that he read in the newspaper about my references to supermen.  I have never used the word supermen except in derision.  I have no room or use for supermen or sad-faced men. I have considerable use for honest, clean, plain people, and very little use for the idealists or the supermen, and the sooner this country comes down to its proper level with some sense of proportion, and gets rid of the supermen and all these super intellects the better for it.  I might say the party on these benches will not vote for this vote of censure.  I do not think it was put up with the best and worthiest motives&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot add any valuable contribution to the discussion that has taken place on this vote of censure against the Executive Council.  Coming here, I might naturally be supposed to occupy a critical position, more particularly as regards the Executive Council, and when this Motion was put down for discussion I might be pardoned for having an open mind on the subject and searching round for some information as to the result and the consequences of a Motion of this sort being carried.  I recognise that in the event of this Motion being carried we will be losing the services of the Executive Council that carried us through the very stormy period of the last couple of years.  In other directions I have opposed what I might call security of tenure in connection with appointments where they are not admirably filled, and if it was in the interests of the country I suppose I might be reasonably ranged along the side of those who would take action to remove people for incompetency from the position of great responsibility in which the Executive Council finds itself.  Examining the period in which I have been in this Dáil, I have on the whole, although I have voted against the Government on occasions <Col N="1431" /> when I thought it was necessary to vote against them, voted in favour of the actions and the procedure adopted by the Executive Council in the Dáil. In these circumstances, I very willingly pay them the tribute of saying I will vote against the amendment proposed by the new National Party.  I think the Minister of Justice has very rightly said that they recognise they have erred, and I would perhaps say that they have erred frequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I willingly adopt Deputy Johnson's dictum as to that.  I do very heartily say I hope he will sin no more in that direction.  When we have listened to the mover of this Motion of Censure and the following speeches by the members of the new National Party, it does not strike one as very apparent that, at all events, in its present state the new National Party is quite in a position to take up the offices occupied by the relative Ministers of the Executive Council.  I do not think that the policy that has been adumbrated by these representatives would be adopted seriously by the country, or that if it were adopted by the country its adoption would be for the health of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the financial policy is concerned, the only outcome of it I can visualise would be bankruptcy to the State.  I do not even know that they have a coherent policy amongst themselves, because I do not know they will all stand for the economic solution of our difficulties that has been propounded so often and so lengthily in the <Col N="1432" /> Dáil by Deputy Milroy.  The main plank in connection with the vote of censure against the Executive Council lies, I think, in the accusation that the position as regards the Army was badly handled.  I do say this for the Executive Council&mdash;that the crisis which we were faced with was successfully surmounted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that Deputy McGrath, at that time at all events, took a high national line as far he could to minimise the danger with which the State was faced.  Whether it was really in the interests of the country to prolong the contentions that have arisen out of that situation is quite another matter.  But I do say that, arising out of that crisis, and after the passing of the crisis, there was a sigh of relief in the country; and I think that a sentiment of very great gratitude to the Executive Council and to all those who helped to surmount that difficulty was the prevalent feeling in the country as a whole. And the best thing I could suggest for the country at the present time is to forget all about the Army crisis, and to face the future, and to see that such a thing shall not happen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not propose to enter into an argument with Deputy Mulcahy on that subject, because I do not think it would lead anywhere, and I do not think it would be very helpful to the House.  I am only expressing my individual opinion on this matter, and I am not prepared to carry it any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as regards the accusation of the Labour Party, that there are large numbers of unemployed in this country, that is unfortunately so.  How far are the Labour Party themselves responsible for it?  How far is the attitude adopted by the Labour Organisations responsible for some of that at all events?  As far as the Executive <Col N="1433" /> Council are concerned, I think they had endeavoured to meet the situation as far as their circumstances and the circumstances of the country would permit.  If there is anything more that could be done safely and without extravagant expenditure that the country could not afford, I think this House would have given full support to any measures they would have tried in order to get at that evil.  But may I say that as far as unemployment is concerned, this country has suffered in no sense in the proportion that other countries have suffered&mdash;countries across the water and in every direction.  A world crisis has followed the war, and efforts have been made to meet a situation such as has never been heard of in the world before.  It may be that there has not been enough done.  But I think in this matter it would have been more helpful if greater co-operation had been secured between all the labour organisations and the Government in trying to meet a situation which, I think, not only included the unemployed but the unemployable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour further on that subject except to say this: That I think my friend, Deputy Bryan Cooper, at one time accused me of being connected with lost causes.  I do sincerely hope that my advocacy of the Government will not include them in another lost cause, because I wish them well.  I feel that in the various situations that have arisen they have done, humanly speaking, as well as any representatives that I could suggest from this Dáil would have done under similar circumstances.</P>

But I suggest that in the special circumstances of this particular case, if we get agreement to call upon Deputy Esmonde to conclude the debate, gave him ten minutes to do so, and then put the question by agreement, it may bring the debate to a conclusion and perhaps as rapidly as if a division were taken on this motion, and another division subsequently.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Baxter, I am really at a loss to reconcile myself to the position as to what my attitude ought to be in this matter.  It is a very, very serious matter to censure the Government of this country, if it involves the resignation of that Government, because I do not think that this country at this moment has any desire for a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, and I will read your constitution whenever you make it.  I do not think that this country at the moment has any desire for a general election, and I do not think we should be fair to the country if we were to have an election.  As Deputy Baxter points out, the second largest party in this Dáil is not at present in the Dáil, and by all the rules of democracy, even though those people do not take the oath and come in here and take their seats, I hold that they should be entitled to form a Government if the present Government is put out of office, unless we are going to have a general election.  And I ask this Dáil in all seriousness, is that a situation we would like to face at the moment? Personally, I am not going to vote for this amendment.  And I want to say that I think that this amendment comes badly from the people who have tabled it, because as regards the acts of omission and commission of the Government that we have been listening to for the past two days, most of them were committed when these men were members of the party they now try to censure.  I do agree that the Government should be censured.  Time and time again Deputies in these benches have drawn the attention of the Government to the state of the country in so far as unemployment is concerned. We have told them time and time again that they are out of touch with the common people of the country, that they depend too much upon the information supplied to them by their officials, that they do not know the exact position in the country, and that before very long they will be faced with a situation which they will not be able to quell.  Deputy Hewat has told you, as I am telling you, that <Col N="1436" /> the Labour Party have repeatedly raised the question of unemployment, and Deputy Hewat asks how far the Labour Party are responsible for unemployment. I take it that that is a suggestion from Deputy Hewat that the Labour Party are responsible for unemployment.  I want to say here and now that the Labour Party are not responsible for unemployment, that the responsibility for unemployment rests upon the people of his class, who cannot see at the moment that they can no longer get the huge profits that they used to get in years gone by, because of the fact that labour is now organised in its own interests.  And I do not think that Deputy Good or any other Deputy will find fault with labour for organising, because of the way in which it was treated in the past, when there was no organisation to protect the working man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Davin, I have heard it said by the Extern Ministers that the responsibility for their inaction in many things is due to the fact that they cannot get the necessary funds from the Minister for Finance.  I want to say here and now, that I am not satisfied, and neither are the members of my Party, that the Minister for Finance is doing anything at all in the interests of the country.  The Ministry of Finance is still in the hands of men who have not, and never had, and never will have, an Irish outlook.  The same old gang are in the Ministry of Finance that were in it when the British were here, and the sooner the Government clear them out, bag and baggage, the better.  As I have said, they never had, and never will have, an Irish outlook, and they are not going to develop this country in accordance with the views some of us held when we were trying to build up the Sinn Fein movement in the old days.  We have heard talk about an army crisis.  It is very hard for us to make up our minds as to what is or was the position so far as the Army crisis is concerned.  We have one point of view from the members of the Executive Council who remain, that the Army crisis is alleged to have passed. We have Deputy Mulcahy representing certain officers, and we have Deputy McGrath who represented certain other officers&mdash;we had Deputy <Col N="1437" /> McGrath rising in his place and creating a crisis in the country by making a certain statement in the Dáil about muddling and mishandling. Deputy McGrath left the Government, and left the country in a state of absolute chaos.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be better if I said Deputy McGrath created a state of affairs.  What I want to allude to is this: Deputy McGrath at that time alleged that he was prevented by the President from saying anything further in the matter.  To my mind, a statement of that kind lent more colour to the situation, and made it worse than it was, because people were thinking all over the country that the thing was infinitely worse than it was, because Deputy McGrath stated that he had something to keep back.  Why I find fault with Deputy McGrath is that he made this statement that was responsible for the Dáil debating the matter for four or five days and holding up other business, and he did not follow it up and go before the Army Committee of Inquiry and say what he had to say then to clear up the situation that had been created.  I do not think that it comes well from him or his Party now to criticise the Executive because of that.  Deputy McGarry, another member of the National Group, comes along and asks what is the use of balancing your Budget for starving people.</P>

      <P>I say and I believe that this is not an honest amendment, and that the Government have not done anything more now than what they did when these men were members of the Government Party, and that the things they put forward against the Government were things that were done twelve months ago when they were members of the same Party.  As I said before, I believe the Government should be censured because of their lack of policy so far as the economic situation of this country is concerned, and their dealings with the unemployment problem. Deputy Hewat talks of doing certain things.  The Government gave a million and a quarter pounds last year in order to reconstruct the roads, and they stipulated that there should be a wage of 28s. per week paid to the men who worked under that grant.  I say here that it would be nearly as well for those people if they were unemployed, as to be trying to work on a wage of that kind, because it is a starvation wage, and a wage that the Executive Council should be ashamed to pay to its workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat says that more has been done for the unemployed in this country than in other countries.  Recently, I admit, the Government have tried to do a little, but they have not done enough yet.  I want to inform Deputy Hewat that, while people here have been without unemployment benefit for a long period, the &ldquo;gap&rdquo; system has been done away with in England and Northern Ireland, and those unemployed in these areas have been in receipt of benefit all the time.  As I said, I am not going to vote for this amendment.  I believe that the Government ought to be censured, but in its present form, and because of what I believe is the object of the amendment, I am not going to vote for it.</P>

      <P>But we have not had any speech from any of the supporters of the Executive Council in defence of the policy of the Executive Council.  We have had three speeches from the Ministers, but we have had no speeches from Deputies supporting the Government.  Very little attempt was made in the speeches of the Ministers to deal seriously with any criticism levelled against them.  In fact, there was rather an exhibition of flippancy and evasion on the part of Ministers. Their whole attitude was one which, I think, was not in the interests of the country.  Criticism with regard to their policy was answered by speeches which were more personal than dealing with matters of policy.  That is not calculated to inspire confidence in that large Party which is not in this Dáil, that if they do come in their criticism of the Government will be treated seriously and not in a flippant or personal manner. We have been asked by Ministers about an alternative policy.  It is legitimate to ask for a policy, but I think Ministers are flattering themselves by using the word &ldquo;alternative.&rdquo; Alternative to what?  What is their policy?  I did hope that during this discussion Ministers would have stated their policy, but that hope was doomed.  I suppose we shall have to wait indefinitely for such a statement. Some definite suggestions were put forward here with regard to the conduct of the Department of Finance&mdash;suggestions which have been described by Deputy Hewat as inevitably leading to bankruptcy.  I would like briefly to recall to Deputy Hewat the suggestions which, in his opinion, are to lead to bankruptcy.  These are the definite suggestions; that the finances of the country be put into the hands of financial experts and not permanent civil servants of the old regime; that the Estimates be simplified so that people could understand them; that the Budget be divided clearly into what is normal recurrent expenditure and what is extraordinary expenditure; that a Committee, such as the Geddes Committee, be set up to cut down the cost of the administration, and, at the same time to consider ways of escape from the evil effects of Article 10 of the <Col N="1441" /> Treaty; finally, as a result of these measures, to have a definite reduction in taxation.  These were the proposals that Deputy Hewat has decided will inevitably bring about bankruptcy in the country.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what statement Deputy Hewat refers as being contrary to that programme.  Ministers have asked for an alternative programme.  It is in their own hands to have their curiosity satisfied in that respect.  They can learn what the policy is very soon if only Ministers and their Party are willing to do their duty and are willing to move for the writs for the constituencies that are vacant.  The main objection we have&mdash;and I must say it has been agreed to by the Deputies who criticised the Government&mdash;is their complete lack of coherence, lack of a definite policy of any kind either in finance, economics or in military matters.  I have not time to deal with the various small points that were raised by Deputies, and with misquotations, particularly those of Deputy Gorey, who, if there was a championship for misquotations at the Olympic Games would win us one trophy in that event.  We have been criticised very severely by Deputies Corish, Hogan and Baxter because of sins when we were in the Government Party.  A <Col N="1442" /> somewhat similar accusation was made by, I think, the President or Vice-President, that we had only within the last four months discovered that their policy was wrong, particularly their financial policy, and that up to that time we had found nothing wrong with it.  I admit that these criticisms are somewhat justified from the point of view of members of the Farmers' Party and the Labour Party, but they are not justified from members of the Executive Council who attended meetings of the Government Party and who know that during the last year many members tried to persuade the Government to have a more forward and a more definite policy.  I do not think it is necessary to go into a large number of points that were raised.  Deputy Mulcahy stated his position very clearly, and I agree with it entirely except for his personal opinion of the capacity of Members of the National Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a small matter that I want to mention, which may seem a sort of anti-climax after discussing matters of high State policy. I want to raise a matter which may be better raised on this Vote than on any other departmental Vote, although it affects quite a number of departmental Votes.  It is in relation to boy messengers. It is the practice to accept boy messengers in the various departments at, I think, fourteen or fifteen years of age and what I want to ask the Ministry to take note of is the fact that in the Postal Telegraph Department provision is made for those boy messengers to have a sort of tuition to prepare them for occupying when they become adult or more adult, positions as sorters, postmen and the like.  But with regard to the other departments, so far as I know, no such provision is made, and the messengers are, in effect, in blind alley occupations.  I want to propose to the Ministry the desirability of taking into account seriously the position of these boys and to make similar arrangements for them.  These arrangements have been made by the Postal Department to give boys opportunities for tuition, improving their education, and generally preparing them for activities in their later life. I ask the Ministry not to give a conclusive answer to that now, as this is a matter of importance to 200 boys in the Ministerial service in one department or another, and in the course of time, when they become adults, they will be at a loose end.  I think it is our duty to enable them to prepare for their manhood, and we ought to give them opportunities for preparing for later life.  I ask the Ministry to take that matter into account seriously and to depute somebody to arrange a <Col N="1445" /> scheme to allow these boys to have proper training.</P>

      <P>My object in moving this amendment is to ensure that no creamery shall get the right to the national mark unless it is already making first class butter beyond dispute. I am a little afraid that under the Bill as it stands, without some such amendment as this, there would be a possibility, however slight, that some creameries might escape the very rigorous inspection and examination prescribed by the Bill, and that these creameries might send out butter which does not come up to the standard required for the national mark.  I think it is absolutely essential, if the mark is to be a success and if we want first grade butter upon the English market, that no butter should leave Ireland except butter bearing the national mark <Col N="1448" /> and beyond all question as to its quality.  The object of the amendment is to make sure that an examination will take place for a period not less than six months.  I changed this amendment from the examination of all butter because that would be almost physically impossible, and it would put a very heavy financial burden upon the State.  But I mean that no creamery shall escape examination, and it is better that the butter should be subject to examination for a period of six months before the creamery is entitled to the national mark.  I do not emphasise this beyond saying that we ought to take every possible precaution to ensure that no butter will get through the port bearing the national mark which is not of the quality required, and that no creamery shall get the national mark unless the ability of the creamery to produce the very best butter is beyond all dispute.</P>

      <P>I am going to support this amendment, but I do so with a certain amount of reservation.  It is so worded that &ldquo;a period of not less than six months&rdquo; examination might mean an examination at the beginning of one end of the period and that that would be sufficient to come within the terms of this amendment and to satisfy its requirements. Deputy Heffernan said that we should take every possible precaution to secure that no butter would be exported from the country bearing the national mark that was not up to the standard required and which the national mark represented. I think this amendment does not give us that which he said is desirable, namely, every possible precaution. The present amendment is more concise than the previous one in phrasing, but it lacks two conditions that the previous amendment, I think, would have fulfilled.  This amendment lacks the phrase &ldquo;examination at specified places,&rdquo; and it also leaves out the phrase &ldquo;of all the consignments.&rdquo; I am not going, at this stage of the Bill, to detain the Committee very long, but this question of examination at the ports and the objective attached to this amendment must raise undoubtedly one of the big controversies associated with the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel fairly satisfied that I will not <Col N="1449" /> be able to secure at this stage, or any other stage, that what I advocate will be accepted by the Minister, and I am not going at this point to waste my eloquence upon the desert air of recalcitrancy, but I give him warning that at a subsequent stage I will endeavour deliberately, and possibly exhaustively, to put on record an opinion which is expressly contrary to his.  There is bound to be in this matter of suggested examination more than appears upon the surface.  Occasional examination of the butter at the creameries will hardly meet the requirements of the situation.  Those acquainted with this particular industry know there is a period of the year when creameries cannot maintain either the supply or the quantity or, I think, the quality of their butter.  The point is this.  The national brand is to be given to certain creameries which are assumed to represent a certain standard of excellence of the commodity.  At certain periods of the year, varying in different districts, that quality will be likely to fall below the standard represented by the brand.  Is it proposed, then, to withdraw from these creameries at that particular period, if the standard is lower than required, the mark that has been accorded to them, and if so, how is it to be ascertained that the time has arrived to do that unless there is, I will not say an all-time examination, but at least a continuous examination in the periods immediately preceding the time when it is generally known that such depreciation of the quality operates?  I am not going to deal with this at present.  I will discuss that general aspect at a later stage, but I want to present these few points for the consideration of those interested in the fate of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Milroy is right in saying that there is controversy in regard to a very important issue arising out of this Bill, but I am sorry he does not appear to know what that issue is.  There is no controversy with regard to examination.  I am in favour of the most exhaustive examination. It was never suggested that there should not be whatever examination was adequate and whatever examination <Col N="1450" /> experience proved to be adequate. I do not think that any section in this dispute, and there are a great many, ever suggested that there should not be an exhaustive examination.</P>

      <P>There is always a difference in the wording between grading and examination.  These two words have been so mixed, misunderstood and misinterpreted during the course of the Bill that it is no harm to make them clear.  With regard to what Deputy Milroy stated, it is no harm to say definitely that as far as I know, no section has ever suggested that there should not be the most adequate examination before giving the guarantee of the national brand to a commodity which we sell in a foreign market.  We all want adequate examination. The issue is not between the people who want examination and the people who do not want examination, but it is between the people who want examination and the people who want, not examination but grading, which is a totally different thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Grading, of course, implies examination.  With regard to the amendment, Deputy Heffernan will agree, I think, that there is no difference between the amendment which I circulated and the amendment which he circulated, except this, that his amendment specified a period.  I got this amendment of mine carefully drafted, and it is even more specific than Deputy Heffernan's.  The only difference is that he inserts this period of six months while a definite period is not inserted in mine.  The amendment which I have circulated reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 32. &mdash;To insert before sub-section (3) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A licence for the use of the national mark shall not be granted to any person unless and until the Minister is satisfied by examination of consignments or packages taken from <Col N="1451" /> consignments of butter manufactured by such person and of the premises and machinery on and with which such butter was manufactured and by such other examination and inspection as the Minister shall think proper that such butter was, before the grant of the licence, habitually of the approved standard.</P>
    <P>There is really nothing between Deputy Heffernan's amendment and mine except this period of six months, and I suggest it would be much better not to prescribe a hard and fast period. Experience may prove that six months may be inadequate.  People may say that while we are gaining this experience we may allow butter to go out bearing the national brand that is not up to the standard.  Some butter will undoubtedly go out in spite of this Bill, but any little mistakes or accidents or evasions of the Act are not going to do us harm in our trade, which is an extremely big one.  All we can do is to take all the precautions possible.  There is no use in any section pretending that they know everything that is to be known about the butter trade.  Experience is going to show us all sorts of things.  It may possibly be that six months is not adequate, but it may be equally possible that six months will be quite adequate for some creameries, and again equally possible that it would be totally inadequate for others.  For some creameries that we could all name, three or four months might be adequate.  However, I can conceive it as being to the interests of everybody who wants to see this Bill administered smoothly, that we should not put certain creameries under anything like vexatious regulations.  I do not mind how vexatious the regulations may be, provided they are necessary. Whatever regulations are necessary must be complied with.  It may be that there would be certain creameries in respect of which it would not be wise, in the circumstances which may arise in connection with the administration of the Bill, to subject them to six months' examination.  For instance, Deputies will notice that in the amendment which I circulated I had originally the words &ldquo;during the prescribed period,&rdquo; but I have struck <Col N="1452" /> them out, and they do not appear in the amendment as I now submit it to the Dáil.  What occurred to me in connection with these words was this: if we had a prescribed period beforehand we would get applications, let us say when the Bill had passed, from a number of creameries for the national brand.  We would consider them and say: &ldquo;Very well, we will prescribe a period of six months' examination.&rdquo; Now, two months afterwards we may get further applications from far better creameries, creameries whose reputation is absolutely solid.  If we were to have in the words &ldquo;prescribed period,&rdquo; it would allow us to prescribe a period of three, four, six, or even twelve months, and I am just pointing out how that would work out in practice. You get applications and you prescribe a six months' period.</P>
    <P>Later you get other applications, and you know that these come from creameries of a far better standard than the ones you had previously dealt with. From a previous examination of them you could feel fairly satisfied that a five months' period would be adequate for these creameries in order to earn the national brand, but you could not prescribe five months in that case; you would have to prescribe the six months the same as in the others.  I think it would be much better to leave some elasticity in this.  I would ask Deputies to remember this, that no matter what you put into the Bill about examination you cannot make it absolutely water-tight.  You must depend, not only on the time over which the examination takes place, but on the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the examination, and no matter what time you put in you will still be at the mercy of the Department so far as the quality and efficiency of the examinations are concerned.  Making all this pother about the period is just stopping one gap and leaving another wide open which you cannot stop.  I have considered this matter fairly carefully, and these are my reasons for preferring the amendment I have circulated now and which I commend to the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister's statement rather weakens <Col N="1453" /> the case of his amendment as it reads to the ordinary person.  He has explained, in fact, why he deleted the words &ldquo;during the prescribed period,&rdquo; and he has given a reason which, I suggest, is a reason for, at least, prescribing a period, although he adduces it as a reason why no period should be prescribed.  He states quite definitely that there are a number of creameries which are well known, and that no period need be applied to such creameries because they are well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain that it is not the carrying out of the actual examination for an adequate period that I was referring to, but to prescribing beforehand by regulations published that we gave so much examination to this creamery and so much to that.  My point was that it would be right, perhaps, to give nine months examination to one creamery, perhaps twelve months to another set of creameries, to give six months to another, and perhaps less than six months to another.  If we were to do that, I would prefer to do it administratively and not by regulation prescribed beforehand.  It is not the examination, but having to issue a notice to the effect that such and such creameries are getting such and such a period that I am objecting to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I am able to follow the Minister in this matter.  I assume that the purpose of Deputy Heffernan's amendment was that before any national mark would be allowed to be used by a creamery, conditions should be prescribed, one of which would be that over a given time the product of that creamery would be subject to certain tests, and it would be as a result of these tests being satisfactory that the national mark would be allowed to be used.  Now the Minister suggests that, because it is a matter of common knowledge and because the reputation of a particular establishment is high, those tests need not be applied so far as the habitual or frequent testing of the product over any period is concerned.  There, I think, is the danger of not having a minimum period fixed for every creamery.  The <Col N="1454" /> danger is that you will be charged with having applied more vigorous tests to one creamery than to another, with having allowed certain creameries to use the national mark before any considerable number of creameries are allowed to use it, and to make what use they may of that mark, in advance of the others, and perhaps get a preference in the market, because of the earlier use of the mark, before their rivals.  I suggest that it is a matter of urgent consideration.  Because we know the reputation of certain creameries to-day is not sufficient.  All creameries should be put on a level mark after this Bill is passed.  There should be consistent equality of testing by the examiners over a period, however long or short, and the minimum period should be applied, at any rate, to every applicant for the use of the national mark.  It would be unwise to say that a creamery which everyone knows has a good reputation should be granted the use of the mark on its face, as they say in the theatre world, because it is generally known that it has a good reputation.  I say that that would be inadvisable, and it would be wiser to avoid risk of jealousies that might ensue by, at least, prescribing a minimum period of test, before any creamery would be allowed to use the national mark.  You may say three, six or twelve months, and after that some creameries cannot get it because you are not satisfied.  I do not quarrel with that, but if you say that three, four or six months shall be the limit, and there shall be frequent and regular examination. I am not saying that every consignment should be examined, but examination should be so frequent and regular as to mean an adequate test of consistency and equality over a period to be named, and every applicant for the mark ought to be obliged to undergo that rigorous test and it should be over a minimum period in respect of every creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister's explanation of what is in his mind rather weakens the case for the amendment which he is putting forward.  I was inclined to think that it did cover the requirements, but, after his argument, I am afraid that it does not, and it ought to be strengthened by perhaps the retention <Col N="1455" /> of the words he has deleted, as they indicate that there shall be a prescribed period.  I do not think that the amendment of Deputy Heffernan is precise enough.  It is too loosely worded, but the intention is clear.  I would not insist on a period of six months.  I do not know what the period ought to be.  All I desire is that there should be a period fixed, and that no brand should be allowed to be used unless creameries applying for the use of the brand have all undergone a similar test, no matter what their past reputation may have been.</P>

      <P>Both Deputy Johnson and I want adequate examination.  We are both agreed that adequate examination depends not only on the time over which it takes place, but also on the efficiency, exhaustiveness, and quality of the examination.  We also agree that it would be a bad thing to do anything, or be forced by the Bill to do anything, making regulations which would cause jealousy between creameries. We had intended, and we contemplated that the amendment which I have inserted would compel the Department of Agriculture to make exhaustive examination, and to make it over an adequate period, but the words, &ldquo;during the prescribed period,&rdquo; were deleted, so that before making the examination we would not have to publish a definite period.  We would, of course, be forced to make up our own minds as to what the period should be.</P>

      <P>Six months may be too long.  Therefore, what would happen is the Bill would be in operation for a <Col N="1456" /> year.  We are not only examining creameries and butter for the purposes of the national brand but for the general purposes of the Bill.  Say that examination has been going on over a year.  It might be extremely awkward to be forced to examine for six months as from the date of the application. It might be gratuitous and there is no doubt you can conceive circumstances in which that examination would be absolutely gratuitous.  What do you mean by inserting it here, because you must trust the Department, when all goes to all for the efficiency of the examination. If you are prepared to trust them for the efficiency of the examination why bind them to a specific period by putting in &ldquo;not less than&rdquo;? There may be trouble about this brand. It may not be given for three or four years except to a minority for obvious reasons.  In the future there would be all this exhaustive examination for the other purposes of the Bill.  You can imagine the other negotiations that would be going on in the meantime. We would get applications suddenly for the national brand.  It might be gratuitous in certain cases to have an examination for not less than six months.  I put that to the Deputies, and if it is really considered that not less than six months is the safest thing I am prepared to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I have whittled down this amendment to the very utmost.  I started at the beginning with the idea that all butter should be examined at the port. I have no sympathy with the idea of grading.  I think the use of the word has caused needless trouble.  I do not see any useful purpose that can be served by grading.  I do not think Irish butter would be benefited by grading, but I have all along seen that a good purpose could be served by examination at the ports.  I have had an amendment down to the effect that all butter should be examined at the ports. I have withdrawn that amendment owing to the financial obstacle which I have seen.  With reference to the present examination which the Minister will cause to take place under the Bill as it stands if the Minister will satisfy me that it is not necessary to make that <Col N="1457" /> examination mandatory I will not stand for it, but if I thought it were possible that some butter would get through, bearing the national mark that would not be worthy of the national mark I think it would be necessary to have an examination at the port.  I may take the word of the Minister that he will be able to have an official examination of butter without an examination at the ports, but the great obstacle of that system is that it would mean the establishment of large sheds for cold storage and also the having of a bacteriological laboratory at the ports.  That would involve great expenditure.  There is one point of view I want to call to the Minister's attention.  It is this: that all creameries which apply for this mark will be capable of making the best possible butter, and it is possible that a creamery with a slack manager or staff might temporarily key themselves up to make a good quality butter for a short time, say for two to four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we can make an order that the examination would go on from two to three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you have the power, but I would like to see that you will be forced to carry out that examination. I think that a creamery which stands the examination for six months is not likely to turn out any butter of an inferior quality.  Like Deputy Johnson, I am not convinced by the argument of one being a good creamery and the other not so good.  I would prefer the Minister to start with the assumption that all creameries are the same.  It is possible that some of the official knowledge may be biassed. They may have a bad name they do not deserve.  If you start with the assumption that they are all equal, then, at the end of a certain period, if the Minister is satisfied, he can grant those the national mark, which fulfil his conditions. The Minister can extend a period of two years even if this amendment is accepted, but he cannot have it for a lesser period than six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing under Section 11 of the Bill we were conducting <Col N="1458" /> examinations for two or three years and that we had been administratively concentrating on certain creameries in the year 1927 for about five months, giving a more adequate examination even than Deputy Heffernan suggests when two, three or four apply for the national brand.  We have then in an elastic kind of way to go on for six months examining.  This is the point, and in that way without having any preconceived ideas of creameries we have to start the creameries all level. I have no preconceived ideas about creameries, and there are none in the Ministry for Agriculture.  It is up to the people examining not to gather preconceived ideas but to get information as they go along.  In the future, when we are examining under Section 11, perhaps we might get applications for the brand, and we might perhaps have no particular reason to continue it for six months more from that date. If Deputies like, I will insert this &ldquo;such butter shall for a period of not less than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; how many months?</P>

If it is possible through examination to determine that a certain number of creameries are eligible for and have the right to use the national brand, and that they can be given the right to use the brand after a period of two or three months, I question whether it is wise.</P>

      <P>The point may be fairly well met, but I would like to have words inserted to the effect that it is a period after the application.  I do not mind what the period may be. I realise there shall be examination of creameries before the national mark begins to operate.  Nothing can be done in that respect until new legislation has been passed regarding trade marks.  There must be a period during which examinations will take place. The Minister, in his last argument, rather tended to the view that there was no value in the national mark, that the examinations that we were trying to prescribe would be going on even though people did not look for the national mark, and that therefore there was no need for this special examination. I think Deputies on the Farmers' benches have endeavoured to contend that the national mark is intended to give a special character to the quality of butter for sale&mdash;that it shall be taken as a certificate of quality and equipment and that it has undergone a test which is not the same test as is applied to ordinary butter.  Therefore it is requisite, I think, that there should be a test applied after the application. It may be that only 25 per cent. will apply, but what is to distinguish the applicants from those other creameries which do not apply for the use of the national mark?  There is only one thing, so far as I can read the Bill, which will distinguish them, and that is, that there has been an habitual test for a period after application. Otherwise, the case the Minister has made does apply to all butter establishments. They are all to be subject to inspection.  The value of the national <Col N="1460" /> mark is decreased unless there is a special test applied to the butter of those applicants.  I would urge the Minister to think of the necessity that this period should be subsequent to the application for the use of the mark.</P>

      <P>I think the point the Minister has raised is very important, but I really think he is quite in agreement with what Deputies are looking for.  The examination may be before the creameries apply.  But if the examination be a minimum period of three months from the date of application, it may have to be extended in many cases. There are many creameries where the standard of butter produced is of sufficient merit to warrant the giving of the national brand at once.  There are other creameries in which more than three months will be required, because there may be more inspections required in their case than in the case of creameries whose character for the flavour and quality of their butter is known to all the inspectors.  I think it would be very well if there was a minimum time after their application for the national brand before the Minister granted it. Where it is found necessary that period will have to be extended to give an opportunity for further inspection of the butter turned out.</P>

      <P>You have ruled what was a better one out of order, in-as much as the intention of the amendment that I had on the paper was to make it an offence liable to a penalty for any person to supply any dirty milk to any other person in the ordinary <Col N="1463" /> course of trade.  I regret that this Bill will not make it a penal offence to offer dirty milk to a consumer.  This amendment proposes to make it an offence to offer dirty milk to a creamery whatever that creamery may do with the milk afterwards; and that is some of the purpose accomplished. Therefore, I am glad to support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we come to amendment 49, I would ask the leave of the House to insert the following amendment which I circulated to some of the Deputies:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 36, sub-section (2), line 55, to delete the words &ldquo;or uses in&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;in or sale from or who uses in or sells from.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which is down in my name&mdash;amend-ment No. 49&mdash;should be considered before the amendment which the Minister now refers to.  My amendment is:&mdash;&ldquo;In Section 36 (1), page 21, line 53, to delete the words `for sale.&rdquo;'  The sub-section as it stands reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Any person who tenders or supplies any dirty, contaminated, or stale milk or cream, or milk or cream which is contained in a dirty vessel, to a creamery or cream separating station, or any place where milk or cream is used for the manufacture of any dairy produce for sale, shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo; My desire is to delete these words &ldquo;for sale.&rdquo;  And the intention is to make it an offence for any person to tender dirty milk to a place where milk or cream is used for the manufacture of dairy produce&mdash;in this case butter&mdash;for use in that place.  I had in mind an institution, perhaps even a hotel but I am thinking more of institutions which have their own creameries, possibly of schools which may have creamery establishments and which ought to be subject to the same rigorous examination as those other creameries which are making butter for sale in the market. I think that the inhabitants of schools or institutions ought to be protected in the same way as the public who purchase butter in the market. And I think the deletion of the words <Col N="1464" />&ldquo;for sale&rdquo; will accomplish that.  It may require some consequential amendments, but it is desirable that any creamery or any establishment which manufactures cream into dairy produce for consumption by other people than the manufacturers, should be liable to the penalty for dealing with dirty milk.  And I make a point which is a possible one that an institution, even perhaps a creamery, which wanted to avoid the consequences of this section might even exchange, might barter its butter for agricultural machinery, and say that there has been no sale.  I say that it is a possible means of evasion of the consequences of the receipt and make up of dirty milk.  And I should like the Dáil to express itself on this question and say whether they are prepared to allow dirty milk to be tendered for manufacture into butter which is not to be sold but is to be used in an hospital or an institution, or perhaps exchanged for other commodities which might not be for sale.  I suggest that it is just as important that butter which is produced and used by any body of people should be subject to the same examination, and that it should be an offence just as great whether the article is sold in the ordinary markets or handed for consumption to people who may live in a hoted or in an institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows my position in this matter.  If that amendment is accepted the Section would read: &ldquo;Any person who tenders or supplies any dirty, contaminated or stale milk or cream, or milk or cream which is contained in a dirty vessel, to a creamery or cream separating station, or any place where milk or cream is used for the manufacture of any dairy produce, shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  That would bring in every farmer in the country.  My first objection to it is that we could not administer such a provision without taking over the public health functions and officials of the Ministry of Local Government. I just want to point out in answer to Deputy Johnson's question as to how Deputies stand on the question as to whether a creamery should be entitled to supply butter made from dirty milk to an hospital, that any person <Col N="1465" /> who supplies dirty milk to a creamery is liable to a penalty for that offence.  That is as far as we could meet him.  I have here the regulations made under the Dairies and Cow Sheds Orders.  They run into seven pages. They are the most stringent regulations I have ever read.  I do not propose to read them to the Dáil.  But they contain very heavy penalties for supplying dirty or contaminated milk to anybody, to any person or institution, and I agree that they should be administered&mdash;every single one of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a Bill to control the sale of milk.  As the Chairman pointed out ten minutes ago, it is a Bill to control and regulate the sale of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Minister would read the regulations in and under that Act more thoroughly he would see that it might apply to the conditions under which milk is produced, and if they were rigorously applied there would be no need for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  These regulations also apply to the producer, and if they were more rigorously applied there would not be the same number of officers needed under this Bill, for we would have only to inspect the milk after it left the producer and went to the creamery.  These regulations are here, and are the law.  While there is no doubt whatever that this question of contaminated and impure milk is a scandal, accepting Deputy Johnson's point of view would mean that the Ministry of Agriculture would have to take over the public health functions of the Ministry of Local Government, and if we were really to administer them as they should be administered we would have to double our officials.  I went as far as we could in this direction. As the Bill stands, any creamery or any institution in a register which re-sells whole milk which is dirty or contaminated is liable to penalties under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must <Col N="1466" /> read his sub-section again: &ldquo;Any person who tenders or supplies any dirty, contaminated, or stale milk or cream which is contained in a dirty vessel to a creamery or cream-separating station&rdquo; is liable to a penalty, &ldquo;or who supplies it to any place where milk or cream is used for the manufacture of any dairy produce for sale.&rdquo;  If the dirty milk is tendered to a place which manufactures dairy produce not for sale, but for consumption in that place by a considerable number of people, there is no offence.  The farmhouse that the Minister speaks of is not covered at all by this section.  There are very few farmhouses receiving milk from other persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it goes some distance, but the Minister should not have used his argument about the difficulty of examination and inspection if he wants to say that this proposed amendment would cover my case, because I suggest that it is a fault to limit this section to a place which churns milk into butter, or other kind of dairy produce, solely for sale.  If the Minister will not accept it I will not persist but I think it is limiting the good effects of the Bill.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Johnson wishes can be achieved by enforcing the Act governing the control of dairies and cowsheds.  Certainly, if that were enforced a good deal of his wishes would be met.  It would be well if the Minister could afford to meet his wishes in this matter.  He refers to colleges, hospitals, convents and asylums, where farmers send milk in large quantities for the use of the people in those institutions, and there is a possibility of there being no examination of this milk.  There is no possibility of examination in each individual farmhouse, and there is the possibility of impure milk going into these institutions. I think there is a good deal in Deputy Johnson's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment brings quite clearly before the minds of Deputies what is intended, and I would press with a little more insistence than I did on the last occasion, that this should be accepted. It cannot be contended that it is going to affect the ordinary farmer who consumes the butter at home.  It is to make it an offence to supply dirty milk for consumption by the inmates of an hospital, etc.  I say as definitely as I can that we ought not to allow it to be possible for dirty milk to be turned into butter for the inmates of <Col N="1468" /> hospitals, schools, or institutions of that kind, when we are trying to protect the general public who are in a better position to discriminate, because in certain districts, in the cities at any rate, the people would taste the butter before they buy it.  In the hospitals schools, etc., they must take it whether they like it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister considered the points raised in regard to the undesirability of limiting <Col N="1471" /> the period to three years?  The effect of the general working of the Bill may be so to improve the conditions in certain areas that he will be justified in extending the licence to use the term &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; beyond that period.  That is to say, that the conditions in the farmhouses will be so improved that the general character of the milk and cream that comes out of these houses will be such as would justify the continuation and even the development of that system.</P>
      <P>I think it is a pity to confine the licence to a period of three years.  I think the Minister should look forward to the probability that within a time&mdash;perhaps not three years, or perhaps longer&mdash;there will be a steady and a vast improvement in the conditions under which milk is produced on the farms.  If that improvement takes place I suggest that it is quite within reason that the system of home separation should be encouraged and that the cream gathered at the farmhouses could then be utilised for buttermaking in a place to be called a creamery, or to which the name &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; might be attached.  That, of course, requires that there should be rigid inspection of the general conditions under which milk is produced on the farm and the conditions under which milk is kept, as well as the surroundings.  The very fact that that is the condition will lead to acceleration in the improvement that we all contemplate through the action of this Bill.  I feel that the Minister is trying up this matter too closely by limiting the operation of the new sub-section to a period of three years. I would prefer if he took power to extend that period on conditions which he would consider it necessary to impose regarding cleanliness and good conduct, in respect of dairying at farmhouses supplying such a creamery.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Johnson in this matter. I think the effect of having it three years will be that there will be no possible encouragement along these lines.  The Minister, I think, will not weaken the position of his Ministry by taking away the term &ldquo;three years.&rdquo; He will retain the power to grant <Col N="1472" /> the use of the word &ldquo;creamery,&rdquo; and meantime any institution of this kind which might develop will know that if their work is done as it ought to be they can obtain the use of the word &ldquo;creamery,&rdquo; which will be of considerable advantage to them.  As this stands, with three years in it, it means that no development along these lines will be encouraged.  I am inclined to think that development should be encouraged in certain districts which cannot support an ordinary creamery.  The next best thing for them is a creamery of this type, and in my opinion butter can be manufactured there better than it can be manufactured on a farm.  I think we should encourage this system where a regular creamery cannot carry on.  At the same time the Minister has power to prohibit manufacture where he thinks a useful service is not being performed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a misunderstanding here.  The limitation of the time is not intended to discourage development.  What it means, and what it is intended to secure, is that the term &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo; shall be a definition of a certain article made in a certain way and on particular premises. This period is put in owing to the existence of one or two premises or enterprises which do not exactly come within the meaning of the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; but which have hitherto been able to use the term &ldquo;creamery butter,&rdquo; and to whom, at the moment, it will be a severe hardship and handicap in business if deprived abruptly of the use of that term.  I take it, it is to safeguard them.  The development of the industry which those enterprises represent, is not necessarily bound up with the use of the term &ldquo;creamery butter.&rdquo; But the use of the term &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo; for those particular two or three enterprises is bound up with their immediate stability.  Given another classification, which I believe the Minister is making provision for, there is every possibility for that particular development.  Personally I think it desirable, where a creamery as such cannot materialise, to give a definite classification, which defines the nature of the product, and differentiates it from something not the same as itself. <Col N="1473" /> There is nothing in the limitation of time that will prevent such encouragement or development.  I will support the Minister in not acceding to the request to extend this period.</P>

      <P>This is an extremely difficult question.  I agree with Deputy Heffernan that we are doing nothing to encourage these cream-gathering creameries to be formed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps to some extent, but you could encourage them at too great a price.  I decided, on thinking it over, that any encouragement you can give could only be on the lines that Deputy Johnson suggests, namely, taking power at the moment to allow them to use the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo;<i>ad infinitum</i> if the particular institutions in question deserve it.  If you did that, the developments might be the exact opposite to what you think.  I agree with Deputy Heffernan that the spread of the dairy industry depends, to some extent, on the development of this sort of cream-gathering creamery.  We will know better later on when the dairy industry is in a better and a healthier position, when growth is more obvious, and when the signs of the times are more obvious, as they will be, when the Bill develops the dairying industry in the country. It appears that is one of the possible ways that the dairying industry can develop and can supplant the other methods of farming in which less national wealth is produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is power taken in this Bill by regulation to allow such cream-gathering places as these to produce creamery butter, an undefined power, because after all we are arguing the principle of the question, and there is no half-way house. You have unlimited power and power for three years.  If you take that power what will happen?  Take the case of Macamore.  We may have one of those cream-gathering creameries collecting 50 per cent. milk and 50 per cent. cream, and making butter of that.  Is it not quite possible seeing that some of the existing creameries have a legal right to use the term &ldquo;creamery&rdquo;<Col N="1474" />&mdash;I am assuming we have by regulation the power to give the right for ever&mdash; and seeing we have that right given in the case of an institution like Macamore, that the best system is to bring the whole milk to the creamery? There is less likelihood of contaminating the butter.  You at least reduce the possible sources of the contamination by separating the milk at the creamery.  It is admitted that that is the best system, and that is the way and the method by which you are most likely to produce high-grade butter. Still we are collecting ninety per cent. &mdash;ninety-five per cent., if you like&mdash;of our milk and we are collecting five per cent. of cream.  That is the thin end of the wedge.  Surely we should have all the advantages that you are giving to another institution which is only collecting fifty per cent. milk and fifty per cent. cream.</P>
    <P>To my mind by encouraging the growth of these cream-gathering creameries you will be much more likely to encourage not the growth of new cream-gathering creameries, but to encourage the substitution of the present orthodox creameries by cream-gathering creameries.  It seems to me there is real danger of that and weighing one thing with another I thought the best thing to do was to try to deal with the immediate hardships that would be caused by passing the Bill without some such amendment as this, to the existing cream-gathering institutions and if, after 20 or 30 years there are only two or three of them it does not look, at the moment, as if there was a tremendous possibility for the case.  I suggest there would be a better possibility of judging that in three years when the whole dairying industry will be healthier.  The people will be thinking more of future development of the industry and whoever is considering the question will be in a better position to judge what sort of future developments should be encouraged. I would not like to put into the Bill something which by encouraging this would be encouraging something which we all agree might be far from desirable and as Deputy Heffernan remarked, &ldquo;The Dáil is here always.&rdquo;  We are not in the position when four Creamery Bills were introduced <Col N="1475" /> in the British Parliament and crowded out for want of time.  The Dáil will be sitting constantly and it will not be difficult to raise a question and get it decided by legislation, but I do submit that it is a little too serious and too great a responsibility for the Department to have to decide a question such as this is&mdash;whether they should make such a regulation and give an opportunity to probably healthy developments but, possibly, most unhealthy developments.  There are the reasons that appeal to me for leaving the Bill as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that my opinions in this matter are largely determined by the view of the social effect rather than the immediate industrial or commercial value.  I know that there is a great deal to be said for the Minister's point of view, but I have thought that the course of development might be a little bit away from the over-centralised factory which certainly, in the view of a great many well experienced and careful observers has helped to deteriorate the home life, the craftsmanship of the farmer and his family and generally, to deprive the people in the dairying districts of some of the advantages which the possession of a cow, or a number of cows, gave to that family in the way of milk food.  It is, unfortunately, too often stated&mdash;and I am sure it is stated with truth in many cases&mdash;that the desire to turn a few gallons of milk into money means the deprivation of the family of the farmer and the people in the neighbourhood who are not farmers, of supplies of milk which should be plentiful.  I am trying to some extent to obviate that, and I think if the home churning method under strict regulations were encouraged, or ever is encouraged and developed, it will mean a steady improvement in the character of the farm buildings and the appliances used in the surroundings of the dairy, meaning that part of the farm which is used for the storing and the care of the milk and the milk products. Another consideration which weighs with me is the fact that in so many creameries and surrounding so many creameries there is such great waste of time in the supplying of milk to the <Col N="1476" /> creameries as distinct from the supplying of cream to the creameries.  You have all seen lines and lines of carts waiting for the separated milk and the waste of time for so many dozens of boys, or men or women hanging about the creameries for hours in the morning is considerable.</P>
      <P>That is a sheer waste of a great number of people, and it does not tend to the best conduct of the industry of farming by the young growing boy, as he too often is.  It certainly has been very useful as a means of gathering together people at the creameries for agitation, but on the whole I think it would be better if we could avoid the waste of that kind of transportation from the farm to the creamery, and that is a factor that ought to be considered in relation to this question. I do not wish to press my point of view in view of what the Minister said, but I still feel that there ought to be a realisation of the desirability of encouraging this home-separating under good conditions rather than sending the whole milk to the factory for separation, and then returning the separated milk to the farm.</P>

      <P>There are only one or two points that I would like to call the Minister's attention to.  The Minister says that we will know better later on, that is we will know what the future developments will be in the creamery business.  I would point out to him that the development in regard to this particular form of creamery business is exactly what he will not know, because there will be no development, and in the absence of developments he cannot know what the benefits would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this amendment will prevent them developing along any lines, and that they will not be established at all.  That is my point.  Might I point out to the Minister that he has power to prevent any wrong development.  He retains the power in his Department, and there <Col N="1477" /> can be no developments which his Department does not authorise.  I think that gives the Minister quite sufficient power to prevent any developments which are not desirable.  Another thing I would point out to the Minister is that it is rather dangerous for the Government to take any power to prevent any natural development of industry. Perhaps it is a little bit extreme to say that it is rather better to give industry a chance to develop along natural lines.  If the Government had interfered with industry in the past we would still be carrying on with handlooms. There is one other point which has been omitted altogether with regard to the development along these lines, and that is with regard to the separated milk that would be retained at home by the farmers. It is very well known that freshly separated milk is very much better for stock-rearing than the milk that comes from the creamery.  There are many people who still continue the old system of hand separators, although they are living quite close to a creamery, simply because they say that they cannot rear calves on separated milk from the creamery, and in that way they have the freshly separated milk for their calves.  On that account I think this is a desirable development where it can be encouraged.  I say that the Minister and his Department directly discourage it here; at least they should give them the chance of establishing themselves and carrying on if they so desire.  I am not sure that they will, but I hope they will.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister has met the views of the Committee in this matter.  We pressed very strongly on him at the time the advisability of considering these cream-gathering stations where it was impossible in certain counties and in certain areas to work at a profit.  I think the views of the Committee have been met.  We can quite understand putting this three years' limit on.  It stands to reason that if you make it less it would not be so satisfactory.  The points that have been raised by Deputy Heffernan were discussed at length in the Committee, and there is not very much to be gained by going into them again.  But this <Col N="1478" /> would be giving an opportunity to those people to develop the milk industry in their areas.  If by any particular cause they had not the possibility of being able to get their milk through a creamery and if they had these cream-gathering stations they could have separators, and even in those cream-gathering stations there could be a certain amount of milk separated.  In other words, it is a step forward in the industry which would possibly help us to a sufficient supply of butter in this country to meet home consumption and the outside markets.  We are very backward in that way on account of all that we have to import, both in butter and cheese, and I think that the Minister has met the views of the Committee and we ought to be very well satisfied.</P>

      <P>(1)  The Minister may, after consultation with such bodies and persons as he may consider most representative of the several interests concerned establish by order a consultative council for giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with any matter referred to them by the Minister in relation to the making of regulations under, or otherwise carrying into execution of, the provisions of this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>This certainly will not be an agreed amendment as it stands. I am anxious to state my objections to it as briefly as I can in order to ascertain what attitude the Minister takes towards my objections.  If I am not able to compress my remarks into a short space of time it is because of the multitude of defects in this clause.  In the first place I object to the term &ldquo;Consultative Council&rdquo; in the first sub-section of the new section.  It would seem to be deliberately worded in order to make the Council something different from an advisory council and for this reason the sub-section says: &ldquo;The Minister may after consultation with such bodies and persons as he may consider most representative of the several interests concerned establish by order a consultative council for giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with any matter referred to them by the Minister.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In connection with any matter referred to them by the Minister.&rdquo;&mdash;that may not be the intention of those who drafted the clause but I suggest that first that term should be changed from &ldquo;consultative council&rdquo; to &ldquo;advisory council&rdquo; and second, that at the conclusion of that sub-section &ldquo;in relation to the making of regulations under or otherwise carrying into execution of the provision of this Act&rdquo; the words should be added <Col N="1482" />&ldquo;or any matter which such council deem it necessary to bring under the notice or consideration of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I mean by that is that the initiation of discussion shall not arise merely from such matters as the Minister may desire to put before the council as is the case in this sub-section as drafted, but that the members of the council themselves will be empowered to initiate discussion upon matters other than those which the Minister may bring forward and I suggest also that you change &ldquo;consultative&rdquo; where-ever it occurs to &ldquo;advisory.&rdquo;  It may not mean, on an exhaustive examination, the difference that I apprehend but still I would like the suggestion to be weighed before being summarily dismissed.  Further, at the beginning of this sub-section the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; occurs.  Why leave it optional?  If there is any use in the council why not make it mandatory for the Minister to call that council.  I want to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  Then under sub-section (2) the term &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; comes in.  I am not going to press for the substitution of any other word for it, but it might be well if the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; was used instead, so that we should have some indication other than that given here upon what ground the nominations are to be based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are they to be based upon the nomination of persons put forward by the different industries or is this council to be a hand-picked council by the Minister through officials of his Department? I think that is an important consideration for the industry.  Then we come to sub-section (3): &ldquo;The said consultative council shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister.&rdquo;  I suggest that is inadequate.  We have got to be very impersonal when considering these things.  The Minister in charge when a Bill is passing through this House, will pass away some time, let us hope it is a long time away yet. But his term of office will terminate some time, and, as I say, I hope in the present Minister's case it will be a very long time, seeing he is not an Executive Minister.  We have to construe these Bills or Acts in an impersonal <Col N="1483" /> way, and when we read that the Consultative Council shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister, it means that it will be summoned by the Minister when he is advised by his officials that they deem it wise that the summonses should be issued.  I think that is not sufficient, because there you have the germ or symptom of bureaucracy in a department, and if there is outside opinion such as a council that may interfere with the operations of that species of officialdom, that council will not be called together more frequently than officialdom can possibly help.</P>
    <P>I suggest it would possibly be an advantage to have &ldquo;advisory council&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;consultative council,&rdquo; that it &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;may,&rdquo; be summoned by the Minister, and so I would propose to add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;or upon a requisition to the Minister signed by not less than one-fourth of the total number of the members of the council.&rdquo;  I suggest that addition so that they can, of their own volition, if there are matters affecting the industry which they deem it necessary to meet in Council about, under the provisions of this Act, be able to come together and give the Minister advice upon the matter concerned.  I suggest also that the council should have power to elect its own chairman and its own honorary secretary, in order to secure that it can meet of its own volition, and when the members of the industry deem it necessary, that the machinery of the council itself will not be manned by departmental officials.  I make no reflection upon those officials, but I think that it is essential under a measure so comprehensive as this, with such sweeping and drastic powers, that there should be a sort of safety valve.  The establishment of this council is, to my mind, one of the most vital provisions in this Bill, and it is upon the nature of the council as the Bill emerges from Committee Stage that will depend whether or not I shall acquiesce in this Bill or oppose its passage in its final stages.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware or not that there is in Australia a Dairy Council drawn from each of the different States of the Commonwealth, <Col N="1484" /> which is elected by the industry itself.  It elects its own officials, and it meets whenever it chooses, and it is a very important factor in the organisation of the industry there. These are the points I wish to suggest: to amend this section so that it will be a really effective factor in the development of the industry, and not a mere sham to cover up what may be the reluctance of our departmental officials to allow the industry concerned to have some effective say on its organisation.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the suggestions made by Deputy Milroy, chiefly because he has used exactly the same arguments as were used by me on the Second Reading of the Local Government Bill.  The Minister for Local Government in that Bill had a clause in which he asked for the appointment of Consultative Councils, and I pointed out that it would be very much better to have an Advisory Board or an initiative Board so that it could give him advice on matters, and initiate these matters itself.  I also claim that it would be very advisable that the class of people who are going to act on this Advisory Board should be stated in the Bill, and with Deputy Milroy I think it is most advisable that it should be put into this Bill that this Advisory Board or Council can meet, and not that the Minister may call them together whenever he likes, because it has been pointed out in another connection of a similar sort that the Minister did not like or care to call together these Consultative Councils, and that, therefore, he never got their advice in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on this matter in support of the contention of Deputy Milroy.  At the select committee there was a new section proposed giving in detail Deputy Milroy's views as to what that council should be, and I think it was unfortunate that he should have overweighted it with certain details of its functions which were embodied in the clause, and which were based on the assumption that other proposals which he had attempted to get passed had been agreed to.  Consequently it was not possible for me to support the proposal of Deputy Milroy in the form in which it <Col N="1485" /> was submitted.  Deputy Heffernan made a proposal of a similar kind, which the Minister accepted in principle, and this amendment which Deputy Duggan has put forward is the Minister's conception of what was desired by the committee.  I do not think, however, that it fulfils the requirements at all.  It practically means simply that the Minister may call into being a council to consult with him whenever he wishes, on any points that he wishes, and that may mean whenever he wishes.  If it does meet with his wishes he may pay the expenses.</P>
      <P>I want to urge upon the Dáil that a much more authoritative body than that is called for.  The Bill, as has been pointed out, does give to the Minister very drastic powers.  He has power to inspect and make regulations touching every point in the butter-making industry from the beginning to the end almost.  I think it is necessary that there should be such powers in somebody else's hands who can wield them with authority.  Then we are faced with the question whether he should be a bureaucrat with advisors appointed by himself and responsible only to himself and not subject to any check of any kind, or whether he should be an authority in touch with and responsible to a considerable extent to the organised bodies within the industry. This raises a matter which has been very much discussed in recent years.  I am glad that Deputy Sir James Craig has supported the views of Deputy Milroy.  He is especially entitled to do so.  We have to-day agreed to the First Reading of a Bill connected with the medical profession, and Deputy Sir James Craig can point to the fact that the vocational council which administers the affairs of the medical profession has done that administration with fairly general approval.</P>

      <P>I am speaking very conservatively because I want to conciliate the Minister.  The idea that is behind the Medical Council is the same idea in effect that is behind Deputy <Col N="1486" /> Milroy's proposition, that is to say that the authority administering and controlling this industry is an authority which is responsive to the people engaged in the industry, that is subject to their criticism and is in close touch with all the various phases of the industry. It may be quite rightly said that the experts who gather together under the aegis of the Minister himself are all very worthy gentlemen and women, quite capable of doing this work satisfactorily but to whose satisfaction?  To the satisfaction of the Minister.  It is he who appoints and he who may dismiss.  He is solely responsible to the Dáil.  On the advice of those experts whom he gathers around him, and who are his sole servants, he may do all these things to this industry and run the risk of alienating those concerned.  But he can instead arrange to have, in a general way at any rate, the approval, at least, of the authoritative spokesman for the industry in the making of regulations and in the fixing of conditions.  Much that is said about the bureaucrat&mdash;I will concede it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce; whatever I say to the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;is not deserved. It is undoubtedly true that the more you impose conditions upon a large body of people scattered through the country, engaged in a particular industry, conditions devised by officials appointed by the Minister, the more you are likely to bring difficulties in the way of the proper administration of the scheme that is in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that in this case it would be very good progress to make if all the various organised interests which are bound up with this industry were approached and were allowed at least to nominate, if not to appoint, representatives on this Council and that they were given responsibility for the proper administration and the proper ordering of the industry under this Act. I am sure that the Minister himself would find the work very much easier and very much more sure of success. He would then be sure of carrying along with him a great bulk of the people affected.  Some of those persons appointed on the Council might well be the advisers upon whom he has to rely <Col N="1487" /> at present, but they would be assisted by those directly nominated by the institutions which are at present working the industry in a sort of semi-organised way.  I believe that the Minister ought to be the head of that council.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister should be responsible in the final analysis for everything done by the Council, and he would have even power to reject the advice of that council.  I am not asking that he should hand over his responsibility to that council, but that he should, while acting as president, give the council responsibility and very considerable powers.  I think it would be a mistake for him to issue regulations such as those contemplated, without having the sanction of the majority of any such council as is set up.  I believe that the council should be set up and be generally representative, and I think it would be desirable to insert in any provisions regarding such council a provision that the regulations which are to be set up should have the sanction of the majority of that council. By that means I think he would be able to rely much more surely than he would otherwise upon the general good working and administration of the Act. This is a matter of great importance, and I would call attention again, if I may, in this Committee as I did in the last Committee, to the recommendations of the old Dáil Commission of Inquiry when it went into some detail regarding the administration of the dairy industry and advocated the establishment of such Dairy Council.  It was proposed that it should have even wider powers than those now suggested. That idea was well received and was, I think, popular in the industry and in the country.</P>
    <P>In the Constitution we have contemplated the setting up of Vocational Councils.  Here is an opportunity to make a beginning tentatively, and to put into operation one of the ideas respecting the establishment of vocational councils.  The Minister is Minister for Lands and Agriculture, as I said in the earlier Committee.  The dairying industry is a very considerable part of the service which he has to administer. How is it going to be administered? <Col N="1488" /> By the Minister advised by experts?  Is it better that he should be advised by experts whom he has appointed himself, or that he should be advised by experts appointed by the people to be administered, the people who are running the industry?  I believe that the Minister would find that he could run this scheme under the Act very much more smoothly if he would set up a council such as is suggested by Deputy Milroy, rather than the anaemic advisory council which he proposes in his own amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, I think, started off by telling us that he was more or less going to support the contention of Deputy Milroy. I wonder has he done so.  I think he has gone a great deal further than Deputy Milroy suggested in the way of amendment.  There is this to be said about Deputy Milroy's amendment, that it left the advisory council still an advisory council with the sole responsibility with the Minister.  I am not by any means sure that if some of Deputy Johnson's suggestions were adopted the sole responsibility would be with the Minister.  You will then have a great deal more than a consultative or advisory council.  So far as the sittings of the Special Committee were concerned, so far as I remember, all the Minister pledged himself was to consider the setting up of an advisory council. We ought to be very slow in setting up anything beyond an advisory council which would really deprive the Minister of a certain amount of authority and responsibility. If you put them to a certain extent over the Minister&mdash;and I think that is the trend of some of Deputy Johnson's suggestions&mdash;you would have a body that would hamper him in his authority.  If the Minister is called upon to answer to the Dáil he could, to a certain extent, take protection under such council.  I object to anything that interferes with the full authority of the Minister and with his full responsibility to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has anticipated some things which I would wish to have said.  I will not attempt to define the council by name, because I believe it would define its own <Col N="1489" /> name in the course of time.  The reasons given were admirable.  They were, however, all on one side and in one direction.  I am not opposing the proposal, but I am suggesting that we should go into a proposal of this kind with a very full realisation of what it may come to mean.  The more a council of that kind is on a representative basis, and the more complete its functions are, the more certain it is to come in the course of time to displace the Minister.  That has been the universal history of every institution of the kind.</P>
      <P>This particular Parliamentary assembly in which we are assembled to-day grew out of councils originally which had no authority, but which were merely advisory, and which ultimately became sovereign.  In a case of that kind my belief is that you may start on a plan&mdash;whether it is good or bad is not apparent to me, but I want to point out the possible results of it&mdash;something like the vocational councils in the Constitution with councils for each separate industry growing up in the country.  It sounds well to say that the right people to make regulations for an industry are the people who represent that industry.  I have heard on other occasions the social aspect of these things insisted on, and the fact that every industry is not a concern for itself alone but a concern for the entire public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just point those things out as a possible contingency which might ripen very rapidly.  If you take a certain action with regard to one industry, there is nothing more natural than that it should be followed up with regard to other industries, and so on until we have a network of those councils, and the more representative they are, and the more complete their organisation is, the more they will tend to displace ministerial functions.  That may be an admirable thing, but there it is, and I should like to point out that view of the thing.  I am speaking now myself as a Deputy simply.  Before Deputies commit themselves to any final judgment on that, they should carefully consider it on both sides, and because the proposal seems to have a great deal of reason on its side, they ought not to refuse <Col N="1490" /> to examine, if possible, ultimate developments.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to follow the general argument of the Minister for Education or that of Deputy Johnson to any extent.  I am not prepared at this stage to give my entire support to vocational councils, but I am rather inclined to agree with the definite proposals that are suggested by Deputy Milroy and I am altogether in sympathy with them.  As far as those proposals are put forward by him they reflect my thoughts with regard to that amendment.  The amendment as it stands says that the Minister may, after consultation with such bodies establish a council.  For my part I am not prepared to accept the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  As this amendment stands, the Minister need not appoint this council at all.  I would say this matter is probably the most important detail in the whole Bill, and I would remind the Minister that he is taking extraordinarily drastic powers in this Bill over an industry, greater powers than were ever taken in this country over any industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of these powers and of the danger of very strong bureaucratic power I think the Minister would be very well advised to make this council a real council which will have a definite influence on the industry and on the trend of the Minister's ideas with regard to the industry.  I understood Deputy Johnson to say that the Minister could always have the final word in the matter, that is, that the council should not control the Minister.  Why, then, should a Minister be afraid of the Council?  As it stands, at present, it has no powers at all.  It might be a worthless thing.  If this Bill were passed with the amendment as it stands, it would meet with a great deal of opposition, and it would not please the industry at all.  Still more important, a great many creameries would enter into this business of getting the national mark with an antagonistic mind towards the industry, and if they do they will hamper the working of the Bill.  We must get the goodwill of all people who are in the industry.  I know the changing of the <Col N="1491" /> word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would mean that the remainder of the amendment should be changed also, but that could easily be carried out by the Ministerial draftsman.  I will vote against the section unless it is mandatory that the council should be appointed.  Also I think it should be mandatory that the council shall be called together not at the Minister's desire, say once a year, but frequently at specified times or on the advice of certain members of the council.  Any number you select depends on the number of the council.  I would also suggest that the members of the council should be selected individually by the organised industries themselves, that is, that they should select a panel of experts from whom the Minister would, himself, select his council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support, briefly, the arguments advanced by Deputy Milroy and Deputy Heffernan on this matter.  We are all in agreement that the Minister is anxious to make the measure as satisfactory as it is likely to be to all concerned. There is no amendment that would be advanced to any section of the Bill that will do more to make the measure unsatisfactory to the different interests than this amendment will.  I have no doubt the Minister recognises that himself.  I cannot agree at the moment that, even if it were desirable, Deputy Johnson's point of view could be successfully carried into effect, that is the establishment of Vocational Councils to deal with the dairying industry. It seems to me that we have in the dairying industry, small as it may be, so many conflicting interests, that when we establish that Vocational Council it would be anything but satisfactory, if it had not really the powers the Vocational Council should have.  It is only likely from that point of view to be carried into effect presently.  If we are not to have such a Council, I think it is advisable that the Minister should have somebody very representative of the industry, as it is, to advise him in the regulations to be made, and the steps to be taken to carry those regulations into effect.  The Minister will have wisdom enough to get individuals <Col N="1492" /> representing the different interests, but it seems to me the Minister should make it definite in a measure that he is going to take steps to establish such an Advisory Council.  I think he ought to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  That will make it definite. After that he should also enact in the measure that it is law that this Council will not only be in existence as an Advisory Council to advise under regulations, but will, as Deputy Milroy points out, also have the right to point out to the Minister and to decide that certain matters in the main industry demand consideration, and that they should have the right to meet to consider those matters.</P>
      <P>Now two or three points like that can be accepted by the Minister, and they will make all the difference in the world between the satisfactory administration of this measure and making the measure what may be but a very incomplete effort towards the end that we hope to attain.  I think the Minister can very readily accept the suggestions made by Deputy Milroy, and it will not take from him any of the power that he has under the Bill.  It will, on the other hand, make the interests concerned and the interests that will be affected by the measure have confidence that in the making and carrying into effect of the regulations they will have a voice.  If they are not in a position to make that voice heard in the administration of the measure there will be dissatisfaction which will make that measure not at all what the Minister hopes to make it.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular amendment has been very carefully and very closely debated.  I may say at once that I put forward the amendment as it stands, contemplating that it would need a certain amount of improvement. I have listened to the debate very carefully, and I may say that I find myself more closely in agreement with Deputy Johnson than I usually find myself in other subjects.  Deputy Johnson made it quite clear that he is in agreement as to the obvious necessity for the Minister who is responsible to the Dáil having the last word in this matter. That is one big safeguard at least, and <Col N="1493" /> a necessary safeguard in view of the considerations which were put forward by the Minister for Education.  With regard to the particular question which Deputy Johnson and Deputy Baxter raised, referring to the method of selection, I think that while both Deputies agree that the members of the council should be selected from the interests concerned, neither of them specified, at this stage, the exact method of procedure in selecting them.  If it were said that all the interests concerned were to elect the members of this council I would be unable to agree.  That is to say, that if the interests concerned, whoever they may be, were to elect&mdash; each of them its quota&mdash;certain members of this council, I would be unable to agree.  It may be that later on an elective council of that sort would do efficiently the advisory work that this council is supposed to do.  But whatever may be the abstract advantages of election as a method of constituting this council, the practical difficulties at the moment are overwhelming for the reasons Deputy Baxter pointed out. Nobody who understands the currents and cross-currents will say, I think, that the election by interests of two or three men who would go definitely on to the council would give us a council that would be satisfactory at present. If the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; is left there, and if we defer consideration of procedure for the constitution of the council until after the Bill is passed&mdash;until there is leisure to consider whether it might not be possible to accept Deputy Heffernan's idea that certain interests might be asked to select five or six representatives, one or two of which would be put up to represent each interest&mdash;well, that method would be matter for consideration afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This council is to be an advisory council.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that the council to be really useful must feel that it is doing really useful work and is under the necessity of accepting certain responsibilities.  I think that the right way to deal with that council would be, to devolve responsibility where it could be devolved.  But I must say that there is not much sign in the near future that the functions of the council will be much more than the very important function of giving <Col N="1494" /> advice.  These functions of advising the Minister I regard as functions of first class importance.  I have such a keen sense of their importance that I would be absolutely unwilling to tie myself now to any method of selection which might involve getting a second rate council later on.  I have no intention, if a council is being set up at all, to just set up a council as so much camouflage. If a council is set up, its advice is to be sought, and its advice is to get the fullest consideration, and its advice is to be acted on, if after the fullest consideration it is found to be sound.  For that reason I do not want to insert anything in this particular amendment which would force me to a certain method of selection which might on consideration prove to be a wrong method, and which afterwards we might be unable to change.  I say that, for the reason which I have just given.  I am satisfied with the safeguards contained in the words &ldquo;consultative council.&rdquo;  I tried to explain what I meant by the consultative council. It has the same meaning as &ldquo;advisory.&rdquo; The safeguards contained in the method of selection&mdash;the freedom of the Minister to select, in consultation with the interests concerned, and to select as far as possible with the goodwill of the interests concerned, by perhaps the method Deputy Heffernan suggested, but always with an eye to getting first class men&mdash;these two safeguards are sufficient to meet the very serious considerations that the Minister for Education urged.  The logical conclusion, of course, of setting up such a council which would have administrative functions is an Industrial Parliament.  The time may come when we possibly will have an Industrial Parliament sitting side by side with the existing Parliament, but that time is not yet.  So far as this council is concerned I want to see on it the best men representing every interest in the trade.</P>

      <P>I want them to give their advice freely, and I am willing to accept an amendment in this form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister shall, after consultation with such bodies and persons as he may consider most representative of the several interests concerned establish by order a Consultative Council for giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with any matter in relation to the making of regulations under or otherwise carrying into execution of the provisions of this Act, or any other matter affecting the dairying industry;</P>
      <P>(2)  The said Consultative Council shall consist of such persons as the Minister after such consultation as aforesaid shall from time to time nominate to be members thereof, each of whom shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership for two years only from the date of his nomination but shall be eligible for re-nomination;</P>
      <P>(3)  The said Consultative Council shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister, and also on such other occasions as the council may from time to time determine.</P>
      <P>The rest of the amendment will stand.</P>
      <P>There is just one point outstanding and that is the suggestion that the council should nominate its own officials.  The council, if it meets, has a right, I suppose, to appoint honorary officials, as Deputy Milroy suggested, but the Executive officer of that council should be a Civil Servant.  The secretary of such an Advisory Council who would do the work should be a Civil Servant in any normal country and that is what shall be done.  There is no question whatever of an extra secretary being appointed and being paid by such a body.  That would be out of the question.  The secretary of that council would do clerical work and nothing more, and he would be, in the ordinary way, a suitable Civil Servant picked from the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>The explanation of that is: It would be an extraordinary thing, to start with, to bind ourselves to one halfpenny under all circumstances, when we would be exporting four million pounds worth of butter or eight million pounds worth &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I rise to a point of order?  We are now on the point of 10.30 p.m., and the Minister will probably not desire to have this question brought forward at this stage.  I understand that he desires to postpone the further discussion of the Bill.  If these amendments are not moved the Bill may then be printed in its new form for consideration before it goes for Report, and the Minister will still have the power to move his present amendment.  It will not come before us again this week, and we shall have before us the new Bill, for a new Bill it will be in effect with all these new amendments, before we enter into the Report Stage.  It is necessary that we should have the Bill in its new form before we go any further with it.  I do not think anything would be lost by allowing it to go out of this Committee now.</P>

      <P>I submit it would be very unwise to refer the Bill now to Committee for Report, unless we are going back to Committee again, for we would be precluded from examining the Bill in the light of these new amendments.  I submit we will have to read the Bill carefully, for many of these amendments that have been put in are really reported ones, and this is really the Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister will not lose anything by adopting the suggestion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a number of large water tanks at the destroyed Hutments, Belmont, Cobh, were recently sold by the Military Authorities; whether he can state the number of such tanks sold, and whether they were sold by open tender; and if he is aware that the Cobh Urban District Council had been in communication with the authorities for the past twelve months endeavouring to purchase one of these tanks, and were prepared to pay any reasonable sum in order to secure same, and if he can state why the Urban Council was not consulted before the recent sale took place.</P>

      <P>Two water tanks only have been sold recently at Belmont Hutments. The sale was by competitive tender, due for acceptance by noon on the 18th ultimo, and was duly advertised in the Dublin and Cork daily papers on the 5th, 6th and 7th idem. Only one communication can be traced as having been addressed to the military authorities.  It is dated the 21st June, and was, therefore, late in connection with the sale referred to.</P>
      <P>There still remain at Belmont Hutments one large and five small water tanks for disposal at a later date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Mrs. M. Thornhill, Commercial Hotel, The Square, Kildorrery, has made repeated applications to the Military Authorities for the sum of £32 5s., amount due her for food, etc., supplied to military while stationed in that district; and if he will now issue instructions to have this account disbursed at an early date.</P>

      <P>No application from Mrs. Thornhill for £32 5s. has been received at Headquarters. Her accounts are regarded as having been cleared by payments amounting to £88 19s. 6d. already made to her.  She is, however, being requested to give particulars in respect of the amount alleged to be due.</P>
