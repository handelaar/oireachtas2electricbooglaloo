      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any machinery has been set up to deal with claims of persons whose motor cars were seized by British Military in 1920-21 where such claims have been rejected by the Shaw Commission as not coming within their jurisdiction, and, if so, what procedure should be adopted by such persons; and if he will state whether a claim which was lodged with the Shaw Commission within the twelve months period and subsequently, rejected will be accepted by the British authorities after the period of twelve months has expired?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will define what steps claimants for old age pensions are to take who have been unable to procure baptismal certificates, as the sworn affidavits of responsible people have in several cases recently been treated as insufficient evidence of age?</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy Seamus MacCosgair in answer to his question of the 23rd November last on this subject.  I shall hand him a copy of it.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out therein that when the baptismal certificate of a claimant was not available, affidavits from persons of standing were accepted as alternative proof.  The affidavits should, however, give in detail the grounds for opinions expressed and statements made therein, and should set forth relevant facts bearing on the life history of the claimant, such as date of marriage of his parents, and his own position amongst the children, especially as compared with a brother or sister whose age has been established.</P>
      <P>An affidavit in which the deponent merely states that in his opinion the claimant is 70 years old is not of much assistance towards establishing age, and that fact should be impressed on claimants.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. J. McGrath)</NameTxt>
      <P>When Christopher McCormack, of Sallins, made his claim, Unemployment Insurance Benefit could not be allowed, because, since no contributions had been paid for him in the last preceding Insurance Year, he was disqualified by Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  He had not filled up the necessary form for claiming contributions under Section 7 of the Act of 1923 in respect of his Army Service in accordance with the usual procedure before demobilisation.  It was necessary to get the claimant to fill this form at Newbridge Local Office and to have it certified by the Ministry of Defence. Some delay necessarily occurred in carrying out this procedure, but benefit has already been authorised, and Mr. McCormack will be paid on to-morrow, which is the usual pay day for applicants living in the country.  I have no funds at my disposal out of which payment of any expenses incurred by persons attending at Local Offices to claim Unemployment Benefit could be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we go into the Orders of the Day, I regret having to interpose upon the business of the Dáil with a personal explanation. Yesterday, when your deputy was in the Chair, I made a reference to an earlier proceeding in the Dáil in regard to Section 8 of the Ministers and Secretaries Bill.  I stated that on a certain evening it had been said by the President that the further business of that Bill would not be taken, and that in spite of that, that business was taken the following day.  I stated that I had not got the records actually before me, but that I had turned them up and the facts were as I said, and I added that I believed those facts were in the recollection of the Dáil.  The Minister for Home Affairs interposed and challenged me to produce those facts from the records of the Dáil.  I thought it rather regrettable that that <Col N="290" /> should have been done, because it left an implication that I made a statement I did not believe, or check, or confirm as an accurate statement.  This challenge having been made, it is necessary for me to say now that I have the records here, and the statement to which I referred, made by the President, was as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;It is only fair that the Dáil should realise what the position is.  Apart from pressing Bills I do not see how we could get very much further with the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, and I would not mind tying up that to give greater time for this discussion, that is, if Deputy Johnson wishes to have the matter decided before the adjournment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the following day, in spite of that pledge, Section 8 was taken.  This was the 13th December, and the statement is to be found in column 1829. The President said: &ldquo;I said a few words last evening with regard to the business we proposed to deal with. Apparently I must have overlooked the fact that we were mid-way through a Section of the Ministers and Secretaries Bill.  I would ask the indulgence of the Dáil to take up that section and dispose of it, and then get on with the other business.  I do not think it will take very long, but it would be more satisfactory to have the section dealt with than leaving it open for consideration at the next sitting.  It would depend altogether upon the indulgence given by the Dáil.  I addressed myself on the point last evening to Deputy Johnson, and I had no intention of misleading him. If he has no objection, and if the Dáil is agreeable, I think we might get along with that section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And then Deputy Johnson said: &ldquo;I see the point the President has made and I have no objection to following the course he suggests.  I am just reminded, however, that perhaps we should rather deal with the amendments of the section, leaving the final decision on the section until Deputies who have shown their interest in it are here.  It occurs to me that possibly Deputies are not here who are interested in this section because of the understanding that this matter would not be dealt with until later.  As there <Col N="291" /> are no amendments down we might deal with the amendments on the Paper and leave the final decision on the Section over, unless in the meantime Deputies concerned arrive.&rdquo;  The President then said: &ldquo;The Deputy who is absent, who had an interest in this matter, and who had an amendment down, is Deputy Figgis.  It is quite possible that he might return before we reach that stage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Home Affairs threw a doubt on my word yesterday.  It was necessary for me to substantiate what I said.  I have substantiated it.</P>

    <Title>QUESTION OF RULINGS.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter which, I think, calls for some consideration, and it arises out of the discussion which took place yesterday and two rulings that were given from the Chair.  I am not now asking you to alter your ruling in any way, and I am not challenging your ruling with any view of affecting the proceedings on the Bill which was passed in the Dáil yesterday.  I want to draw attention to the circumstances under which those rulings were given.  The first case deals with the requirements of Standing Order 123, which says: &ldquo;In cases of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended for the day's sitting, on motion, duly made and seconded, with or without notice: Provided that such motion has the support of a majority of the Teachtaí of the Dáil who are qualified to vote.&rdquo; You ruled that a decision which was taken by a majority of those members present was a decision of the Dáil in accordance with that Standing Order. I am asking you and the Dáil to refer to the discussion which took place when that Standing Order was passed by the Dáil on the 8th March, 1923. The Standing Order was introduced by a Committee which sat on this matter, and the form of the Standing Order as introduced was as follows: &ldquo;Provided that such motion has the <Col N="292" /> support of a majority of the whole Teachtaí of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  The Ceann Comhairle said in explanation: &ldquo;I think 81 (c) would benefit by the deletion of the word `whole.'  It seems absurd.  `The whole Teachtaí' is a peculiar phrase.  I would suggest that you put down `the total number of Teachtaí.'&rdquo;  Professor Magennis intervened and said &ldquo;present and voting; otherwise it might mean the total number altogether.&rdquo;  An Ceann Comhairle then said &ldquo;That is what is meant.&rdquo;  Professor Magennis said: &ldquo;Present and voting.&rdquo;  Mr. Blythe: &ldquo;No, it means members of the Dáil who have taken the oath.&rdquo;  The Ceann Comhairle replied: &ldquo;The Committee understood those were the members of the Dáil.&rdquo;  Mr. Fitzgibbon, who was in charge of this motion, said: &ldquo;The object of this proposal is that it should not be open for a chance majority at the commencement of a sitting to suspend the Standing Orders, and that these Standing Orders, which have been passed by all of us, should not be done away with, except the majority of the whole body were in favour of suspending them for the time being.&rdquo;  Mr. Blythe then said: &ldquo;We could say `members of the Dáil who have taken their seats.' &rdquo;  An Ceann Comhairle replied: &ldquo;It is proposed to amend this Order in this way&mdash;from the word `provided' read `that such motion has the support of a majority of the total number of Teachtaí who have taken their seats.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>Professor Magennis and other speakers, including Mr. Hughes, who was a member of the Committee, go on to confirm that, and it is quite clear from that discussion that the intention of the Dáil at the time was the intention of the Section, as I urged yesterday, that it was a majority of those who had qualified themselves to vote by taking their seats, having taken the oath.  That is point number one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to draw attention to the other point which touches on the Constitutional provision.  The Minister for Home Affairs quoted Article 22 of the Constitution, which says: &ldquo;All matters in each House shall, save as otherwise provided by this Constitution, be determined by a majority of the votes of the <Col N="293" /> members present other than the Chairman or presiding member, who shall have and exercise a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes.&rdquo;  That is as far as the Minister for Home Affairs read this article, and I am asking the Dáil to note the proviso, &ldquo;save as otherwise provided by this Constitution.&rdquo; Following the quotations, which I have repeated, there comes this sentence: &ldquo;The number of members necessary to constitute a meeting of either House for the exercise of its powers shall be determined by its Standing Orders.&rdquo;  Thus the same article, which declares that the matters were to be determined by a majority of the members present, also says that the proceedings of the House are to be ruled according to Standing Orders decided by a majority of the House.  I submit, therefore, that the ruling that has been given should not stand as a precedent for this reason, that if a majority of the Dáil at any time is empowered to abolish, for the time being, its Standing Orders, it may abolish even the quorum, and any four or five members of the Dáil who may be got together can put into the Chair a Chairman who may be complacent, and they may pass any resolution of a financial character, or any Bill to the extent that the Dáil can carry it, imposing or removing taxation. Such a chance majority can do anything if you have no Standing Orders. I, therefore, submit that it is impossible for any minority in the Dáil to remain in that position under Standing Orders if the decisions of yesterday are to be taken as the law of the Dáil, that is, as a precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I might intervene for a moment before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle expresses any opinion or gives any judgment on this matter.  I would say, first of all, that Deputy Johnson has dealt with this matter in what will be accepted generally as a very fair exposition of the general procedure carried on here since we first met.  Apart from the Constitution and the Standing Orders, I think it will be admitted generally that there has been no attempt at sharp practice in the Dáil, and that every party in it and every member of it, no matter how <Col N="294" /> small or how large the party, was considered, and that there was due and fair consideration given, not only to the business, but to every detail of the business as it came before the Dáil.  Before going along to deal with the question the Deputy put to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would say this: that I think there has been general agreement that the suspension of Standing Orders is a drastic measure, that it ought to be possible to suspend Standing Orders in certain cases, and that it ought to be possible also to do whatever is necessary to suspend Standing Orders, and at the same time to keep within the Constitution.  I do not accept the Deputy's interpretation exactly of the second part of the 22nd Article of the Constitution.  I would say that I find it impossible to read into the latter part of Article 22 any other construction than one; that is, that if this Standing Order were correct, if it were to stand, it would be necessary, in order to suspend Standing Orders, to have the quorum fixed at the full number of members qualified to vote.  I think we can admit on all sides that that would be a physical impossibility.  A single member objecting to the suspension of Standing Orders might walk out.  If there were 100 members qualified to vote there might be 99 members in favour of a suspension of Standing Orders, and one member, in order to prevent Standing Orders being suspended, could walk out of the House and prevent it.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the argumentative side of the question. If the 53, that is a majority of the persons qualified to vote, be fixed as the number necessary to act within the Constitution, you must, to carry out the first part of the article, have a House and have a quorum fixed with the number of those qualified to vote.  I think I have made it clear now.  We agreed upon this, that Standing Orders ought not to be suspended on a mere snatch-vote, that some protection should be afforded to the House in the matter of suspension.  I would undertake that there will not be moved by <Col N="295" /> the Government any motion to suspend Standing Orders, except by consent, until we have had the matter dealt with either by the Committee on Standing Orders or the Committee on Procedure.</P>
      <P>If that will meet the Deputy's point and get over this difficulty just now, when we come to solve it I am sure our minds will move in the same direction. While we do not wish to prevent the suspension of Standing Orders, we are all agreed that the suspension of Standing Orders is an extraordinary measure and ought to be safeguarded in such a way that it could not be done by a mere snatch vote.</P>

      <P>May I just raise one point with regard to that? I did not know the matter was coming up to-day, and I am now speaking from my recollection, as I have not had an opportunity to turn to the Debates when this matter was raised once before.  It will be within the recollection of Deputy Johnson, the President and yourself, that this suspension was sought on a previous occasion&mdash;if I remember rightly, about the third week of July last.  On that occasion the Ceann Comhairle, who was in the Chair, found when the question was raised that the exact majority of all Deputies entitled to vote had been obtained.  If my recollection serves me correctly, he said that on those grounds he allowed the motion to pass.  If that is a correct recollection, and I think I have it fairly correctly, then surely that is the standing precedent: that a majority of all Deputies entitled to vote is required; the first precedent and the standing precedent; a precedent of greater value, with all deference to yourself, Sir, because of priority in time, to the precedent you established yesterday.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that we cannot very well leave this matter as it stands.  I do not think the President contests that in the least.  The apparent inconsistency between Article 22 of the Constitution and Standing Order 123 must be resolved, or else the position of whoever occupies your Chair will be an impossible one.  I can only move <Col N="296" /> by the general consent of the Dáil, but if I am in order I would like to move:</P>
      <P>That the procedure to be adopted under Standing Order 123 be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and that the Committee be instructed to report to the Dáil before February 1st.</P>
      <P>I have named a comparatively late date for two reasons: (1) That a number of members on the Committee on Procedure are also members of the Committee on Wireless Broadcasting&mdash; at least four of them.  (2) That it would be very desirable in this matter to have the assistance and the advice of the Ceann Comhairle, and I gather he will not be fit for work before next week.  If I am in order in moving this motion, I do not know if the Dáil will give me leave to move it, but I think it would be desirable to have it definitely placed on the Order Paper.  In the meantime the President's undertaking will operate.</P>

      <P>About an hour ago Deputy Johnson very kindly sent me a note saying that he was going to raise this matter after questions.  I agree with him that it is very important that no precedent should be established except on definite and defined lines.  I based my ruling yesterday, not on Standing Order 123, but on Article 22 of the Constitution. Unfortunately I was not here when a question, not of the same nature, but of a somewhat similar kind, came up here in March last.  I intend to bring this whole question under the notice of the Ceann Comhairle and find out from him what his suggestions about the matter are.  As Deputy Cooper said, it would be far easier for An Ceann Comhairle to give a decision if he had clearly defined rules to go by. I shall see the Ceann Comhairle at the earliest possible moment and bring this whole question before him.</P>

      <P>Before you put that I would like to ask if Deputy Cooper would agree to leave the resolution over for the return of An Ceann Comhairle.  I endeavoured to get into touch with him to-day, but was unable to do so.  I intended to consult with him on the matter and see whether the Committee on Privileges or the Standing Orders Committee would be the better Committee to discuss the matter. If the Deputy were agreeable I may say that there will be no unnecessary delay, immediately on An Ceann Comhairle's return, in dealing with it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Debate resumed on following motion moved by Mr. Milroy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government in considering the fiscal problem should have regard not merely to the admittedly restricted view of the matter taken by the Fiscal Inquiry Committee as indicated in their final Report, but should examine the problem in the broadest possible aspect&mdash;due regard being taken of all the factors affecting the general well-being of the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned last evening I was coming to the close of my detailed criticism of the Report of the Fiscal Commission. It will be within the recollection of the Dáil that I had listed the main objections of the Committee to a policy of protective tariffs under seven heads. I dealt with six, and I think I have disposed of the contention of that Committee, that tariffs do not lead to expansion of industry and increase of employment; that they increased the cost of living, wages, and prices, and that they were useless as a preventative against dumping, and would hurt Irish agriculture.  These were the contentions that I had taken up, challenged, and I think refuted.  I was coming to the last of my counts in my indictment against this Committee when the Dáil adjourned.  The last item was the contention of the Committee in paragraph 109.  In that paragraph they advanced as an argument against protective tariffs &ldquo;that such things are difficult and highly technical in their construction, requiring expert and costly assistance, constant supervision, frequent alteration, and periodical adjustment.&rdquo;  If that argument means anything it means that protective tariffs involve some trouble to the State.  I am not denying that.  There are many other things in life besides tariff policies that are troublesome.  Going to Mass or to Church on Sundays is troublesome, going to work every morning is troublesome, training for a University degree is troublesome, and even preparing a criticism of this tariff Report has been somewhat troublesome to me. I suppose even the preparation of the Report itself&mdash;the time and labour of <Col N="299" /> the Committee&mdash;would constitute a rather difficult and highly technical operation, but still the members of that Committee thought the labour and the time involved were worth while. I am not sure that many of us would agree with that particular sentiment.</P>
      <P>Almost every country in the world has found it necessary to set up protective tariffs.  That proves, I think, at least, that if there are difficulties in the matter, those difficulties are not insurmountable&mdash;in fact, it is doubtful if these difficulties are at all considerable, because I find that in the case of many very small nations whose population and system of government are not reputed to be very enlightened there are, in these countries, highly specialised tariff systems.  I give as an instance the Republic of Guatemala, in Central America, which has a protective tariff containing as many as 2,505 items.  Presumably the contention of the Committee in this respect is that in An Saorstát we have not the capacity to deal with this matter equal to the natives of Guatemala.</P>

      <P>What about Liberia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave Liberia to be dealt with by the Deputy who alluded to it, when he rises to speak.  I think I have quite sufficient on my hands. The Committee made great play with the fact that manufacturers who had been before it were not unanimous as to the extent of the protection they wanted.  The underlying implication of that is this, that a uniform tariff policy ought in any event to suffice for all industries, and that manufacturers ought to be in a position to tell what rate the tariff should be.  That is a gross misrepresentation of the real position.  Generally speaking, in all Protectionist countries foodstuffs and raw materials are admitted free, or at very low rates, expressed in terms of <i>ad valorem</i> duties.  As the degree of manufacture to which the article has to be subjected increases the tariff rate on that article is also increased.  To illustrate the principle which I am trying to explain, I will <Col N="300" /> quote the following examples from the tariff of the United States regarding the duties on flax and its manufactured derivatives, which is fully typical of tariff methods in other countries and illustrates the principle I am explaining: &ldquo;Flax and manufactures of: flax straw, 2 dollars per ton, that is, one-eleventh of a cent per pound; flax hackled, 2 cents per lb.; flax single yarns not finer than twelve lea, 10 cents per lb.; yarns finer than twelve lea and not finer than sixty lea, 10 cents per lb., and half of one cent per lb. additional for each lea or part of lea in excess of twelve; yarns finer than sixty lea, 35 cents per lb., and, in addition thereto, on any of the foregoing yarns when baled, two cents per lb.; when bleached, dyed or otherwise treated, 5 cents per lb.  The duties on woven fabrics and articles of clothing are still higher and are mostly <i>ad valorem</i>, ranging from 10 per cent. to 55 per cent., according to the nature of the fabric, the higher duty being imposed upon the finer and more finished goods.  Thus it will be seen that the object of the protective tariff in this instance is to discourage the importation of goods in the manufacture of which any considerable amount of foreign labour and foreign capital has been employed.  On the other hand the raw material, which is susceptible of taking on a considerable amount of additional value through manufacturing process after importation, is admitted almost free, and, indeed, in most protected countries there is no import duty whatever upon raw materials.  It is important to meet another contention of the Committee, that what is the finished article in one department of one industry or one enterprise, is the raw material of another.  In this instance the flax straw was the raw material of the yarn, the yarn was the raw material of the woven fabric, and the woven fabric the raw material of the article of clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction of a tariff to meet the circumstances of the case has presented no special difficulty to the United States, nor in parallel cases, to the Governments of other countries.  Yet here is what the Committee has to say on this most important point.  In paragraph <Col N="301" /> 10 it states: &ldquo;It is clear where one industry feels it is justified in claiming a tariff of 40 per cent., while another thinks its interests adequately protected by one of 5 per cent., it will be extremely difficult either to select one industry for a higher measure of protection than another or to fix upon a general tariff of a reasonable and adequate amount.&rdquo;  I regard that statement, coupled with the statements in paragraph 11 upon this same subject, as a deliberately-conceived and mischievous attempt to mislead the Government and the people in regard to the theoretical and technical principles upon which protective tariffs are constructed.  As regards the objections raised by the Committee as a reason for declining to adopt a tariff policy in An Saorstát that such arrangements necessitated frequent revision, my comment on that is this, I have here the Board of Trade Journal of December 27th last, and in that I find a list published of the revision of Customs and Tariffs recently carried out or pending in different countries.  The list contains the names of 32 foreign countries and six British Empire countries, and I suppose they are also foreign, which have carried out recently, or are carrying out, such revisions.  The inference is perfectly obvious that these revisions constitute part of the normal duties of the administrative machinery of Government, and present no special difficulty whatever.  Amongst the countries listed as carrying out such revisions, I find the names Colombia, Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru and China.  Is our administrative capacity so far below the capacity of the people of these countries that what they can achieve presents in the minds of our high professors of political economy an unsurmountable barrier to the adoption of the policy which, from other points of view, has substantial arguments in its favour?  Such are the lengths of contemptible innuendo to which Cobdenite propaganda can go.  Now, this Report elevates the consumer into a sort of demi-god, with special claims and rights, and places him in a different category altogether from the producer. One would imagine from this Report that the consumer was a thing <Col N="302" /> apart.  The idea that the consumer, the producer and the citizen could be one, and the same person is utterly repugnant to the logic and philosophy of our Tariff Committee.  Assuming for the moment the validity of an argument, already disproved, that a protective tariff increases the cost of living, and, therefore, increases to the consumer the cost of the articles he needs, and, further, that such an increase is undesirable, it would follow, one would naturally think, that anything that would lower the price of the article to the individual consumer would conduce to the general wellbeing of the nation.  Let us see if it does.  Suppose Messrs. Bass and Co. were able to produce a beverage that appeals so strongly to the British and Irish consumers, and that it was sold so much cheaper than Guinness's stout that it drives the latter off the market, the result would be an immense expansion of the works of Bass and Company, probably at Burton-on-Trent, and the ruin of the firm of Guinness and Son, with the loss to this country of the employment which that firm provided, and the contributions it makes, directly and indirectly, through its employees to the general and local taxation of the country.  Suppose that Messrs. Jacob and Co. were ruined on the same principle also, and our woollen manufactures or cycle factories, our boot and shoe industries, our engineering industries, and all through the gamut of Irish manufacturing industry. The individual consumer would have gained some fractional advantage in the matter of the cost of the article, but the question is would the result be that the nation as a whole would have gained?  Commonsense at once answers that that is the certain path to national suicide.  That is the path that this country has been following ever since the days of the fall of Grattan's Parliament, and it is the path that the Fiscal Committee recommends this nation to pursue in the future.  Sir, the conclusion of the Committee, based upon the claims and rights of the consumer, like all the rest of the conclusions in this Report, are wholly fallacious and untenable, and that falsity <Col N="303" /> is proven independently of the major premise upon which this proposal rests, that protection increases the cost of living. That proposition I have, in earlier parts of my observation, shown to be false in itself.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, in the earlier portions of my observations, I drew attention to certain matters vital to any enquiry into tariffs which the Committee in its wisdom, or rather its lack of wisdom, had seen fit to ignore.  I want now to mention a few topics dealt with by the Committee very fully, and which, I think it will be conceded, were entirely outside the scope of such an enquiry.  The Committee devoted a number of paragraphs to discussing the question of the efficiency of labour and management, and of rates of wages.  It is not my intention to offer an opinion at this moment as to whether labour and management are efficient or inefficient, or whether underpaid or overpaid.  There are protectionist countries where labour is highly efficient, as in the United States and Germany, and there are protectionist countries where labour is highly inefficient, as in British India.  There are protectionist countries where management is highly efficient, as in the United States, and there are protectionist countries where management is alleged to be highly inefficient, as in Soviet Russia.  It seems almost needless to observe that there are all kinds of intermediate gradations between some protectionist countries and others in the matter of labour, management, and rates of wages, and it follows from that that the question of the efficiency or the inefficiency of labour and management, or whether wages are high or low, are matters that have no relevancy in an enquiry into tariffs. The digression of the Committee in this respect seems to me to constitute a glaring departure from its terms of reference, which irregularity is very much accentuated by the manner in which it ignores matters of the most vital and essential interest to such an enquiry, and which factors I have already dealt with in detail.  But what makes this digression so especially unpardonable is the grossly improper <Col N="304" /> manner in which the topics in question have been dealt with in the Report. The employers are told in so many words that their trouble is due largely to the fact that wages are high and labour inefficient.  The labourers are told that management is inefficient and that the native industry is unsuited to them; the consumer is told that employers and employees between them are going to fleece him, and, as if this doleful picture is not sufficient to make our blood run cold, the agriculturalist is told that he will have to bear without alleviation all the ills that according to the Cobdenite theory protection brings in its trail.  An appeal is made not to the patriotism or the civic sense of the different sections, but to the lower selfish interests, thus claiming, if it has any result at all, to produce an end that is crippling and retarding to the progress of this country; and thus to set class against class and interest against interest, instead of trying, as we would expect such a Committee to do, to bring together and weld together in common identity the whole interests within the State.  Now, lest anyone, however, should think that this is a new trace of Cobdenism I quote the following passage from List's work written, as I have mentioned already, 80 years ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is all very well for Dr. Bowring to assure us that the home industry of Germany is being protected at the expense of the agriculturists. But how can we attach any credence to his assurance, when we all see, on the contrary, that the demand for agricultural produce, prices of produce, the wages of labour, the rents, the value of property, have everywhere considerably risen without the agriculturist having to pay more than he did before for the manufactured goods which he requires.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is very well for Dr. Bowring to give us an estimate showing that in Germany three persons are engaged in agriculture to every one in manufacture, but the statement convinces us that the number of Germans engaged in manufacturing is not yet in proportion to the number of German agriculturists. <Col N="305" /> And we cannot see by what other means this disproportion can be equalised, than by increasing the protection on those branches of manufacture which are still carried on in England for the supply of the German market by persons who consume English instead of German agricultural produce.  It is all very well for Dr. Bowring to assert that German agriculture must only direct its attention to foreign countries if it desires to increase its sale of produce; but that a great demand for agricultural produce can only be attained by a flourishing home manufacturing power is taught us not alone by the experience of England, but Dr. Bowring himself implicitly admits this, by the apprehension which he expresses in his report, that if England delays for some time to abolish her corn laws, Germany will then have no surplus of either corn or timber to sell to foreign countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have not had the opportunity of reading this report to which List refers, but from what one can deduce from it, it almost seems that the arguments used by this agent of the British Government are an attempt to try to contrive an economic vassalage of Germany to England.  From the arguments used for that purpose eighty years ago, one would think that they had been copied word for word into this report made by the members of this Irish Fiscal Committee.  Nor is there anything very remarkable in that except this: that it gives us almost conclusive proof of the extent to which so many of our economists are in the grip of Cobdenite propaganda, and are either unwilling or unable to extricate themselves.  The contents of the pedlar's bag, which is Cobdenism, has not changed its nature in the slightest within the last seventy or eighty years.  In the interval, it has made its appearance in the ante-room of every Chancellory in Europe, only to be returned with its contents unsold and unwelcome.  It has made its appearance here now in the hope, and I think the vain and empty hope, that some of its garish rags will be mistaken by the Irish people, unversed in its contents, as genuine pure <Col N="306" /> gold.  However, those of us who have no illusions, either as to the country of origin or the quality of its rags, will take such precautions as are in our power to see that they are properly labelled before they are offered to the Irish people.  Throughout this report every divergency of interest, between the different sections of the community, has been strongly emphasised, and all the interests which the community have in common have been ignored. The Committee has not even once found occasion to use the words &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; or &ldquo;citizenship.&rdquo;  In fact all its statements and all its conclusions imply a very negation of the rights and the obligations associated with citizenship.  In this country of many distractions, one would have thought that a Committee, with such responsibility as this, would have manifested some little appreciation of the interests in common between employer and employee, between producer and consumer, and between agriculturist and manufacturer, because after all these interests in common are much more comprehensive and are of far greater importance than the interests of a separate or divergent nature.  But I think I have already indicated that the Committee seem never to have been able to visualise their Terms of Reference from the standpoint of the nation or the citizen, but only from the standpoint of a group of individuals with divergent interests, in other words, not that of a nation but that of a squabbling rabble, and that seems to the Committee to be the most satisfactory dénouement &mdash;that while these poor foolish crows are, so to speak, squabbling for a piece of cheese, the fox comes along and appropriates the spoils.</P>
    <P>The Committee have made no concealment of their partiality for the fox. In paragraphs 121 and 123 it speaks of the serious disadvantage and the serious disability a protective tariff would impose on outside competitors.  Think of that.  Only once does it allude to the serious disability and the serious disadvantage under which home producers work; but the imposition of a protective tariff would impose a serious disability and a serious disadvantage upon <Col N="307" /> outside competitors.  What was this Committee set up for?  Was it to advise means to safeguard the interests of importers and manufacturers who send their goods here, or was it to look after the interests of this poor unfortunate nation?  I sometimes think we are worse off than Egypt was when it was subject to the ten plagues.  I think our five Professors, if their teachings are followed, will leave this country in a worse condition than Egypt was after the infliction of those plagues.  Those remarks express, with the vividness of a lightning flash in the darkness of the night, the mentality of the men who composed this Committee, and if there were no other objection, that would in itself explain to us why this Report is what it is.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the arguments in paragraphs 135-6-7, where the Committee recognise that the policy of fiscal protection may be defended.  Even in this instance the Committee is careful to put protection upon its defence upon other than economic grounds.  The Committee, however, points out that in so far as economic considerations enter into the matter, they enter into it as objections. This, however, is simply a perversion of fact.  The body of economic theory which advocates a system of protective tariffs on national grounds is far more comprehensive and far more reputable than that which advocates free trade.  It would be no rash prophecy to assert or foretell that the names of such men as Hamilton, the two Careys, father and son; List, Muller, to mention only a few advocates of the system of national economics, will endure as long as those of Adam Smith and Richard Cobden, and certainly longer than those of the poor, unworthy satellites to be found, of all the places in the world, in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, I regret I have had to detain the Dáil at such great length, but I think you will agree that the labour of a body of men of such academic distinctions as our Professors, their labour for over six months, was not a thing to be dealt with in a haphazard sort of way, but was something to be taken seriously, particularly where those labours meant the welfare or the reverse <Col N="308" /> of this country.  I have tried to take them seriously and to treat their labour seriously.  I would not have imposed myself upon the Dáil at such inordinate length if it were not that I saw there was a grave and serious matter involved.  The gravity of the matter is my excuse, if excuse is needed, for making such a large claim upon the indulgence of the Dáil.  The report appears to me, after analysis, and I think most here will agree with me, to be a professor's and a theorist's report, the report of men who acted, not upon evidence, but upon a desire to bring in a document in harmony with their own inclinations.</P>
    <P>There are, however, on record two declarations by President Cosgrave which give me hope that this document will never be an indication of Government policy.  The first is that made in his statement on the 15th June last when he said: &ldquo;The Government must specially reserve to itself freedom to review the Committee's recommendations.&rdquo; I think I have given sufficient grounds for a review of those recommendations. The second is a declaration on the 16th December last: &ldquo;We have not secured our political independence at the cost of so much loss and suffering, to surrender now our economic independence or any part of it.&rdquo; The whole tenor of the argument of this report is an appeal to nullify the economic independence of this State.  I venture to predict that it will take more than the Cobdenite propensities of five professors to resurrect Pitt's dream of conquest of this country, especially at a moment when the genius and the statesmanship of our late President, Arthur Griffith, and the valour of the men who stood by him and this State have given our people the means and the opportunity to defeat that dream of conquest.  It may be charged against me when I have finished that my allusions to the Fiscal Committee and the report have lacked somewhat the spirit of forbearance and have been unnecessarily caustic.</P>

      <P>But that is not my consideration here to-day, or my main consideration.  An issue is raised here <Col N="309" /> which involves such far-reaching consequences to the future welfare of the people of this State that the truth must be faced and spoken, no matter how the susceptibilities of certain persons are affected.  Peter the Great, on one occasion, discussing lawyers, said: &ldquo;There were two lawyers in my Dominions; I hanged one of them.&rdquo;  I must say, when I perused this report, my disposition towards professors of political economy was much the same as that of Peter the Great towards lawyers.  However, I suppose it is not practical politics to translate that disposition into actualities, and I suppose it is not even possible to bring them within the meaning of the Minister for Home Affairs' &ldquo;Flogging&rdquo; Bill.  There is one thing we can and we should do, and that is, to analyse and expose the fallacies of this pernicious document and destroy any possibility of ever securing its acceptance in this country as an authentic testimony of its economic condition, or as a reliable guide to national health and stability.</P>
      <P>The great human factor upon which this report should have informed us is ignored.  That factor is the needs of the people, not the elusive attractions of the mirage of Free Trade.  This report will bring, no doubt, great joy to the importer of foreign manufactured goods, but what hope does it bring to the thousands of starving unemployed and to the dweller in the slums, all those who are trying to eke out a miserable existence on a miserable few shillings a week?  What hope does it bring to the man who is trying to pursue industrial enterprise against the powerfully organised opposition of foreign manufacturers' interests that dominate our home market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What hope does it bring to the agriculturalist who, day after day, is driven in spite of himself to the disgraceful and enervating occupation of the rancher and the grazier?  What hope does it bring to any section in Ireland?  None whatever.  The economic domination of this country by Great Britain is its inspiration, and its sole offering to the Irish people is the trail of the emigrant.  It raises a picture dismal, disheartening, depressing, of a land that has no economic <Col N="310" /> future, of a land where professors of economics accumulate and men decay. This question is not going to be settled by a chorus of professors, chanting &ldquo;Every day and in every way free trade is better and better than protection.&rdquo; Happily, this report is not the last word on the matter.  It gives us no clear light, no ray of hope to guide us to a solution of our social problem, and the general economic development of the State.  We must search for that in another direction, and from other sources we must seek the remedy of our economic distress, if faith in the nation's future has not been abandoned by the people, and especially by those that the people have selected to be the custodians of their rights and liberties. In his statement last June the President said: &ldquo;Questions of policy are not for this Committee.  That will be a matter for the people and the Government when they have the facts before them.&rdquo;  The full facts have not been before them, and have not been furnished by this report.  I am rather of opinion that this report tends to obscure the facts.  But facts are stubborn things, and they are more stubborn and stronger than even Professors of Economics, and these facts are going to prevail yet.  I conclude with this admonition which Frederick List addressed to his country: &ldquo;Let us only have courage to believe in a great national future, and in that belief march forward.  Above all, let us have national spirit enough to at once plant and protect that tree which will yield its richest fruits to future generations; first, let us gain possession of the home market, so far at least as respects articles of general necessity, and secondly, let us try to procure the goods of other countries direct from those countries and pay for them with our own manufactured goods.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion proposed by Deputy Milroy.  In making some remarks upon the Fiscal Report, I will not be able to bring to bear upon it the heavy artillery of Deputy Milroy.  But I will have a tilt at it in my own way. I support the views set forth by Deputy Milroy, and for many reasons, and not the least of them is this reason, that protection was one of the policies of Arthur Griffith.  He had a political policy and he had an economic policy. The aim of his life was to put the English soldier out of this country. He also proposed to put the foreign dumper out of the country.  After the sacrifices made for the last ten years to get English rule, bag and baggage, out of Ireland, it would be too bad if the foreign dumper were still to remain and to reap the benefit of the changed condition of things.  I wish also to express my great surprise at this Fiscal Report.  To most people in the country it came almost as a shock, for a poor country whose industries were anaemic or strangled, whose agriculture was at <Col N="312" /> a low ebb, to hear that the policy of leave-it-so was to be insisted upon, and that no protection was to be afforded. The people were almost as surprised at that, as if the law of gravitation were attacked.  Now, every country in the world, except England, has tried protection, because it is a sensible policy to preserve your own home markets, and to allow no foreigner to come in and use your home markets for the sale of his articles.  If England is an exception to that rule, the reason of it is obvious to everyone.  England got ahead of the rest of the world in manufactured articles, and was prepared to maintain her lead by free trade.  She has done so up to the present successfully. When it is pointed out to those free traders that a great nation like America has set up a tariff, they say: &ldquo;Oh, but America is a continent with vast resources.&rdquo;  Is it not a reason on our side, if America, a continent with vast resources, adopts protection, that we should adopt it?  If America with almost unlimited resources was not able without protection to build up a prosperous manufacturing system, how could a poor country like Ireland build it up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If America is vast for its hundred millions of population, Ireland is equally rich for its three millions, and can provide almost everything that the country needs.  The Cobdenites to whom Deputy Milroy has so often referred come along to us and say: &ldquo;Why go to the trouble of making boots, clothes, bicycles or anything at all?  Sit down and we will make them, and if you go into the poor-house afterwards it is not our fault.&rdquo;  This report, I submit, is a most partial one.  I have heard of manufacturers who went before the Commission, and according to themselves they felt that they might have been before Sir Hamar Greenwood for all the sympathy they got.  We were told that the Commissioners were to confine themselves to facts, and that they had nothing to do with policy. There are only two policies&mdash;protection or free trade&mdash;and in every page of that report there is an attempt to knife protection, and the policy of free trade, which suits England and does not suit Ireland, is boomed.  These men who came up from the country to give evidence <Col N="313" /> in the hope of getting some encouragement came to regard the witness box into which they were put as a sort of torture chamber.  You will find the report most illogical and inconsistent, and if each of the five men wrote part of it, that would account for the fact that one portion contradicts another. All through, they do not look upon the question from the point of view of the nation.  It reminds me of the old Unionist argument when we were trying to get control of our own affairs, when an Irish county was compared with an English county and it was contended we had no grievance, as the same laws governed both.  We could not meet that argument on that plane, but the argument failed when approached from the national standpoint. If you go on the lines of this report you will never build up a prosperous nation. They talk about getting this and that article cheap, but that is not the point. We want to make the article.  It is like asking a farmer to buy a ha'p'orth of milk here and there.  The farmer wants his cow, and Ireland also wants her cow so as not to be obliged to buy a ha'p'orth of milk.  Some of the witnesses stated that they wanted protection for their little industries, and the extraordinary reply they got was: &ldquo;If you get protection, people, like the Imperial Tobacco Company, will come in.&rdquo; Why should they not come in?  Would they not be welcome here?  They would give employment and spend money.  We would prefer to have industries set up with Irish capital, but we want the articles made in Ireland and consumed in Ireland, no matter whose money it is.  The capitalist, if he is a foreigner, will only get 5 per cent. on his money, and what members of the Committee regard as a disaster would prove to be a boon.  That is an extraordinary conclusion for these men to come to.  They say that one factory would turn out all the articles of a certain class, but that it would lead to a combine.  How uneasy they are about Irish commercial morality!  These naughty Irish manufacturers might form a combine!  Did they ever hear of the Imperial Tobacco Trust, of the Oil Trust, and the Meat Trust?  Is the foreign manufacturer too good to combine?  Why did they <Col N="314" /> reserve all their horror and disgust for an Irish combine and allow the foreign one to starve the country, and take the bit out of the mouth of the Irish workers?  Then, again, they say, with regard to boots, that one great industry might supply all the boots necessary, but it would be a monopoly.  What would it matter if it were a monopoly so long as we had the articles made in Ireland, Irish workmen paid for them, and homes made prosperous by them? As a specimen of a combine in this country, the nearest thing approaching it would be Guinness's Brewery.  Are the workmen there any worse off by being connected with the monopoly? Is it not better to have our stout made by an Irish monopoly than by foreigners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Committee say that if protection is given certain industries would not be able to turn out all the articles needed, as they would not have the plant.  Of course they would not have the plant right away, but the plant would grow.  That shows the length to which these gentlemen went to find arguments against protection.  There is no point in these references to monopoly.  They are forced in fact to admit the argument in favour of protection in every successful country in the world, but they point out that it would not suit Ireland.  Then again they say that under protection workmen enough could not be got in certain cases, except from Scotland.  It is like a doctor saying to a sick man: &ldquo;If you take this medicine, you will get too strong and too fat.&rdquo;  If protection comes, the Irish commercial body will not be able to stand the success.  In regard to one trade they say that if it were protected it would not be able to turn out all the articles.  As regards leather goods, they say that undoubtedly an Irish factory would be able to turn out all that is required, but they still have to add a rider of dissent and state &ldquo;suppose you did set up a tariff to protect Irish tanneries an English factory would come in.&rdquo;  Supposing Englishmen did come in with their capital to subsidise an Irish industry, are we to turn them <Col N="315" /> down as long as we get the trade?  I make the same comment on that as I made on the tobacco industry.  It is ridiculous and absurd.  They are forced on a general survey to admit that protection would be good.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The result of the imposition of a tariff would be a stimulus to industry to produce up to the extent of its capacity,&rdquo; which would be an alarming thing for the professors, &ldquo;and would also be an incentive to expansion and production,&rdquo; which would be another unfortunate thing.  This would mean a period of industrial stimulus and expansion which would only terminate with complete control of the market. If capital were available existing firms might largely increase their factories and plant, and new firms would arise to take advantage of such favourable conditions.  Having admitted so much against their grain, they had to add a special rider to take the value out of it.  They said that they had a distinguished Labour leader before them, who said &ldquo;That if the country got prosperous labour would insist on getting prosperous, too.  That would mean another disaster.&rdquo;  Anything more silly I never read in my life. Here is another paragraph of this brilliant report.  &ldquo;The industry will, no doubt, if capital and labour could be secured, expand and develop under protection, but the production can never be so economical as to provide the public with boots at the prices at which they are now obtained.&rdquo;  Where you are paying £1 to-day for a boot from Nottingham you would pay 21/- for an Irish boot, and the view of this Committee was that if those boots were made in Ireland by Irish workmen who were prosperous, and if the slums were to disappear in consequence, that would be no compensation for the fact that we should pay a shilling or two more for our boots.  Where did those people study their economy?  I hold that that sentence would damn their report as an economic one.  When they wanted to frighten manufacturers coming from the country, and who wanted protection for their own little industries which have been strangled, they threatened them with the Imperial <Col N="316" /> Tobacco and other companies.  What was the answer of those manufacturers? They said: &ldquo;We welcome them; let them come.  We want fair conditions, but we are entitled to the home market, which is our market. Let us look after the Irish market, and let other countries look after their own.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reminded me of what Griffith used to say to the internationalists: &ldquo;Before we talk of internationalism we must first set up our nation.&rdquo; The same thing applies to free trade.  Let us capture our own market for the main articles, as List said, and then there can be the usual inter-play between the nations for foreign markets.  Let us first secure our own market for our own people.  We are sending millions of our people outside to make boots and shoes for us abroad.  We are emigrating our own sons and daughters to make them.  Go over to Scotland and travel from the Tyne to Manchester and you find thousands of Irishmen making articles for Ireland who should be making them at home.  This is a policy which no nation should be guilty of.  If it is all the same whether our people live in Birmingham or Dublin, let us have free trade, but if we mean to keep the Irish nation a comfortable Irish nation, we must set up our own industries.  The country must stand on its agricultural and industrial legs.  They want to frighten us about the farmer.  Why should the Irish farmer be poor when we can put a fine market at his door?  Why should we not make Irish agriculture rich?  I saw a statement the other day about the value of farms in America, and the farms in the States which were industrial were three times the value of the farms in agricultural districts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Milroy read some extracts to show how protection helped industries in foreign countries and how free trade injured them.  I have read a book dealing with the silk industry in Dublin, which once gave employment to 11,000 hands who had comfortable homes.  They then enjoyed a ten per cent. tariff, and when it was proposed to take off the ten per cent. tariff they sent a deputation to the English Chancellor, who delivered a Machiavellian homily.  They wanted a <Col N="317" /> tariff, but he told them that they would be far better off when the tariff would be taken away, and that for every ten weavers that were then employed in the production of Irish poplins they would be able to give employment to one hundred fold.  England took off the tariff of ten per cent. from the industry. The result was beggary and ruin.  Go down to Weaver's Square, where the workers lived in comfort, and you will see the ruins.  The man who went over on that deputation, a Mr. Wadden, packed up his goods and went away leaving twenty thousand pounds worth of property after him. The Irish silk industry was wiped out. Afterwards England took the tariff off her own silk industry, and it, too, was wiped out.  America increased the tariff, and her silk industry increased by leaps and bounds.  That is proof certain that certain industries must be protected.  I make a clear distinction between home and foreign markets.  We should protect the main industries of the home market.  I am for giving the main industries full protection.  In America the farmer gets protection against the Canadian farmer on corn. The Irish farmer should get protection, too.  If he does not, what is the prospect of agriculture in this country with the stream of dead meat from the Argentine continuously increasing every day, and with butter imports increasing? When Russia is opened up, where shall we be?  The Irish farmer has the first claim on the Irish market.  He should have it.  We have a rich country, and we should have its products for ourselves. Common-sense shows that we should hold this country for ourselves and exchange its industrial for its agricultural products.  England has no great objection to tariffs or any excise remission when it suits her.  Take the beet industry.  England grants an exemption of excise duty on beet, and three great beet factories were set up by arrangement with the farmers in Norfolk.  Last year the profit on one factory alone was £136,000.  The farmers around there are prosperous and are going to set up another factory.  Why should not Ireland have a beet industry and also a large flax industry?  Why is it that there is an attack on the Irish manufacturer? <Col N="318" /> He is made out of the one cloth as ourselves. Are not the Irish worker and the Irish manager as good as those in any other part of the world?  Wherever they get the same chances they prove themselves to be so.</P>
    <P>I say that the Irish manufacturer is entitled to a chance, and the way to give him a chance is to hold back the foreigner until we have built up the home market; give him complete control of the home market.  In supporting Deputy Milroy's motion I suggest that this Report is an incomplete Report and an unfair Report.  If it marks out a line of national policy it is not the line that should be taken, but the line that should not be taken.  The Government should propose a national policy to make the most of our national resources and to help to build up Irish industries by tariffs on agricultural produce and other foreign imports.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the decision of the Postmaster-General in respect of the recommendations of the Post Office Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that Deputies may be in a position to judge of the merits of this motion, it will be necessary to outline <Col N="319" /> very briefly the history of the Postal Commission, and the position generally in the Post Office during the last few years.  In the closing years of the British regime there was very much discontent amongst Post Office staffs in this country.  Things were very un settled in the Post Office.  This state of affairs arose from many causes. There was much discontent in the matter of promotion.  There was no outlet for the promotion of the staffs. Complaints were made from time to time as to favouritism, but probably the main cause of the discontent was the low basic rate of pay.</P>
    <P>In the other branches of the Civil Service various re-organisations have taken place from time to time.  I think the last re-organisation took place somewhere about 1920, whereby men in what was formerly the old Second Division had their positions substantially bettered, and those who are now clerical officers were up-graded and received substantial increases.  No re-organisation, however, has taken place in the Post Office.  It was given in evidence before the Postal Commission that men sorters and telegraphists in Dublin had their basic rates increased only by the amount of 5/- per week within the 30 years prior to the taking over of the Government by the Irish Administration. Shortly after the Provisional Government had taken over the Post Office &mdash;I think it was in March, 1922&mdash;the first cut under the Civil Service bonus arrangement was due to take place, and the Post Office authorities proposed to apply this cut automatically to the postal servants.  There was trouble immediately. It was argued that as the basic rates were low the bonus was proportionately low and, in fact, that the staffs were not in a position to bear this cut which it was proposed to make. Trouble was averted at that time by the action of the Government in promising to set up, and in actually setting up, a Commission.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference to the Commission were as follows.  I shall read the pertinent portions only:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That an independent Commission of five members be set up to inquire into the wages and salaries, organisation of work, and conditions generally <Col N="320" /> in the Post Office, and to report what alterations, if any, are desirable.</P>
    <P>That in the cases of the principal classes of Post Office servants, and of such of the other classes as the Commission may think necessary, the first task of the Commission shall be to determine whether the present basic wage can bear the recent cut, this to be determined by the 15th May, 1922.</P>
    <P>That the Commission shall be empowered to recommend in the case of classes, where the cut is regarded as not being justified, an increase of basic wage as from the 1st March, without prejudice to the general findings.</P>
    <P>That the Commission shall then consider the general question of wages, salaries, organisation of work and conditions generally.</P>
    <P>Mr. Douglas, now Senator Douglas, was appointed by the Government to act as Chairman of the Commission. The Government nominated two others, Mr. Henry Friel, who is now Secretary of the Home Affairs Department, and Sir Thomas Esmonde, now Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde.  The Irish Labour Party, as part of the agreement, was asked to nominate two members, and they nominated Mr. O'Duffy, who is now Chairman of the Labour Party, and myself.  That was the Commission.  Its duty was to examine and report before the 15th May, 1922, whether or not, in all the circumstances, the main classes of the Post Office staffs, that is, those known as the sorting clerks and telegraphists, the postmen, and the engineering branch, were able to bear the cut which was proposed.</P>
    <P>To put the matter briefly, the Commission did report before the 15th May, 1922.  They furnished a unanimous report to the Government to the effect that, in view of all the circumstances, this cut which was proposed was not justified, and they, therefore, recommended that the basic rate of these classes should be increased by, roughly, 12½ per cent, which approximately left their position what it was before the cut had taken place.  That recommendation was to hold good until the final report of the Commission, or until an <Col N="321" /> agreed cost of living figure for the Irish Free State had been determined.</P>
    <P>It was the intention of the Postal Commission, immediately after making that interim report in May, 1922, to go into the whole question of the re-organisation of the Post Office, and generally to carry on the main part of the work for which they were appointed.  The general election intervened, and after that came the trouble which broke out in the summer of 1922.  For one reason or another the Post Office was not in a position, nor was the Postal Commission, to carry on its work.  Meantime, about the end of August, 1922, a cost-of-living figure was published by the Government.  It had no claim to fulfil the condition of being called an agreed cost-of-living figure, because the Commission had in mind a figure which would be generally accepted by labour people, and also by representatives of commerce, as a proper figure under the circumstances.  Apart from that, we know what happened immediately afterwards.  A strike was called in the Post Office, because the officials held that the previous interim report should hold good until the final report was produced, or until an agreed cost-of-living figure was arrived at.  The Post Office authorities, however, proposed, and actually did take off not only the 12½ per cent. which had been given in the interim report, but also made an additional cut&mdash;at the moment I forget the exact amount&mdash;of, I think, 5.26 of the bonus.  All was to come off on the 1st of September.  That, as I say, led up to the Post Office strike, which went on for five or six weeks.  Eventually the strike was settled.  One of the factors that induced the staffs at that time to call off the strike was a promise given by the Chairman of the Postal Commission, to the effect that if they went back to work the Postal Commission would meet and take up as quickly as possible the consideration of the whole wage question.  I do not say that that was the condition on which they went back, but it was a factor which influenced them very considerably in coming to the decision to accept the Government's conditions.  They went back in October, and on the 1st of November the Postal Commission sat <Col N="322" /> again.  Recognising the urgency of the whole question, the Commission got on with the work as quickly as possible, and as a result were able to issue the first part of their report on the 14th of December, 1922.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to the fact that the Commission considered this matter of the wage question of the postal staffs so very urgent that they thought it advisable to issue their report in two parts, dealing in the first instance with the position of the staffs, so that it would settle the question of re-organisation and wages generally. This is the paragraph in their report which illustrates that point:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the fact that several months must elapse before the Commission can hope to report fully, and of the many and intricate problems submitted to it, and having regard to the admitted need for the early re-organisation of the main classes in the Post Office, the Commission have decided to issue forthwith this first part of the report dealing with the question of re-organisation, as far as it affects the larger sections of the employees and other kindred matters on which definite conclusions have been reached.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows that in the mind of the Postal Commission this was a matter of very great urgency.  The Commission, on examining this whole question, found themselves faced with a very great difficulty and a very big problem.  The Post Office, as a whole, was being run at a loss, and the Commission felt that any recommendation which would have the effect of increasing expenditure would not stand any chance of being accepted.  At the same time, they recognised that, unless there were better prospects held out to the staffs, the report would not be very effective in the way of relieving or alleviating the discontent which undoubtedly and admittedly existed in the Post Office.  They were faced, therefore, with the task of reconciling what looked like two decidedly conflicting interests.  They were not long engaged in the consideration of the problem when they found out that one of the things that led to discontent in <Col N="323" /> the Post Office was the remarkable fact that, owing to the limited number of positions that were available for people in this country, there were going into the Post Office for years a class of men who, as a matter of fact were too good for the work they were doing, and who felt that they were able to do better work and entitled, as it were, to do better work.</P>
    <P>In this connection we had some remarkable evidence from the Secretary of the Post Office.  In the course of his evidence he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trouble in the Post Office had been that, in Ireland, there are not sufficient jobs for the people, and witnessed his own case.  He had been an Intermediate exhibitioner, left school at 15, and went in for the Post Office because there was no place else to go.  If he had been left in the ruck, he himself would have been an agitator.  Some of the men in the Post Office were too good for their positions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another quotation is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Witness (the Secretary) stated that there were approximately 14,000 workers in the Post Office. That administration, to be successful, must have a contented staff to deal with, and it was desirable to take all steps necessary to produce harmony in the Department.  Witness admitted that the staff was not contented, and gave as an explanation, as he had already stated in his previous evidence, that there had been no jobs for the people.  Men who had to go into the Post Office found themselves doing lower work than they were able to do, and were naturally discontented because they did not get the salaries which they believed their abilities entitled them to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That was the problem which faced the Commission. They gave long and careful consideration to all these problems and view-points.  They examined numerous witnesses from the Department and also from the staff side, and they believed that they found <Col N="324" /> a solution, with the result that a unanimous Report was again issued, and I would like to call attention, at this stage, to the fact that those who were now acting on the Commission were not the original Commissioners.  Mr. Friel had been appointed to the position of Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs, and Sir Thos. Esmonde was not in a position to act, so that the Government nominated Councillor Jas Moran, the present Senator Moran, Chairman of the Port and Docks Board, and Mr. O'Connor, the well-known accountant and lecturer on Accountancy in the National University.  I think the fact in itself that a unanimous Report was issued where you had men with what might be called such opposite view-points as Senator Moran and Mr. O'Duffy, not to mention others, goes far to show that it was a Report such as the Government might very well have adopted.  I may say, too, that a suggestion came from a particular witness from the Department, that there should be a re-grading, that the work which was now being done by the Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists should in future be done by postmen and that that particular grade should do a higher class of work.  I should say that the wages paid in the Dublin office are higher than in any other office in the country.  It is what is known as a Class 1 office, and there are Class 2 and Class 3 offices where proportionately lower rates of wages are paid.  A Sorting Clerk and Telegraphist at his maximum was getting 61s. a week as his basic rate of pay.  A postman was getting 39/- or 40/-.  The idea of the Commission was that the work which was now being done for 61/- could be done by the postmen, and that certain classes of the postmen who might be found fitted for the work should have their maximum increased to 52/-.  The postmen would be getting an increase and at the same time the Post Office would be getting work done at a cheaper rate.  In the same way it was recommended that the work now done by what are called Clerical Officers, and for whom a maximum basic rate of £237 10s. is paid, could be done by men promoted from the Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists' Department, and for that those who are getting a <Col N="325" /> maximum of 61/- a week, or, roughly, £159 a year, should have an increase of £60 per annum, which would only bring them up to £220.  Again the Sorting Clerk was getting a substantial increase of £60, but his maximum was £17 10s. Od. less than the maximum of the man whom he was replacing.  The Commission believed that in this way they were meeting the claims of the men for a better prospect, a better outlook and promotion, while at the same time they were not, they held, increasing the total expenditure of the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could be no question as to the ability of Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists to do the work which the Commission recommended that they should do; indeed, it was admitted by the Secretary in the course of his evidence. He said, referring to what are called the Clerical Class in the Post Office: &ldquo;Witness stated that there was a need in the Post Office for a Clerical Class, but he did not state that that must necessarily be a Treasury Class.  He did not think that Treasury Classes as such were advisable in the Post Office. The Clerical Classes which he regarded as essential could be had from the ranks of the Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists, and by means of open competition.&rdquo; There is an admission that these men were quite qualified to do the work in the higher departments of the Post Office which is now being done by what is called Treasury Classes, who are men who have not worked their way up within the Post Office, but who were appointed directly to the higher administrative offices, and whose maximum basic salary is £237 10s.  The Government's decision, announced by the Postmaster-General just before Christmas, in brief accepts the view that there should be a re-grading, that the men should be graded up, as it were, to the higher class of work They accept that part of it, but they do not accept the other side of the bargain. They do not believe in paying for that more important work, except to a very slight extent indeed.  It will be necessary to refer in detail to the Government's report, and I shall take first the case of the postmen.  &ldquo;The Commission recommends that the maximum basic wages of Grade B. postmen <Col N="326" /> at Class I offices be increased by 3/-, to 43/- a week.&rdquo;  I should first say that the Commission recommended that postmen should be graded into two classes, A and B; that the B postmen should continue to do the work which postmen do at present, and that Grade A, the new Grade of postmen, should take over the work now being done by Sorting Clerks.  The Commission, it says, recommends that in Class 1 offices, that is in the Dublin office only, the increase of the lower Grade of postmen should be 3/- per week, from 40/- to 43/-.  I would like to explain the point of view which the Commission held in making that recommendation, because it might be argued that in this case no higher work was given to these men. It was not so much an increase that was the idea as an adjustment of scale. The present scale and the scale recommended by the Commission goes up from 20/- at the age of 18 to 29/-, by yearly increments of 1/6 per week. Then there are, in the existing scales, increments of 2/- a week for two years, to 33/-, and then they drop back again to the 1/6 rate, and towards the end, they have an increment of 1/- a week. The Commission thought it would have been much simpler, from the point of view of administration alone, if it were nothing else, that after the 29/- a week figure was reached, the increments for the same number of years should be at the rate of 2/- a week, which meant an ultimate increase on the maximum of 3/- a week.  The Commission did not think that 43/- a week as a basic wage was too much to offer the postman in Dublin who would have, I think, 14 or 15 years' service.  He would be, roughly, somewhere about the age of 31 or 32 years, even if he entered at the age of 18, but let this be remembered in this connection, that if a man enters even at the age of 30, he has to work up his yearly increments for 13 or 14 years.</P>
    <P>He does not automatically fit into his age scale.  He has to begin right at the beginning, and work up.  As I say, they do not consider that that wage was too much to offer postmen who have responsibilities. These men have to carry around registered letters, and are dealing with considerable sums of money at times, and especially in view <Col N="327" /> of the fact of the introduction of this new cash-on-delivery system, which the Commission certainly had in mind would be introduced, but we read that &ldquo;The Government has given this recommendation very careful consideration, and it is unable to accept it.  It is satisfied, after a perusal of the evidence, that the existing basic scales are fully adequate for the work at present performed by the existing grades. Where, therefore, work is not graded as higher work, the Government is unable to accept a recommendation to increase the present wage.&rdquo;  In other words, the 3/- increase for postmen is turned down now.  In the case of Grade A. postmen, these are to do the work which is now being done by sorters, and for which a maximum wage of 61/ per week is paid.  The Commission recommended that where postmen are turned on to that work they should get an immediate increase of 3/6 per week in case the wages are under 29/-, and 5/- per week in the case of people paid a higher wage, and further, that there should be two additional increments.  That would bring the maximum after some 16 or 18 years' service to 52/- per week, as against the 61/- paid at the moment for the same kind of work.  The decision of the Government as announced is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Commission recommends that postmen, Grade `A,' performing sorting and despatching work, shall have a maximum of 52/- per week, plus bonus. The maximum suggested is too high, and the Government is unable to accept it.  It proposes, instead, to adopt a maximum of 48/-, plus bonus, a week for Class 1 Offices, the scale being the present scale, rising by increments of 1/6 per week from the present wages point to 39/-, plus bonus, per week to the new maximum of 48/-, plus bonus, per week.&rdquo;  That refers to Class 1 Offices, the scale being pro rata in the other offices.  That 4/- is not exactly the difference, but it is what happened immediately. Nobody gets an increase in the first case until he goes to his maximum.  The Commission recommended that any man, no matter at what point he was in the scale, who was given this higher class of work should have an immediate increase of 3/6.  The <Col N="328" /> position now is that a man, whether of the higher or lower work, gets the same wage until he goes to the maximum of the present scale, and then he gets an increase of 1/6, and his incremental period is lengthened by five years, so that even if he enters at the minimum age of 18 he has to work until he is 36 before he gets his maximum of 48/-.  That is how the Government have dealt with the case of these new men who are to be put on to the higher class of work.  They have done nothing at the moment to distinguish the two classes of work until the sorter comes to a certain period in his career.  Then they say: &ldquo;You can go a little further by increments of 1/6 per week.&rdquo;  Take the case of a postman who might enter at the age of 20 or 25.  He has to work 18 years before he gets his maximum of 48/-.</P>
    <P>With regard to the class called sorting clerks and telegraphists, the Commission has recommended that there should be a new class altogether, and they should do a different and higher class of work than they are doing at the present time.  This recommendation is practically turned down altogether.  The recommendation of the Commission was as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Commission recommends that the class at present known as sorting clerks and telegraphists should in future be known as post office assistants, who should perform all duties now discharged by the sorting clerks and telegraphists, except those recommended for transfer to postmen.&rdquo; And in addition they &ldquo;should undertake all Post Office clerical work except that discharged by Executive grade.&rdquo; Then they recommended that the salary for that class should go to a maximum of £220, as against the £160 at present, but that they should do the work which is now being done by men paid up to £237 10s.  The Government, however, decided otherwise.  They say: &ldquo;With regard to wages, the Commission recommends that Post Office assistants should go to a maximum of £162 10s., plus bonus, for males, and £110 for females, except in the case of assistants who shall have passed an efficiency test to be arranged by the Department, with a view to proving their ability to discharge the highest clerical duties proper to the grade, who should <Col N="329" /> go to £220 in the case of males, and £155 in the case of females.&rdquo;  They further say: &ldquo;The latter recommendation, which involves the payment of a State servant not by reference to the work on which he is employed, but by reference to the work which he is able to discharge, is one which the Government cannot possibly entertain.&rdquo;  I do not know how far the Government are justified in taking that interpretation from that recommendation.  So far as I know, speaking as a member of the Commission, the intention was that all vacancies in the clerical grade should be open to men who would have reached the point where the efficiency bar was to be if they were qualified to do the work.  It was not the intention&mdash;I am speaking for myself&mdash;that unless they were doing the work the salary would be paid.  I would certainly say that the Government were wrong in thinking that that was the only interpretation that could be put upon that recommendation. Here is a rather surprising statement coming from the Government, especially in view of the evidence put forward by the Department: &ldquo;Nor can the Government accept the proposal that the work at Headquarter Offices should be performed by the manipulative classes, though the Government is prepared to provide a special avenue of promotion for these classes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now this word &ldquo;manipulative&rdquo; is put in very deliberately to give a wrong impression.  These men&mdash;sorting clerks and telegraphists&mdash;were doing work and are doing work which cannot be properly termed &ldquo;manipulative.&rdquo; They are doing more than purely sorting work, and the recommendation of the Commission was that purely manipulative work would be done in future by the postman, and it is asserted now on the part of the Government that these men are not qualified in spite of the evidence put up by their own Department that they were fully qualified to do the work in the clerical offices.  Now, the wage which was recommended was not agreed upon or accepted by the Government.  They are re-grading these men and they slightly increased the maximum from 61/- to 70/- for men who are to do the higher duties; the others are to remain as <Col N="330" /> they are.  In Dublin, even in the case of these men whose maximums are increased, the immediate increase will be 2/- a week, and their incremental period, which is already an extraordinarily long one, is lengthened out by five years more.  Now, the number of people who can possibly benefit by this scheme, suggested by the Post Office, is extremely limited.  If we take it that there are approximately 420 or 430 sorting clerks and telegraphists the number likely to benefit under this scheme is not more than one-third, and the others will be left where they are in spite of the admitted fact that they are qualified and able to do the higher class of work.  There are other recommendations in this report which have not been touched at all.  One particular recommendation was that in which the Commission suggested that some machinery should be set up within the Post Office for the adjustment of differences, or rather for the discussion and adjustment of any question which might arise and be likely to lead to friction if not settled.  The report is quite silent upon that recommendation.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress upon the Dáil the unwisdom on the part of the Government or of Ministers in setting up a Commission of this kind, and then practically altogether disregarding its recommendations.  But I think there would be very little use for me to dilate upon that aspect of the question when we are all getting so used to it.  With our present Government that seems rather to be the rule rather than the exception.  A Commission report and that is all we hear of it; the Government accepts it if it seems to fit in with their own particular point of view, and if it does not they do not give the matter much further consideration. There are some other aspects of this report that I would like to deal with and call to the attention of the Dáil. There is first, the unreasonable, and very great and unwarranted delay on the part of whoever is responsible in issuing the decision come to on this report.  As I pointed out in the beginning of my statement, when the Commission was appointed it was thought it implied something in the <Col N="331" /> nature of a promise, not a formal promise, but something in the nature of a promise by way of inducement, to have the trouble caused by the strike settled, and that the Commission would set to work at once.  The Commission did set to work at once, and they thought the matter was so very urgent that they determined to issue a report upon this particular phase of the question alone before they went into the whole matter of the re-organisation within the Post Office.  That report was presented on the 14th December, 1922, and exactly on the 14th December, 1923, we have this report dated and issued by the Postmaster-General.</P>
    <P>Now, I think it is due to the Dáil that some explanation should be given as to the reason for that altogether unwarranted delay in dealing with this very urgent matter.  But there is another matter, and it is a matter of very great importance indeed, and raises, to my mind, a question of Constitutional practice. The Postmaster-General is an External Minister, and the Postmaster-General, as such, is responsible directly to this House, and the House is entitled to know whether this is or is not the decision of the Postmaster-General or of the Government as a whole.  Questions put to the Postmaster-General during the year as to what was being done with the report drew forth very remarkable answers in this connection.  I have not the exact quotations before me at the moment, but I distinctly remember on one occasion the Postmaster-General in answering a question as to when the report might be issued saying &ldquo;it was being considered by the Executive and that, in future, questions on that matter should be addressed to the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  If that is the position, then it is a position upon which this House is entitled to have a very clear and straightforward statement.  I hold that if the Postmaster-General, as an External Minister, is to carry out the intentions of the Constitution, his decision should be reported to this House, and not to the Executive.  He is responsible to this House in the first instance.  It is, of course, open to this House to accept or reject the decision of the Postmaster-General, and it is also open to the Executive Government or <Col N="332" /> to the Minister for Finance, if, for instance, it is a matter of expenditure that is involved, when the report is being considered, to say whether he, as Minister for Finance, is prepared to give the money that is necessary to carry out the requirements of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>That would be a perfectly constitutional position for the Minister for Finance to take up, but that point of view should be put before the Dáil, and it should be for the Dáil to decide whether or not the Minister for Finance was making a good case; but my contention is that the report should come direct to the Dáil, in the first place, and that the Dáil should be the first to make a decision on it.  Instead of that, we have really and, in fact, no report at all made to the Dáil.  What I mean is that the Dáil was not given a chance to come to any decision on the matter. If some member did not think it right to move a motion of this kind, then we would have no decision at all.  Surely it cannot be argued, as it was attempted to be argued on a previous occasion, that the Dáil is now given a chance of expressing its point of view on this particular recommendation or report.  That argument was used on a previous occasion when we were discussing another matter which was brought up for discussion and decision by a private member. This was simply read out as a report to the Dáil, a report of a decision of the Government apparently.  It is signed certainly by the Postmaster-General, but I hold it was the duty of the Postmaster-General to come to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;I have made such and such a decision on the recommendation of the Postal Commission, and I now put it before the Dáil to approve of it or reject it.&rdquo;  I hold that that was the constitutional position, and I think we should know from the Postmaster-General, or from the Government, why that position has been departed from, as apparently it has been departed from in connection with this report.  I formally move the motion in my name.</P>

      <P>I must, at the outset, express <Col N="333" /> my appreciation of the very fair and impartial presentation of this case by the proposer of the motion.  Knowing the case as I do, I have no hesitation in saying that there has been no exaggeration on his part.  It is true he has undoubtedly endeavoured to add a certain weight to the view-point held by the sorting clerks and telegraphists, affected by this recommendation, but, on the whole, as I have said, his presentation of the position has been fair and just.  Now, it may be necessary for the Dáil, at this stage, to get a short indication of the various steps taken prior to&mdash;that is to say, during the time of the interim report and subsequent to that interim report&mdash;the time of the production of the main report which is now before the Dáil.  I mention that just for the guidance of members. A Commission was appointed by the Government on the 5th March, 1922.  Four public sittings were held during the month of April, and an interim report was furnished to the Government on the 11th May, 1922.  The report was accepted by the Government on the 3rd June, 1922.  At this stage, and because of a difference of interpretation between the official of the Post Office and the Government, that very regrettable incident in the life of the Post Office ensued&mdash;the strike that has been referred to.  Immediately after the settlement of that strike a re-organised Commission got to work.  Its sittings were resumed on the 31st October, 1922.  Ten public sittings, and fourteen private meetings were held between the 31st October and the 13th December of that year.  A report, with recommendations, was furnished to the Government on the 14th December, 1922, and the Government's decisions on these recommendations were submitted to the Oireachtas on the 13th December, 1923.  I will admit, at the outset, that the delay of twelve months would appear unreasonable, and I regret personally that this delay occurred, but one must remember that the country was, in the interval, passing through a very critical period when the time and attention of the then Minister for Finance was very fully occupied indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that would be a reasonable <Col N="334" /> explanation, or at least in part, an explanation for the unavoidable delay in the production of this report or of its findings.  As a further preliminary to our discussions, and in order that the various complications not easily understood by the layman may perhaps have some light thrown on them, I might say that there were only two main classes in the original report.  These were the Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists and Postmen engaged in head and salaried offices.  There are several other classes in the Post Office, and these we had intended to consider in the second part of the report.  When that second stage will be reached I cannot say.  It is, I presume, a matter between the Commission and the Government itself. At any rate only two of the many classes are considered in the report with which we are now dealing.  The following classes have yet to be considered in case the Commission should sit again: Engineering, Supervising, Telephones, Auxiliary and Rural Postmen, Postmasters, Sub-Postmasters, Stores, Cleaners and Labourers.  For the further simplification of this matter, and that we may be spared the covering of multifarious terms and figures, I propose to speak of the two main classes, and these are, Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists and Postmen, only in their relation to Class A.  There are three classes involved in these two big Departments or grades.  Class A applies to Dublin only. Class B includes such large offices as Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not called Class 1 and 2 and not Class A and B?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>They are sometimes called 1, 2, 3 and sometimes Class A, B, C, but if the Deputy desires we will call them by their numerical prefix. Class 2, as I said, includes such offices as Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Class 3 takes in the smaller head offices and the salaried sub-offices. Now, Class 2 receives either in the case of the Postmen, Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists a lower proportionate wage than Class 1, and Class 3 received a still lower proportionate wage than <Col N="335" /> Class 2.  Therefore, when we deal with figures as we find them before the Commission and with the Commission's figures, and with the ultimate findings of the Government we propose to bear in mind the fact that Classes 2 and 3 are in all cases proportionately lower than Class 1.  One would be inclined to infer from the statements made by Deputy O'Connell that this particular Commission had functions other than to inquire into and report as to whether any alterations were desirable in the conditions of those particular classes.  One would, in fact, be inclined to believe that this Commission had all the powers and duties of an arbitration committee.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I do not think I said anything that would lead the Postmaster-General to that conclusion.  If I did I certainly did not intend it.  I did not believe for a moment that the Commission was appointed as an arbitration board, or that the Government was bound to accept its findings.  But I say it was unwise on the part of the Government not to have accepted its findings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it will be understood that this Commission had precisely the same powers and responsibilities as many previous Commissions which decided Post Office grievances. At least those powers and responsibilities were accepted, I presume, in that sense by the staff as well as they were accepted by us.  While the Government did not see its way to approve of the entire recommendations of the Commission, I must, at once, say that their recommendations have offered channels of improvement to postal officials hitherto untouched by any Commission called upon to perform like functions.  While on the Commission, it is well to refer to some of the findings of previous Commissions working with a very different balance sheet from that which has obtained in this country, and considering the very same subjects which this Commission was called upon to consider. In 1903 as a result of an agitation, not perhaps so advanced as we were faced with, but, nevertheless, an agitation based on the same sort of <Col N="336" /> grievances, the British Government appointed what was known as the Bradford Commission.  The Bradford Commission recommended pretty general increases, but the Government entirely repudiated its findings.  At this time the British Post Office had a solid balance to its annual earning credit.  In 1905 it appointed a second Commission, known as the Stanley Commission, and the net result of the British Government findings, from the standpoint of sorting clerks and telegraphists, not only in England but in this country, resulted only in an additional increment of 2/6 at the age of 25 years.  Nothing whatever at the maximum.  In 1908 it appointed a third Commission.  This was known as the Hobhouse Commission, and, notwithstanding any recommendations made by the Hobhouse Commission, the sorting clerks and telegraphists gained not one solitary penny at their maximum. In 1914 it appointed a Holt Commission and though I cannot say off-hand what that Commission recommended in the way of increase, the ultimate result from the standpoint of the postal service was only an increase of 2/- as a maximum.  At this particular stage the British Government had netted 6¼ millions of money from the Post Office during that particular year.  In 1920 the Whitley Commission was appointed and the net result from the postal service point of view, speaking still of the sorting clerks and telegraphists was an increase of 3/- at the maximum. Now, all this thing goes to show that the British Government, and the British public, who have had ample time to consider whether the manipulative classes in the Post Office were in receipt of a fair and accurate wage for the work performed, came to the conclusion that they were sufficiently well paid.  All these Commissions, notwithstanding the small apologies which I have recited here, apologies which apply only to the maximum, and the maximum in the Post Office at any rate is not reached for a very considerable number of years, all these apologies go to prove that there is no case whatever for the increase in the pay of the manipulative classes of the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the outset of the Free State administration we have been considering <Col N="337" /> whether some departure from the former allocation of postal functions was not desirable, and whether it was equitable to pay for the manipulative work of telegraphy and letter sorting on the same level as for those higher and more onerous duties involved at the counters and in the registered letter and the clerical departments.  We believed the time had come when some demarcation line should be drawn, mainly because of the development of the service between those higher and more responsible functions, to which I have referred, and the lower or mechanical functions common to the sorting clerk.  Likewise we had to consider whether it was really imperative to maintain the old system whereby an intelligent postman would advance to the category of sorter where there was no real justification for barring his further promotion, were he found fitted for the added responsibility.</P>
    <P>I must confess that amongst the heads of Departments whose ideas on many other subjects were not in common, I found very common sympathy on this one idea, that the time had come for the creation of a new class within the service&mdash;in other words, the re-grading and the re-classification of the service.  Had there been no strike, and had there been no agitation, I am satisfied that the Government would have accepted recommendations bearing very largely on the ones they have accepted now, had we submitted them.  Re-grading and re-classification are unquestionably essential to the better administration of the department, apart altogether from the fact that they give the more able elements in the service an opportunity of showing their merit and being paid accordingly.  We submitted those re-organisation and re-classification schemes to the Commission, and now it is said that the Commission's report has been rejected.  One would imagine, from what one saw in the Press and official journals, that that was the case.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report has not been rejected.  It has been modified, but the modification is not altogether detrimental to the staff.  For instance, the Commission recommended that clerical work in the Secretary's Office, <Col N="338" /> at present performed by a definite grade common to other services, and in receipt of the maximum of £237 10s. per year, should, in future, be performed by sorting clerks and telegraphists, promoted by selection from the manipulative classes, and that their maximum should not be £237 10s., but £220.  I do not intend to refer to the mode of selection for headquarters staffs in the past. It is not my affair, as it was prior to our time.  We have come to the conclusion here that the best work in this headquarters department is provided by men who have been through the mill, men who have worked in the service. I think they are far more valuable instruments in the discharge of higher functions of the service than those other people who are brought in from the outside, uninitiated in the many intricacies of the postal service in general.</P>
    <P>For that reason, and because of our decision in relation thereto, I think it could be taken for granted that in future the plums of headquarters establishments will be practically entirely, if not entirely, confined to recruits from the service itself.  These recruits will not terminate at the maximum suggested by the Commission, but the higher maximum of £237 10s.  If that is not a definite gain for the postal workers, beyond what the Commission anticipated, I must be making a very grave mistake indeed.  There is another class of clerical duties associated with the sorting clerk and telegraphist.  These duties are known in the Head Office as writing duties; and associated with these duties are such responsibilities as I referred to a while ago, which need a special type of man.  That would include those on counter duties, registered letter duties, men engaged in stores, and, perhaps, one or two other sections.  The Commission agreed with our view that these particular sections ought to be segregated because of their importance, but they recommended that those who should pass on to these sections ought to advance to a maximum of £220.  We are not prepared to accept that view.  We feel there is the responsibility lying midway, so to speak, between the manipulative and the <Col N="339" /> headquarters classes, and therefore it ought to carry intermediate pay on an intermediate scale.  The Commission's recommendation for these particular classes were on a par with those of the higher classes.  We declined to accept that proposal, and create a new class with a maximum, not of £220, but £182 10s.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I referred to the method of selection for the higher clerical duties, or at any rate, my reference to it might be open to misconception. What we intend to do in regard to the filling of these vacancies in the Headquarters Department, is to follow the rule operating in the present British service, which has proved to be a good one.  It will be admitted generally, that men engaged in the Headquarters Department will need to be big men of outstanding ability, who come in, so to speak, at the foot of the class and work their passage up, becoming acquainted, in the meantime, with the heavy work involved in these Departments.  It is our opinion that the Headquarters Department shall be recruited by competition within the service.  I am not in a position to state what the age limit or the syllabus will be.  It will, in the main, follow the lines laid down by our predecessors.  It is a distinct gain, and I am sure it will be regarded as such by the Postal officials, who hitherto regarded these appointments as practically a closed borough.  With regard to the postmen, the Government, of course, could not see its way to increase their maximum or their increments. In other words, postmen engaged in the work of delivering letters, a work which applied to them formerly, will in future continue on the same scale as has operated in the past, for the reason that the Government believes that this country cannot well afford to make a departure in salary from the same classes of work which so many Commissions investigating the matter in the past could not depart from.</P>
    <P>There is another class of postman called upon to undertake in the future the work of sorting.  The Commission recommended that this particular class should enjoy an increased maximum prior to reaching the present postmen's <Col N="340" /> maximum, which is 41/- a week in Dublin, and that in addition to that variation of increment the maximum should be advanced from 41/- to 52/-.  This was a rather generous anticipation on the part of the Commission, to say the least of it.  There is not much difference on the whole between the work done at present by the postman, and that mechanical work of letter division and letter sorting which they are called upon to do in future.  The fact that the Government accepted a maximum not of 52/- but of 48/- is, I believe, treating the proposal in a very generous spirit.  I may say that this maximum and that applicable to the new class of Clerical Writers, and to the manipulative classes, were sent in by me and accepted by the Government. There is only one grievance which could possibly be advanced here, and naturally Deputy O'Connell developed it to the utmost, and that is the recommendation to the effect that the manipulative classes which continue to perform the same functions in the future as in the past should enjoy an increased maximum of something approximating to an annual increment.  The proposal does not involve a great deal of money &mdash;something like £20,000&mdash;but were it accepted it would place the maximum of these men performing the same work in the future as in the past on a higher scale in this country than that in the North-East or in Britain.  I do not say that was the reason why it was rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my opinion.  I may say this: being responsible for the administration and naturally anxious for the fullest co-operation on the part of the staff&mdash;I am speaking on my own responsibility and ignoring the point of view of the Minister for Finance&mdash; that I would have been very pleased if <Col N="341" /> the Minister for Finance conceded this recommendation.  In that connection I stood alone in taking the view that it might ultimately benefit the service to concede the particular increment.  That the Minister for Finance has found it necessary to take a different view, many people will feel that perhaps he has followed the proper course.  I stood alone in thinking that it might not be a financial loss to the service to have accepted that increment, but I must necessarily, as a Minister, subordinate my views to the general good of the country, or at any rate to the financial good.  When the Minister for Finance thinks that a certain line is necessary for the maintenance of a common financial policy, I must, in common with all other Ministers, cut my cloth to suit the conditions set forth by him.  That is the only point of real solid grievance in this Report&mdash;this small increment applicable to a percentage of the manipulative classes. The Deputy who introduced the Motion referred to the fact that we had not taken into account what he considered to be one of the most important decisions of the Commission, namely, the appointment of an Arbitration Board to discuss differences.  This matter received very careful consideration at our hands.  It follows in the main on the system initiated by the British Government some time ago known as the Whitley Council.  That Council, in my opinion, has brought far more trouble into the Civil Service than existed prior to its institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own feeling is that an Arbitration Board&mdash;at any rate an Arbitration Board as far as the Post Office is concerned&mdash;were it introduced into our service would ultimately be subversive of control and administration.  That acts on two points.  I think&mdash;and it may be a regrettable fact to have to admit &mdash;that the freedom with which I extended discussions with the staff prior to the strike of 1922 was in a very large measure responsible for that strike.  Had I stood aloof and refused to discuss these matters and insisted that those matters should come through the regular channel and kept the staff at arms' length, I feel that the strike would never have materialised.  I am resolutely opposed to any intervention <Col N="342" /> of the staff in the administration of the Department.  The staff, if it likes, could bring its case here.  I am sure there is no shortage of willing hands to ventilate any grievance on the assumption that my ruling is arbitrary. They can, on the other hand, after having discussed any particular phase with my subordinates, appeal to me, and my function in this respect is not that of an owner of a concern but the medium between the public and the staff, and I have no personal interest in seeing that employees should be unfairly treated.  I think it will be generally conceded, as far as I am personally concerned, that I have never, here or elsewhere, said a hard thing about my employees.  I must insist that the institution of an arbitration court such as this Commission recommends, is not desirable.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I may point out to the Postmaster-General that there was no such recommendation as he suggests. I will read the recommendation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They, therefore, strongly urge that an attempt be made to provide machinery which will facilitate the adjustment of differences between the staff and administration.  Such machinery will be valueless unless it is worked in a spirit of co-operation and any councils that may be set up to be regarded as a medium for consultation, and for constructive suggestions, and not merely for the ventilation of grievances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Any suggestion which the Postmaster-General made that the staff claimed to intervene in arbitration was not suggested by the Commission.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt in the world that the beginning would be pious and nice, but that the end would be big and awkward.  It is the same thing in the long run.  We have not rejected this Commission's report.  We have offered a field of advancement to a very considerable section of the staff. Ultimately, anything from thirty to forty per cent. of the employees in those two main classes will be advanced to a scale far beyond anything they had anticipated, and they are fortunate in <Col N="343" /> finding that this Dáil is not unfavourable to the acceptance of those proposals, considering the state of the country.  I shall not refer to the loss on the service, but to suggest at this stage of our administration, and at this stage of the country's existence, that any added burden sought to be placed on this service is a matter which will be stoutly resisted not only by the Post Office itself, but by the country.  I think we have done the best, not only for the staff, but for the service and for the country.  We have a desire to bring about the rectification of work which must necessarily and ultimately mean greater efficiency in the discharge of the work of this public department, and above all we have found a means whereby the men will be paid in strict accord with their value and with their work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with, I want to deal with an aspect of this case which arises out of the statement of the Postmaster-General and goes a little beyond the report under discussion.  The report is signed by the Postmaster-General, and is headed: &ldquo;Government's Decision,&rdquo; and right through the report references are made to the Government&mdash;&ldquo;most careful consideration by the Government for many months past&rdquo;; &ldquo;decisions of the Government on the Commission's recommendations,&rdquo; and so on.  The Postmaster-General, following upon the instructions of the Constitution, is appointed by the Dáil to be the responsible head of the Postal Administration in this country, the responsible head of the department, or departments, under his charge, individually responsible to Dáil Eireann alone for the administration of the department of which he is the head.  One would have thought in such a case, that being his charter and responsibility in a matter affecting the administration of his department of such moment as this he would have made his report and decision directly to the Dáil and not try to shelve his responsibility upon the Government and later upon the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has told the Dáil, that body to <Col N="344" /> which he is directly responsible alone, that, in his opinion, ultimate benefit to the service would be achieved by agreeing to a certain increment.  Then he said: &ldquo;I stand alone in thinking it may not be a financial loss to give this increase.&rdquo;  He tells the Dáil that the responsible head of the Department does not believe that a certain course would result in financial loss, and that, in fact, he recommends it.  But he tells us that he has been over-ruled by another person, namely, the Minister for Finance.  That is not the position that he was placed in by the Dáil when he was appointed Postmaster-General, responsible to the Dáil directly, and to the Dáil alone, for the administration of this Department.</P>
    <P>According to this morning's newspapers, there were references in the Seanad yesterday to nibbling at the Constitution.  I had occasion, two or three weeks ago, to suggest that there were growing evidences of the subordination of the External Ministers, the non-Executive Ministers, to the Executive Council.  There was an attempt to repudiate that suggestion.  But here we have a clear confession that one Minister, voluntarily and willingly, acceded to that subordination.  I say that is not treating the Dáil as the Dáil should have been treated, in accordance with the constitutional requirements. It is not merely nibbling at the Constitution, but is biting chunks out of it.</P>
    <P>I can see that the movement, is to avoid the will of the Dáil in setting up the Constitution, to evade, rather, the will of the Dáil, when it set up the Constitution; in fact, to make these non-Executive Ministers subordinate in effect to the Executive Council.  I say that the Dáil ought to insist, when it decides that a Minister shall be put into an office responsible to the Dáil directly, that that Minister must report to the Dáil, take the responsibility himself for any recommendations he makes, and not say that the Executive will not agree to this, or that the Minister for Finance will not agree to that. If, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, he says that such a thing is not desirable let him say so, and that he has the responsibility.  Let him recommend it accordingly.  If, on the <Col N="345" /> other hand, he says that a certain course of action will lead to the proper administration of the Department for which he is responsible, let him come to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;I recommend that,&rdquo; and then let the Dáil decide between the Minister for Finance and the Minister responsible for the Department which is not ruled by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>I could not help but think when the Minister was speaking that there is probably developing at this moment, on the other side of the water, a discussion, not in surroundings such as this, but in regard to a difference of opinion as to the claims of one set of men which have been reported upon by a Commission, or a Committee, such as this.  This Committee was set up in circumstances which are fairly familiar. It is not claimed that it was an Arbitration Court, and that its findings must, inevitably, be agreed to.  But, it was a Commission that was set up with a certain character and authority, especially in view of the manner in which the Commission was appointed, to report.</P>
    <P>There was a reasonable expectation in the minds of the public, and of the parties concerned, that the report of that Commission would be adopted.  I am admitting that it is not incumbent on either party to accept the findings of that Commission.  But take the parallel case.  The Committee was set up to inquire into the claims of the employers of the railwaymen in England, to determine questions in dispute regarding wages and conditions.  Similar machinery has been agreed upon between railwaymen and railway employers in Ireland.  The analogy may come home a little closer.  The Commission, or Board, or Committee of Inquiry, whatever you like to call it, in connection with the railways, after fully discussing the claims of the companies, for reductions in wages and alterations of conditions, made a report.  The report was unanimously agreed to by the members of the court, just as this Commission's report was.</P>
    <P>Again, like this Commission, nobody pretends that the report and the decision of that Committee was binding on both parties, or either party, except <Col N="346" /> with that moral bond which, it was believed and hoped, would be enforced by public opinion.  One of the sections of one of the parties in connection with the railway dispute has decided not to accept the findings of that Commission, and we read criticism that is levelled against these men for their action.</P>
    <P>In this other Commission one of the parties has repudiated the findings.  He says, &ldquo;We are prepared to accept some of the findings (just like the railway companies or the railwaymen), but we are not prepared to accept the report of the Commission, and consequently the matter is as you were.&rdquo;  Does the Minister think that that is a desirable state of affairs or a good example to set in view of all the recommendations that are being made about conciliation and arbitration, &ldquo;look before you leap,&rdquo;&ldquo;consider before you strike,&rdquo; and all such propositions; if it is considered that an Inquiry of this kind, not, I agree, by a Committee which has authority to enforce an award, but giving careful consideration to every aspect, should be thrown over?  It is, I suggest, a bad example to set, and a headline which probably you would advise should not be copied by other people.</P>
    <P>One would have imagined that when the Postmaster-General comes to the Dáil to discuss the case, that he would place before us, and have told us what would have been the cost to the Postal Department of the increases that were recommended, and what will be the saving resulting from the changes he proposes, as compared with the recommendations which were made.  He does not do that.  He brings no budget. He gives no financial justification for his refusal, and I want to remind the Dáil, that in the view of the Commission, and in the view of very able and competent men, the recommendations which they make would not add to the cost of the administration of the Department to any extent whatever. The Minister has not attempted to refute that, but he has recommended to the Dáil certain proposals which by inference will reduce the cost of the administration and reduce it, as it must be, at the expense of the staff.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to remember the dates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> The report of this Commission is dated December, 1922, somewhat over a year ago.  The difficulties which led to the appointment of the Commission were difficulties of a financial kind.  The complaint was that the cost of living had increased disproportionately to the increase in pay, that as a matter of fact and as the Minister frankly acknowledges, the pay of the postal servants at that time was unsatisfactory.  Commission after Commission had recommended improvements, but not one of them had been conceded.  In December, 1922, a state of things had occurred, arising out of the financial disabilities which led to the trouble, that finally resulted in the setting up of this Commission.  In most cases, when there have been suggestions of reductions in the cost of administration and reductions in pay in recent months, they have been justified by reference to the cost of living.  Here you have a Report of a Commission making certain suggestions for a permanent scale, and recommending a definite scale of basic wages, to meet the ordinary requirements of men of the various classes, in consideration of the standard of life which they are reasonably expected to maintain.  Since that time there has practically been no change in the cost of living.  There is a certain stability apparently in regard to prices during the last 12 months. That being the case, I want to know what is the justification for reducing the standards below those recommended by the Commission, when it has been already admitted frankly that the previous scales were unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am not going to attempt to go into the details of the various classes, grades and rates of pay.  I have heard what the Postmaster-General has to say in defence of his report.  I take it, in view of his verbal acceptance of responsibility, that this is his report to the Dáil, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, that he is prepared to stand over the decision of the Government, and that in fact it is his decision.  I ask the Dáil to agree in this matter with the resolution, that the decision is not a wise one in view of the recommendations of the Commission, <Col N="348" /> and that in effect the Dáil should refer back the decision to the Postmaster-General, and ask him to have a further consultation with the Minister for Finance, and if he cannot agree then, to come and report again that the Minister for Finance will not agree to his decision respecting his Department, and then leave judgment, as between the two, the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the Postmaster-General's contention that the men and women concerned are not going to lose much, if his contention is a sound one. It is equally obvious, if that is a valid argument, that they will not gain much, and, therefore, the cost will not be great if the recommendations of the Commission are adopted.  I will ask the Dáil to believe this, that if the cost is not great, it is better for the future of the postal service and for the example which would be set by the acceptance of the report of an impartial Commission of this kind, that the ultimate cost to the community of the rejection of such a report will be very much greater in its effects that any monetary loss which might be sustained by accepting the report in preference to the scale which has been decided upon by the Postmaster-General.</P>

      <P>I know something of the matter under discussion, and the question at issue, and, to some extent, while I follow the arguments of Deputy Johnson, I do not quite agree with him in all his conclusions, but I think he is entitled to raise the question.  The Government appointed a Commission to inquire into these matters, and it has reported in a certain direction, and I think that the Postmaster-General is not entitled to say that the Minister for Finance prevents him from carrying out the recommendations of that Commission. The Postmaster-General's department is one of the few in the Saorstát that I have come personally in contact with.  I have the most perfect confidence in his judgment and in his sense of fair play, and in this matter, when he informed the Dáil that it is not one he had to deal with but was for the Minister for Finance, I think it is a matter we should take into consideration. The Minister for Finance has got <Col N="349" /> ten millions of money, and the Attorney-General has got his share of it.  I hope I am not wronging the Attorney-General. Unless I am mistaken, the Postmaster-General has told the Dáil that the whole matter in dispute is £20,000.  A sum of £20,000 for a large and efficient department of the State, which should be conducted in a contented spirit, should not stand in the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to say a great deal about this particular matter.  The Postmaster-General has dealt with it very fully. With reference to the biting of chunks out of the Constitution, I think that Deputy Johnson knows very well that there has been no interference with the constitutional position, and I do not think that he will produce any break in the ranks by any attempt to magnify the difference of the point of view between the two departments when a matter like this comes up to be considered. No Minister, whether an External Minister or a Minister under the Executive Council, can undertake increased expenditure or raise wages and salaries without the sanction of the Minister for Finance, and I think that the Dáil will agree that that is an absolutely essential precaution.  If it were not so, I think it would be impossible to keep any satisfactory control of public expenditure. Responsibility in these matters must be on the shoulders of some one person who will see that there is co-ordination between the various departments of Government, and that we do not have salaries run up in one Department, providing an argument for the increase of salaries in another, without the Dáil or, in fact, anybody being aware of what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was absolutely no reason why the Government should regard itself as bound to accept the recommendations of this Commission.  The Government was bound to give the most careful consideration to the recommendations; not to turn them down lightly; not to ignore the feeling which they represented.  I can say from my own knowledge, because I heard the matter discussed a great deal before I entered the Department of Finance at all, that I know that the recommendations <Col N="350" /> of the Commission were not lightly departed from.  But the Government has responsibilities which the Commission had not.  The Commission had no responsibility for seeing that our budget balances. The Commission had no responsibility to the taxpayer to keep down taxation or to prevent the burden of taxation from being increased. The Government has to take into account various matters which the Commission was not called upon to take into account, and which a Commission in the ordinary way would not take into account, and in the ordinary course of events the recommendations of any Commission can only be a basis upon which a Government can consider the matter and come to a decision. There are two main matters, I think, on which the Government differed from the Commission.  The Government did accept the main recommendation of the Commission in regard to reorganisation, which was really a recommendation of the Post Office itself to the Commission, and in regard to a redistribution of work.  The main points of difference were in regard to the Class B postmen.  The wages at present paid to the postmen doing ordinary postmen's work here are the same as those paid in the big cities of England. We have a Post Office which actually makes a loss, and which is, therefore, a burden to that extent on the ordinary taxpayer.  We have higher taxation than in Great Britain.  It seems, on the face of it, ridiculous to suggest that we should increase the wages of our postmen above the rate in the big English cities with a Post Office that is losing while the British Post Office is making, and with taxation higher than Great Britain.  Deputy O'Connell did not, I think, attempt to defend the recommendation of the Commission that they should be so increased.  He simply said that the Commission did not think that 43/- was too much.  He did not make any arguments in favour of the Commission's Report.  The other matter was in regard to the class of Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists mentioned by the Postmaster-General. Again we do not feel that when there is no new work, or no higher grade of work being given, that any case has <Col N="351" /> been made for an increase in the salaries. No doubt, it would have pleased the officials.  I do not know what measure of contentment it would have brought, but we are not in a position to throw out considerable sums of money to please any particular class.</P>
    <P>My own opinion is that a great deal of the discontent in the Post Office arose out of the insubordination that grew up during the years we have passed through.  It was because they were insubordinate and were allowed to do all sort of things that they should not have been allowed to do and were not hopped on when they should have been hopped on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be, but I really think the particular discontent was not by any means a question of wages, or mainly of wages.  It arose out of other causes.  We have heard a great deal of talk about wages.  They have been continually mentioned, but the wage mentioned has always been the basic wage.  Deputies should realise that the wages paid are very much higher than the figure mentioned.  For instance, a postman at present gets to a wage of 40/-, but that is actually 71/8. The Commission recommended that he should go to 43/-, and that means that he should go to 75/10.  It seems to me that for the ordinary postman delivering letters 71/8 is a wage we do not need to justify not increasing.  In addition to that, the postmen have continuity of employment, pensions, uniforms, and, as somebody said, they get Christmas boxes.  There is no reason really in the arguments of Deputy O'Connell.  With regard to Class A postmen, the men who are being promoted to do the work formerly done by sorting clerks, the Commission recommend they should go to 52/-, which is really 88/5.  We decided to let the maximum be 48/-, which actually gives them a wage of 82/10 per week, and it seems to me that 82/10 is quite adequate for the work, which is of a very simple and mechanical nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale begins, at the age of 18, at 20/-, which gives 37/11, and that for a boy of eighteen delivering letters, is certainly, in all the circumstances of the country, an ample wage.  My own feelings about the matter is, not that the Government have to defend their refusal to accept the recommendations of the Committee, but that anything we would have to defend would be in going so far as we did, having regard to all the circumstances of the country, towards accepting them.  We might very well have refused to go as far as we did. We have enabled men in the Post Office, who are capable of doing it, to go a great deal further up the scale than they previously could have done, or than they had any hope at all of being able to reach.  There was a great deal of delay in dealing with this Report, but the circumstances of the country were such that we had work that was really more urgent, and far more important, to do, and, perhaps, if we had dealt with this matter very hastily it would have been more displeasing to Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Johnson than the way in which we actually did deal with it.  The Postal officials will have in the future opportunities that they have not had in the past. They will be able to get on the headquarters work that previously was done by other classes.  Those who are able to do that work will be promoted to do it, and a large number of them will get that promotion, and will be enabled to enter the Clerical Class, and <Col N="353" /> will go up if the present scale remains to something like £237 10s. per annum. As a matter of fact, it is very probable we will not retain that maximum at all for the Clerical Classes outside the Post Office.  The matter is under consideration, and it is most probable that that maximum will be reduced, so that the scale running to £182 10s. per annum, which will be given to those doing duties in headquarter offices, is even more favourable.  With regard to the Commission's recommendation to give an advance of 3/6 a week to any postman put on Grade A whose wages were 29/- a week or less, and an increase of 5/- if his wages exceeded 29/-, what the Government has done is to give one increment, and that is the usual thing in the Civil Service.  I think there was no justification for a recommendation for anything more than that.  I do not want to say anything about the work of the Commission. They, no doubt, spent a great deal of time on it and went to a great deal of trouble, and I think the members of the Commission deserve the thanks of the public for doing the work, but at the same time I must say that they certainly did not present a Report which any Government could have thought of accepting in its entirety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Postmaster-General rather implied that I was presenting the case entirely from the point of view of the officials of the Post Office.  I wish to disabuse the Dáil of any such misapprehension. I was presenting the case from the point of view of the unanimous report of the Commission, and that report fell very far short, in many respects, of the claims put forward by the Postal officials.  I did not presume to, I did not intend, and I actually did not present the case from the official point of view.  I attempted to justify the unanimous report of the Commission set up by the Government themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was more than surprised to hear the Postmaster-General, above anybody else, attempting to base his justification upon what had been done by the British Government in the past.  Surely the last man one would expect to hear that <Col N="354" /> from is the Postmaster-General?  He recited a whole litany of Commissions that had made recommendations under the previous régime, and he said the British Government did not accept these recommendations, and why be surprised because the Irish Government do not accept the recommendations of Commissions?  If that is the case, as it seems to me to be the one that the Postmaster-General presented, he forgot, in the first place, that we might hope to expect something better from an Irish Government than from a British Government, and he forgot especially that the very fact of all these recommendations having been made in the past, and having been turned down, went to show that the postal officials had a case, and very strong case, to look for increases.  And he proved, if proof were necessary, the statement I made in my opening speech, that in 30 years the only increase that had been given to postal officials amounted to an increase of 5/-, and that 3/- out of that 5/- was advanced in 1920.  I was especially interested to hear what he had to say as to the promotion of sorting clerks and telegraphists to the clerical grades in the Headquarters Office.  If the Postmaster-General is prepared to give an undertaking that all the vacancies in the Headquarters Offices will be filled through promotion from the sorting clerks and telegraphist class, then, that is, so far, satisfactory, and that was one of the things the Commission had aimed at&mdash;that these vacancies should be so filled.  But the position at the present time is very different from what the Commission had in mind.  The Commission were anxious, and I think the Department was anxious, judging by the evidence it put up, that the Post Office should be a self-contained institution, and that was the idea the Commission had in mind, and that men engaged in the higher grades in the clerical offices ought to be men who had worked their way up and had gone through the mill. But that is not the position at the present. There is nothing to prevent, under the present regulations, men being transferred from various other Departments, such as the Land Commission and the Education Department, or any <Col N="355" /> other Department, to the Post Office. There is what is known as the Treasury Class, engaged in the Secretary's Office, and in the higher administrative positions in the Post Office, and these are under the direct control, as it were, of the Treasury Department.  Now, these are the people who are paid up to the maximum of £237 10s.  If, as I say, there is an undertaking given that any vacancies occurring in that Department will in future be filled by men who worked their way up through the Post Office and have gone through the mill, it will go a long way towards removing a certain amount of the discontent that at present exists&mdash;discontent due to the fact that men find themselves up against a stone wall with all avenues to further promotion blocked&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general principle that method of selection will be applied. There may be a certain amount of reservation&mdash;I cannot possibly confine myself to an absolute rule in relation to it&mdash;but as a general principle that will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point in connection with that which is important to note.  I think in his statement the Postmaster-General said that these positions would be filled by competition within the service.  There is one thing in connection with that that I want to draw attention to, because the position is not exactly what it appears to be from that statement.  There may be competition, and there may be two men, or even six men, for a vacancy when it occurs.  One of the applicants may be at the top of his scale, and may be a man of 40 or 44 years of age, a highly efficient man, capable of doing all the work necessary in that particular post.  You may have another applicant, a young man, say, of 22 years of age, who has just entered the service. If you put these two men in competition for the post, there is no doubt as to who is going to get it.  The young man will get it, because he has just left school; and I suggest that it is not equitable or right that he should get this higher post and reach his maximum at that age.  I think these vacancies should be reserved for the man with <Col N="356" /> the senior service, if he is capable of doing the work.  The Postmaster-General, and the Minister for Finance also, I think, would have the Dáil believe that there was only a question of a difference of 4/- in this transfer of postmen to the higher work.  There is more than that in it.  There is the question of how soon they will reach that point, and at the moment what it will mean in effect is that although these men are transferred and turned on to do this higher class of work they will only benefit to the extent of 1/6 per week.  If that is not so, I would like to have the statement corrected, and in the case of the men who are not at their maximum they will get no increment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get one year's increment on being put into Grade A.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in the case of postmen transferred to sorting duty, it is intended to grant an immediate increment of 1/6, and in the case of sorting clerks similarly allocated to one of these special functions, there will be no departure except the officer has terminated 12 months as a maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the only increase they will get at the moment is 1/6, so that the figures that were quoted by the Minister for Finance are the maximum figures that will be reached only in five years hence.  As I have already explained, the Commission did not suggest an Arbitration Board which would have the powers usually attributed to an Arbitration Board, but it did suggest that it would be well that some machinery should be set up to facilitate the discussion and the adjustment of differences which would lead to harmony within the Post Office service.  That has been completely turned down by the Postmaster-General, but that of course is a new and growing fashion which we are getting used to, and no doubt it will help us to appreciate what native Government has brought us to.  Again, I would like to impress on those who listened to the Minister for Finance <Col N="357" /> speaking of the good wage paid to people delivering letters and telegrams around the country, that the figures given do not apply to these people. The wage referred to in every case, as pointed out by the Postmaster-General, refers to Dublin City alone.  In all other cases, such as Cork and Class 2 and Class 3 offices, under which country offices come in, there is a great difference, indeed, between what they are paid and the city rates.  The city rates were taken for the sake of convenient reference and illustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was genuinely surprised to hear the lecture on insubordination which we had from the Minister for Finance.  It <Col N="358" /> comes poorly, indeed, at this stage of our history to have these men who gave their services, such as they were, in the Post Office and incurred risk by giving them to the cause of the country, a cause which the Minister for Finance, and others, were advocating at the time, it is a poor thing I say that at this stage of our history the services they rendered should be thrown back in their teeth to-day.  If it were not for the insubordination of these men at that time we would not have the Secretary of the Post Office or the Postmaster-General where they are to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that on the motion for the adjournment, I would call attention to the desirability of postponing the striking of a rate for the current year until the Local Government elections are over.  I know what I am asking is unprecedented, and I know there are difficulties which will, no doubt, be stated by the Minister for Local Government; but I shall try to lay before the Dáil a few reasons why it <Col N="361" /> seems to me that what I suggest is a desirable course.  A short time ago we passed the Postponement of Local Elections Bill.  I, for one, did not realise&mdash; I dare say the other Deputies did not, and if the Minister did, he did not tell us so&mdash;that that would involve the existing Councils striking a rate for the coming year.  I am not intimately familiar with the procedure of Local Government.  I did not realise that when we postponed the elections over March that meant practically another year of office for the existing Councils. I think it is common ground that the existing Councils have, in some cases, been criticised.  Mr. Johnson will accept that, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to suggest that all the existing County Councils are bad, or are doing their business inefficiently.  There are cases in which Councils are not giving satisfaction, and that is very largely due to the circumstances under which they were elected three years ago.  They were elected in a time of stress, and in many cases, the members were not chosen for their familiarity with administration, but because they had comparatively little property on which the Crown Forces could retaliate.  I think that there is a general feeling in the country that those Councils have served their purpose, and have now outlived their usefulness.  In two cases, at least, that view was accepted by the Minister.  I refer to the County Councils of Leitrim and Kerry, and their functions are now being carried on by Commissioners appointed by the Local Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other cases where that course has not been taken, there has nevertheless been a considerable amount of criticism. In Dublin County, in regard to which I can speak with the greatest knowledge, the Minister held an inquiry, but the evidence was not sufficient to induce him to dissolve the Council.  Some of the conclusions arrived at by the Inspector indicate that the Council is at least not a perfect body.  In reference to one matter, exceeding <Col N="362" /> the limit that is allowed to be expended on road maintenance, the Inspector said it was a subject for surprise that a responsible body should have left the matter in an indefinite state and should proceed contrary to the sections of the Local Government Act of which they were aware.  His report says that the attitude of carelessness on the part of an official of the Council, and the toleration of that by the Council, was such as could not be expected from any responsible body. His conclusion is that the County Council have not failed in their duty as a County Council and they, at times, though apparently without wholeheartedness, tried to grapple with their many difficulties.  I think it is undesirable that a body that tries, halfheartedly at times, to grapple with their many difficulties, should have power to strike a rate that will bind the ratepayers for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I left this motion an open one in order that Deputies from other parts of the country could give their views. Now, these Councils are, I think, doomed, and therefore the members will have no particular reason to practise economy.  They may, for all we know, indulge in a last orgy of spending and I do not think that is fair to the ratepayers.  I do not think, when we passed the Bill I referred to, that we realised it would entail on the ratepayers the responsibility of paying the rate for another year at the standard which they have been facing in the past.  To-day, in reply to a question, the Minister pointed out some of the difficulties in the way, such as accumulating overdrafts and the interest on them that will have to come from the rates.  I make this suggestion: Expedite the local elections sufficiently so as to hold them in March before the date of the striking of the rate.  That seems to be fair to everybody.  The objection is put forward that the register is not ready.  Are there not worse things than an election on an old register?  After all, we had an election to the Dáil on a new register and every one of us found various complaints.  I would suggest that it is a greater grievance to have a rate struck for the ensuing year by a body which has ceased to <Col N="363" /> be representative than even to hold an election on the old register.</P>

      <P>In connection with this matter I made the suggestion on the Second Reading of the Rates Recovery Bill but the Minister did not seem to meet it.  Since that discussion it has come to my knowledge that in some counties, such as Carlow, whole masses of ratepayers, not alone farmers, are holding public meetings protesting against the rates.  The same thing may be said of Limerick, Dublin and Clare. Things are pretty bad in these counties. The amount of rates that has been struck in my county for an administration that is not better.  The same things are happening all over the country.  One county may have a rate which may be regarded as reasonable while the county over the border has an exorbitant rate, perhaps double or treble that of the other county, but has not as good roads or as good administration. I can promise the Minister in the collection of these rates, grave and serious trouble, and perhaps disorder, if the present Councils are allowed to strike rates for the present year, and he is also likely to have trouble in the collection of arrears in some of these counties.  That is a serious matter, and the feelings of the general body of the ratepayers should be taken into consideration.  I do not think that the suggestion of Deputy Cooper goes too far.  I think it does not go far enough. There is an extraordinary volume of opinion aroused all over the country on this question of rates and against the striking of a new rate by the present Co. Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether we would be in order or not on the Committee stage of this Bill to insert a new clause providing that the present Co. Councils cannot strike the new rates.  We will however try to do that.  I appeal to the Government to approach this question with a lot of care and consideration.  A lot of this expenditure was incurred in the counties largely through the inspiration of the members of the present Government.  A lot of these results of the damage and burnings have to be met by the County rates and they were <Col N="364" /> due to political reasons, not of course in every case, but to a large extent.  It is not at all a happy state of affairs, and the people are in open rebellion. They are not able to pay.  Too many of these high charges have been made in the last three or four years, and the position is one of which the Government had better take stock.</P>

      <P>I am entirely opposed to the attitude of Deputy Cooper and Deputy Gorey because, like the Minister for Local Government, I am wondering what is going to happen in the interval between March and May when it is suggested the elections should be held.  It has become very fashionable during the last few months to criticise local Councils.  This has been initiated by some of the newspapers in this country for no other purpose than to get the ascendancy class into power again. The Councils that are functioning were good enough to fight during the British regime and they played their part well in the Anglo-Irish war, and, so far as I know, they did everything they were told to do by Dáil Eireann which was looked upon at that time, by most of the people who are howling to-day, as an illegal body.  The Councils to-day are democratic and representative of the people.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Mr. Gorey, and I wonder that he would show his ignorance to such an extent as to suggest that the County Councils to-day are levying rates to pay for acts suggested by members of the present Government.  He ought to know that they are not levying rates for such things.  6d. in the pound is very small, and I think the Government acted very generously in that respect. I think it received the approval of every party in the Dáil, when it was suggested at the time the Bill was introduced. This talk of economy at present is so much pious cant.  The Councils have been carrying on under great difficulties during the past few years, and so far as I know, they are doing their best, Listening to such speeches as we have just heard, one would think that the representatives of <Col N="365" /> the people were deliberately throwing money away.  Deputy Cooper said something about the limits for road maintenance being overstepped.  I do not think that anybody could give an estimate of what the limit in road maintenance is in this country.  To my mind, we want a lot more money for road maintenance, and any Council that strikes a rate, as high as it can, for road maintenance, is doing its duty.</P>

      <P>I quite understand that Deputy Cooper used that particular quotation to strengthen his argument. As I said at the beginning; this economy stunt has been initiated by the newspapers, which took no care to make any investigation as to what they are talking about.  We had those same newspapers, who to-day are preaching economy to the Councils, preaching three or four years ago, patriotism of a very opposite kind to that which the Councils were trying to practise.  The Councils with which I am connected are doing the work which the people sent them to do.  There may, of course, be exceptions, but is the whole country to be held up for money in order that two or three black sheep are to be treated as they deserve?  The Local Government Department should keep an eye on the various Councils and see that they do not treat the ratepayers otherwise than they should, but so far as Deputy Cooper's suggestion is concerned, the Minister should not pay any attention to it.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has stolen my little thunder.  It is a fact that a rate must be made some time in the beginning of February, and must be struck some day not later than March.  If we are going to postpone the striking of a rate until the Local Government elections take place in June, I cannot see where the money is to be found to carry on local services.  We should take account, as far as we can, <Col N="366" /> of the difficulties that Councils have to contend with, and whilst they have done their duty in most cases to the ratepayers, I do not think that because two or three Councils have made default that the whole twenty-two or twenty-three Councils should be penalised for those three or four black sheep.  If the motion Deputy Cooper proposed were carried, it would leave the majority of the Councils of the Free State in a bankrupt condition.  I do not think that Deputy Cooper would like to see that state of affairs brought about.  I hope the Minister will not accede to that request and that the Councils will carry out what the law intended them to carry out&mdash;to make a rate according to the estimates submitted to them, and with due regard to economies, which, I hope, they will all practise.  The economy should be subservient to due consideration of the work which has to be done.</P>

      <P>I will pay Deputy Corish the compliment of saying that in the county in which he has an official connection with public bodies the administration is everything that might be expected, but there are counties where the same cannot be said.  I rise to make a suggestion to the Minister of finding a way out of the difficulty, because I realise we cannot let the public utilities lapse for want of money.  I would ask the Minister to place a limit beyond which they cannot go on those extravagant Councils.  We hear a lot of talk about the cost of living.  I would ask the Minister to apply that doctrine to the rates to be struck in the near future.  For example, if in 1914 the rate was 1/-, 80 points above a shilling ought to be the rate at the present time.  In some counties it will be less.  In counties where there is extravagance he could put a veto on the rate and tell the Councils they must not exceed a certain figure.  We, as farmers, are not getting 80; we are getting 30 points.  I think if he adopted that suggestion we would carry on and at the same time put some check on the expenditure in many cases.</P>

      <P>Major Cooper, in drawing attention to this matter, has not tried to make any secret of his real intention, <Col N="367" /> to force an election at a date earlier than that on which it would be held under the new register.  I happen to be one of the members of the Dáil who, on several occasions, have drawn attention to the fact that arrears of rates have not been collected for many years.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see any election held for local Councils until the question of old outstanding rates has been finally cleared up.  If you are not going to put the machinery at the disposal of the Government behind the local bodies in insisting on the collection of outstanding rates and you allow the elections to be held before these rates are collected you will introduce into the elections many things that will injure local administration.  You will have people asking their representatives whether they are going to assist in the collection of outstanding rates.  It is a serious thing if those issues are going to be introduced into the elections.  I trust the Minister will insist on the collection of all outstanding rates before any County Council elections are held.</P>

      <P>As one who has taken part for some years in public administration, I was rather amused to hear Deputy Gorey and other people lecturing the present Councils, especially when they are making the threat that if an election is not held soon there would be a revolt.  Some people who want public services to be carried out always want an excuse for not paying their lawful debts.  The people we have to contend with are the people who in 1920 advised the different ratepayers not to pay rates to the County Councils, but to pay the money into banks and keep it there for a certain time until England had won.  England was beaten, not alone with the help of the gunmen but with the help of the civil population, and of the public bodies in Ireland.  Those people who carried out the Orders they received from the different ratepayers associations did not lodge their money to help the County Councils, but spent it.  There is, at present, two or three years' rates due by those parties, who were always having an excuse in order to escape their obligations.  Deputy Wilson asks the <Col N="368" /> Minister for Local Government to put a limit upon the rate to be struck. There is a distance you can go in striking rates.  There is no Council that will not endeavour to strike a rate sufficient to maintain the public services. I appeal to the Minister to have no election until those people who have been the enemies of the public bodies are forced to pay, in one way or another, the lawful debts that are due to the public bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the representatives of County Kildare I must say that a feeling approaching consternation exists at the prospect of having to continue to pay the present rate in that County.  In County Kildare two years ago, the annual budget amounted to £32,000.  The last rate amounted to £72,000.  The abolition of the system of road-repairing by contract, entails an increase of £10,000 on the rates of the County.  There never has been any organised opposition to the payment of rates in Kildare, but I have had it from rate collectors that there is an honest inability on the part of the ratepayers to pay the present rates.  If this policy of striking high rates is persisted in, it will drive a great number of farmers into a state of bankruptcy.  For that reason, I support the suggestion made by Deputy Cooper, and I hope the Government will see their way to agree to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke) MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper in his speech has wandered somewhat from the spirit or from the wording of his question to-day.  In that question he asked whether or not the Minister would consider the advisability of introducing legislation to postpone the striking of the rates for the current year until the new County and District Councils have been elected.  He has somewhat reversed the process now, and in doing so he is on a good deal much firmer ground than he was in asking the question.  I think the Deputy is fairly well satisfied with the answer I gave to his question.  He has now asked me to consider the possibility of having the Local Government elections at an earlier date than we anticipated.  In doing so, he and several other Deputies, have pleaded the <Col N="369" /> cause of the ratepayers, and the fact that they find the present rates a very heavy burden.  Representations have been made to me by several bodies of ratepayers throughout the country, and I have a certain amount of sympathy with the representations.</P>
      <P>I realise that there is a substratum of truth in those representations, but I am afraid, like Mark Twain's death, those representations were in many cases greatly exaggerated.  Farmers are pretty hard hit, and I know that they are dissatisfied with the present economic situation, but instead of trying to remedy their position by better organisation, and by bringing pressure to bear in other directions, they attack the rates because that is the most obvious and the easiest position to attack. The payment of rates is absolutely necessary if we are to maintain our position as a civilised country.  We cannot allow hospitals, road repairs and such things to be discontinued. Even if we were to discontinue the payment of rates, I do not think it would materially assist the farmers.  The real difficulty that I think the farmer has to face is that we have a double economic standard in Ireland at the present time.  The farmer has to sell in a foreign market, and for that reason he cannot call upon any protection whatsoever.  On the other hand, the cost of living in Ireland is determined by factors which are not opposed to the same competition as the farmer is. The retailer and the manufacturer in the Saorstát are more or less bolstered up, and for that reason the cost of living is much higher than the farmer's standard is able to support.  That is the real difficulty the farmer is faced with, and he is not going to get out of that difficulty by asking us to reduce rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present standard of rates is not so very high.  As a matter of fact, we have effected great reductions.  Owing to the amalgamation scheme, with the exception, I think, of County Kildare, where it has led to an increase, the reduction has amounted to 20 per cent. in the different counties.  That is the reduction in money for poor relief. With regard to road repairs, which is <Col N="370" /> another very costly service, the amount of money is certainly higher than it was in 1914-15, but if you take the cost of living into consideration, the amount expended on road repairs is very much less than it was in those years.  Deputy Cooper has referred to the exceeding of the limit of road expenditure. The limit of road expenditure was fixed in the nineties, and practically every estimate exceeds the limit&mdash;that is the statutory limit at the present time.  There is no good in making any capital out of that.</P>
    <P>I have got no fixed ideas and no particular desire to postpone the elections, but I think in the interest of all parties concerned it would be much better to postpone the elections until the new register is completed.  If we were to hold elections now they would have to be held on a register compiled in respect of a qualifying date ending the 15th October, 1922.  Conditions at that time were not very favourable for the compilation of a register, and, as well as that, it will be a very old register in any case.  For that reason alone I think it would be very inadvisable to hold the elections before the new register is completed.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies in the Farmers' Party have referred to the fact that some of our County Councils are not all that could be desired.  We are watching all these County Councils very closely and in any case where we consider they exceed the limit we take measures to get rid of them and to put in Commissioners.  That is a very drastic step, and naturally we are reluctant to take it, but I think Deputies need have no fear that we are going to allow excessive rates to be struck throughout the country this year.  As a matter of fact it is remarkable that in the rates that have been struck up to the present quite large reductions have been made.  One Rural District Council that has been very much commented upon is Balrothery.  I notice Balrothery, in its estimate, is coming down 45 per cent. this year.  This is a considerable reduction.</P>
