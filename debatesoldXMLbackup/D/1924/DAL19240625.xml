      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The demobilisation of Colonel Prout and the other officers referred to by me on 13th instant will appear in next Friday's issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and Colonel Prout will then receive an official notification of his demobilisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not officially reported in the <i>Herald.</i>  It was reported there by reason of a question being asked here.  If there be any lack of courtesy to Major-General Prout it is my responsibility.  In the ordinary way this particular notice should have been gazetted at an earlier date.  I myself held it up with a view to seeing if it would not be better that <Col N="2930" /> resignations should be asked for from those officers.  On inquiry I found that putting that request to the officers in question might admit of complications. If it had not been for my own action in holding up the gazetting of this particular demobilisation, it should have appeared ten days or a fortnight ago, and this particular incident would not have occurred.</P>

      <P>A circular letter was sent on the 12th March to all Clerks of the Peace requesting them to take special steps that there should be no delay in the signing of any decrees or reports made by the judges in their area.  The replies to this letter generally state that every effort would be made to speed up the matter, and since its issue the flow of reports and decrees into my Department has steadily increased.  The Deputy, of course, understands that in the first instance the preparation of a decree rests with the solicitor for the applicant for compensation, who passes it on to the Clerk of the Peace for signature by the Judge, and in some instances delay has been known to occur in the preparation of a decree by solicitors.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the delay in setting up the War Compensation Tribunal for dealing with claims in respect to cars and other property commandeered or seized before the Truce by the British forces, he would be willing to set up machinery whereby payments or advances might be made in respect of these claims, pending an eventual refund by the British Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is impossible to determine in advance what cases will fall within the scope of the proposed War Compensation Court or a similar Tribunal to be set up to consider claims of the kind mentioned, it would not be practicable to make advances of the kind suggested by the Deputy.  Further, the general liability in this matter rests with the British Government, and we cannot prejudice our position by consenting to make advances.  Again, no advance could be made without preliminary investigations, and this would entail the employment of a body of skilled investigators and the incurring of considerable expense, which should properly be borne by the British Government. Moreover, in the absence of terms of reference and proper instructions, the task of the investigators would be one of considerable difficulty.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that no opportunity has been lost to impress upon the British Government the vital urgency of this matter, and negotiations are at the moment actively proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the question is in the negative.  The methods prescribed in the County Boards of Health (Assistance) Order, 1924, are designed to secure most considerate attention to the poor and destitute.  Where there is lack of proper attention it can be remedied at once if the Board of Health concerned will interest themselves. Where sub-committees had direct power it was found that wasteful and unnecessary expenditure frequently arose, and deserving cases did not always receive impartial consideration.</P>

      <P>Let us fix that first.  The President moves that the Dáil sit later than 8.30, and that the motion for adjournment be taken not later than 10 o'clock.  He intends, if I understand him aright, to take private business&mdash;No. 9 on the Order Paper&mdash;at 7 o'clock, and to allow that to continue until 10 o'clock.  Will the interval for tea be in private business time or before it?</P>

We have prepared a schedule which will be distributed to Deputies.

It is suggested now that to-morrow after Questions and after the Indemnity Bill (Committee Stage) has been disposed of that Deputy Mulcahy's motion should be considered for the remainder of the sitting and disposed of. Deputy Baxter has asked me a question as to whether it would be in order to propose, as an amendment to Deputy Mulcahy's motion, that the evidence <Col N="2940" /> given before the Army Inquiry Committee should be circulated to Deputies.

2.  Ní bhfuair an Có-Choiste, a tíolacadh an chéad Thuarasgabháil, uatha, aon chomhairle d'aon tsaghas fhónta ach an chomhairle a thug Liam Thrift, comhairle as a dtiocfadh Tigh Laighean do thréigean ar fad agus foirgintí sealadacha do thógaint ar Fhaithche Laighean no neachtar aca ar thalamh Chearnóg Mhuirbhthean no ar ionad éigin eile a bheadh oiriúnach.  Bhí breithniú déanta cheann féin ag an gCó-Choiste ar an tairisgint sin agus bhi diúltuithe acu dhi sa mhéid gur bhain sí le Faithche Laighean amháin ach, ag géille do thuairim an Teachta san, bhreithníodar an tairisgint aris fé mar a chur seisean i bhfuirm i le cúnamh pleananna a sholáthair sé don Chó-Choiste agus a mhínigh se. i bpearsain dóibh.  Chonnacthas don Chó-Choiste go raibh na pleananna san tarraicthe go cliste agus ba dheimhin leo go mbeidís oiriúnach, fé mar a bhíodar ceaptha amach, chun árus sealadach a bheadh oiriúnach agus dóthanach do sholáthar don Oireachtas agus dá bhfuirinn agus ina theanta san do sna hAirí agus dá bhfuirinn.  Níor hullamhuiodh aon mheastachán ar an gcostas ach do ghlac an Có-Choiste le háireamh Liam Thrift: go bhféadfí na déanmhachtaí do chríochnú<Col N="2945" />laistigh de bhliain, agus ná raghadh an costas ar fad thar £70,000 agus go mb'fhéidir go mbeadh sé gearaid do £50,000.  Níor fhéad an Có-Choiste, áfach, a mhola go nglacfí le haon scéim den tsaghas san.  Gan an mhoill agus an costas a bhainfadh léi go cinnte do bhac, ba chóir go seasódh déanmhachtaí, den tsórt atá ceaptha sna pleananna, go ceann deich mblian ar a luíod, ach ba cheart an cheist i dtaobh buan-árus don Oireachtas do shocrú i bhfad roimhe sin agus nuair a bheadh sí socair níor mhór déanmhachtaí sealadacha den tsórt san do scrapáil agus dá dheascaibh sin bheadh costas a dtógála imithe gan mhaith, suim go bhféadfí úsáid ní b'oiriúnaí dhéanamh di mar chúiteamh do Chumann Ríoga Bhaile Atha Cliath in aon airgead a chaillfid siad.</entry>

2.  Since the presentation of its former Report it has received no further suggestion of any practical kind save that put forward by Deputy Thrift, which would involve the complete evacuation of Leinster House and the erection of temporary buildings on Leinster Lawn, or as an alternative, on the grounds of Merrion Square or some other available site.  The Joint Committee had already considered and rejected this proposal in so far as it was confined to Leinster Lawn, but, in deference to the views of the Deputy, it has again considered the proposal as outlined by him with the assistance of plans which he furnished to the Joint Committee and courteously explained to it in person.  These plans appeared to the Joint Committee to be skilfully drawn, and it was satisfied that they would, as designed, provide suitable and adequate accommodation of a temporary character for the housing of the Oireachtas and their staff as well as for Ministers and their officials.  No actual estimate of the cost had been prepared, but the Joint Committee accepted Mr. Thrift's calculation that the structures could be completed within a year, and that their inclusive cost should not exceed £70,000, and might possibly approximate to<Col N="2946" />£50,000.  The Joint Committee however has been unable to recommend the adoption of any such scheme. Apart from the delay and expense which it would necessarily entail, structures of the character designed by the plans should endure for a period of at least ten years, but the question of the permanent housing of the Oireachtas should be definitely settled at a much earlier date, and, when settled, would involve the scrapping of such temporary structures and the consequent sacrifice of the cost of erection, a sum which could be more appropriately used in compensating the Royal Dublin Society for any pecuniary loss it may sustain.</entry>

            <entry>3.  The Joint Committee notices that in discussing its First Report in the Dáil the President of the Executive Council suggested that the Report had not gone into the details of the objections to the use of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham, but the joint Committee felt and still feels that in summarising them by reference to the expense, delay and inconvenience involved, it had supplied all the essential materials for the proper consideration and discussion of its Report as to this particular site.</entry>

            <entry>4.  Upon a careful review of the whole situation it has found no reason for departing from its previous recommendation, namely, that the entire premises comprised in Leinster House should be taken over for the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas, subject to the Government providing, or paying for, suitable premises in which the amenities of the Royal Dublin Society could be reasonably preserved in the interval, and upon the distinct understanding that Leinster House would be vacated at the earliest possible date consistent with the acquisition of a permanent home for the Oireachtas.</entry>

Tá le rá i bhfabhar do go bhfuil a shuidheamh caothúil agus comhngarach, go bhfuil neart foirgintí ann nách gá a dheisiú agus gurb uiriste é mhéadú no cur leis.  De bhárr atharuithe a dineadh air le déanaí tá sé nách mór ullamh ar fad chun dul isteach ann go luath agus ba beag le rá an costas agus an mhoill a bhain fadh le tuille oiriúnuithe dhéanamh air i gcomórtas leis an moill agus leis an gcostas a leanfadh as glaca le haon tairisgintí eile ab fhiú machtnamh ortha dar leis an gCoiste.

            <entry>
              <Col N="2948" />5.  In the event of this recommendation being rejected, Dublin Castle is the only location that the Joint Committee can suggest as a suitable alternative.  It has, in its favour, convenience of situation and access, ample buildings in excellent repair and capacity for extension.  Recent alterations have made it practically available for early occupation so that the expense and delay involved in any further adaptation would be small in comparison with that resulting from the selection of any of the competing proposals which in the opinion of the Committee were worthy of consideration.  It refrains from recommending it so long as the question of alternative accommodation for the Courts remains unsettled, but the Committee, while fully alive to the inconvenience that would necessarily result from the transference of the Courts to some other temporary habitation, is of opinion that this is a consequence which the legal profession and the public, would and should, in the interest of the State, be prepared to endure, provided they received an assurance from the Government that the restoration of the Four Courts would be undertaken at an early date.</entry>

      <P>In connection with this report, there is a certain difficulty as to what the proper form of the motion should be.  I think a motion to the effect that the report be adopted would not afford any solution, because the report, in substance, recommends that a certain thing should be done, and that, if it is found that it cannot be done, something else should be done.  I think what we would require is a motion specifying what should be done on the report, rather than a motion of agreement.</P>

      <P>This matter has been long delayed, and I cannot see what result would be obtained by saying that we simply agree with the Committee in this report. I would say we must agree with the Committee in its report, and, for example, state that the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should take the necessary steps to carry out paragraph 4 of the report, or, alternatively, that the Dáil disagrees <Col N="2949" /> with paragraph 4 and advises or recommends&mdash;whatever the words be&mdash; the Executive Council to give effect to paragraph 5.</P>

Ought we not to consider this matter rather as one of procedure with the object of conveying to the Government the desires of the Oireachtas and stating that the responsibilities for decisions which involve expenditure of money must be the Government's responsibility?

      <P>What I have in writing before me is to the effect that the Dáil agree with the Joint Committee in its report and is of opinion that the Executive Council should take all necessary steps towards carrying out the recómmendations in paragraph 4, or paragraph 5, as may be decided.  The Dáil could pass such a motion which would recommend to the Executive that certain money should be expended, and it would leave the Executive Council to decide the other matters.  I do not know if Deputy Johnson means that a simple adoption of the report would make our minds clear to the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I beg to submit the Eighth Report of the Sessional Committee of Selection nominating a Special Committee to consider the Dairy Produce Bill, 1924.  The report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Committee met on 25th June, 1924, to consider an Order of the Dáil made the 20th June, 1924, to nominate nine Deputies to serve on a Special Committee to consider the Dairy Produce Bill, 1924.</P>
      <P>2.  The Sessional Committee recommends that the following Deputies be nominated accordingly:&mdash;Beamish, Dalton, P.K. Hogan, Heffernan, Baxter, P. Hogan (Clare). S. Milroy, J. Cosgrave, and the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The Committee is, however, of <Col N="2951" /> opinion that the Special Committee should consist of 15 members, and recommends to the Dáil that the number should be so increased.  In the event of the Dáil adopting this suggestion, the Sessional Committee recommends the nomination of the following <i>six</i> additional Deputies:&mdash; Duffy, Egan, Johnson, Donovan, C. Byrne and Sullivan.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Local Elections Postponement (Amendment) Bill, 1924.  I feel that I owe the House an apology for this Bill.  It was on the Order Paper yesterday, but it came on very suddenly.  I happened to be in the hall talking to a Deputy at the <Col N="2952" /> time, and was not aware that the Bill had come on.  I think that the House had a record yesterday for the rapidity with which it got through its business, and that is responsible for my fault in the matter.  I do not think that it is necessary to go very much into detail in this matter now.  I dealt with it at great length on the First Reading, and put the whole situation before Deputies. Under present conditions, if no change is made in our arrangements for the elections, they will have to take place on the 15th July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not prepared to have elections at the present time.  The Register and other arrangements are not fully completed, and some postponements will be necessary.  Legally I am entitled to postpone the elections up to the 30th September, but I feel that a postponement to that date, or any intermediate date, would be very unsatisfactory. There is before the Dáil a Bill which I allowed to remain over on the Second Stage which I expect to come into operation in some form very soon after the Dáil meets following the recess, and that Bill will change the whole system of Local Government and will make it necessary to re-cast our whole system of the representation of local authorities.  If we were to hold an election between now and the 30th September, it would mean a very considerable expense, costing over £160,000, which would be a very serious loss.  I think it would be hard to get candidates to go forward for election to a position which will last for only a few months.  For that reason I am asking the Dáil to give me power to postpone the elections up to March, 1925.  This will not be a mandatory Bill; it will be merely permissive, and I do not think will be postponed to any date as far away as March, 1925.  I expect that the Bill, or an amended form of the Bill, will pass in November, and it will be then possible to hold the elections. I would like to have fairly wide powers in the matter.  The elections have been postponed on several occasions owing to circumstances over which I had no control, and it might have been better at the outset if we had taken wider powers to postpone the elections to a longer period than we actually postponed them for.  For that reason I will <Col N="2953" /> ask the Dáil to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted for the First Reading of this Bill on the principle that as every dog is entitled to his first bite, so every Bill is entitled to its First Reading.  After that it becomes dangerous, both as regards the dog and the Bill, and I intend to vote against every other Stage of this Bill. The Minister has not put forward any solid justification for postponing the elections relating to urban district councils and county councils.  The rural district councils are hanging, like Mahomed's coffin, between earth and heaven, and people may not be willing to go forward for election in the circumstances. I am willing to postpone elections to these bodies until it is decided whether they are to exist or not. For the other two bodies he has made no case at all.  What case he has made is at direct variance to the case he made in connection with the Local Elections Postponement Act, 1922. Then he impressed on the Dáil that it was very undesirable to hold these elections during the winter, as the people would not come to the poll in the short days, and darkness made it difficult for polling to be carried out. Now he has asked us to hold the elections some time between November and March.  If there is anything in the first argument this one is wrong. Apart from that, I would like to enter a protest against this continual practice, which has become chronic with the Government, to have one amending Bill after another, and bringing in a Bill to meet a temporary emergency, then amending it, and then amending it again.  It wastes the time of the Dáil, creates uncertainty in the minds of the public, and has nothing whatever to recommend it.  It is an outward and visible sign of living from hand to mouth, and of meeting necessities as they arise which is very undesirable in any Government.  There are very solid reasons why elections for urban councils and county councils should not be postponed, for these bodies have outlived their normal term of office.  They are in many respects suffering from the faults of the extremely aged.  They are losing energy, and in some cases credit. I know in the district in which I live <Col N="2954" /> they have exhausted their credit, so that at present the roads cannot be lighted at night.  If the Minister proposes to extend the term of that Council to March it will be a very serious misfortune indeed, as they are without credit to light the streets.  The Minister is trying to put members of these bodies into gaols owing to surcharges. I think he is very unwise to press this Bill, and I will vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been good enough to explain to the Dáil that elections have been postponed several times already, and in this case under circumstances beyond his control. He proposes now to postpone them again.  One would imagine from his latest speech on the matter that he regretted having postponed the elections hitherto.  Now he seems rather to rejoice in the prospect of being able to postpone them.  I really think he desires to abolish the elections altogether for local authorities.  If he really revealed his mind he would tell the Dáil that he preferred the Dáil would give him power to appoint Commissioners to govern local areas.  He is sorry that in the previous Bills he did not take powers without the limitation of dates. That is the very next thing to saying that he is sorry he was not granted powers to abolish local government authorities.  I wonder does the Minister fear that if the elections are held within the next two or three months there may be an exhibition of the public views regarding his administration? I suggest to the Minister that it is unwise for his prestige and public credit to allow that idea to get abroad, that he should rather challenge that public decision that local government elections will provide.  He has made no case in favour of postponement.  He said that he hoped the Oireachtas will pass certain new legislation, but many things may happen between now and the end of the year, and it is very bad policy for an administration to assume that every legislative proposal that is made is to pass in the form in which it is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not assume that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister does not assume it, but the argument that he adduces rather leads us to think <Col N="2955" /> that that is his assumption.  We must not hold the elections now because there is to be new legislation proposed, which may involve a change in the form of the councils, and because the new legislation will involve certain changes.  But it is not proposed to allow the old legislation to have effect. Supposing this Bill is passed, and supposing the Bill that the Minister hopes to get through is not passed, then I presume we will have another Bill brought forward further postponing the elections.</P>
      <P>Or would he then say that after March 25th, or the date named in the Bill, the elections must inevitably follow, and that in the meantime local authorities must carry on as they are now doing.  If the desires of the Minister regarding the reform of local authorities become law, it must be that he has now very much bigger ideas, or, shall I say, changed ideas regarding the form that local councils should take in the future.  I do not think I read anything in the Minister's Bill that has had a Second Reading which would suggest that the county councils to be elected under the present law would be unfitted to carry on the duties under the Bill that is now in charge of the Minister&mdash;the Public Health Bill.  Nothing has been said so far as I can remember to suggest that the franchise is to be altered, or that the qualifications for councillors is to be altered, or that you are going to restrict the selection to a certain class or section of the community, or that you are making sure that a very select element will, after March, be available for county councils and other local bodies: nothing in the Bill which has had a Second Reading would make impossible the working of local administration by the new councils which would be elected between now and September if this Bill does not get a Second Reading, and, therefore, I do not see why there should be any further postponement of local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he has power, without any new legislation, to postpone the elections till the end of September.  I suggest to the Dáil that that is quite long enough to postpone <Col N="2956" /> the re-election of local authorities, unless the Dáil is satisfied that it is desirable to go back to the period when the local affairs of the country were governed, either by the wealthiest person in the neighbourhood or by the central Government, or by commissioners appointed by the central Government. If it is the intention and the desire of the Dáil to maintain in being a scheme of local government by locally elected bodies, then we should not agree to this further postponement of elections that is proposed in the Bill. I think that a very much stronger case will have to be made before any person who is not already bound to the policy of the Minister could be convinced that he should vote for the Second Reading. I, therefore, will very gladly support Deputy Cooper in this matter.  I will give him all the support that he requires to throw out this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the question to which attention has not been drawn.  I had thought for a moment that Deputy Johnson was going to mention it, and to save me rising.  The point is this: Recently the Minister expunged the Dublin Corporation, and he has taken the same action with regard to several local bodies lately.  Whatever the necessities and whatever the arguments in favour of that step for administrative reasons, there is no doubt whatever that that action has done the State harm, because it has sent the idea abroad that this Government and this Free State is opposed to government by publicly-elected bodies.  The reasons why these public bodies have been blotted out in this summary manner is because they have expended, and long since expended, whatever sanction they had. The majority were elected in 1920 and in 1921, and we are all perfectly familiar with the reasons that prompted their election at that time.  They were not put forward, nor were they elected&mdash;in fact, the majority were not even elected at all, because the election was merely a formality; names were put up and these names were not opposed. In very few cases was there any opposition to the names that were put up, not for administrative reasons and <Col N="2957" /> not for executive reasons, but simply that persons were chosen who would execute the will of Dáil Eireann, at that time engaged as it was in a national struggle.  As we know further, persons were carefully chosen whom it would be impossible, with any success, to surcharge. In other words, not only were the people chosen for a purely political purpose, a very necessary purpose at that time, but actually persons were chosen to execute that political purpose and were chosen from among those who had the least sense of responsibility, and that was done deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Corporation, it is known that certain citizens were anxious to stand in the Corporation election at that time.  They were dissuaded from doing so, and deliberately dissuaded from doing so, because surcharges would ensue infallibly as a consequence of the actions that they would be called upon to undertake, and they had substance that could be surcharged. That was the reason why these bodies which had been created had not been executing or administering their functions as they should have been executed and as they should have been administered, and these are the reasons why the Minister has lately acted in so summary a manner in regard to them.  What will be the result if this Bill passes?  It does not need a great deal of foresight to see that before there are further elections there will be a large number of public bodies which will have been superseded and their places taken by Commissioners, and, therefore, further damage will be done of the kind that I have indicated. That need not take place, and I say that there is no necessity whatever for it.  Public elections can proceed at the moment.  They can proceed in every case except in those indicated&mdash;of rural district councils.  County councils and urban district councils can be elected even on the large assumption that the Local Government Bill be enacted on more or less the lines drawn out by the Minister's Department and submitted by the Minister to this Dáil a short time ago.  Even on these large assumptions, urban district councils and county councils will be still required, more or less as they are to be <Col N="2958" /> elected to-day, and there is no reason why they should not be elected to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I have taken the large assumption for the sake of argument, that the Bill be enacted more or less on the lines that it has been framed.  Even on that large assumption I say that these two other bodies must be elected as they are to-day. Why, therefore, should they not be elected at once?  I do not think that there is any need for this Bill, and, moreover, I think that there is considerable danger and harm in the Bill, the danger and harm residing in the fact that if this Bill pass a great number of local bodies will be superseded by order of the Minister infallibly; in the first place, because they are not fitted, and they never have been fitted, for this work they have been undertaking, and, in the second place, they have expended whatever sanction they originally received.  From that will follow a certain amount of harm and unpopularity, and suspicion that the Government is afraid of incurring the risk of public elections, and that they ought to be avoided at all costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill, I think one of two things must happen.  The Local Government Bill which has been already introduced must be put out of the way one way or the other.  It must be either defeated in the Dáil or abandoned before we can have a new election.  I suggest that the Bill should be abandoned.  The reform is not so pressing that it could not wait for three years, which is the ordinary statutory term of local bodies.  Deputy Cooper stated that county councils and urban councils could be elected. As a matter of fact, the arrangements for county councils under the new Bill would be altogether different, as the number of councillors would be increased, and there would be other alterations. The Bill must be put out of the way one way or the other.  The present system has not failed so much because of defects in the system itself as because of defects in the bodies elected to administer it.  I am not saying that there are not some defects in <Col N="2959" /> the system, but the defects are not so serious that we could not carry on for three years longer by having an election now.  Any defects in regard to the representative character of these bodies could be removed by elections. I am not going to follow Deputy Johnson into what I consider the very necessary provisions whereby the central authority can remove councils or corporations that run amok.  I think they were very necessary, and the fact that the Minister has put them into force has, I think, been welcomed by the ratepayers, and has not met with the reprobation spoken of.  If the ratepayers were asked the question in the morning I feel that they would endorse the action of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The people are not crying out, as has been stated, against what the Minister has done.  Only a few interested people are crying out. The view of our party here is that the Bill ought to be abandoned and new elections allowed to take place immediately, or, alternatively, that the fate of the Bill ought to be decided one way or the other.  We do not want an election now and another election following the passage of the Bill in the autumn.  County councils could not be elected on the present basis and continue in office if the Bill is to come into operation, because the Bill makes provision for additional county councillors. Therefore, the only thing to do is, either abandon the Bill, as I suggest to the Minister, or put it out of the way one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not given his real reason for the introduction of this Bill.  Personally, I do not consider what the Minister has said is sufficient reason for the introduction of the Bill.  I think it will be admitted that the Minister has given sufficient indication as to what is the opinion of his Ministry in regard to the public bodies of the country.  If the public bodies are really as bad and as inefficient as the Minister and his Department contend, surely the proper thing is to give the people an opportunity of getting rid of <Col N="2960" /> them as soon as possible.  Why bring in a Bill to give them a longer lease of life except the object is to give the Minister on opportunity of sending out Commissioners all over the country?  If that is not the object, then the only way I can reason it out is, that the Minister is bringing in a Bill to allow public bodies whom he contends are inefficient to remain in office and to give maladministration a longer lease of life.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to speak very plainly on this matter and to suggest that the Ministry do not want to hold elections at present or to give the people an opportunity of having a say as to who are to be their representatives on the public bodies.  There is undoubtedly a lot in what Deputy Figgis has said.  Anybody who has been connected with public bodies, or who took part in the elections in 1920, knows perfectly well that the members of the public bodies were selected, not for any qualifications or administrative abilities they had, but because of their political outlook, and because they gave undertakings that they would do certain things.</P>
      <P>I think it should not be lost sight of that since that election very great and important extra powers have been given to public bodies.  We have had county boards of Health and other bodies established, and I say that the plain people in the country do not consider that the present representatives on the public boards represent their views.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Gorey has said, the people do object to the Minister replacing public bodies by Commissioners, because they are not prepared to give over their rights to the Minister or any other individual. If the public bodies are not doing what they should do according to the views of the people who elected them, the people want an opportunity of getting rid of them and putting other representatives in their place.  They do not want to be ruled and bossed by two or three officials.  I am going to vote against this Bill, and I think the other Deputies should vote against it also.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey has made the point that the Minister is afraid to give the people a chance of electing the representative <Col N="2961" /> that they would wish to elect, and that that is his real reason for bringing forward this Bill.  Would Deputy Morrissey agree, or is he one of those Deputies who take up the attitude on this matter that the present machinery of local administration is perfect and needs no change?

      <P>Unfortunately, this is the Second Reading, and Deputy Morrissey should say all he has to say when he is on his feet.  Deputy Johnson has stated that on a great many occasions. Other Deputies on the Labour Benches have stated that time and time again. On various Bills we have heard of the faults in connection with the existing machinery of local administration.  We have heard it stated that the machinery for dealing with Poor Law, asylums, roads and all the rest of it, should be changed, and I agree with that to a great extent.  But now that is all forgotten. That is all forgotten the moment it is convenient for Deputies on the Labour benches and on other benches to charge the Government with preventing elections because they are afraid of the results.  The Deputy and, apparently, other Deputies, suggest that these elections are postponed because we are afraid of the result.  If the machinery of local administration needs a change and is crying out for a change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought I made that clear.  That is the issue between us.  I suggest it is not because we are afraid of the result of the election, but because we realise that a change in the machinery must come that these elections are being postponed, and that the simple question is this.  Are we to hold elections now, elections to bodies whose constitution, perhaps, will be completely changed in a year, and hold other elections in a year at a cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers of £160,000?  That is the question.  I will do justice to Deputy Gorey and say he faced the facts.  He said: &ldquo;Let all the local bodies be dissolved.  Have new elections, and have no change for three years.&rdquo;  That was his position.  That is at least an understandable and a logical position.  But when Deputies are attacking the Minister for bringing in this Bill they should remember that that is the alternative to having an election now or having two elections within the year.  That should not be lost sight of.  It is the real issue.  Are you going to postpone the necessary reforms in local administration?  Are you going to have two elections in a year at a cost of about £160,000 to the taxpayers?  There might be a good lot to be said for not postponing the elections. Personally I am entirely in favour of postponing the elections on the strict understanding that the necessary changes will be made, but there is no use using extravagant language. There is no use deducing from this Bill that the Minister for Local Government is in favour of a sort of local feudalism, a local chief running the county councils.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Figgis gives me a chance I will deal with his point, if he is anxious to have it dealt with. There is no use suggesting that the meaning of this Bill is that the Minister <Col N="2963" /> for Local Government wants to constitute a selected class to run the local authorities in future.  There is no use suggesting that there is any warranty in the Bill for saying that the Government or the Minister for Local Government wish to run all local bodies in future, or to substitute for local bodies in future Commissioners.  There is no warranty for such statements.  His proposition is quite simple, to postpone the elections until March, and no further.  That is not postponing the elections till Tibb's Eve.  Deputy Gorey pointed out and pointed out rightly that if the scheme of the Minister is to be carried out that it would be impossible to go ahead with elections to county councils and refrain from electing district councillors.  As everybody knows, if the Bill passes there must be elections to the county councils.  The number will be almost double.  So there is no validity in the point that we can get over this difficulty by simply refraining from elections to rural district councils and having elections purely and simply to county councils.  The whole machinery is changed.  If the Bill passes there is only a year's delay.  There is not 20 years or 30 years or a hundred years.  If the Bill passes then there is no doubt whatever there will have to be new elections to both rural district councils and to county councils.</P>

A decision must be come to here.  I do not agree with Deputy Figgis that the Government has got into disrepute by abolishing the Dublin Corporators.  I do not agree either that the only thing that is wrong with the present bodies is that they were elected in 1921.  The Dublin Corporation was no better and <Col N="2964" /> no worse from 1921 to 1924 than it was for the previous three years, and I believe that the country is behind the Minister for Local Government in his action in regard to the Dublin Corporation, or rather Dublin Corporationism.</P>

      <P>We have all heard about the mountain that laboured and brought forth a mouse.  In this House the mouse has laboured and brought forth a mountain of talk.  This is about the smallest Bill, and as I consider, one of the most non-contentious Bills, ever introduced in the Dáil.  There has been a discussion with a certain appearance of indignation imported into it which certainly is entirely beyond my understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Deputy Figgis reproaches the Minister with having expunged the Dublin Corporation which, he said, had exhausted its sanction.  Then he goes on to invest the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with infallibility, and it seems rather curious to denounce the action of the Minister whom he so invests.  I could understand opposition to this Bill if the Local Government Bill was not pending.  I cannot understand the desire of those who want stability of local administration to have an immediate election under the present system at a cost of £160,000&mdash;I think that was the figure mentioned by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and I think also that it is a moderate estimate&mdash;and then to have, within a few months subsequently, another election equally costly to the people of the country.  This proposed new measure of Local Government has had its Second Reading, and the constitution of a body that would emerge from an election under the present system is bound to be affected by that measure and the stage that it has reached.  Even assuming that county councils elected under the present system were not affected, so far as those who would be elected under <Col N="2965" /> the Bill that is pending would be concerned, still the number who constitute the county councils would be, I take it, affected by the dropping off of those who represent the rural district councils on those bodies.  The filling of those vacancies consequent on the new measure would certainly involve either co-option or a fresh election.  I think such vacancies would be too numerous to be filled by co-option.  In any case it would be an undemocratic procedure, and one which, I think, would be resented by representatives of Labour in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey complains that the Minister proposes to give what he denounces as maladministration a new lease of life.  I think that is not a fair construction to put upon the Minister's intentions.  I think that an election held at the present time would hardly materially affect the personnel, the existence, and the constitution of the present bodies.  I take it the Minister for Local Government and Public Health seeing that, is simply giving what Deputy Morrissey describes as maladministration a respite before it is finally put into the condemned cell and extinguished.  I endorse the question addressed by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to various Deputies. Do they or do they not think the structure and the machinery of existing local governing bodies is perfect?  I think no one will answer that question in the affirmative.</P>

      <P>If the Bill had been transformed into an Act that question would be quite pertinent and relevant. We are not discussing the perfections or imperfections of the Local Government Bill.  We are discussing the imperfections of existing local administration. Let us hope that when the Bill that is pending has passed the gauntlet of criticism in the Dáil, it will be an instrument which will effectively remove the imperfections of the present system.  But the removal of those imperfections is not a thing to be dealt with piecemeal.  I think the Minister is quite right to take a long, a big, and a broad view of this question and to reserve dealing with the thing until the <Col N="2966" /> right time has come and the full powers for effecting comprehensive reform are within his grasp.  This is one of the proposals that have come before the Dáil that has my whole-hearted support. I think there is commonsense in postponing the elections.  It is bordering on the ludicrous to have pending a measure changing the constitution and the personnel, as far as numbers are concerned, of those different local bodies, the operation of which can only be a few months deferred, and to propose, before that comes about, another election which, to utilise Deputy Morrissey's words, would give maladministration another lease of life.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I am going to support the Bill because I believe that it would be a very ineffective way to give the relief that some people are crying for, to rush an election inside of six weeks or two months.  That would be the earliest time at which an election could be held, even if the Dáil were willing that an election should take place immediately.  If the Local Government Bill is going to become law in its present or in its amended form, I do not see that any useful purpose would be gained by holding two elections inside of six or eight months and putting the country to the big expense that is bound to be incurred thereby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said&mdash;and it has been made a very cheap jibe&mdash;in regard to the men who were elected to carry on local government a few years ago.  If some of those councils have gone wrong, and have done what they should not have done, is that any reason to suggest that the people who were selected <Col N="2967" /> at that time to carry on local government were wrong?  They were supposed not to carry out the instructions of what were known then as our oppressors.  Can we get any guarantee that these elections, if they were held to-morrow, would be held under different circumstances?  In local elections, as well as every other election in this country, politics will enter and people will be elected for their political opinions, no matter what anybody says.</P>

      <P>At any time.  I do not think that even Deputy Johnson will be able to eliminate politics out of local elections in this country, and I think he would be very sorry to see politics abolished in this country.  A lot of people seem to thrive on politics, and it seems to be the stock-in-trade of a whole lot of people&mdash;I think the whole of us in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I do think that the holding of an election would be a farce, because the class of people you would ask to go up would not do so if they had to run the gauntlet again in a short time.  You would have the same thing over again, and you would have the people put to unnecessary expense.  As far as I can see, this Bill only postpones the holding of the elections for three months, and if that is a very vital matter, it is one that the Dáil can consider.  You could not get an election held sooner than some time in August, even if it were ordered tomorrow. The Local Government Bill has to come before us again in October, and three or four months is the most you will be postponing the election. You would put the country to the expense of thousands of pounds by holding an election now and another in a few months.  The rates have been made, and are being collected, so that the councils coming in will not have any rates to make until next year.  The only thing that can be said is that the present people may go on spending extravagantly, but the people in charge of administration at the present time have an ample period to show that they <Col N="2968" /> are not the extravagant people that they are thought to be.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands and Deputy Hughes seemed to urge that the necessity for this Bill depends entirely on the fact that a Local Government Bill is before the Dáil.  They seem to take it for granted &mdash;I do not see any reason why they should take it for granted&mdash;that this Bill is going to be law within a few months.  I think the Government, by their action with regard to this Bill, have shown that they have a certain doubt on that point.  Indeed, their whole action with regard to this question of Local Government requires explanation. We have now what we had last year, a measure postponing the local elections.  We had practically the same arguments then that we have now, except that argument which Deputy Cooper mentioned.  It was mentioned then that it was quite unsuitable to have elections in winter time, and that it would be better to have them in summer.  Now, nobody says it is better to have elections in winter than in summer.</P>

      <P>I will not say that the Minister for Local Government used that argument, but it was certainly pointed out, in favour of the adoption of the measure at the time, that it was better to have elections in summer time than in winter time.  There is no guarantee whatsoever that the Local Government Bill, about which so much is made here, will become law in a few months.  Certainly there is no guarantee that it will become law in its present form.  We have a promise &mdash;I do not know whether it can be regarded as a definite promise or not&mdash; of a commission being set up to go into the whole question of Local Government reform.  I understand such a commission will be set up.  We have <Col N="2969" /> heard nothing definite about it recently and it may take a considerable time before such a commission is set up and gets to work.  It will take a considerable time to consider evidence and bring in its report.  I want to know if it is the intention of the Government to go on with this Local Government Bill before we get the report. If the commission is to do its work in the way it ought to do it, I do not expect that we can have the report before Christmas.  There is nothing to show that their report may not be on altogether different lines from the proposals which are put forward to the Local Government Bill.  I, personally, would be inclined to face the alternative put up by Deputy Gorey and to wait three years for these reforms, having the elections in the meantime. Deputy Hughes has resented the imputations which have been cast from time to time on the present bodies. If I understand the position rightly, those imputations have come more from Deputy Hughes' side of the House than anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I am trying to speak generally, too.  I take it then that Deputy Hughes was condemning his own side as much as any other, and I accept that.  Certainly the statements of the Minister from time to time go to show that he has little faith, on the whole, in our present public bodies.  I am inclined to agree with what has been said, that the chief reason for this is that they have outlived their time. I certainly think that elections&mdash;no matter when they are fought, we are bound to have political issues introduced&mdash;and the discussions which would take place prior to the elections, would be a healthy thing for the country. It would bring before the minds of the people the faults of the present occupants of these positions and the necessity for reform.  I do not believe that simply postponing elections from time to time and replacing the boards by commissioners, directly under the control of the central authority, on the grounds that those bodies have outlived their time and are inefficient, is a good thing for democratic institutions.  It will go far to do what Deputy Figgis <Col N="2970" /> has said&mdash;to give the idea that this country, which was supposed to have great democratic ideas, is rather inclined to go backwards than to progress in respect of democratic institutions.</P>

      <P>There are a few points made by Deputy O'Connell that I want to refer to in the first instance. He states that a Commission of Inquiry to deal with Local Government Reform is about to be set up, and that that may mean a certain amount of delay.  It may mean delay if the Local Government Bill has got to be amended in any way, according to the views of that Commission.  It will most likely require to be amended, because there are very few Bills introduced, even by a Government with vast sources of knowledge at its disposal, which have not got imperfections.  I believe, with the report of that Commission before us, and with the Local Government Bill, when amended, coming before the Dáil, that if you have an election next March you will know where you are. You, as a Dáil, will have amended that Bill, and when the election takes place the whole position will be absolutely different.  If at present an election is forced on you, the district council elections alone will cost about £60,000.  I do not say that I approve of the abolition of district councils.  I am not going to deal with such matters now, but I say that the present Local Government system in the Twenty-six Counties is wrong and requires amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Figgis to the occupants of public positions in Ireland for the past three years or more.  I have a knowledge of those who have been in public positions in Ireland for a very much longer period than three, six, nine, or twelve years, and I am aware of the fact that the composition of such bodies might have been hastily decided upon, and might have been influenced by questions of exigency at that time, but, on the whole, I maintain that these men did their work as well as they could and that they compared favourably with their predecessors, whether in corporations, urban councils or otherwise. They were up against very grave difficulties, of which I, unfortunately, being <Col N="2971" /> one of these men, have got knowledge. I am aware of the fact that some of them have not done their duty by the ratepayers.  I have not knowledge of the Dublin Corporation apart from what I have read in the Press.  For many years, back to the time when the supporters of the Union practically owned the Corporation, it was not beyond reproach.  I believe it has, to some extent, retained the reputation which it received from those who made it a closed borough for the supporters of English rule in this country.  I do not think that those who have composed it since have committed acts which were more wrong than were those of their predecessors.  As regards the commissioners, I believe it is the duty of the Government&mdash;and with Deputy Gorey I am in absolute agreement &mdash;to take charge of the interests of the ratepayers when those who were appointed by the ratepayers to do their work have not done it honourably or straightforwardly.  When these people have not taken care of the interests of the ratepayers who sent them there, I believe that the Government is right to send in commissioners, whether the body is a district council, an urban council, or a corporation, and the Government that would not appoint these commissioners would not be doing their duty.  You people, whether you are farmers, labourers, or merchants, sent men to represent you on these bodies, some of whom think of themselves and not of the people who sent them there, and if they persist in that line of attitude and bring the affairs of such bodies to a level to which they should not be brought, I say that if the representatives of these councils do not do their duty and take care of the interests of the ratepayers, no matter what the work is, whether it is the sick poor, sanitation, or lighting, the Government is quite right in sending in commissioners.</P>
    <P>Sending the commissioners does not mean that they are to be made permanent. It does not mean that we are giving away any of our democratic rights.  The sending of the commissioners is only for the time being until a new council is appointed.  Let no Deputy think that the appointment of <Col N="2972" /> commissioners to do the work where a particular body had failed to do it means that this country in the future is to be governed by commissioners. I, for one, am absolutely against it.  I believe in democratic rule.  I believe the people's representatives should be there to do the people's work, and I also believe there is a way to make them do their work by sending commissioners to inquire into matters when things are wrong, and if necessary to do the work which the people's representatives failed to do.  I am afraid that some of the Deputies lack a sense of what they owe the country on the whole as well as the people who sent them here, if they in any way support maladministration&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy D'Alton wants the people to have a breathing space.  I do not think he wants to give that breathing space to the people to think.  They are thinking <Col N="2973" /> already, and what they are thinking of is as to where they come in between the different public bodies and the Government.  Like Deputy Hughes, I deprecate to a great extent whatever has been said in general terms regarding public bodies.  They have been elected for some years past. They served a very useful purpose, they came into being at a time when it was not very popular to be public representatives, and they went through a very severe strain during that period. But I think the people are entitled to ask, now that so much has been said about their non-representative character, how soon are they to be replaced, or re-sanctioned.  It is a case of whether they represented the people or not.  That is what the people are thinking of, and I suggest to Deputy Johnson that they are thinking very seriously as to whether they should not have an opportunity of expressing themselves as to the representative character or otherwise of the present bodies.  We are told that we must wait for reform of local government, and that in general the machine is not perfect. With all due respect to the Minister for Local Government, I suggest the machinery he is setting up is not perfect, and that it requires a good deal of attention before it comes within any appreciable distance of perfection. He does not think so, I suppose, and I imagine if I introduced a Bill myself I would think the same.  Further, has he any guarantee that the machinery he is about to set up will be sanctioned by the Dáil?  If the setting up of the Commission is to have any effect in reforming the present local government machinery surely it will have something to say on the present Bill.  Can he assure us that the recommendations of that Commission will not be in favour of the present machinery, and more so than in favour of his own machinery?  The urban council and county councils have very important duties to perform, and has he any guarantee that the Commission will recommend the alteration of the constitution of these bodies?  It will be very interesting to know why the second Commission we were promised regarding the Dublin Corporation has not <Col N="2974" /> been set up, and it is also very interesting to learn that some of the irregularities that were noted by the auditor in his report occurred during the period when a principal member of the Government party was one of the members of it.</P>

      <P>This has been a fine storm in a tea-cup when you consider that all this talk is about the question of postponing the elections for six months.  At present the elections are overdue for a period of only twelve months, and when you consider the time you have gone through, and everything else, I do not think that is a very extraordinary length of time to allow to lapse.  I am afraid in introducing this measure my policy in relation to the various parties in the Dáil has placed me in the position of the old man and his ass.  I am trying to please everybody and find I cannot please anybody.  No Deputies were more clamorous for the introduction of a Bill amending local government than the Deputies on the opposing benches. Previously, on the estimates we had two gala days to attack the Ministry of Local Government, and afterwards, when the Local Government Bill came forward, it got a further severe handling from Deputies on the opposing <Col N="2975" /> benches.  When the estimates came up I was attacked over various matters, and for not having put in force reforms which, as I said to the Deputies, I had no power to do unless they allowed some Bill to go through.</P>
      <P>I introduced the Local Government Bill with the intention of giving the Deputies an opportunity to think over the provisions of that Bill, and to give what assistance they could afterwards in amending it.  When I introduced the Bill I believed there would be a possibility of getting it through that Session, but in view of representation from all Parties, both here and in the Seanad, that a measure of that kind should not be rushed, that we should take very great care in passing through a permanent Bill of that kind, and in view of the fact at that time I was under the impression that the Recess was to take place on the 4th July I realised that it would be impossible to get that Bill through, and accordingly I agreed to postpone the measure, I believe at the time with the concurrence of all Parties, on the condition that a Bill would be passed through the Dáil and the Seanad allowing me further to postpone the elections until the provisions of the Bill came into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Deputy Gorey is the only Deputy opposing the Bill who seemed to talk to the point.  He said it is really a question of dropping the Bill altogether, which will mean having no reform in local government for three years, or else postponing the elections. He is in favour of dropping the Bill. Dropping the Bill would place me in a very awkward position.  I may say I am not prepared to continue in this office for three years without making some change in the administration of local government.  I do not believe anyone could carry on with the present machinery, and I do not care what Party is in office, it is absolutely essential that a change should be made in the local government machinery if we are to carry on with any sort of efficiency at all for more than another twelve months.  At the present time I am in some respects placed, if not in an illegal, certainly in a non-legal position. There are certain offices which I should <Col N="2976" /> set up, for instance, a medical inspectorship of schools, which I am not doing on the ground that if I set them up it would mean a very heavy expenditure, which can be avoided and the same results can be achieved in a much more economical manner.  Our whole policy in the Ministry of Local Government is dependent on getting some kind of Bill through very rapidly, and I undertake to get that Bill through as soon as possible after the Recess, probably in November.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Gorey has dealt pretty well with the question of county councils and the reason why it is necessary to postpone the elections in respect of the county councils, as well as the rural district councils.  With regard to urban councils, it is necessary to postpone these elections also, as we have decided to hold all the elections on the same date on grounds of economy.  If Deputy Cooper was present at the first reading of the Bill he might have remembered I read an extract from the report of the local authority of an urban area complaining of the very high cost of an election which amounted to something like £105, while the total revenue for the year only amounted to £130.  It would be very foolish to incur this unnecessary expense except for very good reasons.  With regard to the appointment of a Commission, I wish to lead off by saying that Deputies on the opposing benches are really estopped from making any request in that line at all because they did not accept the President's offer and they voted against the Bill.  If they were assuming at the time that it was a conditional Second Reading they did not fulfil their part of the bargain. This question of a Commission is one that requires a great deal of consideration. When you talk about Local Government and Local Government administration you are talking about a very complicated, a very involved, and a very extensive matter.  If I were to set up a Commission to go into all the various matters under my control at the present moment, and if that Commission were to go into these matters in any kind of detail, I am certain their deliberations would not be concluded for probably several years, and that <Col N="2977" /> would give satisfaction to nobody.  This question about a Commission originally arose out of representations made by people interested in reforms in the city of Dublin administration.  They were anxious to have a Commission set up to inquire into that whole matter, but they were not anxious to have that Commission mixed up with another Commission which was considering other matters of Local Government administration. It was then this idea of the Commission first grew.  We have agreed to the representations from the people interested in this matter, the Greater Dublin Movement, to set up this Commission.  We have appointed as Chairman a distinguished member of this Assembly, and I believe it will be able to set about its deliberations very shortly.  There are other matters it will be also necessary to set up a Commission to deal with.  The question of Poor Law is at the present moment in a very chaotic condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Because owing to the difficulties of administration within the last two years, certain reforms have not been effectively put into operation. We are doing what we can in the interval to tighten up the machinery, and have done so in a great many cases with some success.  Through the commission we are trying to find some way of differentiating between the deserving and the undeserving poor. That commission will look into child welfare in general.  With regard to another important matter raised in the Bill, the question of roads, Deputies may not be aware that I am assisted by a very able body, the Roads Advisory Committee, in that matter, and other sections of the Bill were introduced on their behalf.  There is also a commission set up to deal with State Medical Service.  All those matters have to be dealt with separately if they are going to come to any conclusion <Col N="2978" /> within a reasonable time.  This present Bill, as I mentioned when I was concluding my second reading statement is a kind of a skeleton which has been so drafted that any other reforms which are found necessary to be introduced can be grafted on to it without doing any harm.  Deputies during the Recess will have an ample opportunity of bringing forward amendments to improve that Bill, and thinking over them.  As the President suggested in his statement on that occasion, if the Bill suffers from any defect it is from the fact that it was drafted merely by experts, and it is necessary that the lay mind should be brought to bear on it to improve it as far as possible.  I consider that nowhere would he find people as capable of dealing with the Bill as here in the Dáil, where we have men who have distinguished records on local authorities throughout the country.  They can give us the benefit of their experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  It is a Bill to enable the Minister for Finance to borrow and provide money to enable the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to carry out the necessary extensions to the telephone system.  When the British Government purchased the telephone system from the National Telephone Co. it was arranged that the money for the purpose, and for the necessary extension, should be advanced direct to the Post Office from the Consolidated Fund rather than by Votes at any particular period or from year to year. Various amending Acts have been introduced in Great Britain.  Up to this we have advanced money out of the Central Fund to the Post Office for the extension of the telephone, under the authority of the British Acts as adapted by the Adaptation of Enactments Act. However, it is undesirable to proceed in that way, because a difficulty naturally arises in regard to the limit.  It might be held that we could continue to lend up to the entire unexpended amount under the British Acts at the time of the separation, or it might be necessary to fix what would be the Irish proportion of the unexpended amount allowed to be advanced out of the Consolidated Fund.  We have advanced to the Post Office since the taking over, in the year 1922-23, £64,500. Last year we advanced £70,000.  It is estimated that in this year £150,000 will be advanced, and that the sum of £500,000 now asked for will carry us on until the 31st March, 1926.  It has been felt that it was better to bring into the scope of this particular Bill the sums that have already been advanced under the British Acts which came over, so that we would have done this all under the authority of our own Act, with the definite limitation of £500,000.  If the British procedure is followed here further Bills of this nature will be introduced as necessary for the purpose of enabling further sums to be advanced to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for this purpose. <Col N="2981" /> The borrowing will be done probably from some Pension Fund to which it will suit to have the money repaid in the way in which it will be repaid, by annual terminal payments.</P>

I stated the amounts already advanced were, in the year 1922-23, £64,500, £70,000 last year, and it has been estimated that £150,000 will be required in the current year.  That will leave a fairly substantial balance for the next year.  If we were satisfied that more would be required it would be possible, of course, in the interval to take steps to provide more.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Posts to give us full information upon the position, and the purpose for which this money is to be applied.  We have had from the Minister for Finance a statement that some of the moneys which are proposed to be granted under this Bill have already been expended, and I think it would be well to know whether it is intended simply to continue on the same lines of expenditure for the next two years as for the past two years or whether there is any intention to extend the telephone system to any degree.  I had thought when this Bill received a First Reading that it was a proposal to elaborate somewhat the telephone system, and generally to extend telephony through the country, and that what was required was a large new capital sum.  I think that the Minister should take this opportunity to enlighten us as to the policy of his Department respecting the development of telephony; how far it is intended, for instance, to introduce the telephone in substitution for the <Col N="2982" /> telegraph, whether it is his hope to extend the telephone system throughout the country, rural as well as urban, and whether he has any expectation regarding a new system of linking up of exchanges.  I think in a general way the Minister should be invited at least to give the Dáil full information respecting his policy and what he hopes to do with the remainder of the half-million pounds that is now sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson is quite correct in his anticipations regarding the contemplated development of the telephone system.  On previous occasions it was made pretty clear to the Dáil that this has been the settled policy.  The British left this country in rather an undeveloped state telephonically.  As a matter of fact, with the exception of the cities and certain important towns, it could reasonably be said that we had no telephone system at all, that at most it was only a skeleton system.  I do think that our predecessors did intend, prior to the European war, to embark on some such comprehensive development as we now have in mind. At any rate, whether their expressed intentions were really to be carried out or not, is a matter that we need not really dwell on now.  But immediately on the advent of our administration we proceeded to ascertain what could be done in this direction, and we drew up various schemes covering not only the extension of those parts which were already tapped but of development into those areas, like Connaught, which have practically no telephones whatever. The first step in this direction was the supplementing of the main arteries connecting the principal towns.  There is no use in considering a national system of joining up the smaller towns and villages without first providing for those main arteries, and as soon as the Engineering Department had been enabled to remake the destruction of the last two years, attention was directed to the building up of those collecting arteries, these main junctions.  We are now engaged on that work, and at the moment extra telephone cables have been laid down between Dublin and Cork, and between Dublin and <Col N="2983" /> Mullingar, and we are on the way to extending those cables from Mullingar to Athlone, Longford, Castlerea and Roscommon.  Also, we intend to supplement the main lines to the NorthWest. As far as the direct South or the direct North is concerned, we are fairly adequately served.  The moment that these main lines are completed, and every effort is being made to expedite their completion, it is intended to cut into the sub-districts, the smaller towns, and subsequently the villages, and finally the country districts, otherwise to push on with a universal scheme of telephony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that can limit our development speed and that is the shortage of technical labour.  It is unfortunately the case that when the British withdrew from this country, they were wise enough from their own viewpoint to take with them a great many men who were essential to developments of this kind and who would be very useful to us at the present juncture.  But matters are as they are and we have to face the situation as it is.  We are, therefore, limited in our speed by the fact that we are short of this technical arm.  A good deal of pressure has been brought to bear on me from members of the Dáil and from public bodies to push on telephone development, but there is one line to which we are very keen on giving preferential treatment, and that is the cooperative creameries.  I have a list here in anticipation of some questions being raised by the Farmers' Party, pointing to a considerable number of stations that have been joined up within the last six months; others that are actually in progress at the moment, and others still that have been facilitated by the installation of call offices in the neighbourhood.  But there are others far removed from any centre of population which will undoubtedly cost a great deal of money not only to the State but to the creameries themselves if the work is embarked on.  With regard to this I would say that we may not be justified in spending this money until such time as we see what further shape the directional wireless system may take in the immediate future.  If it did happen that we could utilise <Col N="2984" /> directional wireless, the expense of equipping these creameries, which are, of course, the first consideration, by directional wireless, would be very little; it would be quite infinitesimal. There is, as I say, a general desire on the part of the country that no time would be lost in bringing this State to that level of telephonic equipment which we find in certain Continental countries.  The Dáil can absolutely rely on it that not a moment is being lost in so equipping the State.  If many towns have not already had their telephones installed it is because of the huge amount of destruction which we have had to replace, and it is solely because of that.  We would indeed have been in a position to announce now that possibly not less than two or three score of the smaller towns would be so equipped were it not for that waste during twelve or eighteen months.  A good part of this money is also needed for Dublin.  In Dublin prior to our time you had something like 10,000 pairs of wires.  That was the maximum capacity of the local machinery.  People in pre-war days had to wait very often six, eight, and in some cases twelve months and longer for a telephone. Immediately after taking over we proceeded with a very comprehensive scheme of wiring and we are now in the neighbourhood of the completion of something like 10,000 extra pairs. In other words, double the local capacity, in the brief period of two or three years.  We have laid as many pairs of wires in Dublin since this State came into existence as our predecessors did during the whole life of the telephone. That is not bad progress, and the result is that, except in a very few districts in Dublin, we are now in a position to put up telephones practically overnight.  That is the experience of people in Dublin, and the Department has been thanked by people every other day for the expedition shown in this work.  We have scores of such letters, and if we had the necessary technical machinery very much more progress would have been made. At any rate this Bill is essential, and the money will be well utilised.  It will repay the cost itself.  The State will not lose a farthing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended for some time past that, as many members of the Dáil as possible should have an opportunity of getting to know some of the outstanding features of the Post Office service.  It is their duty, I think, to acquaint themselves personally with a service of that kind.  It had been pretty well excluded from their purview in the past, and for that reason I hope it will be possible for Deputies to see what has been done.  One of these developments is the manufacturing arm which has been set up at Island Bridge in a large factory taken over from the British.  Formerly, it was the practice here to send practically the entire of the repairs of Post Office machinery across the Channel, and to have the repairs executed there. That was a waste and a loss of money to this country, naturally, and, of course, it also lessened the amount of employment to be given in this country. We took immediate steps to have that remedied.  We have now set up this factory, and we are employing at the moment about 150 people, mainly mechanics.  The number of people we are employing is increasing, and we anticipate that before the end of the year it will reach 200.  What the number will ultimately attain I cannot say, but the policy of the Post Office at the moment is to see that everything possible, whether telephone cabinets, furniture, instruments, or anything else, must be made in this country.  To do work of this highly technical character needs expensive machinery, and in the case of the men engaged on it a certain amount of technical training.  Needless to say, all this will require time, but we are on the track of grappling with that whole subject and of keeping in this country the very large sums of money which formerly left it for Post Office equipment here.  That is our policy.</P>

We are not oblivious of the importance of that, but as the Deputy, I think, will admit, it is a matter that takes time.  Regarding the rural post, we have at the moment a delegation at the Stockholm International Congress, and their instructions are, in addition to the congressional work, to investigate on the spot the working of a system peculiar to Scandinavia, a rural system which may be applicable here.  I hope to be able to give further enlightenment on that point when the Annual Report comes along.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word by way of approval of the programme of work which has been outlined by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I think the extension of the telephone system throughout the country is very necessary, and especially in a country like ours, where there is a scattered population and where the Post Office service of the more common kind must necessarily be proportionately more expensive than in a thickly populated country like Great Britain.  I think that this is the best way to extend the postal facilities throughout the country.  I think it is preferable to do it in that way rather than to attempt to extend purely postal facilities.  We could get a better service and, I believe, a more economical one by means of the telephone system extended in the way that the Minister proposes to do it than we could get by merely extending the letter deliveries.  I was particularly glad to hear the Minister's suggestions and proposals with regard to the manufacture of post office machinery and requirements generally in this country.  That is a branch of the service in which I believe there are <Col N="2987" /> great possibilities, and I certainly think the Minister should get every encouragement from the Dáil in his desire to have such a service provided and developed as he proposes.  I think the Dáil will have no difficulty in assenting to this measure, and if the plans which the Minister has outlined are carried out I believe they will do all that he thinks they should do, and that if he finds it necessary to come to the Dáil again and ask for power to borrow a greater amount than is mentioned in this Bill to carry out work along the lines he has indicated, I am confident he will be granted the power he seeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>One is glad to be able to support what Deputy O'Connell has stated about the manufacture of the special requirements needed for the Post Office at home.  At the same time, I would like to know from the Minister whether calculations are made at regular intervals as to the cost of these particular commodities manufactured at the works that he has told us of, and whether he is satisfied that he can produce there the same articles at a lower rate than that at which they could be obtained if manufactured in other workshops not under the control of the Ministry.  While one is anxious to see these industries started, one is not anxious to pay more for the different commodities produced in the Post Office factory than they could be obtained for by contract in outside factories in the Free State. That is a point on which I would like to have some assurance from the Minister. The next point is in connection with the factories for the production of these commodities.  I take it that the demand for these particular commodities is more or less a temporary one to meet the extensions that the Minister has in view.  If that be so, the Minister ought to be slow in the way of laying down large and expensive plant for the production of commodities, the demand for which in the future may not be at all equal to what it is at the moment. There is a third point on which I would like some information.  The Dáil is aware that the charges for our telephone connections here are somewhat higher than they are elsewhere.  What I would like to know is if, as a result <Col N="2988" /> of these extensions, we are likely to have a reduction in these charges in the near future.  It is obvious that with more extensions we are likely to have a larger income than we have had hitherto, and hence I would like to know if the local charges in future are to be lower than what they are now.</P>

      <P>I desire to know from the Minister if it is his intention to connect the telephone service with the residences of dispensary medical officers in the country.  I understand that during the past twelve months strong representations have been made to the Minister on the matter from County Boards of Health.  I think it is very necessary that these connections should be made owing to the fact that dispensary doctors at present are unable to get in touch with the central hospital in any county at night for the purpose of ordering out the ambulance to take urgent cases to hospital.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has given any kind of favourable consideration to the representations made to him in one particular case, namely, by the County Meath Board of Health.</P>

      <P>If representations are made to me in respect of the particular institution to which the Deputy refers he may rely that careful consideration will be given to the matter, but I might point out that in some cases very exorbitant demands, which are not justified, are sometimes made to my Department. Deputy Good rightly asks the question whether a State factory is able to compete on equal terms with private enterprise.  I am in a position to satisfy the Deputy, without any shadow of doubt whatever, that in the overwhelming majority of cases not only are we able to compete with private enterprise, but even taking into consideration the usual overhead and other charges, we are able to beat them easily on some very important contracts. I am also satisfied, in this particular State Department at any rate, that the public is getting value for its money, and nowhere more so than in this State factory.  It will be known to Deputies, or to many of them at any rate, that in these State factories a regular output per hour is needed, and nothing is taken for <Col N="2989" /> chance.  Every man has got to do a certain thing within a certain time, and if he fails to do that then he has to get out.  That is the alternative. That is our system, and for that reason we can absolutely guarantee that the State is going to get value for its money.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill has already been favourably received by the Press and the public generally, and one statement has been made about it with which I agree, and in consonance with which I intend to make my remarks here very brief to-night.  It has been expressed in this way: That the Bill speaks for itself, that there is nothing very secret or very complicated about either its proposals or its machinery, and that no great detailed explanation will be required as to its main provisions. I said previously, when introducing the Unemployment Insurance Bill that I regarded it as a rather unfortunate matter that that Bill had to be introduced by itself and that this Bill should have been delayed and could not appear on the Order Paper on the same day because producing these measures in this way is apt to give people a wrong impression of what the Government policy is towards the main problem that faces almost every Government at the moment.  And that is the problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I did intend, by confining my remarks on unemployment regarding the Bill, to confine the discussion, the discussion did wander and there was rather a general debate on the question of unemployment in the course of which a Deputy made a remark that the only cure for unemployment is employment. That may seem a platitude. It seems to me to be definitely in the region of a truism, but it has to be adverted to as the first approach to any dealing with this problem of unemployment. On further consideration <Col N="2990" /> this remark posits that there ought to be in some way or another increased activity in industry leading on to increased demand for labour and especially leading to an increased demand for labour in its normal occupation, not by means of relief works or other methods, which though sometimes reproductive, are certainly extravagant in expenditure.  The first step, therefore, in the approach of this problem of unemployment brought inquirers up against the fact that industry in some way had to be stimulated into further activity.  The next immediate question was how was that to be done.  Now, on that there may have been many answers given in this House.  If Deputy Milroy was here he would give a ready-made solution on the question&mdash;Protection, and Protection alone, to do all that is necessary. The answer, again, that would come from another quarter of the House would be that if industries were nationalised that also would be a specific.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care to be more particular than to say from some quarter.  It might be regarded as a specific, and there would be coming from various quarters of the House different answers to the question.  Now before putting forward this Bill as an answer I want to make one thing clear. It probably is clear to the majority of the House, and it is a point that I want to stress for purposes of my own, that unemployment is at present abnormal in most countries.  It is abnormal here, but it is abnormal from a different set of circumstances here from that which operates in other countries.  There is unemployment here, as there is elsewhere, due to the destruction of national wealth since 1914 and up to 1916.  There is unemployment by reason not so much of the direct action of war resulting in the destruction of business property as in the aftermath of war&mdash;the lack of confidence felt by the investing public in this country to put money into industrial enterprise until they are assured that the conditions are definitely stable, and likely and certain to remain so. These two things definitely are <Col N="2991" /> factors here, but there is also a third thing, and there is a certain danger in so putting it, but that danger must be faced.  It is due to the fact that emigration, which for long abnormal in this country, has ceased to a certain extent.  There is danger in putting that, inasmuch as I may be represented in hinting at an increase of emigration as a cure or a remedy for the present state of things.  I do not mean to urge that at all.  It does not enter into the consideration.  But what must, at any rate, be adverted to is this: that counting that the drain of emigration has lessened even in the normal circumstances pre-war in this country, there would be a larger percentage of people unemployed than probably would be elsewhere.  That is due to historical conditions in this country.  It is not very easy to get money to flow from the investing public to industrial enterprise here. People have not got a habit of investing in industrial enterprise in this country, and we want to loosen the flow of money towards our industrial enterprise.  We want to create an investing public, and more than that, we want to bring here the creators and directors of industry; of these we have some, but not enough.</P>
      <P>In stressing the point about emigration, I stressed it for this purpose: to show that even if we get back to a pre-war state of things in this country we would still not have settled the unemployment problem and have to go further afield and create industries where industries, previously did not exist. Unemployment, as I have said, is a problem with most Governments at the moment, and where unemployment is the problem it will almost automatically be found that one of the main ways of facing that problem has been some such measure as this.  Those who are acquainted with the history of the matter in England must know that the extension of credit under the Trade Facilities Acts has been made the main plank in the programme of all political parties on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having arrived at the point that industry must be stimulated, various ways of stimulating industry come to <Col N="2992" /> one's mind.  There is the direct one of subsidising.  That has its advantages, but it has very big disadvantages.  It immediately increases taxation and, to a certain extent, raises the cost of living. Excessive taxation is, of course, one of the reasons in this country, as in many other countries, why there is less purchasing power and less money for enterprise.  Subsidising has already been attempted in certain things here as a secondary approach to the unemployment question&mdash;subsidies towards housing and roads.  There are certain national undertakings which may have direct subsidies given to them, but the field is very limited.  The main thing is that others have to be stimulated into starting up again the machinery of production, in the hope that when the machinery is started, and when it is rotating, it will draw in other industrialists. Once the wheel is started, and it goes full circle, then there is hope that everything drawn in by that, when all added together, may make a definite impression on the unemployment question which would not be made by any small single undertaking.  The cumulative effect, the snowball effect of such a Bill as this, has its value to start the machinery going.  There is hope then that further additions may help in solving this big problem.  That is one of the effects looked for under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a second which, to a certain extent, I consider even more valuable than the first.  I have spoken already of the lack of confidence that there is in the country with regard to conditions, and the lack of confidence on the part of the investing public. There is a psychological effect created by a Bill of this sort which is very valuable.  If a scheme is investigated and passed by an Advisory Committee, it is then submitted for departmental criticism, and finally emerges as a scheme which has won for itself the guarantee of security.  That immediately constitutes a hall mark on the scheme, inasmuch as it has passed the barrier of criticism and survives, and is valuable to that extent.</P>
    <P>There is the further point that if the Government shows it is ready to run up a certain amount of productive debt in its attempts to stimulate industry, and if particular schemes are <Col N="2993" /> favoured in that way, that brings to the people's minds the thought that this industry has a better chance of prospering, because the Government want it to prosper.  It might lead to such a side issue as this.  If, for instance, certain State contracts had to be placed and the competing firms were firms in the Free State and firms outside it, the Irish firms having got guarantees through this Bill, obviously, apart from patriotism, the State would be bound to support in preference to others, the particular undertakings which had secured this guarantee. That is the psychological point of view that it tends to show the Government is making a serious attempt to stimulate industry and that particular schemes have won through, have survived criticism, and are being put forward as schemes for investors.</P>
    <P>As to the machinery of the Bill, I do not think it will require any great explanation. There is an Advisory Committee. That committee is outside the Government departments.  It is to be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in conjunction with the Minister for Finance.  The Advisory Committee will not be a departmental committee in the sense that it will include officials.  It will be composed of outside experts brought in to pass judgment upon certain schemes.  I do not think any exception has been taken in a Bill of this sort to that method of appointing the committee. It has been found better to have an outside committee in such cases, as the schemes would then be approached from two points of view, that of the expert financial or business man outside, acting on the Advisory Committee, and that of the departmental official afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he is thinking of a single committee to deal with all classes of schemes, or separate committees, and are the members to be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That point with regard to separate committees has been considered, because the Bill is really a double Bill.  It foresees the type of scheme which would come up under the ordinary Trade Facilities Act, and the secondary type of scheme of which the main object is a reduction in the cost <Col N="2994" /> of essential commodities.  It is not definitely determined yet, but what was proposed was that there should be a fairly small committee set up for the purposes outlined in Section 1, and that special people be added to it for the purposes of Section 2.  The question of payment of the members of this advisory committee has not been considered. It was not considered that they should be paid beyond the possibility of having to pay expenses.  The fees referred to in Section 5 are to defray the cost and expenses mainly of a clerical staff in connection with the committee.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as I say, has a double purpose. Sections 1 and 2 indicate in a certain way this purpose, because the first leans on the question&mdash;Is the scheme calculated to promote employment? The second would depend upon the answer to the question&mdash;Is the loan proposed to be raised calculated to promote a reduction in the retail prices of essential commodities?  That second section is an addition to the ordinary Trades Facilities Act.</P>
      <P>It has been thought better to deal with the retail prices question in this way, rather than by way of control. Control is difficult.  It is, administratively, very expensive, and the effects of it, so far, have been none too good. In fact, it was said it was the period of control that gave rise to rings, and that it is rings, at the moment, and the presence of rings, that keep up the cost of living.  This method is relatively simple; it is not expensive, and results are looked for from it.  It has the additional advantage, from the Departmental point of view, of throwing the onus for promotion on to either a public authority or any association of producers or consumers, or of both. Schemes put forward by these bodies, showing good grounds for belief that they will be successful in reducing the cost of essential commodities, will get fair examination by the experts and, if successful, will get either a loan or the guarantee set out in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had explained that.  I meant the type of scheme that might come forward under Section 1 and have the effect required as the basic principle of No. 2.  I was rather separating them in this way&mdash; schemes, the main object of which was to promote a reduction in retail prices of essential commodities, and schemes which had not that purpose, but which would be calculated to promote employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I defined that differently.  I said the idea was to have one committee appointed under Section 1 of the Bill, and to that committee would be added certain other people who would be concerned more with Section 2.  To be more definite, the essential commodities in the Saorstát would be such commodities as form the basis of the cost of living figure. Let us take those.  Take it that they are mainly agricultural products.  That would mean that to the committee, say, of three, under Section 1, comprised, say, of an expert business man, a banker and an accountant you would add two men who had experience of trade in, or the production of, such essential commodities as I have described. The second committee would be the same committee with additional members added for special purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the rest of the Bill calls for any explanation.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 are really sections into which the Ministry of Finance is brought to supervise loans, and to arrange for payment and repayment.  Section 6 is a further check by which under any loan granted under the Bill accounts have to be presented to the Oireachtas.  The <Col N="2996" /> Bill includes a considerable number of safeguards and checks.  There is the Advisory Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and, finally, the Oireachtas. Guarantees under the Bill are limited to a period of twelve months after it is passed.  The sums of money are also limited, so that, while there are sufficient safeguards, there is sufficient liberty under the Bill to allow for a certain stimulus, provided proper schemes are brought forward.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy from an area contiguous to the present boundary I feel it my duty to say a few words upon the subject of this motion and the amendment of Deputy Johnson.  There is not much need I think for talk.  It does not serve any useful purpose.  We have had conversations and we have been promised some results from them, but we have not received such results.  I think that it is time that the method of talk should cease and that the method of sensible approach to this question should be commenced.  The discussion seems to have drifted latterly here into an academic one.  This is not an academic question: this is a serious national question.  It is a question between right and wrong, with a tribunal designed to decide, and that tribunal has to decide on an international treaty backed up by two nations.  That is the decision that is awaited here in this country. The motion and the amendment seem to me to have the same object, and that is to emphasise the delay that has taken place on this question.  The delay is almost inexplicable and it seems to threaten to continue.  The correspondence that we have gone through and which has been placed in <Col N="2998" /> our hands in the White Paper proves, I think, quite clearly to us that our Executive is in no way responsible for this delay.  While that is so it is necessary I think to impress upon the members of the Executive Council that the situation is very acute, and that it is gradually growing more acute day by day while the struggle continues in correspondence.  It actually threatens the Government of this country and it threatens the Treaty.  Let that be clearly understood.  That is the situation that confronts the Government on this question.  Of all other questions that face this country, this is the most formidable and the solution of this difficulty is the real national problem. There is a feeling prevalent that there is obstruction to the commission that has been designed by the Treaty and accepted by those who ratified the Treaty on behalf of this nation and on behalf of the people of Britain, and that there is a disposition on the part of the British Government to temporise with this obstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any such fears as that should obtain even a semblance of justification it would be disastrous for Ireland, as well as being disgraceful to Britain, and it would be very difficult to forecast what the consequences might be. These fears are particularly acute in the areas that are specially affected, that is, those areas that are held in bondage in spite of their majorities, and where an attempt, a very deliberate attempt, has been made to submerge these majorities and to deprive these people of all civic rights on local representative authorities.  There was great alacrity in recognising the Treaty in the first instance on the part of the Northern Government for the purpose of securing partition.  Now there is a great desire to use the second part of the same Article in order to secure not only that the country is to be partitioned but that Article 12 is to be partitioned. It had been hoped that he problem might have been approached and envisaged to do away with all boundaries.  That was hoped in the initial stages, and there was a certain amount of grounds given for that belief, and there would have been no demur to the sanction of reasonable or even unreasonable accommodation.  I <Col N="2999" /> think, for the purpose of securing that very desirable national object.  It seems, however, as if there has not been any such desire on the part of Belfast, when we look at the treatment of our people in the interval in these areas. The fate of our whole nation hangs on this struggle absolutely.  While everyone in the Dáil will agree that our Executive has handled the matter so far in a statesmanlike way, it is necessary <Col N="3000" /> they should realise the extreme urgency of having Article 12 honoured at once, since it appears impossible to have the question dealt with from the point of view of more immediate national re-union, and if discussion here hastens progress in doing this, then it would be of very great advantage to the whole Irish nation.</P>

      <P>On the main question, I intend to say very few words. The Dáil is not willing to agree to the amendment calling special attention to the provisions of Article 12 relating to the Council of Ireland as far as they have reference to Northern Ireland.  I will assume that the arguments which were adduced in favour of the amendment, and which have not been met, coupled with the arguments in favour of the original motion, have, when taken together, satisfied the Dáil as to the necessity of voting for the motion. I propose to vote for the motion, and I would ask the Dáil to agree with Deputy Milroy in the matter.</P>

      <P>We on those Benches welcome this Bill if it means what we think it means; but we are not quite sure that it does mean that.  I notice that the Minister, when speaking in connection with this Bill, did not refer once to the agricultural industry. I believe if we could read into his mind we would see that he means this Bill to deal almost exclusively with industries which are connected with cities and towns, and that he has almost overlooked the very important industry of agriculture.  I may be wrong.  I trust I am wrong; but that is the impression that I got from his statement.  If that is so, I desire to protest against it.  I think the tendency in the Dáil in recent times has been to devote too much attention to the industrial side, or what is known as the industrial side, and not at all sufficient attention is devoted to agricultural interests.</P>
      <P>We get very little sympathy from the Government Benches.  We get a good deal of derision.  Were it not that in the Minister for Lands and Agriculture we have a stalwart supporter of the agricultural industry, we would be without support of any kind on the Government Benches.  This Bill is simply the framework of a Bill, and it is difficult to understand how it will work out in actual practice.  The success or failure of it depends largely upon its administration.  With regard to the Advisory Council, it is very important that it should be composed of the interests most vitally concerned in the country.  In that connection I would again refer to the Minister's speech, and I cannot recollect him saying that there would be representatives of agriculture on the Advisory Council.  Again I may be wrong, and I trust I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it is the intention to give agriculture representation in proportion to <Col N="3003" /> its numbers and to the value of the industry. On the Advisory Council we should have representation in proportion to our numbers.  It is stated that agriculturalists represent 75 per cent. of the actual population of the country. It is only reasonable and just that we should claim such representation. Frequently we have been told by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture of the dire condition of the agricultural industry.  It is a favourite topic of his, and I think he ought to have fully impressed on the Dáil by this time that the industry is in a parlous state.</P>
    <P>I notice that he throws the onus of saving the industry on the farmers themselves.  He said that so far as the Government is concerned they can do nothing, and that the farmers must help themselves.  That is hardly reasonable, and it is scarcely in accordance with the help given to agriculture in other countries.  It is not in accordance with the requirements of agriculture here.  I have here a copy of the Official Report containing a speech of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in connection with Unemployment Insurance. His speech on that occasion, in my opinion, was one which could have come excellently from the Farmers' Benches if we had the capability and the imagination for producing such a fine statement regarding the condition of the agricultural industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give the Dáil a quotation from the speech.  I would, in fact, like to quote the whole speech, because from beginning to end it is an excellent exposition of the condition of depression from which the agricultural industry is suffering.  I will, however, quote only portion of the statement.  In reply to an interruption, the Minister said: &ldquo;This is a democratic country.  The farmers are 75 per cent. of the population. The population of this country is three millions, and the farmers and labourers together are two millions, and they should see that they get in the country what is due to them; but they will not get it unless they organise themselves.  If they organise themselves <Col N="3004" /> the Government can co-operate with them; if they do not, we cannot help them.  The productivity of the next year depends on whether the producer looks after his business.  We can do nothing unless he does.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister does he really mean that?  Does he really mean that unless the farmers produce this fabulous state of organisation that the Government can do nothing for them?  Does he mean to say we cannot avail of the facilities of this Bill unless we succeed in organising the farmers in a manner in which farmers have never been organised before and never will?  The Minister is as thoroughly aware as I am that it is almost an unknown thing to organise farmers in the way that industrialists and industrial workers may be organised. Their position in the country prevents that, and I would say to the Minister that the farmers are probably as well organised as the farming community in any other country in the world. There may be other countries which are better organised from a farming point of view.  We hear a lot about Denmark, and Denmark may be better organised, but my experience of other agricultural countries is that we are as far ahead in this country as the farming community in any other country in the world.  You will find that the Irish co-operative system is quoted, as something to be emulated, by the agricultural papers of other countries.  That being so, I do not accept the statement of the Minister that unless we put ourselves into the position of unity which he expects from us we are not to get the benefits of this Bill.  The Minister told us that we are fond of using eyewash, and we got a great lecture upon what we are to do.  It is a case of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  Why will not the Government do something for us at once?</P>

      <P>We will have to organise to hold our own against them in the end, but as a matter of fact, we are as well organised as any <Col N="3005" /> farming community in the world.  For that reason we are entitled to the facilities under this Bill which any farming community would be entitled to.  I would like to ask the Minister if that will be applicable to co-operative societies. Many co-operative societies are at present in a backward state.  They have been adversely affected by the bad times through which the country has passed, and many of them require outside help if they are to continue.  I sincerely hope that the intention of the Bill is that those societies, where they deserve it, and where they show the intention of maintaining themselves in a financially sound position, will get the guarantees and the financial aid which they deserve.  I would warn the Minister, if a warning from me is of any use to a man of his experience, that as soon as this thing gets thoroughly known he will have hosts of applications. He may be prepared to turn down about 90 per cent. of these applications, because I believe that every business man who is on his last legs, who sees the bankruptcy court staring him in the face, will immediately rush to the Minister in the hope that by getting these loans and these guarantees he will save his financial neck.</P>
      <P>It is not our intention to support the giving away of money which will not come back.  I think that guarantees of this kind should be only made in the case of people who are prepared to start or continue sound business propositions and people who are prepared to make a success of them, if it is at all possible, and they should not be used for wild-cat schemes or for the benefit of those who are already on the downward grade and who are gone too far to save.  As far as the unemployment question is concerned, I am inclined to think it is a step in the right direction: it is a method by which unemployment should be met.  It is a really constructive measure, and much better than the so-called doles and the unemployment insurance, which are not constructive and which are to a certain extent of a demoralising effect.  Subject to the guarantee that agriculture will get its share in proportion to the value of the industry, I and the Deputies on these benches are prepared to support this Bill.</P>

      <P>In itself this is an excellent Bill.  It is not an original Bill; it has followed the British Trade Facilities Bill very closely.  That Bill has been tested and it has worked on the whole satisfactorily, and probably the Minister is wise in taking advantage of it.  It may be noted that in the one respect in which it departs from the British Trade Facilities Act it is slightly more generous than the British Trades Facilities Act.  As far as I can work it out, in the British Bill, 3½ per cent. on the national revenue was guaranteed.  In our Bill it is practically 4 per cent.  That is not very great, but remembering the parrot cry of the Minister for Finance we may be thankful that we are not worse off than the British, instead of being better off. But I think the Minister was a little disingenuous when he spoke of this Bill running in double harness with the Unemployment Insurance Bill.  I thought that there was another Bill with which it would run in double harness, and that is, the Finance Bill, and I am quite sure that applications for these guarantees and these credits will come very largely from people outside the State who wish to set up factories for goods which are being taxed by the Minister for Finance in his Budget.  I think that it is a good thing, on the whole; I am not condemning it, but we should recognise that it is the case, and the Minister's remarks when he said that we needed to bring business experience and business knowledge from outside should be noted now, and not made the cause of an outcry later.</P>
      <P>So far, then, as the Bill stands, I am prepared to bless it.  But it is more than an ordinary Government Bill, brought in in the ordinary course of Government business.  It is a Bill to fulfil a pledge, and a very long-delayed pledge, made by the President.  Speaking in Rathmines on the 18th of February of this year, at a meeting to promote the candidature of Deputy O'Connor, the President said: &ldquo;It is not intended to bring in a Bill to fix prices, but it is intended to introduce a Bill to prescribe, as far as we can, some relation of price to value.&rdquo;  Last week the President informed us that this was a Bill that was intended to fulfil this pledge.  Does the President dispute the reference?</P>

      <P>I was unable to attend the meeting, and, therefore, had to rely on the public Press, but I hope it is accurate.  Now, does this Bill say one word about the relations of price to value?  I acquit the Minister.  The Minister was not involved in the President's pledge.  He was not a member of the Executive Council at the time. But there is a collective responsibility of the Executive Council, and the Minister and the Executive Council cannot ride off on this Bill and say: &ldquo;We have fulfilled our pledges,&rdquo; when it does absolutely nothing of the sort. There is not a word about the relation of price to value.  Of course the President safeguards himself; he said, &ldquo;as far as we can.&rdquo;  It now appears that that is no distance at all.  They have not been able to achieve the object which the President, the head of the State, then put forward as an argument in an election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave it there. To my mind if you are going to fix the relation of price to value there are three things you must do.  I agree that the absolute fixing of prices is impracticable because it would tend to drive goods out of the market.  But there are three things that you can do and that, I think, the public as a whole want done.  Firstly you can fix a standard of what is a fair price.  It is not easy to acquire a certain department for investigation, but that department already exists to a certain extent.  The Government has to fix the cost of living figure and fix bonuses in accordance with it.  It only needs some extension of the work of that department, because in dealing with these matters the ordinary average man or woman is at a most hopeless disadvantage.  They look at the market reports in the papers; they try to find out what the <Col N="3008" /> things ought to cost; they find that one commodity is sold by great hundreds; another is sold by the cask.  I am talking of apples&mdash;and yet another is sold by the pound.  There is, I think, need for the Government to have an Intelligence department that will reduce all these figures to some sort of standard that the ordinary man can understand the scale on which he buys, making a reasonable allowance for the profit of the retailer, and also for cost and expenses. That is the first thing you should do in order to deal with that problem.  The second thing I think the Government should do would be to take statutory power to inspect and investigate books bearing on trading transactions.  The work of the Committee on Prices was nullified because that power did not exist.  It is not asking for anything sensational.  Already the Income Tax authorities can compel anybody to lay all their books before them and send them to prison if they will not, and I do not see why, for the purpose of informing the State of the profits that are made in business out of the public, it is unreasonable to ask the average trader to put his cards on the table.</P>
      <P>That, then, is the second essential. The third essential I venture to think the majority of people are in favour of is that, if it could be proved, and clearly proved, that a retailer has deliberately and systematically made an excessive and unfair profit out of his customers, he should be punished.  I think that we are not asking too much if we say that some punishment should be prescribed in the case of a man who goes beyond the bounds of legitimate trade and of reasonable profit.  One must make an allowance for the possibility of a loss instead of a profit, but taking all these things into consideration, I believe that if a man absolutely and callously sets himself out to make the most of the advantage of having a monopoly, or a semi-monopoly, or of being in a ring, it is not too much to ask that he should be punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are three of the points the Government should have borne in mind when framing this measure.  Instead, they preferred to adopt the methods which are relatively simple and not expensive. I agree they are relatively <Col N="3009" /> simple and not expensive.  But are they also effective?  If these methods are not effective then the President's pledge has not been fulfilled.  It has not been fulfilled in the letter, and, unless there is real reason to believe that this measure will bring about a considerable reduction in prices, it has not been fulfilled in the spirit either. Personally, I am afraid that the hope of a reduction in prices through the means of this Bill is rather vague and unsubstantial, unless the Government are in a position to tell us that they have an assurance from corporate or unincorporated bodies who will reduce the prices.  Now there is £300,000 going in this.  That money is payable to anybody who will put up a practical scheme to sell the necessities of life cheaper, whether it consists in bringing in milk from Louth and Meath and selling it in Dublin, or establishing a meat factory.  There are possibilities, but I am not at all sure that the farmers are the people who are going to take advantage of them.  In one respect in which there had been great charges about profiteering, this Bill is lacking.  I refer to the cost of porter. I may form an association of consumers&mdash;I would not have far to go to find them&mdash;I could apply for a loan under this Bill in order to sell porter in Dublin at 7d. instead of 8d. a pint.  I believe it is possible to do it.  But will the Minister for Justice give me a licence?  He certainly would not, and I would have to take the whole £300,000 to buy up existing licences.  Now that is a business in which complaints of profiteering have been most general, and it is the cost of porter that has led mostly to strikes along the quays.  This Bill does nothing to fulfil the President's pledge, but if the President intended to except porter from his pledge he should have made that clear to the electors at time of the election.  I leave that point.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I have not very much hope of any real movement&mdash;unless the members of the trades unions take it up&mdash;that would reduce prices as a result of this Bill.  In business, as in golf, the professional beats the amateur every time, and these associations of consumers and producers will be amateurs as compared with the middleman. <Col N="3010" /> I am sorry Deputy P. Hogan is not in his place, because I think he would be able to tell us the result of an experiment in this direction in Ennis, where the Labour Party tried to reduce the price of butcher's meat. They were very wise.  I believe the Labour Party in Ennis tried to bring down the price of butcher's meat, and they started in business on their own. Unfortunately they placed in charge of the scheme a gentleman who knew nothing about buying meat, with the result that they incurred the loss of several hundred pounds.  Now it is conceivable, unless this Advisory Committee is very alert, that that is the kind of thing that will happen under this Bill.  A scheme like that is the shortest way of wasting money that one could devise, even worse than playing poker.  That being so, I must stress the importance of the Advisory Committee, and I do it, as the scheme depends almost entirely on the Advisory Committee.  We are asked to take a leap in the dark, because we do not know who the Advisory Committee is to be composed of.  I suggest to the Minister that it would facilitate the passage of the Bill if he would, during the next week or two, sound these members, and see whether they would act or not, and announce to the Dáil the names of the Advisory Committee before the Bill passes, because if you get the kind of person who loves to be on an advisory committee, and will talk a lot, and do very little work, this Bill will be a disaster; but if you get the right man it will be a great boon and a great advantage.  I am not saying that it will facilitate the process of the Bill if the Minister in advance announces the names of the advisory committee, because the names that would commend themselves to the Labour Party would not commend themselves to me.  But the Minister could let us know, if not the names, the qualifications and the kind of persons he is going to put in, because considering the Bill as a Bill, it is obvious that it stands or falls by that particular fact.  Therefore, I hope that the Minister will take to heart what I have said, and not keep us in the dark in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a speech on this Bill I notice that Deputy Heffernan asks for enlightenment on certain points.  I do not know whether he wanted that information or whether it was that he really wanted to string words together.  I say that because I noticed he was here while the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking, and I thought he listened to his statement.  I would give him credit for reading the second section of the Bill before making a speech of a quarter of an hour on it.  The second section of the Bill reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister for Industry and Commerce after consultation with an Advisory Committee nominated by him in conjunction with the Minister for Finance for the purpose of the section is satisfied that any loan proposed to be raised by any public authority or any association (corporate or unincorporate) of producers or consumers or of producers and consumers is calculated to promote a reduction in the retail prices in Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>Now, in the face of that he wants to know where do the farmers come in. He wants to know whether this Bill does anything for agriculture.  I thought that Deputy Heffernan knew that farmers were producers.  I did not expect that I needed to explain that at any great length to the Farmers' Party, but Deputy Heffernan evidently does not know that yet.</P>
      <P>Now, this Bill gives a chance to the farmers, and I had hoped they would rise to the occasion.  But if I were to judge from the Deputy's speech which I have heard&mdash;a speech which has depressed me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches made by the farmer Deputies show that their point of view is the old point of view. Make speeches, tall talk, and never come down to business.  Deputy Cooper said that this Bill was a novel experiment. Undoubtedly it is a novel experiment. It is an experiment that was made in the interests of the producers and consumers.  It was made in the light of the fact that the producer is <Col N="3012" /> getting a small price for his produce, and it was made in the light of the fact that the consumer was paying high prices for what he purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet that we made this very novel experiment.  We cannot go into trade.  I suppose, if we did, Deputy Heffernan, being a good, sound conservative and sensible man would strongly object, and would call it socialism, and I am sure that Deputy Cooper would say the same thing.  We think it would not be a good thing for us to go into trade, and we do not intend to.  But we do aim at reducing any financial difficulties that might stand in the way of producers and consumers going into trade for the purpose outlined in this Bill.  The object of the Bill is to reduce these difficulties to a minimum.  We are making this novel experiment, and we are bringing in legislation to effect that purpose. Deputy Heffernan gets up and asks what about the farmers, and what are you going to do for them.  We  reduce apparently the financial difficulties to a minimum, but evidently  is expected that we must do a good deal more.  We are asked to put up schemes and to find out what the producers and what the consumers want; we are asked to find out what is in their minds, and after finding out what is in their minds they want us to sit down and prepare schemes for them. Now, I want to say quite frankly that this clause in the Bill is going to be quite useless unless the producers and the consumers rise to the occasion, and unless they put up watertight schemes we are not going to prepare schemes for them.  It is not our business to do it.  I agree with Deputy Cooper when he says that uninstructed philanthropy leads nowhere except to loss.  We have had too much of uninstructed philanthropy up to the present in this country in connection with all these economic movements, and I really thought that we had got beyond that stage.  I am of opinion that the farmers&mdash;the producers&mdash;and the consumers generally ought to have enough of confidence in themselves to be able to go into the markets in competition with any other class, and that they ought to be able to put up a watertight business scheme which will hold water and <Col N="3013" /> which any Advisory Committee could pass.  If they cannot do that then the Bill is no good, and we can do nothing for them.  You can go a certain distance to help people, but I would ask Deputies to remember that you can go only a certain distance.  People must help themselves and no amount of rhetoric will get over that.  I hope very sincerely that the farmers&mdash;the producers&mdash;and the consumers are accepting this Bill in a different spirit from that in which Deputy Heffernan dealt with it in the course of his speech.</P>
    <P>If I might give one example: We have all heard of the milk scandal here. We all know that milk is being retailed in Dublin at from 2s. to 2s. 4d. a gallon. We know also that it is being sold in Belfast at 1s. 8d. per gallon. Why is that, I ask?  I leave it to anyone who likes to answer that question. The answer, I say, is not to our credit as business men; it is not to the credit of the farmers of the Free State, nor is it to the credit of business people in the Free State that there should be such a contrast.  If the County Dublin farmers will not work such a scheme, let the County Limerick farmers supply the Dublin market.  In my opinion the County Limerick farmers should be able to supply the milk to Dublin.  The transport charges are not worth speaking about, despite the fact that they are about 150 per cent. above the pre-war figures.  I am hopeful that if the County Dublin farmers will not do it, that the Limerick farmers will waken up and organise themselves, and do what the County Dublin farmers neglect to do.  I am sure that if they do so they will get the co-operation of the consumers and of a number of fairly well-educated, responsible people here in Dublin who are out of work at the present moment.  These people will distribute the milk for them, and go into the same organisation with them. If the Limerick farmers do that, I am sure that as far as Dublin is concerned they will be able to get, not 9d. per gallon for their milk, as they are getting at present, or 1s. a gallon, but that they will be able to get 1s. 4d. per gallon, or thereabouts.  I would like to point out that if the Limerick farmers <Col N="3014" /> do that it will not make the slightest difference to the butter industry. But I suggest that is a good proposition that I am putting forward, provided on the one hand that you have the producers&mdash;the farmers&mdash;and on the other hand a certain number of consumers, and a certain number of responsible people who may be unemployed at the present moment, and who are willing to go into the same organisation with the producer.  That is what has happened in Belfast, where milk is being supplied at 1s. 8d. per gallon.</P>
    <P>The organisation in Belfast did a good turn not only to the producers, but to the consumers.  The producers in Belfast are getting, as a result of their organisation, from 3d. to 4d. per gallon more for their milk than they would otherwise get, while the consumer is getting the milk at 6d. per gallon less than he would get it without the organisation.  When that can be done in Belfast, why should it not be done here?  All that this Bill does is to make certain arrangements and to obviate certain possible financial difficulties that may be in the way of such a scheme being put into operation, and no Government can be expected to do more than that.  Deputy Cooper described this Bill as a reality with what he called its promise.  He said that he was in favour of control, and that that would be his way of bringing down prices.  That I think, is a very debatable question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may correct the Minister, I did not say that I was in favour of control, but rather that I was in favour of compulsory information and notification as to what prices were, and if that proved ineffectual in bringing down prices then control would have to come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Deputy wants a fair price fixed.  He wants a fair price fixed for every essential article; he wants inspection of books so as to find out profits, and then he wants punishment for profiteering.  I say that is control, and I say further that it is control in a very rigid form.  The issue as between control and the method proposed in this Bill for reducing prices is not a new issue, but is a <Col N="3015" /> very old one.  I can say this, that control has failed in every country that it has ever been tried in.  We are not better than other people, or more efficient than other people.  The point I want to make is this, that control has failed in every country in which it has been tried.  I admit that control may have succeeded in temporarily reducing prices, but where it has been tried over any reasonably long period it has been a failure, and of course, the reasons are obvious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument is that in the long run control has tended to increase prices, but I have stated that over any short period, and under abnormal circumstances, it may have succeeded in keeping prices at a certain level.  Where control, however, has been tried over any reasonably long period it has been a failure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to control prices or to do something else, or to attack the subject in some other way. Is there any other alternative?  I do not know of any.  You can either rule prices or say that goods cannot be sold for more than a certain price or you must take steps like these.  You must foster competition to bring down prices; there is no other way.  I was talking about control for the moment. You are to fix a fair price, let us say, for the month of June.  I am sure the Deputy has some idea as to the difficulty of doing that, and as to what a delicate and subtle thing trade is.  You are to fix a price at North Wall, or will you fix it in Dublin or in Cork, because once you fix the price it is rigid and must be maintained, and it is illegal to charge above it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would fix an index figure at Dublin, and I would have standardised figures for Cork, Limerick and so on, in relation to the index figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would <Col N="3016" /> order an index figure for Dublin, and would have standardised figures for various parts of the country in regard to that index figure.  There are almost impossible obstacles to doing that. Then it is suggested that you would inspect books and find out the profits, and I want to comment upon that.  I am not saying whether I agree or disagree but Deputy Cooper advocates that.  I can imagine that on another Bill I would find Deputy Cooper very much against such a thing, and I will watch him very closely in the future. Then we are to punish the profiteer. What is an unfair profit?  You are to fix a price for every essential article, the price in Dublin and other centres in the country, working down to every little town, and after all that, and setting up all the necessary staff and machinery to do that, you are to find out the profits that are made on various essential commodities and say what a fair profit is.  You are to say what is a fair profit on every commodity, and you are not going to stop with essential commodities in the cost of living schedule.  You will have to go through to all other profits.  Is that scheme possible? It has failed in other countries. They tried it in England during the war and they had controlled prices up to a certain point, but look at the result now.</P>

      <P>Look at the result now.  It was long enough in existence in England to bring about the formation of rings, and it was long enough in Ireland to bring about the formation of rings.  What has kept down prices in England?  Prices are kept down lower in England than in Ireland. Prices in England were kept down by one big institution which has done more to keep down prices than everything else, and that is the Co-operative Wholesale Society of England, which has establishments in every big city in England, and even in a big country like England that has done more than anything else to keep prices down and to break rings.  You had control in England which was a failure, I maintain, and which brought about <Col N="3017" /> rings there, and also here, and to meet the reaction of control in England and in Ireland you have, as the only effective method, the method that we are trying to foster in this Bill.  That is the point as I see it.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, may I say, to relieve the Minister of the depression he is suffering under, that we welcome the idea of co-operation, and we welcome this Bill so far as we understand it.  But what I wished to convey was that we think the Minister should take advantage of the organisations as they are at present rather than that we should be constantly taunted with lack of organisation. We realise organisation is necessary, and the Minister must be aware that we are perfectly willing to do all we can to co-operate with him in any scheme he may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture was a little unfair to Deputy Heffernan.  It was obvious to every member of the Dáil that Deputy Heffernan was speaking of Section 1, dealing with the solution of unemployment, and the promotion of industries connected with agriculture which would have as one of its incidental effects the absorption of men from the unemployment market.  The Minister thought it well to assume that Deputy Heffernan was only speaking of the clause relating to the reduction of prices.  Something fell from the Minister that suggests to me that he is thinking of Section 2 as likely to effect a reduction in retail prices of agricultural produce, and also a reduction in the price of commodities which are essential to agriculture and that the term &ldquo;essential commodities&rdquo; may include essential commodities which are the tools of industry.  I wonder does the Minister for Industry and Commerce take that into his consideration? I assume that &ldquo;essential commodities&rdquo; in Section 2 referred to articles of food in general consumption by everybody &mdash;men and women&mdash;in the country, such as are referred to in the new cost of living schedule.  But now is it to be assumed that the farmers are desirous of a reduction in retail prices of essential commodities, to wit, food.  I know the Minister for Agriculture thinks <Col N="3018" /> they are not.  Let them get higher prices as wholesalers and there is also room for a lower price to the retailer. But I am not sure he is on very safe ground if he is thinking of immediate results.  I am afraid that is where the Minister is a little too optimistic and confident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>He quoted Belfast, and he quoted the British Wholesale Co-operative Society.  I know something about both, and I know the Belfast Co-operative Society in regard to its milk distribution scheme has been working for not less than ten years to arrive at a state when they could purchase in two weeks in January 45,000 gallons of milk for retail distribution. I am quite sure it is safe to say that as a consequence of that organisation for distribution that the retail prices of milk generally have been kept on a lower level than they would have been if that institution did not exist.  But it is not quite fair to say that they have reduced the price to the extent that the Minister has suggested.  Unless his figures are later than mine he has rather overstated the case.  I do not think it is true that the co-operative society in Belfast is able to pay to the farmer-producer prices at this time of the year much in advance of the prices received from the co-operative creamery by the farmer selling whole milk. I happen to have the figures for the year&mdash;that is, the proposed price to be paid to the farmers, and the prices at which the association would propose to retail its milk.  These figures were dated several months ago, but it was the scheme for the succeeding year. The prices for June and July were 8d. per gallon.  The farmers may not have accepted that contract, perhaps, I am not sure, nevertheless that was the scheme.  There was a jump for August of 3d., and 4d. for September, and the prices would be 11d. for May, 8d. for June; 8d., July; 11d., August, 12d., September; 14d., October; November, December and January, 15d.; February, 14d.; March, 13d., and April, 12d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Were these the prices to the farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3019" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the prices to the farmer on the farm, and the retail prices were to be 20d., May, June and July; 20d., August and September; 24d. for October, and 24d. right through till April, during the whole of the winter months.</P>
      <P>That is to say, 1s. 8d. for five months of the summer, and 2s. for seven months.  The margin for cost of distribution is still great.  But I think it is probably as low as the retail distribution of bottled milk, mainly twelve hours old, can be brought to.  There is much in the contention implied in the Minister's statement that by organisation of milk distribution a great deal of the cost might be saved, and that the consumer will share with the producer any benefit from that saving. But you are not going to arrive at that this summer or next winter.  This organisation has taken, perhaps, fourteen or fifteen years to develop, and certainly ten years to develop in the considerable way that it has now extended to.  I know from very close knowledge that for a considerable time it was not a very profitable venture.  One is not going to drive out competition and to supplant established dealers in the first few months of an undertaking of the kind.  If this scheme is not going to be effective within a year, then it is not going to achieve the purpose, which is sought to be achieved, in time enough to do any real good.  The same thing might well be said in regard to other commodities, but many other commodities can be handled by amateur organisations much easier than milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have a little more information on these proposals from the Minister before we pass the Second Reading.  The speech of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture suggests that he has in mind the larger towns, and strange as it may seem, one hears complaints in regard to the prices of agricultural produce from the small towns almost as loud as one hears from the cities.  That, undoubtedly, might be remedied by the direct supply from farmers' organisations to these towns, Unfortunately farmers have been trained to think that the outlet for agricultural produce is across the water, and all their organisation is <Col N="3020" /> directed to that end.  Much of the foodstuffs sold in these shops, and for which high prices are demanded, is agriculture produce, but, unfortunately, agricultural produce from distant farms.  I do not know whether the Minister has in mind giving encouragement to municipal organisations&mdash;urban and district councils&mdash; who are prepared to put up schemes regarding supplies of essential commodities in their own area, and whether the Minister for Local Government and Health is a party to that proposal.  I expect that there is more likelihood of, shall I say, quick returns regarding the lowering of prices if assistance were given to local authorities to use their own organisation for the purpose of opening local markets and selling retail in these local markets, than by anticipating a regular business organisation of farmers and consumers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice yesterday said very pertinent things regarding the cost which the community has to bear and which arises from too many retail shops.  He was thinking in terms of whiskey and porter, but the same remark applies just as strongly to all other commodities.  If we desire, as a community, that we should be served by 10,000 shopkeepers instead of 1,000, I presume, as a community, we are willing to pay for it, and I think we ought to be willing to face the fact that we are not only being served expensively, but badly, by these 10,000 shops, instead of more efficiently and better by 1,000 shops, which could do it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that where a municipal authority is prepared to tackle the problem of opening markets or stores for the sale of essential foodstuffs, he should give that body every encouragement and try to persuade the Minister for Local Government and Health to give his general or particular consent.  I do not agree with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in his general condemnation of control and his assertion that control has increased prices and has led to the establishment of rings.  One would think that we never heard anything of rings until the war.  One would think that there never had been inquiries into trusts before the war, or that we never knew anything of meat and milk rings, rings of <Col N="3021" /> a variety of kinds, until the control which began during the war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested that it was control which induced the development of rings.  As a matter of fact, rings and trusts, endeavouring to control prices, were, and are, characteristic of the large-scale industry which we are working towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I never suggested that there were not rings before control; control increased that tendency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Control improved organisation.  Control led to closer and more efficient organisation undoubtedly. In a sense, it may be true to say that a greater number of rings developed because of control and of the organisation which control entailed.  If the Minister will read, if he has not already read&mdash;I am sure he has&mdash;the reports of the Linlithgow Committee, he will find that the charges against trusts and rings are not quite as well supported as he would like.  As a matter of fact, if one takes the milk ring that serves London, it is rather suggested that the highly organised method of distribution has kept down costs to the consumer and has helped to maintain prices to the producer. There are no rings in the competitive towns, the towns which compete with London for supplies&mdash;the rings, at least, are not as efficient.  Nevertheless, the London milk ring, as it is called, can obtain from farmers, 150 miles from London, milk in competition with the suppliers who are supplying local cities and towns within 20 or 30 miles of London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not to be assumed that the organisation which involves a large amount of capital is necessarily going to increase the price to the consumer.  Many of us have talked that way, and, undoubtedly, the tendency of such an organisation is to fleece the consumer. Unless checked and controlled, such an organisation will fleece both consumer and producer.  When you have a little manipulation on the Stock Exchange, and a re-organisation of the financial scheme of the company, then you will find, of course, a movement towards <Col N="3022" /> fleecing to a greater extent than before, the consumer and producer.  There is nothing inherently bad in that organisation, which is generally denounced as a ring or a trust.  It depends on whether it is controlled or not.  That control may be public opinion; it may be legislation.  But there is to be control. There again, I suggest to the Minister, when he denounces control, it depends entirely on how that control is applied and what kind of control it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that control is fear of public opinion and a certain amount of competition.  A good deal of milk is supplied in London, not through the milk ring.  I am not suggesting that they have a monopoly of the milk supply for London.  Of course, the competition of the smaller institutions helps to keep down prices to something like a reasonable level.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced at all, from what I read in the Bill, that the scheme proposed regarding the method of reducing prices, is going to be effective.  I would like to have much more information as to what is in the mind of the Minister.  There are two proposals in regard to the reduction of prices.  One is to grant loans and the other is to guarantee the repayment of principal and the payment of interest; or the repayment of principal, or the payment of interest. Would the Minister give us some light as to what is running through his mind in that respect?  There is a limit to the sum to be voted under this section &mdash;£250,000.  That £250,000, supposing it were used up by way of loan, will not go anything like so far as if it was mainly used up by way of guarantee of interest.  I think it would be much more enlightening if we had the views of the Minister as to how this section would work.  It was Deputy Heffernan, I think, who wanted the Ministry to be very careful regarding the class of undertaking that will be supported under this Bill.  Of course, that is very good advice.  Will the Minister give us a little more enlightenment on this matter? Has he any organisation in mind beyond that hinted at by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture?  Does he know if there are any local governing authorities who would be willing to undertake, say, to supply coal at cost price, or of potatoes or bread?  I know that there are certain bakeries in the smaller towns, the proprietors of which would be very glad to undertake to supply bread for these towns without any charge except interest or rent for the use of the bakeries.  I suggest to the Minister that he should think very favourably of any proposals that come forward regarding the supply of bread and coal at cost price by the municipalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the other part of the Bill <Col N="3024" />&mdash;the main part&mdash;this is intended to affect industry directly, and to reduce the number of unemployed.  Deputy Cooper commented on the fact that he thought this Bill was slightly more favourable than the British Bill. view of this matter was that the sum fixed was small, but, no doubt, the Minister will reply that if it proves effective it can be enlarged.</P>
    <P>I hope that is what is in his mind. I think it is the kind of proposal that will likely do good in the way of encouraging development and promoting a certain amount of employment in the country which would not otherwise be forthcoming.  Again, I would like to know what is in the Minister's mind. Is he thinking of the larger, the more ambitious schemes?  When we hear of the development of industry by bringing to the country the creators and directors of industry, that suggests those more ambitious schemes of development which will be centred in one or two places in the country, schemes probably which would come perhaps a little later but would come eventually without this particular inducement, schemes which might be expedited by the offer of the Bill which is only to operate for schemes which are brought into effect in twelve months.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think more value would be got out of the £750,000 by encouraging a large number of smaller operations which are at present waiting for capital and looking for the assistance which this kind of proposal would bring to them.  Probably it will be said that the two can go together, but I hope the Minister is not going to rule out schemes for the development of quarries, or schemes of one kind or another, small schemes where ten, twenty, fifty or a hundred people might be employed in a very short time. I think if the many local schemes were taken into account, the country would be relieved greatly, and even the problem in the big cities would be also relieved by virtue of the relief in the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be averse to any proposal that may be brought forward to amend the Bill in this direction, and that the conditions under which grants are made and loans are <Col N="3025" /> given&mdash;conditions imposed by the Ministry&mdash;would be made known to the Dáil, and that amongst those conditions will be one which will insist upon fair conditions of labour being granted to the employees in those concerns. The Minister, in opening the discussion, said that unemployment was not new, and that it was not confined to this country.  He suggested that a Bill of this kind might settle the problem. I am sorry to think that that is not likely to be the case.  There was unemployment before the war, and following the course of this Bill, and the development of industries under a scheme of this kind, we should inevitably, I think, have a recurrence of unemployment. There is no suggestion, for instance, in the Bill that the products of the industries which are to be promoted are going to find a market. There is no suggestion that it is those schemes of industrial development, productive schemes which aim at supplying the Irish market, that are to be given preference.  There is no suggestion in the Bill, or in the Minister's speech that he would give special encouragement to industries which have as their objective the supplying of the Irish market, and thereby ensure that the producers will have a market for their produce.  I am not sure whether combining those two sections there might not be embodied a proposal which would enable the local municipal store that I spoke of, to have, shall I say, a licence from the Ministry on condition that it would supply Irish-grown produce, and sell Irish-made articles and that the industries which are to be assisted under Section 1 will be such as will supply the consumers in this country who are also the producers, through those shops.</P>
    <P>Thereby we can have concurrently the development of the productive industries supplying an Irish consuming public.  Otherwise I can imagine a continuance of what unfortunately prevailed, that you will encourage Irish industry by State grants, by loans and guaranteed interest; people engaged in those industries will follow their usual bent and spend the money they obtain by their productive work on produce which is imported, and then half the <Col N="3026" /> value from the point of view of employment and national wealth production is lost.  I suggest to the Minister for consideration that when you are developing productive schemes you have to bear in mind the market.  If that market is to be abroad then the producers will have to face the competition of British and other equally well subsidised schemes.  If you will aim at supplying an Irish market and giving encouragement to consumers through municipal stores to purchase Irish products, whether agricultural or industrial, then you will be running the two lines with something like a prospect of ultimate success and laying the foundation for a permanent industrial development, and a permanent assurance of a market.</P>

      <P>While I am pleased that the Minister has endeavoured to help a project which will have the effect of reducing the cost of living, I believe that this Bill will not have as much effect as he thinks.  We have heard this evening about the cost of certain essential commodities, and those of us who are particularly acquainted with the prices of those essential commodities wonder why responsible Ministers should stand up in the House and make statements&mdash;unknowingly, I admit&mdash;which are not founded on fact, but which are bandied about in the Press.  They bring them forward here as conclusive proof of what can be gained by the Bill the Minister has put before us.  As a matter of fact, milk is cheaper in Dublin than it is in Belfast. Milk is being sold in working-class districts in Dublin at 1/2 and 1/4 a gallon.  You are not hearing a word about that, but that is the prevailing price of milk.  2/4 is the price which is charged to those gentry residing, say, in Merrion Square, where it is served at the door, but the price of country milk in Dublin, the supply of which amounts to several thousand gallons a day, is roughly from 1/2 to 1/4 a gallon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give you definite proof of that.  Everyone knows who has examined it that this question of the cost of living is a bogey.  The Minister's statement that prices were reduced <Col N="3027" /> by the co-operative wholesale society in England is also a fallacy. Did they reduce the price of beer? They do not handle beer, and yet the price of beer in Dublin, where it is produced, is greater than in England. That argument does not hold water.</P>
      <P>Take the price of bread.  The price of flour in a small town in the country is 41/- per sack.  When made into bread it is 75/-.  Who is getting the 34/-?  I want to point out where the rings are.  Although the prices of essential commodities are not very high, there are rings of producers and rings of manufacturers and rings of labour. In Dublin to-day the highest prices are demanded for every service in the labour market.  I am not saying that that is a bad policy, but it is the fact. I am not condemning it.  I am only stating the reason.  I am not saying labour is not right in demanding those wages.  Milk is delivered in Belfast to the doors at 1/8.  The wages of the man who delivers the milk there is about 60 per cent. of the wages a similar man gets in Dublin.  You can see yourself that 8d. per gallon, spread over the distribution which that man covers, will hardly pay the difference in the wage.  Therefore, we cannot get very much from this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister for Agriculture should get up and speak about farmers not endeavouring to help the Government in reducing the cost of living, when he knows that I have been, in conjunction with the whole body of farmers, considering how, by reason of this Bill, we can best bring down the cost of essential commodities. I approach him on the matter and he gets up and says that the farmers do nothing.  We were asking him all along for information.  I asked him to-day for information but he has not got the expert information I required. I asked him what way milk was delivered in Leith, Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast and London.  I wanted the details of delivery.  He does not know, but he should get somebody behind him to tell him.  He told me to go over and see.  I am going over.  But to say that we are not alive to the actualities of the situation is nonsense.  I was <Col N="3028" /> on a Committee to-day dealing with the pig question, and the astonishing statement was made by a very large factoryowner that bacon was sold in large quantities wholesale in the city of Dublin at 78/- per cwt.  That is about 8d. per lb., and you say the cost of living is high in Dublin.  It is not.  It cannot be, because there is too much competition amongst the shops.  They cannot hold up the prices.  The prices are approaching pre-war.</P>

      <P>We have heard about &ldquo;capital expenditure for productive enterprises.&rdquo;  I take it that under that I would be entitled to go to the Minister and ask him for £100,000 to start a brick works in order to make bricks to build houses.  That would be productive enterprise.  It would be reducing the cost of living.  I would be entitled to produce bricks in order to reduce the cost of bricks.  But I know very well that I would not be able to carry on.  Do I not know that the labour market is unsettled and that there is no stability?  Nobody is going to risk his money when he sees what is happening all over the place.  Dissension in the labour world is doing as much harm as dissension in the political world.  Those things do not make for stability.  Nobody is going to venture the expenditure of money unless there is stable government and the ordinary stability for the people.  A peculiar feature of our legislation is that last week we were considering how best to produce butter for export which would command the highest price.  Here we have a Bill in which we are considering how best to get the lowest price.  It is most extraordinary. <Col N="3029" /> The dead meat industry has been mentioned. What will that do in reducing the cost of living?  Nothing.  The cost of living in the city is as cheap as it is in any part of Britain.  There is a good class trade to be got, and I think the farmers might get more for their produce if they endeavoured to cater for the better class trade.  We have got the trade of the workman&mdash; a good, sound trade where you are paid every day.  That is the best way to do trade.  But we ought to try and cater for the better class trade, where you must give credit and charge more.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would be good enough to shoulder a scheme of ours and allow us to deliver milk direct to the consumer in proper bottles.  It is under consideration, and when it is ready we will come forward with it, and I am sure the Minister for Agriculture will support it and will not talk about 2s. 4d.</P>

      <P>They get 15 per cent. profit in the winter, when milk does not turn sour and when there is no waste. We will do the same with the help of the Ministry's money.  I really do not think that there is anything in it, because if you have good solvent security and go to a banker you will get the money.  If this Bill means that we will get the money at a less rate of interest it will help us, but if it means that we have to get the bank rate of interest it will not help us, as we can get the money without Government help.  We can get money at 6 per cent., but if the Minister can get it for us at 4 per cent. he will be helping us.  We can get the money ourselves as long as we have credit.  I appreciate the difficulties there are in a measure of this kind.  I appreciate the value of any Bill that will regulate prices.  We investigated prices in Dublin, but we <Col N="3030" /> found we had no power, especially in regard to one particular trade.  Competition is the only means by which prices can be brought down.  By controlling prices you stabilise prices.  I confess, as a producer, that I got the best prices in my life at the time when the price of milk was controlled.  This is a step in the right direction if it helps producers in the country, and if it enables facilities to be given to bring the produce to the doors of the consumer, it will have the effect of lowering the cost of living three or four points.  By that means there would be a saving on the bonuses given to Government officials which would cover the loss on wild-cat schemes.</P>

      <P>I am sure we would all be delighted to secure the necessities of life as cheaply as Deputy Wilson and the members of his party get them.  His whole argument is against <Col N="3031" /> the cost of labour and rings.  We hold that there is a milk ring in the city of Dublin, and not alone do they supply milk at exorbitant prices, but they christen that milk with Vartry water. Farmers in the country have been prosecuted for this.  Deputy Wilson stated that there is competition.  Where is there any competition amongst shopkeepers either here or in the country? They are all in the rings.  I hold that this Bill will not reduce the cost of living or decrease unemployment.  We want Bills that will give employment and give work to those who are without it.  There is talk here of the price of beer and other things.  Where is the man who is unemployed to get money for beer and other things?  This is a bigger problem than many other problems which the Government have had to face, and we appeal to them to face it while there is yet time and before they come on with their other Bills.  Bills are being rushed through here, but the most important Bill of all is being neglected, and that is one to provide work throughout the country.  If the Government do not face this problem we will probably have to take a different attitude from that so far taken by us, and then it will probably be too late for Deputy Wilson to get up here and make such statements as he has just made.</P>

      <P>Like you, sir, I am wondering what relation the question of milk prices on the various public boards has to do with this Bill.  I think Deputies have been inclined to pay too much attention to Section 2 of the Bill. I am rather doubtful as to its potency or as to whether it will do anything to reduce prices.  I think that Clause 1 is an important clause, and the Ministry are to be congratulated upon bringing this Bill forward.  As we have said repeatedly from these benches, we do not advocate unemployment benefit as such, and we do not want the dole. We want employment for the workers in the country, and we want a feeling of security in the country, and we believe that it is only by measures such as this now before the House that that feeling of security is going to be brought about.  The first section is, in my opinion, a bit ambiguous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3032" /> I am sorry I was not here when the Minister was speaking on the Second Reading, but I would like some information when he is concluding, and I would like to know what are the schemes that local authorities are supposed to put before this Advisory Committee. I am rather doubtful as to the interpretation that this Advisory Committee will put on certain schemes. Take the case where there is a cement factory, as in Wexford.  This cement factory's misfortunes have been repeatedly mentioned in the Dáil.  We have had great difficulty in keeping it open. It is responsible for the employment of about sixty men.  I want to know if certain public bodies took up the question of concrete road-making, and if they applied for a loan to do that work, would that be considered a proper scheme under this Bill?  It would be providing employment in a dual sense. It would be employment direct by the local bodies concerned, and it would be a fillip to that particular industry which is at a very low ebb.  I would like to know from the Minister if he thinks the Advisory Committee would sanction such schemes as that.  Deputy Wilson states that this Bill will not help the dead meat industry.  I differ from him in that opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I said that the dead meat industry would not reduce the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was coming to, for if you helped an industry such as that which is carried out on co-operative lines, to my mind you would help to bring down the cost of living.  I know something about the dead meat industry.  We have a bacon factory in Wexford, and it is hit very hard at the moment by rings established by the old-established firms. These firms are in a position to pay more for pigs at the moment and to sell at a lesser price, because of these rings.  I think this is being done only to crush out the co-operative industry. It is not a paying proposition as carried on now.  I think that where these co-operative firms are struggling, that this Bill is going to be of great advantage to them, and that eventually it will tend to the breaking up of these particular <Col N="3033" /> rings which the old-established firms have formed.  I hope when the Minister is replying he will give us a better interpretation of Clause I., especially as to the powers of local bodies, and what schemes they will be empowered to undertake under that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think myself that a good deal of the legislation that we have been dealing with during the past few weeks has not received proper attention, and that this Bill will remain as one of the most important Bills that has been placed before this Dáil.  I think that it certainly can be made so.  It lies more or less in the hands of the Irish people themselves as to what is to be done to cure the problem of unemployment, and, if I might say so, to use a word that was very familiar in the political history of not long ago, this Bill is Sinn Fein in the best possible sense.  Reference has been made to the connection between this Bill and the prices that prevail and that affect the cost of living.  Over a year ago I stated exactly what I felt myself in that regard, and presented my hostages in that matter.  I would like just to read exactly what I then said.  It was in the note to the Report of the Commission on Prices where, dealing with the recommendation of that Commission that all traders should be required to display a list of prices, I stated&mdash;and the Dáil agreed&mdash;that it was more and more obvious &ldquo;That this problem of prices was involved in a much larger economic question.  What especially struck me in some of the evidence given before the Commission was that which dealt with this very problem.  It was fairly clear (as clear as evidence of such a nature could make it) that very large profits were being charged by certain traders.  But it was also clear that some of these traders were barely able to maintain a livelihood.  The large percentage of profit, that is to say, had become necessary because of the large number of persons competing with one another for the same business within a very small area.  I wish to draw attention to this, because it implies an inversion of what is usually supposed to be the case.  It is usually supposed that great competition <Col N="3034" /> will reduce prices, whereas, so far as distribution is concerned, excessive competition means that there are many to share a limited amount of business, and that each of the many must, therefore, increase his or her profits in order to make a livelihood.  I have, therefore, been driven to the conclusion that the higher rate of living in Ireland, by comparison with England, is due to the fact that there is a higher percentage of persons dependent on distributive profits rather than on production. Any country in which so large a percentage of the population is engaged, as in Ireland, in the distributive trade, must necessarily, I believe, be more expensive in which to live.  The only real way in which to mend this fault is to create productive employment, in which to draw off those who are now engaged in, or dependent on, merely distributive profits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read that because I stated there just as clearly as I could what I think is the most important element in the economic configuration of our national life, which I believe this Bill will help to improve.  It is impossible to have a reduction of prices so long as there are so many persons engaged in a purely distributive business.  The right method is to increase the purchasing power of the people themselves by increasing the national production, and the value of this Bill is that it sets out to achieve that end by the method that has already proved successful in England. This Bill is not a new one.  Before I touch on the Bill itself I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the conviction that has been expressed by many speakers here to-night, in which I fully share, that the right method has been taken by increasing production rather than by merely controlling prices, and that the method attempted in the Bill is going to be a very long circuit, and that it is not going to yield any fruit within a measurable distance of time, and if it does yield fruit it will only be by national co-operation.  Therefore, I think we will have yet to return, though I agree with the Bill, to the question of a definite control of prices.  Nevertheless, the Bill attacks this problem at the very fundamentals.  It is a measure <Col N="3035" /> that has already proved itself to be successful in Great Britain, and I would like to draw the attention of the Labour Party to the fact that the prime origin of this Bill is the British Trades Facilities Act, and that the real origin of the British Trades Facilities Act was the fact that British Labour raided the then British Premier in 1921, at Gairloch, and it was as a result of the conference and consultations held there with Labour that that Act, or the father of this Bill was first framed. Dealing with this conference quite the most able exponent of the British Trades Facilities Act, Sir Lynden Macassey, who had examined and dealt with its working, has said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general opinion of the experts summoned to those conferences was that a large amount of new constructional work (extension and electrification of railways, construction of docks, extension of manufacturing works, etc.), which would normally have taken place during the war, still required to be carried out, but that such work was being held up by the high costs of manufacture and the high rates which had to be paid for money.  It was felt that although much of this work was urgently needed for the proper service of the public handling of trade, the placing of orders might be deferred indefinitely in the hope of a fall of prices, and meanwhile the Government would be compelled to go on paying unemployment doles.  If, however, cheap money could be provided, one at least of the main obstacles would be overcome, and this might in many cases afford sufficient inducement to commence the works immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was as a result of that that the British Trade Facilities Bill was first framed in 1921.  It was followed a year later by another Bill of the same kind, and the Bill which we have before us now is practically line for line and word for word a copy of the earlier measure in all parts, except Section 2, which is the only matter in regard to which, for the first time, a new element has been introduced.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, in this Bill the pivot of the system is the Advisory <Col N="3036" /> Committee, to which the Minister drew the attention of the Dáil, and it has been referred to several times.  I would like to ask him a definite question in regard to this Advisory Committee that I believe to be of very great importance. I find it has been of great importance, and has been proved of very great importance in the history of the measure from which this measure is derived.  In introducing the Trade Facilities Bill the British Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a definite pledge I would like to ask the Minister if he is prepared to renew that definite pledge that was given on the other side.  The pledge was that once a committee had been constituted the Government would not interfere in any manner with its discretion.  The reason for that pledge was that it should never be able to be alleged, rightly or wrongly, that the Government had been taking decisions owing to political influences that might have been brought to bear.  The method that is being adopted in Great Britain at the present moment in regard to the Trade Facilities Bill is that the committee having been created and a sum of money named, then the committee proceeds to expend that sum, and its discretion is not interfered with at any point.  I ask that question for this reason.  The Minister spoke about the committee submitting its decisions for Departmental consideration and approval.  Now if these words of his are any indication of the method that is going to be adopted I would like to point out in the first place that it is quite contrary to the practice adopted elsewhere as a result of experience. I think, without any prejudice in the matter in favour of earlier experience, that once the Advisory Committee has been appointed, the committee should be left alone and left entirely to deal with these matters on certain principles which it will itself formulate.</P>
    <P>Both in regard to Sections 1 and 2, the success of the Bill will depend almost entirely on the Advisory Committee. Questions have been asked here to-day as to how the Advisory Committee will expend that money It is not a very large sum that is placed at its disposal. I referred earlier to certain comments made by a British publicist and public servant who has some <Col N="3037" /> amount of experience in regard to the Trade Facilities Act there, and he stated exactly how this measure in Great Britain is administered.  He says &mdash;&ldquo;The Committee keeps always before it the fact that it is a custodian of the Public Purse.&rdquo;  I wish to emphasise the words that follow, because their importance cannot be over-stated. He proceeds: &ldquo;And that much more harm than good would be done by recommending guarantees in cases in which the risks are greater than the principles of sound commercial prudence would accept.  It does not feel that it is called upon to recommend a guarantee in cases of a speculative nature for which even in normal times, the promoters would have found difficulty in raising money.  Nor does it think that it ought to recommend guarantees to relieve undertakings from financial embarrassments incurred through lack of ordinary commercial foresight on the part of those responsible for their management.  A guiding rule is that the Government's liability should be as small as possible, and that a good commercial security should be obtained in every case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Guarantees in all matters are, of course, only guarantees in respect of loans, whether in loan issue or direct loan, and never in any case in regard to ordinary stock issue.  That answers the point, I think, that Deputy Wilson asked.  The main benefit conferred is that a cheaper rate of interest is charged upon such loan money than it would get if it were issued ordinarily in the market.  The English rate at the present moment for all issues under the Trade Facilities Act come between 4½% and 4¾% on debenture stock and debentures, whereas some of the enterprises that have taken advantage of this would not be able to issue much under 6 per cent. and 6½ per cent., with the result that the benefit given to enterprise has increased production to a very considerable extent, and by increasing production has done two other things.  By cheapening production it has made the commodity cheaper to the final consumer, and by increasing production by that cheapening, it has done a great deal to mend, if not to cure, the unemployment problem.  Incidentally it has also this further benefit, <Col N="3038" /> that it has increased the purchasing power of all workers.  One has only to look back on the history of Great Britain within the last three years and to imagine how it would have managed without the Trade Facilities Bill having regard to the huge number of enterprises it has taken up and supported by guaranteeing loans which they have asked for, to realise how considerable has been the benefit which that Bill has conferred.  Nevertheless, it is true that the conditions in Ireland are vastly different from the conditions in Great Britain.  Great Britain is a great industrial country; Ireland is not.  I would have liked that the Minister would have given some indication of how he thinks the Advisory Committee would devise its policy in regard to the kind of enterprise which it would foster by guarantees of the sort indicated in the Bill.  I think that is an important matter.</P>
    <P>I have referred to Great Britain, and one cannot help referring to it because this Bill is an attempt to take a measure first framed for those different conditions and apply it to this country. Therefore, in order to discover its effect in this country, it is right to take its history from what has been the experience elsewhere, and turning to that experience, one knows that a great many enterprises have been started by Great Britain outside England altogether.  That condition does not prevail in regard to us in the last degree.  At the present moment I believe this Bill, rightly administered and rightly co-operated with, should achieve and could achieve another very great benefit to which sufficient attention has not been drawn.  As I said the other day, 26 years ago we turned the adverse balance that had prevailed for half a century against us, and we began to export in cash value more than we imported.  Within the past two or three months that situation has entirely changed.  For the next two or three months, while agriculture is still exporting, we can rely upon that fair balance being maintained, but after that, at the end of August or September and with the coming of winter, unless something has definitely been done to increase production between now and then, the situation for the <Col N="3039" /> winter will not be a very pleasant one to contemplate.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should look at the matter frankly now.  It is not decrying the case.  It is merely looking facts in the face, and it is merely recognising that the situation is as it is. Credits are being called in all over the country, as the Minister knows, and as any bank will state.  Between now and September or October, some measures will have to be taken and could, under this Bill, be taken, if it be rightly pushed and co-operated in, such as will increase our production and enable us to rescue a situation that has its serious element.  While the Minister was speaking I asked him if he would indicate, in regard to section 2, the kind of associations that he referred to, and he, with the marked approval of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, deftly turned aside and declined to indicate the kind of associations he had in mind.  Nevertheless, when it came to the turn of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, he was not so discreet or so tactful.  He indicated he was thinking definitely of the kind of organisation that is known as co-operative.</P>
    <P>Section 2, I take it&mdash;and it has generally been interpreted&mdash;is the first statement by a Government in this country that it is going definitely to support co-operative methods.  I make no comment; I leave it at that.  I read out here a few moments ago some of the principles that have prevailed in regard to the administration of this measure elsewhere, some of the principles that the Advisory Committee will hold before it, I take it for certain, in regard to section 1.  That is to say, that no loans will be given except on grounds of sound commercial prudence, and that no guarantees will be given to relieve undertakings from financial embarrassments incurred through lack of ordinary commercial foresight.  That will prevail, I take it, in regard to section 1.  The point I wish to emphasise is that it should be held to prevail with equal firmness in regard to section 2.</P>
    <P>Many a co-operative society has been established, and because of local favouritism, managers were appointed <Col N="3040" /> who should not have been appointed, and, as a consequence, these societies have found themselves, and do find themselves to-day, faced with failure. Societies of that kind, I take it, are societies that will not come in for benefit under this Bill, unless the Minister or the Government in some way exercise a continued control over societies of that kind.  I would like to ask the Minister, in conclusion, if, in regard to Section 2, to which so much attention has been drawn, he would be inclined to favour the course of action that would not be so necessary in regard to Section 1.  Loans might be guaranteed under Section 1 for definitely productive enterprises, and those enterprises would then be left to their own devices.  If loans are going to be guaranteed under Section 2 to certain co-operative enterprises, where the same responsibility for failure does not prevail as in regard to other matters, there should be some principles laid down and some control and supervision exercised to see that right methods of business are exerted in the general management of societies of that kind.</P>

      <P>This debate has, unfortunately, wandered rather much, and possibly I may be fortunate in having a definite time limitation put upon me in my attempt to reply to the many points raised.  Deputy Heffernan first criticised this measure from the point of view that it has not got, in his imagination, things which are actually in the text of the Bill.  Having criticised it on that basis, he proceeded to read me a lecture as to what should not be done and what should not be allowed under the Bill.  He pointed out that unless the Bill were altered all sorts of wild-cat schemes would be formulated and put forward for approval. The checks in the Bill are rather numerous. There is one big check, and that is that the whole thing is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance. If Deputy Heffernan or any other Deputy thinks that wild-cat schemes are going to pass an expert Advisory Committee, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Department of the Ministry of Finance, I am afraid that a certain amount of the talk that has previously been heard in <Col N="3041" /> the Dáil relating to the Minister for Finance has been more or less hypocritical. The checks, as I have said, are numerous.  They are possibly too restrictive.</P>

      <P>They will certainly be tame-cat schemes by the time they get through all those barriers. The checks are indeed acknowledged by some as unduly restrictive, but they are necessary to safeguard public funds.  Deputy Cooper has asked if at some part of the Committee Stage I could give the names of those whom it is my intention to appoint on the Advisory Council; but he rather recanted later, and he thought the giving of the names would not help the progress of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to give names, but if Deputy Cooper thinks the Bill could be improved by inserting qualifications for members of the Advisory Council, corresponding to the qualifications set down for members of the railway tribunal, that is a matter that we could consider and debate in Committee.  Deputy Cooper also raises a point as to the President's promise on how far this Bill carried out the pledge he gave, and he divided what he thought should be done under three heads&mdash;(1) that prices be published; (2) that power be taken to inspect books; and (3) that power be taken to punish profiteers where profiteering was proved.  That was the scheme considered and rejected.  This is the favoured proposition instead of that other scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the authorities I could get and all the authorities we consulted did tend to the conclusion that there is not much good in publishing prices in this country at the moment unless you go further and take some power to fix prices.  If you proceed to take power to fix prices you must go further still, and you must fix those prices in every town on all essential commodities at every stage of the passage of those commodities from the producer to the consumer, and there are very many stages. <Col N="3042" /> There were two ways suggested.  One was the setting up of a Government Department, with a whole staff of accountants, customs authorities and officials, and the second was the setting up of a Board and the supplying to that Board of funds in order to open stores on their own.  These two plans have not been found successful in their working in other countries.  The Minister for Agriculture stated that control had done away with competition; that it had created rings, and the only way to burst rings was to encourage competition. And it is hoped to encourage competition under this Bill.  That argument of the Minister for Agriculture was countered by Deputy Johnson, but I have here, and I have given great consideration to it, the Report of a Commission set up by a Decree of the French Government in 1920 to investigate price variations, their effect on the cost of living, and the cause.  That Committee set its finger on many causes of the continuous high cost of living in France, but one thing they did single out definitely was the fixing of prices. They singled that out for special comment, and said that it was to a degree more than any other thing responsible for the high cost of living in France.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is aware that the scheme, both in France and in England, during the war, of fixing prices was to fix a price of a kind which would encourage production in those places, and they therefore fixed fairly high margins for manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuance of the system was singled out as one of the causes of the high cost of living. But there was one point that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture did not make, and that in deference to Deputy Cooper's argument, I think, should be given.  These objections, however, apply only to the fixing of prices by coercive methods.  It is pointed out that price fixing, in the sense of indicating to the public the reasonable price which should be asked, is in a different category and may be very valuable.  A wider education of the public is urged as the surest means of adjusting price and eliminating abuses.  But they went on to say that it would require considerable <Col N="3043" /> publication before any mere indication of prices would be of any value, and I found myself faced with the necessity for taking some steps which held out an immediate prospect of a reduction of prices.  If I have to go on the lines indicated by the French Committee, which urges a wider education of the public as the surest means of adjusting prices and eliminating abuses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the French Government acted on the Report of that Committee, and if so, is he aware that the cost of living in France continues to be very high, and that possibly the Committee were wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy asked did the Government proceed to educate the French public and have they succeeded in their efforts, I would say that it is obvious that the Committee did not expect that this would be successful in that regard for a considerable time, because the delay is what they urged against that, and that is what I urge against anything of that sort here.  If we had a well-informed public, a well-educated public, there would be no necessity to bring in any coercive measure, or no necessity for a non-coercive measure such as this. Deputy Johnson raised the point of the essential commodities.  As far as was the intention of the Department, all essential commodities&mdash;and I think I stated that in opening&mdash;would mainly mean the 68 commodities on which the cost of living is based.  Other commodities may be added.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose it is possible, under the ruling <Col N="3044" /> made recently by the Ceann Comhairle, to go into the question of the milk supply in Belfast, and I do not intend to go into it.  But one other question was raised on that matter.  Deputy Johnson advanced an argument that it had taken a long time to bring this co-operative society to perfection, that we wanted a speedy method here, and consequently we could not draw any lesson from Belfast.  I thought that one of the advantages of belonging to a society was that you were able to take advantage of improvements effected by earlier generations, or even by an earlier period in your own generation. It took many years to find out how to stand an egg on its head, but I can do it any day now.  It took a considerable time to bring a fountain pen to perfection, but I can use one any time.  We do not need to go back and repeat all the processes up to the final stage, and if we were to go on that basis I think that measures could be ruled out of consideration on the ground that time would be necessary. Deputy Johnson raised the other point with regard to the moneys under section 2, and submitted as his suggestion that the amount of money would go further when applied on the guaranteeing of loans than when set forth definitely as a loan.  That has been adverted to and the Bill allows that.  The Bill is based on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What I am anxious to know is what is the amount of the moneys.  The Bill, of course, has been drawn up on the British Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 never appeared in any English Bill.  There is no section in any British Bill in which there is any division of moneys into actual loans and the guarantee of loans.  The aggregate capital amount of the loans granted under this section shall not exceed the sum of £50,000, and the total aggregate capital amount of loans granted under the section shall not exceed the sum of £250,000. I think that that indicates very clearly the department's mind, that £200,000 had better be given to the guaranteeing of loans, and the sum of £50,000 only in respect of actual loans, and to that extent we are in agreement with Deputy Johnson's view.  The question <Col N="3045" /> of schemes promoted by county councils and municipalities, and as to how they would be received, has been raised both by Deputy Corish and Deputy Johnson.  These schemes will be most welcome.  They are allowed for in the Bill, and there are certain considerations affecting such schemes which would give the Minister for Finance&mdash;I will not say pleasure, because the Minister for Finance never has any pleasure in lending money or in guaranteeing money&mdash;but I gathered from him that schemes framed in such a way would meet with much greater approval, as far as he is concerned, than other schemes.</P>

      <P>Well, the scheme that the Deputy suggested is a scheme that would receive approval.  The Advisory Committee will have a certain amount to do with its interpretation, but so far as the Department is concerned it is a type of scheme that would be favoured.  I have been asked several times what was in my mind with regard to this Bill.  What was in my mind was not that I should suggest schemes to outside bodies and to corporations, and that they should then come along with my scheme, perhaps put in a somewhat better way, and present it for approval.  This is a scheme definitely to get away from, and to do away with, the necessity for Government interference.  It is proposed to interest the people outside, and when they show enthusiasm and initiative, and come along with a proper scheme, that scheme will then, if passed by the Committee, get the necessary loan or guarantee.</P>

The question of Irish manufacture and whether it is for home or foreign market will come into the terms and conditions.  The schemes will rank in order, according to whether Irish manufacture is required, and whether it is for the home market or not.

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>After the prolonged period of listening-in and in the sultry atmosphere which we might naturally expect would be provoked by a discussion on the milk question, I am rather reluctant to obtrude the matter which I want to raise and to tire the Dáil.  But taking into account the very serious grievances which many old men and women are suffering from throughout the Saorstát, through the ruling of the Minister for Local Government and the officials of his Department, I think it my duty to bring before the Dáil this matter.  What I intend to refer to is the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act by the Minister for Local Government and the permanent officials of his Department, and to their interpretation, or shall I say rather their misinterpretation of some of its principal provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, sir, as far as I can judge from several cases which have been brought before me, it is the settled policy of the Local Government Department to deny the benefits of the Act to any person who receives the slightest aid to subsistence although that person may be qualified as regards age, and as regards want of means.  That is if they have been receiving maintenance or shelter from friends, whether relatives or not, who are not under any legal obligation to afford such maintenance or shelter, but have been doing so through a sense of Christian charity, a quality which, I am sorry to say, does not seem to have pervaded the Ministry of Local Government or its officials, that these persons are <i>ipso facto</i> debarred from the benefits of the Act.  Now, I do not think there is anything whatever in the Act to justify this course of action.  It is set forth as a statutory condition in the Act that persons applying for a pension must satisfy the pension authorities that their incomes do not exceed £39 5s.  Now, to my mind, the term <Col N="3048" />&ldquo;means&rdquo; must be interpreted as consisting of resources belonging to the applicant for the pension and &ldquo;means&rdquo; does not mean that if that person receives voluntary aid or assistance from another person, whether a relative or not, that this is to be taken into account and charged against that person. It is absurd to contend that voluntary maintenance or voluntary shelter debars a person from the benefit of the Act, considering that these benefits may be cut off at any time at the will or at the whim of the donor.  I think that that is a contention that cannot stand. I think there is no warrant for it in the Act.  I do not wish to speak on generalities. I will give a concrete case. Miss Maria Kelly, who lives at Cloney, Co. Kildare, attained the age of 70 years on the 24th February last.  I have her baptismal certificate, so that there can be no contention whatever about it. A good many years ago she inherited a small farm from a brother who, at the same time, disposed of his other effects by will.  The interest in that farm was put up for sale and realised £160.  As I am informed, most of that money was dissipated in paying legal expenses and various debts which had been contracted on the credit of this holding.  After that a man named Kelly, who was a first cousin of her's, asked her to come to live with him in order that he might afford her shelter. She did that, and Kelly died, and his widow continued to keep her on, although his widow was not any blood relation whatever to the applicant for the pension.  That continued until this lady came to the age of 70 years, and her application for a pension was sent in.  It was passed by the local committee, but it was turned down by the pension authorities.</P>
    <P>The facts that I have stated have been certified to me by the Very Rev. Canon Mackey, the Parish Priest of Athy, who was fully conversant with everything connected with the matter.  Now, sir, I put these facts before the Minister and I received in reply a letter in which he stated: &ldquo;I desire to inform you that the appeal upon the claim of Miss Kelly was on the ground of means.  The pension officer reported that Miss Kelly was maintained by Mrs. Jane Kelly, who <Col N="3049" /> holds a fully-stocked farm of 97 acres, valuation £38, rent £38 19s. 6d, and the estimated maintenance as worth in this case £49 17s. 6d. a year.  The reasonableness of the estimate was not questioned, but it was pointed out by the sub-committee that the maintenance was a purely voluntary act.  Miss Kelly however enjoyed benefits and privileges worth over £49 17s. 6d. a year, and so long as she continued to do so she is debarred from the old age pension.&rdquo; I wish the Minister could see Cloney.  I think he would be puzzled to find out what benefits and privileges a person living there could obtain worth £49 17s. 6d. a year.  He states in the letter that that farm of Mrs. Jane Kelly's is fully stocked.  I have no doubt it is fully stocked with plover and wild duck.  We had another extensive landholder there who came here last week seeking an interview with the Minister for Agriculture.  He holds 190 acres of land and only on 35 acres of which he could get a dry footing.</P>
    <P>That gentleman came to get relief from the attentions of the rate collectors. Whether he succeeded or not I do not know, but at any rate it goes to show the value of a farm valued at £38 in that district.  Apart altogether from that, whether this Mrs. Kelly had a fully-stocked farm or not, or whether she had any farm at all, I assert that that does not affect the question.  The real question is whether Miss Maria Kelly has means amounting to £39 5s. a year, and if she had not I say she is entitled to the pension.  Look at the absurdity that this would lead to.  Supposing Mrs. Jane Kelly said to her relative, her connection by affinity, that she must clear out.  Miss Maria Kelly, immediately she goes out of doors, becomes entitled to the pension.  Whether through the inclemency of the weather or through the activities of the myrmidons of the Minister for Justice, she is forced again to seek shelter, automatically she is deprived of the pension. I am sure the Dáil will agree that that is the acme of absurdity.</P>
    <P>I think there could be nothing more absurd coming even from a Government Department.  This is a new regulation imported into the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act in 1922. When the scheme for the amalgamation <Col N="3050" /> of Unions was put into operation by the late Board of Guardians of Athy, the Guardians were allowed to grant 5s. a week in addition to the pension to old people in the workhouse at the time who became entitled to the pension, and who left the institution so that they might live with their friends. The granting of that sum to these old people, in addition to the pension they received, was sanctioned by the Local Government Department, of which the Minister was not President at the time. The Minister for Finance, in speaking on the Old Age Pensions Bill, stated that it was never contemplated that the pension should be looked upon as the sole means of support of the recipients. According to the ruling of the present Minister, any assistance given to an old person, even the shelter of a roof, disqualifies.  I assert that that position is quite untenable, and I hope that the Dáil will mark its disapproval of the attitude taken up by the Minister and his Department with regard to the poor old people.  Speaking as a lay man, in my opinion if that decision were tested in a court of law, it would not stand, and if the Minister is obdurate in persisting in the attitude he has taken up I hope the decision will be so tested.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak on this matter from the point of view of the treatment meted out to the people who are in receipt of the blind pension.  Since the passing of the recent Act the Minister's inspectors and his pension officers have been very busy in reviewing the cases of blind pensioners. The result has been that, in various parts of the country, people in receipt of these blind pensions now find themselves cut off.  I think everybody will agree that that is not a very desirable state of affairs.  At the moment I have in mind two cases from my own district of people whose blind pensions were cut off recently.  When the applications of these people were being considered two years ago, the pension officer decided that they were not entitled to the pension.  The local Pensions Committee, in view of the medical evidence and other information which was laid before it, decided that <Col N="3051" /> these people were entitled to the pension. The Local Government Department decided against the Pension Officer and on the side of the Pensions Committee, and allowed the pensions to these people at that time.  The Department now comes along two years afterwards, and takes the pension away.  I think it will be agreed that that is not a very desirable thing to do.</P>
      <P>I suggest it is not a very nice thing for a Government to come along and take away the pension from these poor blind people.  They had been in receipt of this 10s. a week for the last two years, and, so to speak, had resigned themselves to their fate.  They were beyond doing any work in consequence of their blindness.  In that connection I would like to know what is the degree of blindness that is necessary in order that the applicant may be entitled to a pension. As far as I can learn, there seems to be no agreed standard of blindness to guide local pensions committees in dealing with these cases.  I am of opinion that if a doctor sends a certificate, either to the pension officer or to the local pensions committee, that a person is not able to follow his or her usual occupation in consequence of defective vision, then that ought to be sufficient in itself to secure a pension for that person.  I would like the Minister to say what standard of blindness is required for a person to get the blind pension.  If any standard has been arrived at, I think his Department ought to acquaint local pensions committees of it.  I can quite understand the Minister tightening up his regulations so far as new applicants for pensions are concerned.  There may have been abuses in the past, but it will be admitted, I think, that the number of pensions granted to blind persons constitute a very small percentage indeed under the general pension scheme. I think that the Minister ought to see that the pensions are left with the comparatively small number of blind persons who have been lucky enough to secure them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say a word with regard to the arguments used just now by Deputy Conlan in dealing with the particular case which he brought forward <Col N="3052" /> and with the arguments which members of the Farmers' Party put forward on various occasions during the passage of the recent Old Age Pensions Bill through this House.  I have a distinct recollection that Deputies on these benches received very little support or assistance from the Deputies sitting with Deputy Conlan when that Bill was going through.  I have a distinct recollection that on the Second Reading of that Bill two members of the Farmers' Party voted for it with the Government, while the remainder abstained from voting.  If Deputies on the Farmers' benches had paid as much attention to that Bill then as Deputy Conlan is doing now, it would have had a much stormier passage through the Dáil than it had, and perhaps the Minister would have found himself compelled by the pressure brought to bear on him by two responsible parties in the Dáil to reconsider his position with regard to many of its most important details, and he would have been obliged to take action that would have been of advantage to the old age pensioners in the country generally.</P>

      <P>In listening to Deputy Conlan's speech, I could not help regretting that he did not decide to take part in the play instead of reciting the epilogue.  If he had given us more information when the recent Old Age Pensions Bill was going through than he has given us now, perhaps we would be better able to deal with the situation.  We got a circular quite recently from the Minister, in which he told us of some of the conditions by which those who could not procure certificates of age would be able to have their claims passed.  He referred to the preparation and production of affidavits.  For my part, I know of many cases in which affidavits have been submitted, and submitted by responsible people&mdash;responsible people in my opinion, but, of course, I do not know who are responsible people in the Minister's opinion&mdash;and yet these claims have been turned down.  To my mind, the only person who is capable of making an affidavit as to the age of anyone is somebody who is old enough to make that affidavit.  Otherwise the affidavit would be useless.  We are told <Col N="3053" /> that you must connect your statement with some event in the past life of the applicant so as to prove that.  I would ask the Minister what event in the first 20 years of his life he could connect 50 years afterwards to prove that he was 70 years then?  Will he give us one event in the first 20 years of his life that he could connect with an event 50 years afterwards?  Would he point to one event as the last election? Then let us take a hypothetical case, the case of a farmer, a father or a mother, who have reached 70 years of age and who are cut out on the question of means.  Four or five years ago those people came to an agreement.  The father and the mother and the young people&mdash;boy or girl who had married&mdash; entered into an agreement that a certain amount is to be paid to the old people.  The Minister comes along now, irrespective of that agreement, and says no matter what agreement you make, your support has the first claim upon the farm, and irrespective of any agreement you must suffer the penalty, because we in this new Act have altered the basis of calculation and you must suffer accordingly.  Unless those people hand over their farms to their sons and daughters, these farms would cease to be productive quantities in the State.  There is only one thing to do; either to make the farms over to their children and make the agreements, or to work them in their old age and lose their productivity to the nation.  I hold with Deputy Conlan that the interpretation of all these clauses, sections, regulations and all the red-tapeism which binds up the consideration of the old age pensions claims is something that should go, and the sooner we have some definite statement regarding both the proof of old age and the basis of calculation for property the better for everybody concerned.</P>

      <P>The forces of labour and agriculture have combined very successfully in closing me out in answering their arguments.  I may state first of all for the benefit of Deputies that those cases only come before me on appeal, and it is only on appeal that I have any function in regard to them at all.  The onus of proof is on the applicant in all those <Col N="3054" /> cases, and I have to treat evidence, in the same way as it is treated in an ordinary court of law.  Certain cases of hardship of that kind have been placed before me.  I cannot go into those cases in detail.  I have no facts before me. Now, it is necessary for us to take every precaution to see that applicants do not evade the Act by making property over on various relations on the understanding that they get relief, and that the State will come to their assistance. We cannot afford to distribute charity on that extremely liberal scale. Hundreds of cases raised by Deputies and others in regard to hardships in relation to old age pensions have come before me, and in not one single case have I seen them prove any instance where our officials in the matter did not accord due importance to the evidence in favour of the applicant.  Cases are often cited to me where the old age pensioner says he is a certain age, and that everyone knows that he is of that certain age; but appearance is a very unreliable criterion in matters of this kind.  One person may look older at 50 than another at 80, and in that way people on the spot are the very worst judges of a person's age.  I think Deputy Hogan understands sufficiently clearly what is necessary in an affidavit. There is no good in making an affidavit merely to the effect that one party believes that another party is a certain age.  They must give something to go on.  The person who makes the affidavit must link up some event in his life with the life of the person in favour of whom he makes the affidavit, otherwise there is no real proof in the case at all.  In some cases the affidavit is made by persons so mentally infirm that it is of no real value, and then these affidavits are often contradicted by marriage records and records of a similar kind.  It is a cheap way of earning popularity to pose as a defender of the aged and infirm.  I have too keen a sense of my responsibilities to compete with Deputy Conlan for popularity in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position I hold is not a position where one seeks popularity.  It is a position where one has to take his reponsibilities very seriously.  At the same time I may say that one of the most serious defects of the Irish character <Col N="3055" /> is this tendency to dependence of one kind or another, and it is a very serious thing in the State at the present time.  The number of people who lead a parasitic existence, more or less, is increasing in proportion to the number of people who are striving to make an honest living, and it is, therefore, not an easy thing to encourage thrift and providence.  This country was brought to the verge of disaster by the famine in the 'forties of the last century, and it was mainly as a result of charity continually distributed at the expense of the provident and thrifty, who continually decreased in proportion as the destitute and the dependent increased, and owing to the system of charity and poorhouses and various charity institutions established, and we must endeavour to avoid falling into a similar danger.  I do not know if Deputies are aware of the very high cost of the administration of the old age pensions at the present time.  They amount to three million pounds; that is a very considerable revenue, and it is a revenue that some people consider ought to be sufficient to run the whole government of this country.  It amounts to 50 per cent. more than the whole charge of running all the other services of my Department.  That is a matter to be pondered over.  I am not in a position at the moment to compare the figures&mdash;that is the amount expended&mdash;on old age pensions in Ireland with that of England, Scotland and Wales.</P>

      <P>With regard to the blind pensions, I am in a position to compare the amount of money expended in Ireland with that expended in England and Scotland.  In Ireland the number of blind pensions payable on the 30th June, 1922, was 3,283; in Scotland, 1,436; in England and Wales, 9,333.  In Ireland it amounted to one out of every 956 of the population, in Scotland it amounted to one in every <Col N="3056" /> 3,315 of the population, and in England and Wales it amounted to one in every 3,864 of the population.  The approximate cost per year amounted in Ireland to £82,050, in Scotland to £35,900, and in England and Wales to £233,325.  That would give some idea of how those services are administered in Ireland.  Yet, I am still being condemned for being heartless and uncharitable in this matter.  I am prepared to put up with that charge as long as the proportion of these figures remain as they are.</P>
